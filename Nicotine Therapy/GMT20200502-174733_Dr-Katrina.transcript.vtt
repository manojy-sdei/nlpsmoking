00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.120
Dr Katrina Groves: You're trying to get

57
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Down a little bit huh

58
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.670
Tracey Brown: Yeah, I did. Yeah.

59
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so how do you feel how are the cravings.

60
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.880
Tracey Brown: Oh,

61
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:45.960
Tracey Brown: No cravings in little stressed out with all this stuff, you know, I got a job and then got fired from my job and that affected me a little bit. Um, well.

62
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:59.250
Tracey Brown: I was hired on by a med tech that wasn't really doing our job right. And so I was thrown in there and needed so much. I was working for a memory care center.

63
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:19.740
Tracey Brown: And they needed me so bad on the floor that they didn't give me proper time to do all my paperwork and everything was like verbally discussed, you know, but I didn't get a chance to write down a whole paragraph statement of what my charges were as far as my criminal history.

64
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.510
Tracey Brown: And they fired me for it was their best worker. I mean, I was just loving my job to work in with them.

65
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.110
Tracey Brown: You know and and yeah and so I got fired. The company was like

66
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:48.960
Tracey Brown: Worried about their reputation and and they just didn't trust it. They didn't trust me after I didn't write it down and it really kind of affected me because I love my job. I was excited about it. So,

67
00:05:49.440 --> 00:06:03.750
Tracey Brown: I'm getting over it. I it was a little educational, you know, always have your own back always do your paperwork. I thought I was doing good, by doing the physical work. It was demanding, you know, and I was trying to get used to working

68
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.830
Tracey Brown: You know up at three o'clock in the morning, starting at six.

69
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.720
Tracey Brown: Wow. So yeah, little mistake I learned from it.

70
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.630
Dr Katrina Groves: That's really positive. Good for you.

71
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. So what are your thoughts about a future job.

72
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.740
Tracey Brown: Well, that was over in Oregon.

73
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.000
Tracey Brown: And like Kelly was like, come back to us. We would never do that to you and

74
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.160
Tracey Brown: You know, they know me a little bit better. Over here, they just didn't know me in Oregon and

75
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:43.050
Tracey Brown: Right, I almost let it affect me. It hurt my feelings and I was like, no, I can't. I can't let it affect me like that.

76
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.460
Tracey Brown: A little more air.

77
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.280
Dr Katrina Groves: And you know what, yeah. It wasn't personal. It was all about what was written and not and so

78
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.590
Dr Katrina Groves: True, they probably hated to let go of you, they probably would love to have you come back.

79
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.490
Tracey Brown: If they can't my coworkers definitely did it was it was the owners and up above them. So, yeah.

80
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.330
Tracey Brown: I'll try to get back in there. I'll do what I gotta do.

81
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:21.000
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'm going to take you in the past. Now, which is stuff you probably don't want to remember. But, how old were you when you first started using substances like take me through that were, you were you five years old, melting pot or were you 10 years old.

85
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:59.910
Tracey Brown: My mom smoked with me. You know, I grew up in a smoke filled house we stayed low to the floor late on the carpet watch TV out of the fog bank.

86
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.020
But

87
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:15.240
Tracey Brown: Yeah, ended up picking them up, but it's my goal to quit smoking, I'm in fact like any day now. I've been setting up for it and mentally gearing up for it. So I'm going to quit that

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.980
Oh,

104
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.740
Dr Katrina Groves: And what have you. I just go for

105
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:18.240
Tracey Brown: I'm actually I I was made to quit when I did 30 days in jail over DMV ticket.

106
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.860
Tracey Brown: Mm hmm. Um,

107
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:35.790
Tracey Brown: And when I was in jail, I realized that without any normal stresses or any responsibilities. I had three hots and a cot and I just slept for two weeks and slept through the

108
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:48.600
Tracey Brown: Withdrawals box of it. And when you know when I got caught up on the sleep situation like I remember breaking a sweat and waking up feeling like I was reborn again.

109
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:59.340
Tracey Brown: And I got back on the streets stressed out it myself a reason few days later and picked him back up again and

110
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:16.680
Tracey Brown: You know, that's all it took was just given myself an excuse and going from there and then realizing how powerful they are and how we can be you know I'm

111
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.870
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm I just get my myself.

112
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.100
Tracey Brown: Haha

113
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.600
Dr Katrina Groves: How much do you smoke now.

114
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.800
Tracey Brown: I smoke. I'm definitely half a pack a day.

115
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And have you tried patches or GM or Chantix or Wellbutrin

116
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.830
Tracey Brown: Um, I have tried the patches before in the past, which

117
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:47.400
Tracey Brown: I think I would go cold turkey. I don't think I need an aid. I just need to tell myself. That's it.

118
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.840
Tracey Brown: And that's I'm getting closer and closer, I just, I feel it.

119
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.710
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't even think of

120
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.340
Dr Katrina Groves: What do you think you're on a scale of zero to 10 How ready are you 10 being like, I'm ready.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.870
Dr Katrina Groves: Totally and zero is like, I'm not ready at all. I'll never quit. Where are you at

122
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.690

123
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:12.330
Tracey Brown: I'm at a nine, it's, it's something I definitely don't want to die doing

124
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.810
Tracey Brown: Yeah, I want to be able to say she's

125
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.990
Tracey Brown: completely sober when I cross over.

126
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:27.000
Dr Katrina Groves: That's awesome. So when did you start using the other drugs narcotics math and whatever else you got into

127
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:34.050
Tracey Brown: I'm the methamphetamines came in, probably around I ran away from home at

128
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.430
Tracey Brown: I was introduced to the math about 16

129
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.500
Tracey Brown: I'm

130
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:53.700
Tracey Brown: Ran real hard with that very addicted to that for years and years while I was addicted. Is that though I was definitely dealing with

131
00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:02.850
Tracey Brown: My upbringing, you know, things that happened as a kid and everything. So the whole time.

132
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:14.160
Tracey Brown: During my adolescence. I remember trying to fix myself I was always trying to climb out of the hole trying, you know, so

133
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:28.320
Tracey Brown: I think I got addicted to the meth, because I was constantly trying to fix myself and I did, I did all kinds of journaling and and

134
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.420
Dr Katrina Groves: As you had issues with rape and incest and things like that. Right.

135
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.220
Dr Katrina Groves: molestation and

136
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.820
Tracey Brown: Three.

137
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.350
Tracey Brown: Is what really triggered me

138
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.060
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah yeah

139
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you remember any of that. I mean, at three years old. You're not gonna remember that much.

140
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:51.870
Tracey Brown: Oh yeah, I remember being a child, my mom was such a good mom and I had such great memories that remember a lot

141
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.110
Tracey Brown: I remember too much.

142
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, exactly.

143
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.390
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.170
If your mind.

145
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.110
Tracey Brown: Definitely pass the, uh,

146
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:18.540
Tracey Brown: The feeling or need for any kind of, you know, drugs, stimulants or anything like like I feel like I have my mind and my health backing me to wear. Yeah, I'm

147
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.890
Tracey Brown: As good as I need to be can be

148
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.590
Dr Katrina Groves: So when did you start the narcotics than that. Do you ever do heroin or IV.

149
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:40.170
Tracey Brown: No, no, I was once I quit the mess. I felt like I was free from being a drug addict and, you know, not realizing I still smoke marijuana like that was a drug, in my mind, you

155
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:19.920
Tracey Brown: And I was desperate for a job and ended up working at a bar, doing a job that was against my personality like I knew I could make money. So I did what I had to do, but it affected me and I ended up drinking, which I'm not a drinker, and I got a DUI.

156
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.570
Tracey Brown: Once I got that DUI. It really affected my life and I never drink again since the

158
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.720
Dr Katrina Groves: But no, I missed when, when did you get started on the narcotics.

159
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.840
Tracey Brown: Well, when I was working in that bar I hurt my back.

160
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, okay.

161
00:14:50.940 --> 00:15:00.720
Tracey Brown: Bad back injury I tore a disc in my back. And it was so bad. Dr gropes that for three years. I remember just

162
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:18.210
Tracey Brown: You know, it was like a toothache and my back and like nobody like I couldn't get anybody to believe that it was hurting me as that, as it was, you know, considering you know some of the injuries. People can acquire but I'm

163
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:29.940
Tracey Brown: Get believed you know with my injury, being an ex drug addict was really hard for me. I didn't know how to speak the language. I still was very, you know,

164
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.880
Tracey Brown: Set back and so

165
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.850
Tracey Brown: During during this time a

166
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:51.120
Tracey Brown: P was pretty bad word, you know, six Norco sedation to cut it, but it just really didn't because there was constant pain just would not go away.

167
00:15:51.990 --> 00:16:03.180
Tracey Brown: And of course, in my mind, I was just being spoiled to the fact that I just could not, you know, having any pain. I had a lot to do. Still with the kids and but

168
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:04.830
Tracey Brown: So you

169
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Know off the street, then or

170
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:14.460
Tracey Brown: Yeah, well, the doctor said, You know, you're addicted, you know and and your pill seeking, even though I was still in pain.

171
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:24.780
Tracey Brown: I wanted to kind of be like, no, you know, and then I just realized yeah substances can be very addictive. Just like the cigarettes. So

172
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:32.220
Tracey Brown: Regardless of whether I was seeking them out in my mind, or if it was the pain.

173
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.100
Tracey Brown: I knew that I had to

174
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.650
Tracey Brown: Challenge it and

175
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.990
Tracey Brown: I'm still, you know, my goal is to still be completely sober. But I will say um

176
00:16:47.460 --> 00:17:00.210
Tracey Brown: I don't think I would have the quality of life. If I was still feeling that pain and I still feel that underneath the sandbox and that I still have the pain, like, you know, I can still feel it. My back's vulnerable.

177
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.350

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:12.180
Tracey Brown: It's in a spot in the sway of my back to where I don't think it'll ever heal is a chair, you know, and it's just something that will never really want to completely Hill, maybe

179
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.310
Dr Katrina Groves: At this point go. How old were you when it started that when you have the back pain.

180

Dr Katrina Groves: So you had never taken any narcotics before 37

183
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:30.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Nope. Amazing. And so the doctors really are the ones that kind of got you started on the pain pills.

297
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.330
Tracey Brown: Learning from every everything I can.

298
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:38.610
Dr Katrina Groves: I know you're still doing good to fix yourself. I hear you. So part of the thing with bright heart to is is not only do we do the Suboxone groups, but there's counseling.

299
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:53.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Traumatic people that have had traumas, you can have your own counsel or if you want one. You know, you don't have to. You can continue with Tony or I don't know if you were on telemedicine or with any for a while. I don't remember how that turned out.

300
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.870
Tracey Brown: Yeah, no didn't get that started okay

301
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.020
Tracey Brown: But I appreciate that. I'll keep that in mind.

302
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:08.070
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, so how many kids do you have right now. I know you have your one son lives with you and he's held

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:30.780
Tracey Brown: He's actually still in the same state. But doing way better since I've gotten them off of all psych meds. He's only taken gabapentin to sleep at night.

308
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.410
Wow.

309
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.730
Tracey Brown: And he's doing much better without the meds.

310
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:42.930
Tracey Brown: Good cuz they didn't. They didn't change his situation whatsoever just physically. It did, but

311
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.220
Tracey Brown: Right, mentally, he's his to his

312
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:47.910
Dr Katrina Groves: And I just didn't

313
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.790
Tracey Brown: Want to use any medications if not enough.

314
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.860
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah and now you've had any other children or miscarriages abortions.

315
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:03.870
Tracey Brown: Um, I got a younger son, Zach, he's doing good. And my daughter Christina with the three grand babies.

321
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.790
Tracey Brown: My know my mom's deathly allergic to penicillin. I can take it. But I mean, I've

322
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:37.530
Tracey Brown: Never really taken that much antibiotics. Anyway, I remember taking a little bit of penicillin. When I was a kid, but

323
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:46.620
Tracey Brown: It's very strong to me and and I I reacted very weird to penicillin. Like I feel like my soul's getting a float away.

324
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.640
Dr Katrina Groves: So you try to avoid that. But you don't get hives or anything. No.

325
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.460
Tracey Brown: No, I'm really tough skin.

326
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:54.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

327
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.240
Tracey Brown: Not much bothered bothers me at all. No.

328
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:05.430
Dr Katrina Groves: And I don't hear any suicide risk at all for you. I don't hear like you're trying to off yourself. You've got too much to live for. Right.

329
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

330
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.400
Tracey Brown: No worries here.

331
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.400
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. And so when are you going to need your next prescription for the Suboxone. Did you just

332
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, you need it now.

333
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.250
Which we like.

334
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.390
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright so what pharmacy. Do you go to

335
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.980
Tracey Brown: I'm still at Walmart.

336
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:32.520
Dr Katrina Groves: Walmart. Yeah. Mike is a good guy. He cares about people. He can kind of get in space, but I really liked him.

337
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.630
Tracey Brown: I do too. Yeah, and you know, and

338
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:46.470
Dr Katrina Groves: So do you want just like 75 for the month since you're trying to taper. That would be one and a half, two and a half a day or or what do you want to do.

339
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.950
Tracey Brown: However you want to, like, you know,

340
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Every day.

341
00:29:52.500 --> 00:30:04.800
Tracey Brown: I do take extra sometimes I do. I'm always lagging throughout the month, all the way through my menstrual cycle is really, when I feel my stomach issues because I get all swollen.

342
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.590
Tracey Brown: Right. These are like way worse.

343
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:14.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Let's, let's stick with them. Sorry. Let's stick with three a day them and 90 and then you

344
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:23.370
Dr Katrina Groves: Don't have to use that many if you don't want, I just remember at one point you were trying to taper down but maybe right now is not a good idea because I'd rather you get off the cigarettes.

345
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:29.040
Dr Katrina Groves: And you shouldn't try to taper Suboxone and try and get up cigarettes. At the same time, because it won't work.

346
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.140
Tracey Brown: Yeah.

347
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.570
Tracey Brown: Sounds about right. Um,

348
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:40.290
Tracey Brown: Yeah, I feel more empowered, like with the other medicine backing me because

349
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.110
Tracey Brown: Lately without it you can feel your depression more you're more apt to slip into it.

350
00:30:46.320 --> 00:31:02.520
Tracey Brown: Right you know that tiredness feeling that we've done to our own bodies by abusing it so many times that if you don't have that little some something in there, the tiredness of the body is what really can get someone to slip into to depression into that, you know,

351
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, yeah.

352
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.040

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:54.330
iPhone: I wanted to go refill. One of my prescriptions and happens to be the one that makes me really panicky. If I don't have. It's just the government and just because I have seizures when I don't have it.

493
00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:01.890
iPhone: And all of a sudden you know because years ago amber had written on their much last 30 days, which was fine.

494
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:08.550
iPhone: But she didn't fill it as a 30 day mark, even though I told her my mom took her and asked how I knew I have seizures when I go off it.

495
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:21.540
iPhone: Because I take it, but it doesn't look good. And as long as I don't have issues like that. I don't have a problem. Well, all of a sudden I want to affiliate and it's got must last 30 days on it again.

496
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:39.420
iPhone: And person. They said, This is what happened. This is why you know I get really panicky and crazy and anxious. And he said, No problem. I'll take it off. So I went I thought I told Mike the pharmacist. You know what he told me he fix it. You send them in a thing. Right. Same day I saw him well.

497
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:53.310
iPhone: Mike sent it in. It got sent back with not going to change stuff written. And I said, That's weird. She told me send it back into them and it came back. So I got a hold of the

498
00:42:54.390 --> 00:43:10.860
iPhone: Nurse. And I said, You know, I talked to him and he said he take care of this because of what happened prior there was, you know, I took a lot of other medications, he you know he can put must last 30 days on, you know, but this one just happens to make me freak out.

499
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.410
iPhone: And I wouldn't wish on that day, he tells me he knows remember telling you that

500
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:17.190
And

501
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.850
iPhone: Then, because I'm an addict, apparently.

502
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.130
iPhone: I'm not trustworthy.

503
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:29.910
Dr Katrina Groves: I think it's more like he's forgetful, you know, Dr. Pearson has got his own medical issues. So maybe you can fool.

504
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:37.500
iPhone: I know and that's the thing that's probably what it was is key. She's a lot of people you guys forget just from the sheer volume.

505
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:53.520
iPhone: I know that, but I think Dr. Pearson feels that he has to be held to a higher standard because of his problems, he has. And if they think that he's forgetting that we make them working and it has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the fact that she's a lot of people

506
00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:02.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Right, so one can do for you, you probably figured this out. But if you how many what what those do you take right now of the gap of Henson, I take

507
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:07.320
iPhone: Two, six milligrams, two, three times a day. I've been on it for

508
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.730
Dr Katrina Groves: 100 milligrams

509
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.530
iPhone: Yeah, so I take two of the

510
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.060
Dr Katrina Groves: Person today.

511
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:12.540
Yeah.

512
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:20.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so what you want to try and do is take on one day if you can take a half less

513
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:28.620
Dr Katrina Groves: For a couple days and then that way. You've got an extra in case you need it. And, you know, so you can make yourself another day by doing that.

514
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:38.100
iPhone: Well, what I'm doing is I'm I went over to mental health because when I had went to go talk to them like patriots about it because it worries me and

515
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:46.710
iPhone: He also took me off my five out of man telling me I'm an addict. I shouldn't have stuff like that. Bottom line, he said, because I'm an addict.

516
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:55.440
iPhone: He doesn't prescribe stuff like that to add it to even though I had been had it for a year that you've been prescribing it never asked for it to be increased never had an issue with it.

517
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:06.660
iPhone: But he took it. So I told him, I said, by you taking this you're taking ideas on a month for like on a crawler my skin. I said, even though it's only five I got a win for me.

518
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.350
Right.

519
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:15.000
iPhone: And then he did this and then it's not just, it's one of his nurses

520
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:24.990
iPhone: I had to referrals going on for carpal tunnel studying for sleep study now it's her job to do those to the nurses to call

521
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:40.440

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.650
iPhone: Doesn't have the power to do that. But she does, she has is in

524
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:55.950

525
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:05.010
iPhone: He said, Well, I must have just forgot to put it on there. I said, No, I was there, as you know, Vinnie you start winning had to send him an email stating

526
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:19.410
iPhone: It was there, she's not lying to you and you know you're driving her crazy with this gala patenting because you're freaking her out. And if you want to get a buzz off medications. She's got way better ones in that one.

527
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:44.580
iPhone: Yeah, but that doesn't matter. I'm an addict. So Dr. Pearson is a great doctor if you are not an addict. In fact, I would kill to get into him and I tried so hard before I got clean because he kind of supplies happened down our county pills any person. I went to here, who was local he was

528
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:54.240
