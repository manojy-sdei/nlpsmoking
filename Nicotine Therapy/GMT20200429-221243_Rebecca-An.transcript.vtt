25
00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:08.310

28
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we've got we've got to attack the thoughts to begin with.

29
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To get you away from the cravings and

30
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Patricia. You have to remember that a craving it a thought about it in a craving has a beginning and a middle and an end.

31
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you allow it to end.

35
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.840
Galaxy A10e: And I just heard of like you're busy doing something I know sometimes I'll go for a walk, just

36
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.710
Galaxy A10e: START A PROJECT at home, sitting on something, something like that. I don't know what else to do.

37
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it helping

38
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.150
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, it helps them. But that's why I was also taking more of my medication and I was

39
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.370
Galaxy A10e: Supposed to be taking is it does, it does help when I did more

40
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A de I'm sure that it does. And that's something that you'll work with with Dr. Candle. But in the meantime, what you and I are going to need to work on together is managing you know those thoughts.
