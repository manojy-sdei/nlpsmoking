00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta flip that phone on its other side one side probably goes to work and and the other one probably know

2
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.750
Lauren Anderson: It's funny, depending on the day a different

3
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Song right

4
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so funny.

5
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It is about moods. Who knew

6
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to open up a note here um how see is it snowy out there. What's like over there.

7
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.610
Lauren Anderson: No, I mean we just thought the weather. Cool pretty quickly over the weekend and then Monday we did get snow didn't really fit much in Albuquerque.

8
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.970
Lauren Anderson: But the mountains were covered the next day.

9
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.520
Lauren Anderson: It's we still have a real cool breeze, but otherwise it's pretty warm out now again.

10
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I want to ask you something. You remember the end of our session last time we met. Do you remember kind of the content a little bit

11
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.980
Um,

12
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.640
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, little we're talking

13
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.380
Lauren Anderson: About

14
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.940
Lauren Anderson: A fixed fixed mindset versus fluent mine says that right

15
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

16
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're thinking of

17
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.750
Lauren Anderson: Nervousness that what you mean. Um,

18
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm hearing you say is you remembering pieces of a group topic. Yes.

19
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you mean, last time we met.

20
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am.

21
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
Lauren Anderson: Alone. I'm right. We were gonna do that experiment with talking

22
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.550
Lauren Anderson: I failed miserably I failed to even remember to do it when I'm around people. It's just, and I couldn't. I knew I was

23
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:12.300
Lauren Anderson: And I couldn't even stop myself and it's, it is nervous, where I can't even breathe. I'm talking for so long, so fast, like on a walk. If I invite my friend Tim

24
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.510
Lauren Anderson: I'm talking the whole time going up a steep hill and Denali likes to go fast. She pulled me up that you'll know like

25
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:30.720
Lauren Anderson: And it's like calisthenics, I guess, or like cross training, you know, or something. I look like as if I were doing this, while running, you know, kind of thing. The talking because I'm so much harder to breeze.

26
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:41.730
Lauren Anderson: So it's, it's ridiculous. But no, I just didn't even think of it. I mean, until later, you know, after the fact, I failed miserably.

27
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't. Here's the thing. We can't fail at something that we didn't remember. So let me check in on that just a little bit more

28
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember in group.

29
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It was your turn, and it was around growth mindset versus fixed mindset and you shared

30
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um,

31
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.450
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

32
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.300
Lauren Anderson: You remember the questions we wrote down right

33
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am. Yes. Yes. Do you remember

34
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling cut off by me. Do you remember feeling cut off.

35
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No, really.

36
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Um, I did. I cut you off. I did it. And I wondered, because I knew what what what a kind of this goal was, and I didn't know if you wanted me

37
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: To help shorten because remember your you wanted five words. And I was like, I don't know how you're going to do that.

38
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's words.

39
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Like 10. I'm like, let's do 10 and you're like, No, I want five and it was like Okay, so here's, here's what the note from growth looks like.

40
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, we're talking about gabapentin sir cool to 75 million rounds know rumination. I just wake up and can I bet you were talking to the doc before I got there. Oh.

41
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.120
Lauren Anderson: You know 75 milligrams. I have not taken that before I noted that I needed to go to pick up

42
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

43
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.240
Lauren Anderson: Sorry.

44
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on just a second. We're talking about talking not about milligrams, just two seconds. Hold on, two seconds.

45
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.470
Okay.

46
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to read this. So group modality goal with up, up, up, up, up. And then we got on client hearing feedback from other ah ok I am neutral.

47
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think I asked.

48
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What could I have done differently. So I asked those questions right I say on, what could you

49
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you perceive a sense of failure using that word failure quite deliberately because it's not a word that I think is a healthy one so much but I'm using it because that's how a lot of people think

50
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Once I wanted to see how that might land on a piece of paper and you said visiting Dr.

51
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Discussion a client looking into getting advice from our support one client hearing here I am neutral. Okay, so I checked in with you and you were like, well, I feel neutral about whatever was being talked about in group.

52
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And states one action could have been too. Oh, and you were offering a suggestion for someone, which is to map out everything that needed to be done.

53
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to have attainable goals you kind of like something sounds like somebody was saying about maybe mapping it out.

54
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.040
Lauren Anderson: Um, I, I did comment at the end that I really liked. I think his name's Ray.

55
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.030
Lauren Anderson: I'm

56
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.130
Lauren Anderson: The guy figure fellow with glasses.

57
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.060
Lauren Anderson: You had said.

58
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.230
Lauren Anderson: Something to the effect of, pick one thing and follow it through.

59
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.100
Yes.

60
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:58.800
Lauren Anderson: And it could it could apply it, you know, to maybe it's more than just one, but, you know, specific things that you really want to, but I like that idea.

61
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:08.760
Lauren Anderson: Those questions yes failed versus done differently. I had responded positively in the first one, under what do you think you failed out. That's why it was kind of

62
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:19.890
Lauren Anderson: So then it said, I answered. The second one that was kind of more of a positive thinking when I responded to the first question after I realized that responded to that one in a positive mindset.

63
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.610
Lauren Anderson: Right.

64
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. Um, and yet the the activity was intentional on my part. It was to access that negative self talk. It was to get into it.

65
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To get above any kind of whether it's the right thing to say in a therapeutic environment was to go right into how our negative self talk how it sounds in there. So can we still visit it and see what comes up, if we really try

66
00:08:51.600 --> 00:09:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can use the word fail, not because it's a word you would use, but because it might give us some insight into some negative self talk just as a point of exploration

67
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to do that assignment like right now looking at it now. I believe I have failed that and see if you can finish that sentence. Maybe write it down and see what you could write what would you right now.

68
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.790
Lauren Anderson: Big one

69
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.340
Lauren Anderson: Is

70
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.580
Lauren Anderson: How

71
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:39.540
Lauren Anderson: Dramatically heavily my personal life, my romantic life was affecting my every day. I'm

72
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.270
Lauren Anderson: goals and ambitions.

73
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.550
Lauren Anderson: Really duties.

74
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me hear that one complete. Can I, and I know it's a lot to ask, but this way I can hear how the causality lands in your mind. Can you say a full sentence.

75
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this caused this even though it's artificial just want to hear. Can you say one more time.

76
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.620
Lauren Anderson: More, more concisely.

77
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.760
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.310
Lauren Anderson: My romantic life.

79
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:33.600
Lauren Anderson: affected me so dramatically, emotionally, psychologically about

80
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.340
Lauren Anderson: It.

81
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.890
Lauren Anderson: And of course its cycle.

82
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait.

83
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.410
Lauren Anderson: Yes, the beginning my sentence. Again, I don't want to go so

84
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, my romantic life affected me dramatically, emotionally, psychologically, that it

85
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

86
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Beautiful. Beautiful.

87
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there, you've got this

88
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.360
Lauren Anderson: Can you read it again, please.

89
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am. My romantic life affected me so dramatically emotionally and psychologically that it

90
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:26.820
Lauren Anderson: Eventually completely overpowered superseded anything else that was going on in my daily life.

91
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on in your daily life.

92
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:37.170
Lauren Anderson: Dominated and then a envelop like consumed.

93
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the daily life. I know just what was it like

94
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.960
Lauren Anderson: Going into class school. There we go. Yes.

95
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Education overpowered.

96
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: My

97
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.940
Lauren Anderson: An occupational because I was teaching piano as well and tutoring.

98
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.360
Lauren Anderson: Math.

99
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.270
Lauren Anderson: Reading math for math classes, stuff like that.

100
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice what's missing from the sentence. You're going to hear it. Now my romantic life and is it romantic or is there some. How do we say, what is that an ad objective.

101
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:29.250
Lauren Anderson: Overall, I would call it hope hopelessly hopeful romantic is what I was some so many times. I was so optimistic and sure of it. Most of the times, a man didn't even know existed my views like

102
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.810
Lauren Anderson: My whole life.

103
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I optimistic romantic

104
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Life. My optimistic.

105
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.560
Lauren Anderson: So hopelessly hopeful romantic

106
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.660
Lauren Anderson: Is what I called it

107
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: About we call hopelessly hope. Oh.

108
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

109
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So listen closely.

110
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.050
Lauren Anderson: Didn't really define what was going on.

111
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hold on a sec.

112
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, listen, there's still something missing. You're going to hear it, but you're going to have to hear it in order to pick up what's missing. You ready, here comes

113
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: My hopelessly hopeful romantic life affected me dramatically, emotionally, psychologically that eventually it completely overpowered my education and occupational

114
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.950
Lauren Anderson: Crime, I would take consumed it completely consumed my educational and occupational goals.

115
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.530
Lauren Anderson: And duties or obligations goals and obligations.

116
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, we knew there was something missing. And I kind of turned my voice up a little bit and you caught it nicely done. And I did. I took out L overpowered and I'm putting in, I

117
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.680
Lauren Anderson: Really consumed.

118
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.750
Lauren Anderson: In the end,

119
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:50.220
Lauren Anderson: And it's cyclic, you know, of course, look, because it wasn't the same object from most young age to now, you know, of course.

120
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.360
Lauren Anderson: Said cyclic

121
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.830
Lauren Anderson: But that was always the eventual effect.

122
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.840
Lauren Anderson: Really interfering just just destructive.

123
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:07.530
Lauren Anderson: The big yeah distraction, you know, a big very big distraction.

124
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:09.660
Lauren Anderson: But

125
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I hopelessly hopeful romantic life affected me

126
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:19.110
Lauren Anderson: I wouldn't say my hopeless romantic life my mindset or

127
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.520
Lauren Anderson: My eaten see

128
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.380
Lauren Anderson: Well, emotionally

129
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.850
Lauren Anderson: Came from a young age.

130
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but I don't know what to replace. Here we go. You want me to take out my or leave my

131
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:37.320
Lauren Anderson: Life life. I don't think is my hopelessly helpful romantic not life either mindset.

132
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:48.330
Lauren Anderson: Or emotional self but just the way I am. Does that make sense. It's not my life. So it's not the my actual

133
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationship with these people.

134
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.130
Lauren Anderson: Or something. It's more of a internal obsession thing.

135
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.360
Okay, here we go.

136
00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I changed it. We're going to hear it again. See if you like it, see if this really lands. True. And we get to refine it and refine it again and refine it again until it matches spot on with your truth. Okay.

137
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. Listen closely my hopelessly hopeful romantic mindset affected me dramatically, emotionally, psychologically that eventually completely consumed my education and occupational goals and obligations.

138
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.270
Lauren Anderson: Hmm.

139
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.620
Lauren Anderson: Yeah. Yeah. And I think at the end my life, not just my goals and obligations just

140
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.160
Lauren Anderson: I eat my life right

141
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.310
Lauren Anderson: That's a little more complicated than just my goals and, you know,

142
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: tune in. I'm going to say it again. Okay.

143
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your truth. Let's see if it lands. True.

144
00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: My hopelessly hopeful romantic mindset affected me dramatically, emotionally, psychologically, eventually it completely consumed my educational occupational goals obligations and my life.

145
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

146
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so now when we step back from that amazing statement.

147
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you make of your mindset.

148
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your opinion of your mindset.

149
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:38.550
Lauren Anderson: I'm comfortable with it. It's mine. I like myself. I love myself, you know, but I

150
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.430
Lauren Anderson: The years with my step mom.

151
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:52.830
Lauren Anderson: Because it's such a time, I mean they got married into my sixth grade year, and she really completely changed the one at from so cool and loving the nice to

152
00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:07.140
Lauren Anderson: Daily abusive. And so that was kind of it, compounded on my natural self but so my natural style. Something I comfortable with and I love and I learned very early age accepted.

153
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.170
Lauren Anderson: But

154
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.850
Lauren Anderson: Well,

155
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:20.340
Lauren Anderson: With a side story with that, but I don't like you're off track. But so my my step mom, I think.

156
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:42.390
Lauren Anderson: It kind of changed the direction that that was taking a that I think set me up for much more tragic circumstances because I was pretty much looking back dating guys that were the psychological profile and abuse style was like her to a tee. Yeah, so

157
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.270
Lauren Anderson: That with my mindset, it, it was just one tragic thing after another.

158
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am. Yes, I know.

159
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.490
Lauren Anderson: The heart breaks, you know,

160
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.860
Lauren Anderson: I didn't see it. Then, of course,

161
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.540
Lauren Anderson: But

162
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's tune in here. I want you to look at me and I know you don't know me and I haven't earned your trust yet. I'm going to work on that. But do you recognize even a glimmer of things that look like step mom did you catch something I want to know about it. If you did.

163
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.980
Lauren Anderson: Not consciously not

164
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: On okay if it comes up. I want to know. You can take that chance and find out how I do you can test me can say, oof, that little thing you do with your hair or the way your eyes look just now. That's what she used to do.

165
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And

166
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:49.020
Lauren Anderson: I can tell you, like you love me and you care about me and everything. So it's Terrapins I can tell it's you can easily. You know, like the psychic vampire type, you can usually tell when someone's attacking you, you know,

167
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.160
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, totally. It's

168
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.730
Lauren Anderson: So yeah no I I'll let you know though.

169
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.460
Lauren Anderson: I bet my friends, but I get a good feeling from

170
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.570
Lauren Anderson: Seeing that at all. Yeah, but

171
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably it will come, but it'll come

172
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconscious, right, it'll be something like, I don't know what just happened. You may like catch it in the feeling reaction about a second later, it might be, I don't know why that I really don't want to talk to you right now. You might say to me.

173
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I might rewind it and say okay okay hold on to that don't run away. Stay there.

174
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.430
Lauren Anderson: Down in front of you.

175
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:27.270
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I've done that in front of people like piano teachers before besides my main one shut down completely.

176
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.500
Lauren Anderson: Shut down

177
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.750
Lauren Anderson: And the only way to deal with it kind of

178
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And good to have that self preservation and so it's in preservation. It's in the service of the self. It's keeping that ego safe that sense in

179
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.540
Lauren Anderson: Romance isn't involved it

180
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:54.870
Lauren Anderson: easier for me to shut down, or at least walk away, not to subject myself to it, but I get the blinders on. When it's someone I'm in love with Twitter painted by obsessed with

181
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune in let's tune in now and check in with your body and see. I mean with you. I'm going to check in on my body. I'm going to see how I'm doing just sort of

182
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: My eyes are closed and not looking at you in fact i'm i'm looking off to the side and I'm tuning in, I'm doing a body scan on paying attention and you do the same if you can, and just

183
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tune in and see how you're doing. So, you know, the top of your head, the forehead right behind the eyes and ears even awareness into the mouth and into the throat.

184
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the shoulders, the chest.

185
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How is that breathing. Is it short and rapid just tuning in, pay attention to the muscles of the arms.

186
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention as that tracking and awareness moves down through the belly.

187
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your arms.

188
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: noticing any shifts and changes in the hands

189
00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to your seat phones, where that support that's holding you up right how it meets your sit bones ritterbusch into the legs, the knees calves.

190
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The ankles and the feet.

191
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: just tuning in

192
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To how your body is doing.

193
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it tense somewhere and relaxed in another place.

194
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it on guard. Does it need to is it proceeding threat, can it relax. Can it allow gravity to let the shoulders come down a little.

195
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to rely on that pole that pulls us all to the center of this planet.

196
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your breathing in your tummy. See how it's doing with this invitation to just turn inward.

197
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: just tuning in, aware

198
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Again and again

199
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your perception.

200
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the most important thing

201
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's valued.

202
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's critical

203
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To your survival and knowing what the next best thing to do is for you.

204
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your awareness.

205
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're ready, just kind of open your eyes. Just a little model, the way just kind of kick a peek at me and know that I'm here. There's another human over here.

206
00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not judging you. I'm only curious. I only care and want to know, because I cannot read minds and I don't know how your body's feeling

207
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious to know how you're doing when you're ready to the degree that you're ready, just that awareness that I'm here. Just open your eyes even a little bit to take in. There is another

208
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:46.440
Lauren Anderson: My body feels pretty relaxed, I noticed my hands started to feel lighter like more weightless. After I continued breathing slowly especially my my fingers started to bend a little bit, you know, fold down a little and good just got light lighter fluffy floating a little

209
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.560
Lauren Anderson: Um, I have a bruise. I dropped something heavy

210
00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:09.900
Lauren Anderson: With some corner. I can't even remember what it was. I'm probably a heavy backpack from a walk with Ali Baba, my foot. So I've got a bad night. But I'm taught. So I can feel that 13 under my shoe.

211
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:11.610
Lauren Anderson: Other than that.

212
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.510
My body.

213
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:22.260
Lauren Anderson: Is a surprisingly all everything feels pretty good. I've had a headache. The last two days. Not today, but the day before the day before that until I went to bed.

214
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.270
Lauren Anderson: An hour

215
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice foreign not notice, Lauren.

216
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The words right that you're saying. And then notice just the contrast to know words while you

217
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Were in that introspection notice there were no words out loud may have been in some inside and now there's words just just just sit with both of those existing like right up next to each other before there were none and now their words and their stories.

218
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold that for a second.

219
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can see

220
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's different about when there were no words when you weren't talking and now it's time to talk you ask the question, what's different between then and now.

221
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:25.050
Lauren Anderson: I'm sure my heart rates going up my palms get sweaty my fingers stop building light, of course, I get tension my arms and shoulders, neck,

222
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:26.340
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

223
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.640
Lauren Anderson: Feel More like I'm about to cry, and it's harder to breathe.

224
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I got an idea. What is the problem was me. What if it's because I asked a question, what if the problem was I ignited that because I imposed. How are you feeling question. What if

225
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:56.280
Lauren Anderson: Instead wasn't sure if you wanted a response or if you are wanting me to think about your question. So I guess I was unclear on that. So, but I kind of didn't want to talk, since I know that's what I'm trying to work on. But play it safe and just continue breathing.

226
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so maybe. Yeah, maybe. What I can do differently is but next time we do something like that where I invite

227
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of that meditative state or that sort of, hey, I'm going to relax my muscles. I just want to get centered. I want to feel grounded like one of those exercises.

228
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what I'll do is this. Well, you can always correct me. But instead of asking you a question of well, and how is that body feeling which may put pressure on you, um,

229
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I say nothing, and you just unfold on your own and you decide to talk or would that be more stressful.

230
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:46.800
Lauren Anderson: I kind of like the guided maybe something in the middle like I kind of like you guiding it but and all the same suggestions, but maybe I just a slower rate.

231
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.130
Lauren Anderson: Like to say the suggestion. And then we have like

232
00:26:50.340 --> 00:27:03.510
Lauren Anderson: You know, do that, breathing thing and you could start me on that. The reason one to just to remind me, and then you know and do that a few times, or maybe even just want and then your next phrase, I don't know, something like that, maybe

233
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:20.220
Lauren Anderson: Nice and then maybe have a key or like a code word to know when you're ready for me to start coming out and asked me a question actually want an answer like a peachy keen or something like that, just to know that we're time to come on meditation, talk about it.

234
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. So here's what I heard. This is so cool. Number one, I can slow my rate, I can do that. I can absolutely

235
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.360
Lauren Anderson: Suggestions yeah

236
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it. And then also, we're going to have a transition. You and I are going to agree that that Transition. Transition to then I'm going to be talking about my internal experience. It needs a transition and I wish I had. And I want to buy one thing

237
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know those things well.

238
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.930
Lauren Anderson: Like a wine glass with up

239
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something. Oh, do I have

240
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.300
Lauren Anderson: Or even a word would be all right, too.

241
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.680
Lauren Anderson: But yeah, if I get really into it. I might not hear a word as easily as a tone.

242
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to buy. I'm going to buy something and I've been meaning to it. I just got a great excuse

243
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a little miniature gongs

244
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.540
Lauren Anderson: You know what I mean.

245
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I wonder

246
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.540
Lauren Anderson: I wonder if they make a cool sound.

247
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: They put it under control.

248
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I've learned is, I'm going to have a code word or a sound and I'll keep up, keep playing with that. But for now, it might be after I kind of we brought ourselves to this guided meditation, it might be something like

249
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.810
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, sure.

250
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you. This is the difference. This is really, really key. I, I don't talk I stay shushed

251
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.210
Lauren Anderson: You after I after the

252
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: After the day the key. I notice I'm not going to start with my questions. I think that's going to be an important part

253
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.820
Lauren Anderson: Where you already know the what we're responding to. Right.

254
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to decide what you're going to share. When you're ready, no pressure you do

255
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:14.010
Lauren Anderson: Maybe that's the things when I can start to think about the words I want to use, but keep wise like I'm still meditation, but now I'm for me, my response my reflection.

256
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Reflection yes the psychological part of for me is this and I already told you, I'm quite transparent and I will always educate and narrate what's going on. And so what's happening. The reason I want to do this is because

257
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone coming at you with demands to explain yourself when you've been traumatized with that kind of inquiry or something coming at you, um,

258
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to repeat that trauma, so I don't want to be that again to you. So I'm hoping to not be that although I'm here. I was then guiding because you were able to actually

259
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You went quiet and and talk all the way through the meditation. So I saw them. Like, that's interesting. So she can

260
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Be quiet, and then as soon as I started asking a question and it was off right then it's all these thoughts. These words come in.

261
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.770
Lauren Anderson: But I'm thinking about once I open my mouth and start talking

262
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.370
Lauren Anderson: It's hard.

263
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's see. Let's see if I don't impose the pressure, the demand that you share my question, right. Let's see what happens when it's just

264
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.690
Lauren Anderson: Well, I noticed, I guess I have to reflect on kind of what just happened. Instead of the meditation.

265
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:04.560
Lauren Anderson: I noticed that once we started talking I got crouched down with my hands between my legs and I'm all sweaty now right there. And my legs and my hands.

266
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:20.730
Lauren Anderson: And I'm all I was all tensed up until you ring the bell, and then, you know, I started being quiet and just breathing the thinking. Um, but yeah, it's slowly. I must have slowly gone to that position from ending the meditation, like this.

267
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.810
Lauren Anderson: So yeah noticeably just much

268
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:34.200
Lauren Anderson: Better. I don't know that my heart rate was really going up. I think it's more when I start to talk unless someone's you know being noticeably really mean or something.

269
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.250
Lauren Anderson: Or aggressive like

270
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I if I can imagine what it is you're doing. So I don't know if you can see me in this chair.

271
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:57.000
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I don't know. I get to sit down and see. Let's see your knees like my my hands were I guess like under my neither band. I'm sitting on my piano bench. So my legs much at

272
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.980
Lauren Anderson: A 90 degree angle.

273
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You see me.

274
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.920
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, you got it back up a little bit.

275
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So, my hands are they in here. Perfect legs like this.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.450
Lauren Anderson: Your legs or your legs are not crossed

279
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.170
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

280
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.100
Lauren Anderson: flat on the ground.

281
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.060
Lauren Anderson: LIKE THIS BEFORE 90 degree angle as if you were playing piano. I'm sitting on my piano bench so

282
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I am. If I were to bring up straight down like this, or straight

283
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:41.130
Lauren Anderson: Yeah. Then you grab your, your server this direction, you grab your thighs like that right underneath.

284
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.710
Lauren Anderson: Right underneath right at the bend.

285
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.270
Lauren Anderson: Your pointer fingers.

286
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.350
Lauren Anderson: And I got my thumbs on the inner outside. Okay.

287
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's turn your attention to your hands.

288
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

289
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.730
Lauren Anderson: They're all squeezed in at the shoulders and arms and bending forward to

290
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.300
Lauren Anderson: And squeezing with your hands.

291
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.740
Lauren Anderson: On the legs. I don't know my my toes, actually.

292
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

293
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I feel like I'm bracing myself for something

294
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.360
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

295
00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel

296
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.600
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

297
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.330
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

298
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:31.020
Lauren Anderson: defense mechanism or something, I don't know. Yeah, it's a very uncomfortably socially I when I start talking

299
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:32.490
Lauren Anderson: Well,

300
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Lauren

301
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do all that I'm literally mean my body. I feel like I'm literally bracing myself for another like hit

302
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.440
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I've never been physically abused to just

303
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

304
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:51.720
What

305
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How does your body feel when you're in this position. I want to know about your body

306
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.210
Lauren Anderson: I'm opens up everything stuff look quite I'm on my toes. Now,

307
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.040
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, with my leg for flex

308
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So if, if I stay in this position, I can tell that my internal organs are protected. I feel like this is the most I can do to protect myself. And as soon as I lift my head up in my back straightens I feel like all this is exposed and I feel vulnerable. How about you.

309
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.900
Lauren Anderson: If you open it up now. Yeah.

310
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So let's go back into it looks crouched over together. Let's raise ourselves and get into that really get into that position, hands tight on my arm on my toes and my my toes. I'm on my toes. My heads down

311
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that we're bracing ourselves for first response. What is it,

312
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:17.760
Lauren Anderson: Repeated a dynamic experience of what happened with my step mom trying to solve it with my lover's whatever picking that type

313
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Of analysis. Stay here. All right.

314
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:23.760
Lauren Anderson: Well,

315
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.520
Lauren Anderson: my stepmom made it. So now whenever I am talking with someone around someone I

316
00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:34.950
Lauren Anderson: automatically respond to any social situation.

317
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.710
Lauren Anderson: I get automatically in that mode is if I'm

318
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:41.820
Lauren Anderson: Going to be attacked. Whether or not I perceive, it's going to happen.

319
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's analysis. So,

320
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:44.700
Lauren Anderson: Here's

321
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the tricky bit Lauren

322
00:35:52.320 --> 00:36:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you seen anything in group or maybe in here that I won't know how to analyze. What do you think, do you think I've got the got what it takes to analyze

323
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.190
Lauren Anderson: And to help me and everything. Yes.

324
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if there's enough trust there then

325
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're paying me might as well let me do it.

326
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You only need. You don't have to do all the analysis. So I think it's just a moment. I'm now I'm doing it with these men. You don't have to do that. Not, not in here.

327
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.870
Lauren Anderson: Because that's what you're asking.

328
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.530
No.

329
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm not.

330
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing. Oh, no, no.

331
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.510
Lauren Anderson: That's why I'm doing that.

332
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, I didn't listen this is really different. This kind of work that you and I are going to do. It's not like other stuff. When I say, How did, what are you bracing yourself for I want to know the first thing that comes to mind. Most people, it would be something like this.

333
00:36:51.780 --> 00:37:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I hit. What kind of a hit the next nasty criticism, that's going to come from my step mom. Ah, OK. You see it.

334
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm looking for your first response not analysis already know you're an incredibly intelligent analytical woman, but I'm interested in what that body is is bracing itself for I'll do all the analysis, you don't have to do that. I already know you can analyze it, of course.

335
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.500
Lauren Anderson: So you're asking what I think physically what this means.

336
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

337
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're almost no no it's you're almost there. So when you heard me do that thing I did where I got in the same position and I shared with you how I felt.

338
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember that that wasn't analysis. I literally said my body.

339
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: My body feels like it's bracing itself for something that's I literally told you how I felt. That's what I'm looking for. I want to know you. In the moment I don't want analysis.

340
00:37:51.360 --> 00:38:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not worried about that part. You and I work that part out later. I want to know what it feels like to be in that position. So these come fast. So one more time. Learn it will be instantaneous that first response will happen if a second is this long it'll be this big, it happens.

341
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That fast. And then, oh, well, now maybe it's because my mom and a half. And now I did it with all these men and you're going to end up saying all that. But the part that I want is that very first

342
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Response and you might only know it in the body. You might know it in maybe an image that flashes or a smell that might come quickly or you might know it in a sound. You might know it in

343
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A body somatic clenching relief, but it'll be remember this. This is a second. The stuff I want is in that very first fraction of that second

344
00:38:52.230 --> 00:39:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in all that analysis, you and I can get to that later. Okay. I want to know. So let's do it again. Let me do it again. I'm going to sit here and I want you to tell me the first thing that comes to mind when you get in that position.

345
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I crossover, and I go in. I'm, I'm on my toes and hunched over, and for me, I'm feeling

346
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I will bear down and get through this morning. What are you experiencing as you get in this position.

347
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:35.940
Lauren Anderson: I just don't even know I'm not sure what what what do you like what am I just don't know.

348
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.930
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

349
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.210
Lauren Anderson: I have to think on it or something.

350
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.810
Lauren Anderson: Oh,

351
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.800
Lauren Anderson: Give you how

352
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.130
Lauren Anderson: Am I supposed to have a one word response. Number one,

353
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

354
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:49.770
Lauren Anderson: I know the first thing we've been thinking about it, talking about too much. Now I

355
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.300
Lauren Anderson: Have to think about it.

356
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No, yeah, let's do some quiet lets you and I. Let's do that meditative

357
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.970
Lauren Anderson: We really don't want to do this.

358
00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:00.090
Lauren Anderson: Please. I don't want to do this right now, please.

359
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: turn inward turn inward. Let's go to that relaxed state that you enjoyed earlier. Okay, let's do that one.

360
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.180
Lauren Anderson: I don't want to answer that the

361
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.940
Lauren Anderson: Half day whatever we're just doing though. Please don't.

362
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go learn. I just said we let it go turn inward you doing you can't do your part wrong can't

363
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the client. It's only my misstep it's always going to be me. You just do you and you stood up and you're protecting your sacred space and we're going to just go to feel safe.

364
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe together.

365
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, letting it all go letting that stomach, go go go go flat.

366
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to inhale into a full belly on 321 and hold it. Hold it, hold it and let's exhale out the mouth. Let it go.

367
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out for another beat another one, another one. Let's bring it into the nose, inhaling through the nose.

368
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, all of it out.

369
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can keep that breathing going I want to continue

370
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.630

374
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing sounds maybe little feet little

375
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Nails hitting the floor or some other sound from outside. You hear it.

376
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe it's gone.

377
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.790

Gwenevere Abriel: Committee, you hear my voice.

380
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.340

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Narrative is

382
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.620

Lauren Anderson: Back and good

421
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:53.370

422
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, absolutely.

423
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All we need more intensive stuff on the front end and then then once we get that sort of

424
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotion regulation skills down, then it's like, no, I got this. I can be with you once a week. Okay, now let's talk about the insurance for some people they they won't hold themselves accountable and they want that sort of

425
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Parent figure to nudge, nudge, nudge, I can be that, for if you want the national Coach, if you want me to never bring it up. I can never bring it up. How can I be helpful in you getting your insurance.

426
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:40.020
Lauren Anderson: Um, you know, I was kind of thinking about, like, if I wanted to actually set tangible like physical, material goals with with you and have us like as part of part of our

427
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.500
Lauren Anderson: Group like my homework, kind of thing. Yeah.

428
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:51.000
Lauren Anderson: What from our sessions. Can I think on it now that now you verbalize it. To let me think on it for the weekend. Alright, cool.

429
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.380
Lauren Anderson: So for anything on that position to lead response.

430
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.770
Lauren Anderson: Okay, maybe like halfway through the week or something when

431
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.400
Lauren Anderson: It's clean slate of it, try it again.

432
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so I'm looking at next week.

433
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:27.840

434
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday, April 23 I think 110

435
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I get concerned and these afternoon hours that I'm going to end up being late to you guys. So I think I'd like to make it on purpose. A little later.

436
00:48:49.590 --> 00:49:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So Lauren 110 on April 23rd, set your alarm, I would give yourself half hour to 45 because I've been listening, it takes a long time for people to get into through the virtual clinic and it's helpful. I've noticed people have said, oh, I didn't know that.

437
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You can actually do that. BAM thing in the morning like or even the day before.

Lauren Anderson: Oh,

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.290
Lauren Anderson: When I was telling them so

442
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm telling what i'm saying is I'm trying to say clients have liked knowing that they can get the Bam Done way ahead of their appointment, because they don't want to be hurried having to do it right before the session.

443
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.640
Lauren Anderson: Some people. I do it before this appointment also

444
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.120

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me put a pin in just for a second. Just, just for a second.

454
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't actually know if bright heart health wants this.

455
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Brief addiction monitor done. I don't know what I'm trying to offer right now is supposed to be in service to you, but if it's adding confusion that I apologize.

456
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just trying to say if you're managing your time in a particular way, you may want if you wanted to, you could do that. Bam. Sunday.

457
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it done, if you wanted to. I don't know whether they want long before you meet with me. I'm going to be very honest I don't actually know.

458
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.570
Lauren Anderson: I'll ask them next time, if I remember

459
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.790
Lauren Anderson: I actually had a couple questions about them.

460
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.620
Lauren Anderson: Okay, about the questions in it, so. Okay, the question.

461
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:45.720
Lauren Anderson: About. Have you used opiates in the past week is that question also referring to buprenorphine or that's a different thing. Okay, so I, that's what I thought the answer no to that and then

462
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:57.660
Lauren Anderson: It asks, have you been using over the counter things. I just want to let you know that's occasionally I take an Extra Strength Tylenol for headaches and excedrin migraine bill usually put one one of each, and see

463
00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it. That's basically it.

464
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:07.260
Lauren Anderson: Just so you know what what what I'm answering their when asked if I've used illicit drugs. It's the marijuana. That's my daily

465
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes.

466
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no worries. No worries, and to and and also to add information. I don't know if you know this,

467
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people don't I look so rarely at the brief addiction. I'm sorry, I've got a spasm. I'm a writer.

468
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I look so rarely at your brief addiction monitor that truly your doctors looking at them every time you go to group. I am going to be very candid with you.

469
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: About once every three months.

470
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:39.360
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

471
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If you tell me. Listen here, when these are important and I want you looking at them. I'll do it.

472
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll do it.

473
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Otherwise,

474
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.040
Lauren Anderson: Otherwise, but someone's monitoring I'm every week, but

475
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This what you and I are doing

476
00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard stuff as it is. OK.

477
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So Maya. Yeah, this is where the work is happening in the psychotherapy right in here in what we're doing what you did today powerful

478
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but if you tell me. No, I want if I'm going to do this darn thing I want you to look at it, then I'll do it.

479
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.250
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

480
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear. I look forward to seeing you in groups. And then we have our individual schedule.

481
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

482
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:38.940
Lauren Anderson: One more question. Yeah. I, since I, I didn't really do the experiment. If you have any suggestions to help me actually remember when I'm around someone that I'm about to

483
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, with the five

484
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.510
Lauren Anderson: I couldn't. I didn't even remember it one time when I was around someone and started talking

485
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. How about right now. Here's my suggestion when you leave me here today and what I'd like you to do is get in the habit of this, you're going to do that breath work that same belly breathing. But this time, you're going to be feeling your own

486
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale, and guess what this is also five words. Isn't it so you can also be doing this, while you're no one's going to see you down here and zoom you can be doing it.

487
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to remember five words and you've already gotten in the habit breathing and you're already doing this on your finger and now you have these five words. So that's what it would look like this.

488
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to routinely be doing. Inhale. Exhale.

489
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: already doing it. So I'm already in the habit of this feeling of these five

490
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And because you pick five. It's so cool because I just thought, well, we have five fingers on one hand, and this breathing thing is often a technique for that. Inhale, exhale to slow ourselves down

491
00:53:53.850 --> 00:54:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you are already in the habit of doing that. Now, let's say you do your experiment and you wait to do it in group when I'm there.

492
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You might do this, and no one will see you and you're like, oh, that fingers. I'm going to say five words. First I'm going to do my breathing and I'm doing it right now. You can't see me five.

493
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.570
Lauren Anderson: We can make it 10 also cuz you're going, I guess I

494
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.250
Lauren Anderson: Gotta

495
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Respond to her with five words and remember that I just remembered my five. Now I'm going to get my pencil and I'm gonna be like, Okay, no, she's going to ask me.

496
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: she's not. She's asking everybody else should ask everybody else I know she's going to come to me. How do I do it succinct. I know she likes feeling so I feel

497
00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: irritated when others are in a fixed mindset irritated in fixed mindset I feel irritated.

498
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there you are, you're in it. You're doing it. You're slowing down. You're looking at the number of words. You're the one that wants it so tight but

499
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.390
Lauren Anderson: I would go with 1010 more reasonable once you

500
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:02.430
Lauren Anderson: Take any kind of clause or conjunction to explain yourself it's

501
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.270
Lauren Anderson: Your, your

502
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But look what it does, if, if this is what gets you to remember. Remember, it's this, it's this Brianna I've added this now. Here's five fingers. Oh, that's right. And you could do all 10 if you wanted to, but this might help you remember. Okay. Okay.

503
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, it's time you see if I can do this thing. I'm going to go through the next hand. I'm going to try to keep it down, she I know she's going to call on me. She calls on everybody. So I want to give my feedback and I want to, I want to be concise me write it down.

504
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you write it down. And you can consolidate it and you pull it up. You say, I'm going to read from my paper, and here I go. I feel data and then if you want to be silly because I'll do this and grip. Sometimes I'll go

505
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:47.820
Lauren Anderson: Mm hmm.

506
00:55:48.510 --> 00:56:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm a Gemini and, you know, although the doctor. Yeah. Do I get a word in edgewise. She'll say to me, and then I'll go. Whoops, or I'll mute myself.

507
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.210
Lauren Anderson: Just keep

508
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Running right

509
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. I can't meet you. I can't. But those are going to help you, you don't

510
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think that would go, Well, I'm not going to do that, too, but

511
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.460
Lauren Anderson: You can be a third individual, by the way, Lauren, nobody

512
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.780
Lauren Anderson: Said afterwards.

513
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think that's going to help our poor very much if I'm muting

514
00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You being cute though. But there's an idea. So when you're doing your, your belly breathing maybe

515
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that really slowed me down. I gotta tell you that that additional contact with my breath, I realized

516
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to slow way down. That was even too fast. I felt like I needed to slow my finger down a little bit.

517
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Me too. I just stopped the

518
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.890
Lauren Anderson: Top

519
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.090
Lauren Anderson: A couple times like

520
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.360
Yeah.

521
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's give that a shot. Maybe data. If you do this a few like even 10 times a day. This

522
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.670
Lauren Anderson: May be my own

523
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The on your own then

524
00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It comes to I got a little note.

525
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Next to my appointment five words, I'm going to meet

526
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In group and it says five words, I'm gonna keep it to five words and then you've got that visual cue you'll do your breathing. I know she's going to call on me. Hey, I'll volunteer. I've got it in my head. Maybe I'll volunteer. Let me go first. You could do that.

527
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:56.610
Lauren Anderson: And I might get can we make it 10 I've been seeing from your examples to five really is a little too little.

528
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.750
Absolutely.

529
00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need any, do you need me to message a doctor of any kind, or you already set all the way you have enough medicine to get you to your next service.

530
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:09.210
Lauren Anderson: Yep, I'm good.

531
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Very proud of you. You worked very hard today.

532
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. I'll talk to you later.

533
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:16.800
Lauren Anderson: Okay, well, good day.
