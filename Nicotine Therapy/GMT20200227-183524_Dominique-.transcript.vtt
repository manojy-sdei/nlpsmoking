Dominique Pozo: Good and

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.190
Dominique Pozo: How about what, what would you like to be getting out of our sessions and let's um let's kind of talk about what what you would like this work together to look like and

21
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, I feel like she's there's, there's a lot of stuff I

22
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.700
Dianna Jaramillo: I feel like I have a whole lot of stuff you know like

23
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.000
Dianna Jaramillo: Just everything I'm

24
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.540
Dianna Jaramillo: Like with my mom and just the way things are now things are hard like really, really hard now.

25
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.400
Dianna Jaramillo: That I'm not, I'm not working. And, you know, all of that stuff not having like now I don't have the vehicle make my boyfriend has the vehicle and

26
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:30.990
Dianna Jaramillo: And, you know, he takes me to do whatever I need to do. But it's scary living out in a rural area, like I do, and having to look at getting a job.

27
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:42.570
Dianna Jaramillo: And not having a vehicle and having to go all the way to Santa Fe to work and not having a vehicle and and then he works. And so it's that part's really scary to you know

28
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.180
Dianna Jaramillo: So I don't know what I'm going to do.

29
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.350
Dominique Pozo: Or do you have a license. Can you drive

30
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

31
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.780
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, eventually. Is that something you want eventually to get a car.

32
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:08.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. My, my, I had my really beautiful terrain. But when I left my mom's she kept it because it was it was up. She was the main person on it.

33
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.080
Dianna Jaramillo: And so she just took it away from me and you know so i and i haven't added vehicle since then. And that was almost a year ago, I guess.

34
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.070
Dominique Pozo: I mean things I'm hearing one are just wanting some autonomy and also you

35
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.600
Dominique Pozo: Also your safety, you know, just being able to know that you're that you have this in case you need to get out of, you know, this rural location for whatever reason.

36
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.640
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

37
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah. There's the Jesus so much. I mean,

38
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:58.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Even like us, this House that we're in, um, we've stayed here because so my boyfriend doesn't really work in the wintertime, because you know it's cold, and he's, he does a lot of contractor type stuff. And, um,

39
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:10.770
Dianna Jaramillo: But we stay here because the landlord. He's real understanding you know he's really nice and he's, he doesn't push us for further and when he knows. Neither one of us are working or anything.

40
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:22.950
Dianna Jaramillo: But this house is just falling apart. It's awful. You know, so that's that's a huge a huge issue to and we would like to get out of here and get to Santa Fe and everything, but

41
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.780
Dianna Jaramillo: It's just so expensive, and everything's just really scary right now. I don't think I've ever been scared.

42
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:46.860
Dominique Pozo: What what areas are you're not scared and I want to, I totally don't want to dismiss the fear and the vulnerabilities that you're feeling. But I also want to know for my own understanding what areas you feel

43
00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.960
Dianna Jaramillo: I think honestly like the main area that I'm not scared. Early in his lake with my sobriety my recovery.

44
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Area. I'm not scared.

45
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.740
I'm not scared.

46
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.450
Dominique Pozo: Huge

47
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

48
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:20.250
Dominique Pozo: And I just want to encourage you and let's just take a moment and maybe drop out of the head and let these feelings come out because it's, you know, this is the place and time to let it move through and give these parts space.

49
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.120
Yeah.

50
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

51
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

52
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:40.290
Dominique Pozo: And I could be totally wrong. I could be wrong. Please tell me that doesn't sound true at all. But as you're speaking I just I just gotten a sense of like a young child like

53
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:53.430
Dominique Pozo: I'm scared. And I don't. Whatever, I don't feel safe or this house is falling apart, you feel scared and and I wonder if you if any of that rings true like How old is that scared little one.

54
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.660
Dianna Jaramillo: Helpless and young

55
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.160
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so I think this watching some deeper

56
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah it is, for sure. Yeah.

57
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. I mean, just a think.

58
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.650
Dianna Jaramillo: Not having my mom is a really big thing that she just

59
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.620
Dianna Jaramillo: She just doesn't care about me anymore. You know, like she just gave up button. And that's, that's something that she's done before.

60
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:38.400
Dianna Jaramillo: When I made a mistake or when i when i you know was using years ago, you know, eight, eight or so years ago when I was using she would just totally turned her back on me. She wouldn't try to help me or

61
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:47.070
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, trying anything she would just turn it back on me and stop talking to me and that's exactly what she's doing now. And so it really

62
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.680
Dianna Jaramillo: brings all that back.

63
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.880
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, I just

64
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it's like all sorts of trauma all over again.

65
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.890
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's what I'm sensing is the, you know,

66
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.140
Dominique Pozo: Missing that security, you know that secure attachment to

67
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.250
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

68
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.620
Dominique Pozo: It's like mother is the nurturing like embrace that that holds us when we're scared so

69
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.870
Dominique Pozo: I cannot really hitting

70
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.490
The signal.

71
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.610
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

72
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, definitely.

73
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.980
Dominique Pozo: So let's take a moment and rub your hands together like this.

74
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.460
Dianna Jaramillo: And move it.

75
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.570
Dianna Jaramillo: He's such a Yeah she does.

Tuning India.

78
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.150
Dominique Pozo: Just feel that warmth and, you know, large and that fire energy

79
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.830
Dominique Pozo: Creating a little one.

80
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.400
Here.

81
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.250
Dominique Pozo: And then wherever you feel

82
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.470
Dominique Pozo: Moved to place your hands to place them.

83
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.370
Dominique Pozo: On whatever part of you feels great.

84
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.360

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.410
Dianna Jaramillo: And just

Dominique Pozo: If you can just tune into the part of view that is is taking care of you, you know, no matter how scared you are. There's the warm up. So let's hear saying, I know it's hard, and we're going to be okay. I don't know what it looks like, yet, but we're going to be okay.

88
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.820
Dominique Pozo: Or whatever your words are

89
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.840
Yeah.

90
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.640
Dominique Pozo: What are you exactly

91
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.820
Dominique Pozo: What are your words like what would you tell yourself to soothe yourself.

92
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:51.960
Dianna Jaramillo: It's okay. I tell myself. It's okay. Probably 1000 times a day, and you say it's okay it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, you're okay. We're okay.

93
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.390
Dominique Pozo: Do

94
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.470
Dominique Pozo: You believe it.

95
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, mostly

96
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:10.680
Dianna Jaramillo: Mostly believe it. I mean, you know, it always has been in the past, even when Things have been scary in the pastor

97
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:19.050
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, it always is. It's always okay and I'm I've always survived. I'm always

98
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:30.390
Dianna Jaramillo: I've always gotten through it and lived and survived and things have gotten better and in also. I mean I it's

99
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.620
Dianna Jaramillo: I believe that now to mostly

100
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Nothing. Yeah.

101
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:50.370
Dianna Jaramillo: It's just, I don't think that I've ever been in this position that I'm in right now with nothing and also been sober.

102
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.630
Uh huh.

103
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.030
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so that's like

104
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.800
Dianna Jaramillo: I just didn't care before as much

105
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:06.720
Dianna Jaramillo: And so I didn't, you know, I mean, I could just know myself. I could just be numb and

106
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:14.910
Dianna Jaramillo: And just sort of float through each day and I'm not doing that. No in and I don't want to do that. No.

107
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.310
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so

108
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:28.140
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I mean, I don't know, it's just so scary not knowing just not knowing what's going to happen, you know, or

109
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Where I'll end up or

110
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Just the not knowing is so scary.

111
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.680
Dominique Pozo: Well, I just want to validate and actually celebrate

112
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.460
That you're

113
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.380
Dominique Pozo: You ever heard of that, that, that theme, the window of tolerance before

114
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.090
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

115
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.180
Dominique Pozo: So,

116
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.320
Dominique Pozo: You know, I think.

117
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.880
Dominique Pozo: When a person is actively using their tolerance is so tiny for just

118
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:09.630
Dominique Pozo: They just can't handle the discomfort. So I'm going to go drink or smoke or your shoot up or whatever, whatever people choose to do tend to numb this thing. And so by

119
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:18.540
Dominique Pozo: By feeling how uncomfortable because it's not comfortable to be scared and to not know it takes a lot of

120
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.210
Dominique Pozo: Trust and whatever other things, you know, you call upon

121
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.130
Dominique Pozo: Feel

122
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.350
Dominique Pozo: That some faith in

123
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.490
Dominique Pozo: In the unknown.

124
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.480
Dominique Pozo: That starts to grow that window of tolerance which is

125
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:34.710
Dominique Pozo: Which

126
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.690
What's the word

127
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.500
Dominique Pozo: It's such a skill to have. As we move through life because life is not comfortable. Right.

128
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.790
Dianna Jaramillo: That's for sure.

129
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.150
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Sometimes it is, sometimes it's great it's, you know,

130
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.660
Yeah.

131
00:11:50.160 --> 00:12:04.080
Dominique Pozo: You know, we're constantly presented with challenges that are that move us in that space. So you're growing into that. And yet, if it's the first time you've been in this space and not used, it makes so much sense that all of this is coming up. Yeah.

132
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I think so too.

133
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:06.930
Yeah.

134
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:08.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

135
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.580
Dominique Pozo: So when you tell yourself you're

136
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.500
Dominique Pozo: Going to be okay. You're gonna be okay.

137
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:29.850
Dominique Pozo: What are the parts of you that believe that if you can imagine there's, you know, there's theories that we have all these different parts within and you know we've got young older pirates all these different things. So what are the

138
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.630
Dianna Jaramillo: Parts that believes

139
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.480
Dominique Pozo: What are they are quite

140
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.030
Dianna Jaramillo: Like

141
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.340
Dominique Pozo: What are they

142
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.070
Dominique Pozo: What's the description of them.

143
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.410
Dianna Jaramillo: There's

144
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.900
Dianna Jaramillo: I think I don't know, like a part of my

145
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Like my heart, my

146
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.150
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, it's

147
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:12.240
Dianna Jaramillo: Like all these different parts that do believe that you know that it is going to be okay. There's, it's like

148
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.910
Dianna Jaramillo: 75% of all of those parts believe that it's going to be okay.

149
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.780
Dianna Jaramillo: And then

150
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:25.050
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, but there. I don't think there's a single part of me that believes that 100% still

151
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.330
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like the heart. It sounds like there's a lot of

152
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:45.540
Dominique Pozo: Truth in the heart, even though it may not be 100% and I want to stick with that because this is going to be like a place to return to it seems like the hard part is going to help to suit the parts that don't that aren't fully on board and

153
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:54.210
Dominique Pozo: Let's take a moment and if you're willing to just describe that hard part like tell me the qualities of that part of you. What is she like

154
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Strong and sensitive and

155
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.440
Dianna Jaramillo: loving and kind

156
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Vulnerable

157
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.630
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

158
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Caring.

159
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.260
Dianna Jaramillo: And scared to death.

160
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.930
Dianna Jaramillo: To be broken and hurt.

161
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.060
Dominique Pozo: Who has her back who's got that heart parts back

162
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.310
Dianna Jaramillo: A little bit of my brain, probably a little bit of me. My mind my consciousness.

163
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.570
Dominique Pozo: And what's that part. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that.

164
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.170
Dianna Jaramillo: That's probably

165
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.130
Dianna Jaramillo: The part that is like the most

166
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.520
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know.

167
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Strong but but week tour or confused.

168
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.220
Dianna Jaramillo: He knows pinelake

169
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.170
Dianna Jaramillo: Like

170
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:29.820
Dianna Jaramillo: The part that's like, Is it is it is it really going to be okay but also like has faith in that hurt per week there's there's faith there because I know in my mind in my consciousness. I know what my heart has been through what it's experienced and what it's capable of and

171
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.280
Dianna Jaramillo: how powerful it is

172
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:42.900
Dominique Pozo: So that consciousness is kind of like the witness. It's witnessed and it can draw on history to say hey I've got proof that you can pull through

173
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

174
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:51.150
Dominique Pozo: Well, it's really, I'm just having this thought in the moment, you know,

175
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.290
And

176
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.490
Dominique Pozo: I don't know what your sensitivity is. And please, just call me out if it's not appropriate. If you

177
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.650
Dominique Pozo: Like Jen using gender terms is

178
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.600
Dominique Pozo: Feminine, masculine or is that okay

179
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.800
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's fine.

180
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.940
Dominique Pozo: I'm just thinking, traditionally, you know, with our

181
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.430
Dominique Pozo: Energies and

182
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:32.940
Dominique Pozo: Using archetypes, there's, you know, there's the mother archetype, and it's typically it's coming from the heart. It's that warm place and then there's the father archetype, that usually is a little more rational and

183
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.360
Dianna Jaramillo: Right.

184
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:39.840
Dominique Pozo: You know, creates the structure and can think linearly with a timeline. And so as you

185
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:53.790
Dominique Pozo: Spoke about these two parts that seem to have the faith and know on some level, that to me seems like a father, an inner father, and then your heart part to me seems like an inner mother that you've cultivated and

186
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.210
Dominique Pozo: Really strong parts that

187
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.830
Dominique Pozo: Are, you know, a part of the whole with the rest of you.

188
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:11.220
Dominique Pozo: You know that, like there's some to really strong foundational parts of yourself to call upon or lean into, you know,

189
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.060
Dianna Jaramillo: Definitely, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I like that.

190
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

191
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:23.670
Dominique Pozo: Yeah so taken. He just took a deep breath and I think a part of you relax a little bit right there.

192
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.960
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Oh.

193
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.210
Dominique Pozo: So let's just

194
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.700
Dominique Pozo: Acknowledging that you have these parts of you that are like pillars, you know,

195
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.410
Dominique Pozo: And

196
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.190
Dominique Pozo: And just take a few deep breaths to remember all the

197
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.920
Dominique Pozo: And it doesn't take away the struggle or the realness of everything, but it's just

198
00:17:50.010 --> 00:18:04.650
Dominique Pozo: A reminder. Okay. When things when I get a little anxious or the the parts that are afraid start to come up to. Just remember, okay. Yes, I hear you. And here I am bringing those those two energies forward.

199
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.240
Yeah.

200
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

201
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.190
Dominique Pozo: I'm just, I'm just kind of waiting to see where, you know, where should we go from here. What do you think

202
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.610
Yeah.

203
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.410
Dianna Jaramillo: I know it's

204
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:39.810
Dianna Jaramillo: It feels like so much when I think about it, or when I talk about it. It feels like just so overwhelming.

205
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.270
Dianna Jaramillo: But

206
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.270
Dianna Jaramillo: I feel like instead of, instead of using

207
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.070
Dianna Jaramillo: These I've

208
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.170
Dianna Jaramillo: I've

209
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.590
Dianna Jaramillo: Over the last year, I've started to just kind of shove it down and not

210
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.440
Dianna Jaramillo: Talk about it and not deal with it and

211
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.730
You know,

212
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.500
Dianna Jaramillo: They haven't

213
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:25.410
Dianna Jaramillo: I haven't talked about really anything. I don't really talk about that kind of stuff with my boyfriend or anybody you know I've talked about it very little with my dad.

214
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Cuz there's there's stuff going on there too, with my dad, but we've always been really close, and he's always

215
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.450
Dianna Jaramillo: For the most part, he's always really been there for me and and been supportive of me.

216
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.130
Dianna Jaramillo: But

217
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:53.940
Dianna Jaramillo: Except for this this last time that I i left because I was with my mom for we live together and we both worked and you know did supported the household together, um,

218
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.620
Dianna Jaramillo: But since I left her almost a year ago. I'm

219
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:18.690
Dianna Jaramillo: Like it felt like my dad completely, totally changed with me like he didn't. He didn't trust me or something. All of a sudden, or maybe he thought that I went back to using or I don't know what because my mom. I know my mom told him. God only knows what

220
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.420
Dianna Jaramillo: My mom told him, and

221
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.290
Dianna Jaramillo: I only ever saw him like once every

222
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:44.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Maybe two or three months as it was because he's, he is all over. He travels a lot and uh yeah he's all over the place. But no, I haven't seen him in in almost this whole years since I left my mom and we text and talk once in a while, but I'm

223
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Just actually just recently about, I don't know, maybe a few weeks, two or three weeks ago.

224
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.030
Dianna Jaramillo: I texted him.

225
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.030
Dianna Jaramillo: I forgot what it was, it was

226
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:06.540
Dianna Jaramillo: He's very, very non confrontational. And if he feels the slightest inkling of there's an issue there. He'll just

227
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.600
Dianna Jaramillo: tune it out. He just, you know, he won't

228
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Deal with it, you know.

229
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:25.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Usually I mean for big stuff you'll, you know, he will. But anyways, so he didn't text me back for that. And so a couple days later, those really bothering me. So a couple days later.

230
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:33.780
Dianna Jaramillo: We texted him and he told him, I don't know what my mom told you, or what you think is going on with me but

231
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:51.030
Dianna Jaramillo: You know we are things are hard right now because I'm not working, but I'm not using there's no anything. There's no drugs, no alcohol. Nothing at all. And so I just need you to know that that just because I'm not living with her doesn't mean I'm just a piece of crap. Now,

232
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

233
00:21:52.650 --> 00:22:01.620
Dianna Jaramillo: And yeah. And then, and he really actually seem to respond well to that I was really surprised and

234
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:14.130
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, he was like he texted me back right away. And he was like, We need to talk. And, you know, we need to communicate more and and discuss some of this stuff because

235
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:24.480
Dianna Jaramillo: You know i i don't know what's going on with you, but I believe you. I trust you know and so I mean that that was really nice. And then

236
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:32.370
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, he helped me out a little bit with with a phone card for my phone. And so that was really nice.

237
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.020
Dianna Jaramillo: And

238
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:49.350
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, it showed me a lot actually from him. So, I mean, I'm really thankful that I still have that that person. My dad, you know, because we have always been so close. I'm still really thankful that I help him.

239
00:22:51.240 --> 00:23:03.210
Dianna Jaramillo: And and i don't know if he talks to my mom like talks to my mom about me because they're really close. They were better off. They were meant to be friends. You know, so they they stayed really close after they work together anymore. For the last

240
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:11.790
Dianna Jaramillo: You know 20 something years they've been they've been really good friends. So, I mean, it was always nice for me. I didn't have parents that were constantly fighting and

241
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.700
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, harassing each other, anything

242
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:30.510
Dianna Jaramillo: So I don't know if he talks to her about me or anything like that. But honestly, I feel like that's, that's one of the bigger issues for me is the whole thing with my mom. I can't even talk about it, you know.

243
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:38.580
Dominique Pozo: Well, I really get the sense that I correct me if I'm wrong, but I sense that you feel abandoned by her

244
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.360
Talk.

245
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.370
Dominique Pozo: Happy to.

246
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.750
Dominique Pozo: Hear that your dad actually

247
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.610
Dianna Jaramillo: Showed up and

248
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.340
Dominique Pozo: You know, it didn't happen on both ends because that's a huge

249
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Him. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.870
Dominique Pozo: How old we are

251
00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:03.480
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, parents and to be, you know, pushed away dismissed and not acknowledged by a parent is a it's

252
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:18.060
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, really, really huge. I don't. And just, I mean not talking to my dad as much. You're seeing him at all. This last year. It's really lonely, like I have felt really really alone.

253
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Because of them, you know, because just not having them in my life the way I did before.

254
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.090
Dianna Jaramillo: And I, and I have been, I've been really like

255
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.520
Dominique Pozo: How, how long ago did you have that exchange exchange with your

256
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.590
Dianna Jaramillo: Was that that last time was just

257
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.260
Dianna Jaramillo: About a week ago, I would say.

258
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:52.530
Dominique Pozo: Oh, great. Okay. And have you have you made any effort to communicate more. So can we go out to lunch or can you come to me because you don't

259
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.180
Dominique Pozo: Have yeah we're having fun.

260
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I brought the I brought that up and and

261
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:12.180
Dianna Jaramillo: I told him you know we should get together, we should we should have dinner together, something like that. And he's always he's always like, Yeah, you know, definitely. That sounds great but then there's no follow through with on his part when they

262
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.150
Dianna Jaramillo: When they bring it up. It's like, you know, he's

263
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:29.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Not in town or he's busy or and I know that's true like he's always busy and he is. He's all over. He has a house and he has three different houses in three different states. You know, so he has a whole new family.

264
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.330
Dianna Jaramillo: And all of that. So I know he's busy a lot but

265
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.160
Dianna Jaramillo: It's

266
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:48.210
Dianna Jaramillo: It's, I know it's kind of, I just kind of accept, accept is like I feel like as long as we're talking and I can still have a conversation on the phone with him that that's pedophiles good enough for now.

267
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:58.800
Dominique Pozo: Is there something in the way of you you taking the initiative and saying, I want to go have dinner with you on say Tuesday night.

268
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.150
Dominique Pozo: Instead,

269
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:05.130
Dominique Pozo: Of something like that. Is that possible, or is there some what's keeping you from doing

270
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.100
Dianna Jaramillo: It feels like there is, it feels like there is something keeping me

271
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:24.750
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm I don't know what it is. I'm not really sure, because I've even said it and thought about it, that if he saw me. You know, he would know immediately that

272
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:39.540
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm good. I'm healthy. I'm not, you know, doing anything I shouldn't be doing. So I don't know what it is. But yeah, there's, there is there's something from me pushing, pushing it to that to the next step and

273
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.990
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, actually, you know,

274
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:52.530
Dominique Pozo: It could not be it, although I wonder is there fear of experiencing rejection, on some level that you don't. It's like that would be too much, or is that not

275
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.760
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's

276
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.930
Dianna Jaramillo: That's definitely part of it. I don't

277
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.870
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, not, not, that's not the biggest part. But yeah, that's definitely in there.

278
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.050
Dianna Jaramillo: There's a sprinkle of that for sure.

279
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.560
Dominique Pozo: About your partner, do you think your dad would like not necessarily approve. But do you think that he would be happy for you if you met your partner.

280
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.800
Dianna Jaramillo: He yeah i think i think he would totally like him. I think they would really like each other.

281
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:37.950
Dianna Jaramillo: You know he's he's never been real Georgie with like my my past relationships and stuff. He was never like

282
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:47.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, he's horrible, you need to get the hell away from him or, you know, or really liked somebody where they were spending time together without me. You know, it was never

283
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:55.530
Dianna Jaramillo: He was never he was always kind of like whatever, as long as, as long as you're okay and you know you're you're happy and

284
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.410
Dianna Jaramillo: That's fine. You know, so, but I think, actually, I think they would actually really like each other.

285
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.970
Dominique Pozo: You don't sounds like a very independent character. And I'm wondering

286
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.760
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, well, the dynamic and how

287
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:18.000
Dominique Pozo: Your little girl might be coming through, like, you know, oh, am I important enough. Does he have time. Who does he want to me.

288
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.330
Dianna Jaramillo: Right.

289
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.940
Dominique Pozo: Like all these things.

290
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.640
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

291
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:40.080
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, so maybe the rejection part is is a little bit bigger of a part because I felt I felt like I mean honestly I just started know without actually trying that if I was to say, you know, let's get together, whatever Tuesday night.

292
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.830
Dianna Jaramillo: At six I'll meet you at so and so or whatever.

293
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:57.810
Dianna Jaramillo: That he would be like, Oh, well, I'm leaving town or, you know, I can't. That night, for whatever reason, and and that that rejection that would be rejection and that would really suck about what hurt.

294
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:12.300
Dominique Pozo: What could be another way that you could propose to to actually have a plant make a plan and and a commitment to it that might avoid some rejection, what, how can you think to do that. I have some ideas, but I want it to come from you.

295
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.480
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, probably

296
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Ask him, you know, to

297
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.010
Dianna Jaramillo: To

298
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.480
Dianna Jaramillo: Make

299
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Make a timer asked him, you know, like, what, what night. Is he free

300
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:36.360
Dianna Jaramillo: And let it you know sort of come from him come out of him and

301
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.440
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, I guess maybe

302
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:50.610
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's what that's what I'm thinking. And you know it's it's less vulnerable to to to put out an actual day and time in here. No, I can't do that and

303
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.760
Dominique Pozo: It's open ended to say something like, hey, I really want to see you, that this means a lot to me and

304
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:05.220
Dominique Pozo: That if we don't set a day or time it doesn't happen. So will you let me know what they are times work for you because I really wanted

305
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:06.870
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, something like this.

306
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:16.560
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm totally willing to do that, you know, I mean I think another part of

307
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:28.590
Dianna Jaramillo: His, His deal. I'm not being is as close to me minus, you know, whatever. My mom has told him, but his wife.

308
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.960
Dominique Pozo: Right. I remember her and my

309
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.260
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, she you know they've been married for, you know,

310
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.330
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, probably almost 20 years now.

311
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Because they've got together when I was really, really young and

312
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.990
Dianna Jaramillo: She never liked me. She just never liked you know she never made an effort to

313
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:54.330
Dianna Jaramillo: Get to know me or to get close to me. The only time I ever actually had any kind of conversation with her or spent any time around her.

314
00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:03.570
Dianna Jaramillo: Was when I was way up here. I was doing so good. I was getting awards from the state, you know, I was having frickin Congress, Congressman, give me you know awards and

315
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:12.960
Dianna Jaramillo: For the work that I was doing with with the addiction community, the addiction recovery community and they got the only time that she ever sort of had anything to do with

316
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:21.810
Dianna Jaramillo: After before that and and after that it's i have i know that she has had a really huge.

317
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.500
Dianna Jaramillo: Like control.

318
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:38.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Over the employees, my dad's decisions you know and and so, you know, that's a big part of it too. I know that that's that's a big part of it that he doesn't. He's not as

319
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:47.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Close with me or you know doesn't see me more or whatever. I know, I know for a fact that it's it's partially because of her

320
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

321
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.930
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Wow, that's tough for him and i i was thinking of her as well.

322
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:55.140
Dianna Jaramillo: What

323
00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.600
Dominique Pozo: You know, why isn't he more available and recognizing right said he has a whole other family and

324
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.640
Dominique Pozo: She hasn't been willing to get to know you yet. Right.

325
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. After 20 years you know

326
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:21.180
Dianna Jaramillo: So, so that's kind of like, whatever. And I even told told my dad in the past to that, if that's fine. She doesn't you know if she doesn't want to know me, or whatever.

327
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:36.900
Dianna Jaramillo: That's totally fine with me. She's not my family, I would have been, I would have made her my family. Totally. You know if she would have put an in an effort, a little bit of an effort, but she didn't. And so she's you know she's not my family. She's nothing to me.

328
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.150
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, but but I told him, you know, I'm not going to give you any shit about it or make you feel

329
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:52.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Bad that are and you know anything about it. I just know that you're my dad and they need you and they need you in my life, you know, and

330
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.940
Dianna Jaramillo: And that was that, you know, and he just sort of took it for what it was and

331
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:06.240
Dianna Jaramillo: Kind of left it left it at that. I don't think he ever talked to her told her anything about

332
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.050
Dianna Jaramillo: How she treated me or anything like that.

333
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.150
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

334
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:14.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

335
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.870
Dominique Pozo: I keep getting this hit. I don't know if you're up for it or if it feels like where you want to go with the session, but

336
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:34.110
Dominique Pozo: To bring some art supplies out because you've really shared a lot. I want to let like you kind of drop with it a little bit through some art making unless there's more that that

337
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.370
Dianna Jaramillo: No. Yeah.

338
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.290
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Does that sound good.

339
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that sounds awesome.

340
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:45.630
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. Let me. I want to stick with everything you've shared, I just want to give it some attention from a different part of your brain.

341
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:54.480
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. I know that sounds good to me. I don't really have much but but paper and pens. Perfect.

342
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.420
Dominique Pozo: So do. Do you have them near you.

343
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, right here.

344
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:17.640
Dominique Pozo: So I was having the idea of a few things came to my mind one I was really struck when you said you've been you've been feeling very lonely. This past year, that really touched me to that and then

345
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.430
Dominique Pozo: You know, in the way that your mom has been

346
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.630
You know,

347
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:33.150
Dominique Pozo: Really not responding to you in the way that you would wish and that feels, you know, really needed and then your dad to a point like he's responding to a point.

348
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.790
Dominique Pozo: So,

349
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:45.540
Dominique Pozo: So, considering that there's this lonely part of you. And then these two, you know, very significant figures mother and father who are only getting so close.

350
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:54.090
Dominique Pozo: Okay, if you're willing to draw the lonely part of you in the center of the paper.

351
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:05.280
Dominique Pozo: Whatever just market for now with some shape or symbol or something, whatever feels appropriate for that lonely part

352
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.260
Dianna Jaramillo: OK.

353
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:33.780
Dominique Pozo: OK, and then using the rest of the paper. If you can just put how close is your dad to you and what's the proximity of your mom. So just so you can get a visual. It's like a constellation is what this is. So there's

354
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:50.790
Dominique Pozo: I really like using the metaphor of a constellation, because there are points in the sky and there's distances and they're pretty steady yet with humans are constellations are con they're moving all the time. So right now what is the constellation look like

355
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.270
And then

356
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:30.060
Dominique Pozo: In the space between you and your mother and the space between you and your father for the time being, until something shifts. What can you do to sue that space, like what things could you fill that space with that would feel really nurturing and good for you.

357
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.000
Dominique Pozo: And you can draw them. You can write them.

358
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.780
Dominique Pozo: Whatever think would you think would be

359
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.590
Dominique Pozo: Like for you to make it a little easier because it's painful.

360
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay.

361
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.050
Dianna Jaramillo: And then just take a moment.

362
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:38.940
Dominique Pozo: Take a moment and and look at your image. And just what do you see when you look at that. What, what comes up for you.

363
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.050
Dianna Jaramillo: Sad.

364
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.520
Dianna Jaramillo: There was a could make it better.

365
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:27.090
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I, I don't want to rush through the grief of it too fast. And I also don't want you to get like voice text in it. So I'm, I'm actually in this moment thinking okay

366
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:48.240
Dominique Pozo: Do we give us more space and just let it be, or do I invite her to think about some action, she can take to move out of this sad space. What feels. What does your spirit really need because grief is not a bad thing. It's just I think when we get like frozen in it, then it's

367
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:56.460
Dominique Pozo: A great problem, but it's actually quite healing. So, what, what do you think you most need to feel the grief of this

368
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:16.800
Dianna Jaramillo: Probably because I haven't, I haven't, haven't let myself feel feel it at all, just like I said earlier, it's sort of just like pushed it down over and over and over and just kind of blocked it and and I haven't talked about it. I haven't

369
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.040
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, dealt with it all.

370
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.690
Dianna Jaramillo: So I need to feel it a thing I need to just feel it, even though that's scary is how

371
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.920
Dominique Pozo: I just moved outside. I'm not sure why it froze up but I'm

372
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.870
Dominique Pozo: Gonna get the best internet

373
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:58.860
Dominique Pozo: Signal possible

374
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh yeah okay that's. I was wondering, I figured it just froze for a second.

375
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.770
Dominique Pozo: I'm actually glad it gave you, maybe a moment to just be without me asking you. More questions.

376
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.080
Dianna Jaramillo: But

377
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.840
Dominique Pozo: I what I was wondering is, I'm

378
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.470
Dominique Pozo: Wanting to be a really kind of delicate because it's such a fine balance of not taking you out of the grief because

379
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:31.230
Dominique Pozo: In the past, you know, it sounds to me that you used to cover up the sadness and not feel that. So there I think there's some benefit and like

380
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:43.860
Dominique Pozo: Just metabolized in and digesting the grief of, you know, if the distance that you've been experiencing with your mother and father, and then at the same time, you know i i don't want you to get stuck there and frozen.

381
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Great.

382
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.890
Dianna Jaramillo: We're that's

383
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, that's what I was saying was, like, it'll

384
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:59.610
Dianna Jaramillo: I do feel like I need to feel it, because that's the only way I'm going to process it because I haven't felt it mostly I've stayed on.

385
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.660
Dianna Jaramillo: Like, try to kind of hold on more to anger.

386
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.890
Dianna Jaramillo: And and

387
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:14.130
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, in an older the those kind of more, you know, darker emotions to sort of help me get through this last year.

388
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:25.830
Dianna Jaramillo: And, you know, like, Well, what the hell you know like if she doesn't want me. She doesn't want me in her life, then you know she could kiss my ass but but i don't i don't really believe that, you know, it's just, I'm just kind of keeping up

389
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:38.970
Dianna Jaramillo: To protect me or whatever. And so, feeling it is really scary. Like I'm I'm scared. If I feel it that it'll just wait. They could kill me or something.

390
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.660
Yeah.

391
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.070
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm scared to feel it but

392
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.760
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't want to

393
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Because everybody even tells me like

394
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.000
Dianna Jaramillo: Things about her like

395
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:08.100
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, like I can't believe she's doing that I could I could never imagine doing that to my own kids. No matter what they did, like my mom sister. She has two twin sisters

396
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:09.780
Dianna Jaramillo: And

397
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:26.790
Dianna Jaramillo: And I stayed, I guess, you know, kinda. I was never really close with anybody, and neither side of the family, but, um, they have really tried to keep in touch with me and keep in communication with me and you know make sure that I'm okay, I guess.

398
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:38.970
Dianna Jaramillo: So they call me, you know, probably once a week or so and then they tell me, stuff like that, you know, like, I don't, I can't understand her and that's their sister.

399
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:54.330
Dianna Jaramillo: They know her, you know, they know her very well and they tell me what, what the hell is she thinking, Why is she doing this. Why, because I texted my mom several times. I tried to call her once she didn't answer you know i mean i i tried to

400
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Reach out to her.

401
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:01.740
Dianna Jaramillo: She just ignores everything she doesn't text me back. She doesn't anything at all. You know, and, and my Auntie's are like

402
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:11.010
Dianna Jaramillo: You know i i don't care. You know what they do, what my kids did I cannot ever imagine doing something like that to them and that that kind of stuff.

403
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:21.780
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, really makes me think, because the only mother daughter relationship. I know is the one I have with my mother. That's what I know that's that mother relationship.

404
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:31.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Is all I know for that kind of relationship how she treated me how she raised me you know how she brought me up how she loved me so, so, so much.

405
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:42.390
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so many times throughout my life. And then how she could just turn on me so many times to is so freaking confusing.

406
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.720
Dianna Jaramillo: It doesn't make any sense. Like, how could you love me.

407
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:58.170
Dianna Jaramillo: So much and you know be there for me so many times. Was it just, I feel like it was just because I was living with her like that's the only reason she was there for me.

408
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:07.740
Dianna Jaramillo: Or love to me or cared for me so much because the times that I haven't been with her. She thinks I'm out there doing God knows what. I don't know, you know,

409
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.820
Dianna Jaramillo: I caused that I used. I, I, you know, I was a mess for so many years, and

410
00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:20.430
Dianna Jaramillo: And now, ever since then, even though I've been, you know, up until this one last

411
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:29.790
Dianna Jaramillo: Relapse I guess it was I was I was totally clean for eight years before that, you know, and there was. There's no reason

412
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:38.820
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't I it's just so hard for me to, to understand why. How could she loves me so much.

413
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.970
Dianna Jaramillo: And then hate me so much so many, so many different periods of my life.

414
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.620
Dominique Pozo: I you know I'm

415
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.800
Dominique Pozo: Having the spot right now.

416
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.190
Dianna Jaramillo: That the

417
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.040
Dominique Pozo: Time that you actually don't have a vehicle.

418
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.690
Dianna Jaramillo: Even though distract yourself.

419
00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:07.770
Dominique Pozo: The world and engage with it and you don't have a job. It's actually a question time where you can tend to some of these deep things. And I'm wondering if this this next week. You can take the time and write her a letter.

420
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.990
Dominique Pozo: Right along letter and

421
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:18.930
Dominique Pozo: And really, you know, get the things out. You want to get. And because he brought the client, you can really crafted and edit it and say, it just the way you want to say it.

422
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.090
Dianna Jaramillo: That's what I wrote down right here. I wrote that on my picture write a letter.

423
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:32.400
Dominique Pozo: Good. Awesome. Yeah. Great, we're on the same page, I think, you know, there's so much and it's very confusing and I think

424
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:40.500
Dominique Pozo: You know, I, I'm actually wondering, without knowing your mom at all. You know, I'm wondering on her end what's going on for her because this is pretty

425
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:51.270
Dominique Pozo: Confusing behavior. And who knows what's going on for her. Who knows what traumas are getting resurrected for her. What fears. I'm not validating what she's doing at all, but I'm just thinking

426
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.110
Dianna Jaramillo: It's true.

427
00:45:52.380 --> 00:46:05.010
Dominique Pozo: He's having her own experience, and I'm sure she's hurting if if you know if you experience so much love from her as a child. It must, on some level, I don't. I almost don't want to say this because I don't know if it's true but

428
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.220
Dominique Pozo: I

429
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.560
Dominique Pozo: You know her heart is aching

430
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.930
Dominique Pozo: It is way as well.

431
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.110
Dianna Jaramillo: I know it is. I know that is

432
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:20.490
Dianna Jaramillo: That's, that's another part that so confusing. You know, like I i know that she's really hurt.

433
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:31.710
Dianna Jaramillo: Not having me me not being there living in the same house you know as having the same kind of relationship at all that we did it just everything completely changed overnight.

434
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:39.450
Dianna Jaramillo: And I know that it's hurting her. I know that she's really suffered with it. I know she has this last year, you know,

435
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:53.880
Dianna Jaramillo: And, but, but, and you're totally right. She is having her own experience. And she's got other stuff. There's, you know, mental health issues in that whole entire side of the family. I made my grandma had seven daughters. By the time she was 19 years old.

436
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:59.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, she started, she was, she was married to my grandpa 12 years old.

437
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.130
Dianna Jaramillo: He was 18 she had her first daughter at 13

438
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:07.560
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so there was one after another after another and then twins at the end and

439
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:20.220
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, all she did was beat the shit out of them for their whole entire life. She beat them and beat them and beat up. That's all they grew up. So it's like, I understand that part. You know, it's no wonder

440
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:28.770
Dianna Jaramillo: That things are the way they are with her and always have been. It's no wonder it doesn't shock me that she treats me this way.

441
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.880
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, it's

442
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.890
Dianna Jaramillo: It sucks that she could just be

443
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:45.960
Dianna Jaramillo: So amazing and wonderful and raised me with so much love. But the second I make a mistake when I was like 12 years old she completely turned on me and flipped out on me, you know, and that was the first time I was 12

444
00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:58.410
Dianna Jaramillo: When she did that and then again when I was like 15 and then again when I was like 19 or whatever it was, you know, there was like she's done this multiple times. And it's only when i right there.

445
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:08.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Where she can visually you know she sees me and she can see me and have eyes on me and hear me, that's the only time that there was ever that kind of

446
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.620
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, love and make

447
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Trust.

448
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. So she comes from a history of abuse.

449
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.270
Dianna Jaramillo: I had serious abuse.

450
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.960
Dominique Pozo: And mental, you know, mental challenges so

451
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:39.840
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, there's a bigger picture here for sure that I think of letters a good start. And I keep getting a hit to play this, this little blurb. It's a section of a talk for you by a man who actually lives out in New Mexico name to my team practice. Have you ever heard of him.

452
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.390
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't think so. No.

453
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:53.310
Dominique Pozo: So he he actually wrote many books in one book The beautiful book called and and grief and praise and he with the

454
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:57.930
Dominique Pozo: These Indians and what the mama called the tutors, you

455
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.630
Dominique Pozo: Mayans and he he

456
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:15.570
Dominique Pozo: He lived on for years and and in their culture grief is celebrated. It's like this is a natural part of life and they have you know they they weave it no shame and it's done very openly and

457
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.790
Dominique Pozo: And I just, are you, are you willing to hear something for a few minutes.

458
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.070
Dominique Pozo: Absolutely. Okay.

459
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.540
Dominique Pozo: He's great. And he's been through it. I mean, he was he was

460
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:36.240
Dominique Pozo: A political prisoner at one point they were chasing him. He was on the run. He was like, fleeing for life and what the mall. So he's been in

461
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.480
Dominique Pozo: And watched many of his die.

462
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:49.560
Dominique Pozo: So let's see on ado I'm going to do these two that are in total of about five minutes, and we've got

463
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.660
Dianna Jaramillo: Time. So, okay, cool.

464
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.440
Dominique Pozo: So what

465
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:06.450
Dominique Pozo: Is being here. So why you're here, you have to make life so he has to praise life all the time. Oh gosh, I'm playing it for myself. I didn't share it with you.

466
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.940
Dianna Jaramillo: Know, I could I could hear it, though.

467
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.260
Dianna Jaramillo: I was hearing it. Good.

468
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.520
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's

469
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.520
Dominique Pozo: Me. Okay, I'm gonna still i'm going to share it. Maybe that's well that's interesting that you could hear it.

470
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:18.600
Yeah.

471
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:24.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, there it goes.

472
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay, here we go.

473
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:27.060
Yeah.

474
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.030
Dianna Jaramillo: So what's beautiful about life is being

475
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:42.750
Dominique Pozo: Here. So while you're here, you have to make life, life. So he has to praise life all the time and grieving is part of tracing of life, and this will make the spirit fat and which makes them happy.

476
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:44.820
Dianna Jaramillo: To be full effect.

477
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:55.320
For live this fat praising grief. All of this expression, but it's not for its own sake. And when I say grief. I don't think people should sit around. We've been on time, Tom.

478
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.550
And I'm talking about being happy with the glue on smiling say so time

479
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:09.750
Dianna Jaramillo: And talking about doing in a way so that the village holds the people up where they're going through it like we have some people in this room. We have a lot of people in this room got heavy grease this very moment.

480
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:16.740
This very moment and. Well, I mean, we all have it, but some guy little morning every

481
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.960
Morning, they asked for.

482
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.620
And they can't afford to break down.

483
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.830
Dianna Jaramillo: But this has to break

484
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:38.100
Or what's going to happen, their grandchildren going to inherit it in the form of some kind of repression or a disease so often you go to a shaman in the village someone makes divination and new countries.

485
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.670
Solidified sorrow is the tumor.

486
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:52.350
Is called petrified sorrow. If you really translate exactly what it means to be sure. So the sadness turned into a stone, it's not liquid anymore.

487
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:59.400
It's not liquid makes illness concern over the place, I myself like this.

488
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:10.200
Everybody subject to it when I first live in Guatemala and I leave this place the killer 1800 of us was six years, our village alone.

489
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:21.990
All right. People say, Don't you want to go back. Yeah, I want to go back to what was there, but I'm gonna go back to the big pile of dead people in the gras remember my friend was shrapnel in them.

490
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.020
Pay with american tax dollar

491
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.000
One. What am I supposed to hate Americans.

492
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:31.980
The Americans.

493
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:45.840
Americans. Well, I hate was the fact it is people didn't get to be grief because everybody else had to be a neuron when there was being killed. That's where wars are so terrible because don't have time to grieve. That's where someone to hang himself.

494
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.450
killed themselves during worse.

495
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.100
It's not good.

496
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:56.490
It's not good, so that the village is there to make big circle around the people either metaphorically or literally

497
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.030
And they just make sure they don't want their heads.

498
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:11.670
And of course the people are watching Pretty soon get into it too because they got a lot of things to do to I forgot about what's his name or they start remembering about their child that died guy. Last one between my two boys.

499
00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:27.090
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, so when I came up here during the war. I came up here, you know, had to be like, you know, really so much had to watch my backside at $5,000 price in my head of trying to kill my children, my wife, everything is taken from me frozen.

500
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.750
I had to watch everything to watch the law here because the immigration everything finally got it all straightened out but I'm still like this.

501
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:39.360
You know, it's like, you know, one of those little deer know watching out for the

502
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.330
Dianna Jaramillo: New Hampton.

503
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.380
My whole body spying to

504
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.470
My whole this side of my body went under my armpit and asked to sit in my hairline white

505
00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:06.540
And I had to be carried around newburgh and fix it. That take me to shamans and acupuncturist and surgeons and doctors did you remember so campaign on a remember constant, constant pain.

506
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.310
Constant pain. I was telling about myself. And then what happened.

507
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:19.470
To sky tan from Guatemala. This is, I was in New Mexico because from my village. So great someone from the village game.

508
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:31.680
I went to go see him or hear sold out to one of the right wing groups and it came up to me and he says, you know, it's good to see you again. Martin are talking in mind and all this stuff and he says you know I sold out to the right wing groups.

509
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:38.130
I didn't say that. But he said, part of that. And if you come down. I will kill you on the spot right between. I like that.

510
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.410
I was horrified.

511
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.710
And talk like friends here and I go to village gonna kill me.

512
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:50.010
Well, what happened to me this mended me the biggest favor. Anybody ever did in my whole life. He didn't know it.

513
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:55.050
And I'm kicking next time I see him or send the other workers. Somebody already kill him.

514
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.180
But what happened.

515
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.620
So at home and I wept and wept.

516
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:07.410
And wept and wept. There wasn't a dry spine, New Mexico.

517
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:20.610
Honest to God and I drink more water to meet and we and we and we and we and we whip and I was very lucky because I had some industry level with me. My people refuges like us.

518
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:29.700
Who could stand around me and allow me to do that but have been this kingpin all that time and slowly but surely my body and twist to some degree.

519
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.280
I still carry a huge

520
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:34.740
Huge

521
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:52.530
Dominique Pozo: Huge map race for the Journal of the grief enemies that so I know from personal experience how this thing can make you sick. Not just like and inspire everybody knows if you don't cry. Don't you gotta cry when you feel I have been talking about long range. So let me stop there.

522
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:59.100

523
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.700
