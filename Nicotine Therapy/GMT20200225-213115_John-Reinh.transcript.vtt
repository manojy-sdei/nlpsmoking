15
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.130
Alexander Gomez: Oh well. Um, I've been dealing with opiate addiction.

16
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.970
Alexander Gomez: And probably since my knee surgery.

17
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.140
Alexander Gomez: And after that I had this rare skin condition that

18
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.820
Alexander Gomez: That's very painful. It causes me to break out and boils and everything.

19
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.320
Alexander Gomez: So then they said they sent me a Narcos the 10 strong four times a day for 30 days.

20
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.310
Alexander Gomez: So then I was addicted to that for about six months, but then I started dabbling in math and then once I came

21
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.470
Alexander Gomez: To my doctor's appointment with the dirty test. She caught me off.

22
00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:12.150
Alexander Gomez: Well then, I was I've been struggling. Since then, to deal with my mission but then they got me on Suboxone which helped, but then I noticed that, um, I started having these withdrawal symptoms from Suboxone so they switched to dissolve and as well as seems to have a lot better Suboxone

23
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.650
John Reinhart: This is working better

24
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.720
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, it was working a lot better.

25
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.730
John Reinhart: Good, good. Thank you for that, tell me your story with substances.

26
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.440

John Reinhart: That's fantastic. That's really good. Keep up the good work.

31
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.510
John Reinhart: Next question is, when were you first exposed to such

32
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.540
John Reinhart: using drugs.

33
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.680
Alexander Gomez: I'm probably like when I was, let's say 13 years old.

34
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.190
Alexander Gomez: Yeah.

35
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.970
Yeah.

36
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.190
John Reinhart: Pretty normal

37
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.110
John Reinhart: Me too. I think I first started smoking pot. When I was about that age, long time ago.

38
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.460
Alexander Gomez: Yeah yeah

39
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.010
John Reinhart: How did it progress.

40
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.040
Alexander Gomez: Um, well, I started smoking pot like probably in the fifth grade.

41
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:33.060
Alexander Gomez: In elementary school, which is pretty bad, but I didn't like it at first all groggy and I didn't, I didn't feel like going to school and all that.

42
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:55.890
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, just progressed into like middle school and then probably from middle school grew out hype got it progress more I started smoking more pot you know dabbling and cocaine dabbling in mass, but then my messy. You started picking up probably when I was 15 I started doing it more

43
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.480
Alexander Gomez: recreationally then then like on the weekends.

44
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.070
John Reinhart: Yeah, yeah. So God became more of a problem and everything.

45
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.940
Yeah.

46
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.000
John Reinhart: So that's how progress when was it worst for you.

47
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:25.110
Alexander Gomez: Um, probably when I was 18 I was working. I was working at JP video in Napa and I had a full time job and everything. So I would buy like

48
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:39.120
Alexander Gomez: A large amount for the whole two weeks that you know I would work. And then I would get paid again. So I would probably get like an eight Ball every, every week.

49
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.430
John Reinhart: Yeah yeah

50
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.110
John Reinhart: None of that just so vicious cycle. Hmm, let's start skipping like what

51
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.420
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, it was it was it was pretty bad.

52
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.830
Okay.

53
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.490
John Reinhart: What was OK. Now this one is for chronic pain and you do with that right

54
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.360
Alexander Gomez: Yeah.

55
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.330
John Reinhart: What was the persistence precipitating event what caused the the

56
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.690
John Reinhart: The chronic pain to happen.

57
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.760
Alexander Gomez: Well, I have

58
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:30.810
Alexander Gomez: With my knee. I have like no cartilage in my knee so they had a torn meniscus and money so they had to agree and shaved all that meniscus off. So then I had to go through physical therapy and all that. And it seems to hurt more when it's cold at night.

59
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:39.960
Alexander Gomez: So I deal with that and like sometimes. Sometimes it's like step wrong. It feels like my knee almost gives out on me.

60
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.490
John Reinhart: Mm hmm.

61
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:48.180
Alexander Gomez: So I called her walk carefully, or like I'm like riding my bike, I tried to like write smoothly and try not

62
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.340
Alexander Gomez: So much

63
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.530
John Reinhart: So that's primarily your main physical pains that you deal with

64
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.550
Alexander Gomez: Yes, sir.

65
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.770
John Reinhart: Well that's, that's good. That's not, that's something that can be dealt with, right there. So that's good.

66
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.640
John Reinhart: Growing up, what was your family like

67
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:28.860
Alexander Gomez: I'm pretty good. Well, when I was younger. My dad got an A really bad car accident with my brother and sister, he was under the influence of alcohol. So when you gotten that Rick, he ended up doing time in jail in the county jail or quietly years I'd say probably about four years.

68
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.400
Alexander Gomez: Well, so my mom had a raises.

69
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:44.130
Alexander Gomez: All three of us on our own for that amount of time. So she put herself herself through school and everything. While my dad was in jail and

70
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:54.780
Alexander Gomez: But when he got out he was clean and sober for about maybe two years. But then he got back on the wagon. So then he's still drinking. Pretty much every day.

71
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.010
John Reinhart: So that's pretty. One of the reasons you don't drink that is kind of like

72
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.330
Alexander Gomez: What happened. Yeah.

73
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.190
John Reinhart: How old were you when this accident happened with your dad.

John Reinhart: Did anyone in your home life struggle with mental health, substance abuse or food addict or food issues.

86
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.550

87
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.580
Alexander Gomez: Their weight and everything.

88
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.190
Alexander Gomez: I don't really get depressed enough to eat that much.

89
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.640
Yeah.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.010

97
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.150
John Reinhart: Yeah, okay.

98
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.110
John Reinhart: Let's see, uh, what was school like for you.

99
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:17.340
Alexander Gomez: Um, school and elementary and it was kind of hard but I got through that element and Middle School. My kind of floated by the kind of just like past me. I didn't. I was cutting a lot and I didn't really go to school and then once I hit High School.

100
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:26.820
Alexander Gomez: A VINTAGE. It was like so many classes that I couldn't keep up with schoolwork. So they switched me to tennis go

101
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.560
Alexander Gomez: I went to school for like maybe like the four years, but I never graduated

102
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:41.040
John Reinhart: Okay, so you still need to get your GED diploma. Maybe sometime in the future.

103
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.720
John Reinhart: We'll say, okay, what grade did you complete to

104
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.680
Alexander Gomez: That I think the 11th.

105
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.900
John Reinhart: Well, okay, you're not that far away that

106
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.210
John Reinhart: That's, that's good.

107
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.510
John Reinhart: Let's see.

108
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.580
John Reinhart: Do you struggle with any learning disabilities.

109
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.180
Alexander Gomez: And sometimes I'll suffer from like

110
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.490
Alexander Gomez: I don't know dyslexia like I'll read words wrong.

111
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.890
Alexander Gomez: Yes, I will read it backwards like sometimes it's hard to focus on words.

112
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:26.910
John Reinhart: That's not uncommon at all uncommon at all. I have a good friend of mine. He's a, he's a doctor. As a matter of fact, he's dyslexic. A lot of lot of bright people are

113
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:37.230
John Reinhart: They see words or letters different in in the words. So that's something you could overcome. You know, it's, it's, but that's good to know.

114
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:50.940
John Reinhart: Were there any events that stood out to you, growing up either in your neighborhood family or friends. I think you mentioned one earlier that your dad getting in the automobile accident.

115
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.090
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, there's been from life.

116
00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:07.320
Alexander Gomez: When my wife left me. She took she took both of my kids with her and moved across state. So she pretty much left me for another guy.

117
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:20.730
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, she was lying to me for like three years about it the whole time. When you finally did leave. She did take both my kids and they're really young. They were about six years old, six and five years old.

118
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:31.980
Alexander Gomez: So when she left, she took them both. So then, the first time I got to see him since then was a few summers ago so my kids now are 16 and 15

119
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:44.490
Alexander Gomez: In a while but we finally got we've got the divorce and everything so she promised to have the kids come see me last night, but she hasn't kept that problems.

120
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:53.610
John Reinhart: But I think that lot of times it seems like it'll be the kids. I want to know about their dad or their mom that they've never seen and

121
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.400
John Reinhart: You know, might be till they're 20 or something or who knows but you know

122
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:11.370
John Reinhart: That's very cool that you have a couple of kids and you know that while they're there, and they're teenagers. Now, so they're going through, you know, you know, we remember what it was like to be a teenager, so

123
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.790
John Reinhart: Going on. When you're that age.

124
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.830
John Reinhart: Or, let's see.

125
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.790
John Reinhart: Did you ever serve in the military.

126
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:21.930
No.

127
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.650
John Reinhart: Okay, do you have any financial or legal issues you are concerned about

128
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:38.760
Alexander Gomez: Um, no, I'm just trying to right now. I'm still looking for a job. I'm still on planet, but I'm pretty on a job before I run out of it.

129
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.880
John Reinhart: Okay, cool. What type of work you do.

130
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:54.690

131
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:01.860

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.980
Alexander Gomez: Yeah, well, they had me working like

133
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:14.220
Alexander Gomez: Pretty much full time when I first started and I asked for a part time. So, and it was a while since I've worked. So my body wasn't used to it.

134
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.000
John Reinhart: Yeah.

135
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:23.070
Alexander Gomez: And I got real sick at work. And they were like, no, you can't be calling in. It's not up in your 90 days. Yeah, so they had to let me go.
