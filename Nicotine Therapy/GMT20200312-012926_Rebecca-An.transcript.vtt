00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, hello.

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.929
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.300
ethant: I'm doing alright

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.599
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So sorry about being late.

5
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:30.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No problem. I wound up having some two people at six o'clock. And so I just, I knew that her, she would be quick. So I, you know, got through with her, how are things going for you.

6
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.990
ethant: Freezer okay I've been kind of

7
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're tired.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.750
Yeah.

9
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.180
ethant: I guess I've been like I was really I felt like I was really depressed. Last time we talked, and I think I'm less depressed, but I'm still a little depressed and I've been

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.050
ethant: There's been, I've been pretty anxious

11
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.670
ethant: I took the Klonopin a couple days over the weekend and then I stopped taking it.

12
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.850
ethant: It helped when I took it for sure.

13
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

14
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.530
ethant: So yeah, I don't know.

15
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.460
ethant: I think you asked me to try to figure out if my depression was like situation or if it was because of the medication.

16
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

17
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.460
ethant: It's kind of hard to figure out. Because the world is so crazy. I did you hear the news.

18
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

19
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.740
ethant: The President was just on the TV half an hour half an hour ago at six o'clock, and he's barring all travel from Europe to the United States effective Friday.

20
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

21
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.900
ethant: Because of the coronavirus

22
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

23
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and that's going to help

24
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.990
ethant: I think his ideas that

25
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:09.210
ethant: There have been more bigger outbreaks detected in Europe, but it's actually kind of funny. The reason is that they've been doing more testing over there. But we don't have enough kits. So we don't know how bad the spread is here already.

26
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.170
ethant: It's probably just as bad if not worse as it is in Europe, but we don't know, but his reaction is to to

28
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Put up a wall.

29
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Basically

30
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that'll solve it all.

31
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it's true. And I read something the other day that said that

32
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Women are carriers could be possibly be carriers of it, hmm. Um,

33
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I read that my email.

34
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.240
ethant: I haven't heard about that.

35
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.110
Yeah.

36
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't even remember because I keep getting these alerts about it in my email and I'll read a little bit

37
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and sometimes it catches my eyes, sometimes it doesn't. But

38
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then they explain what the symptoms were and that it takes about 14 days before it actually hits full force.

39
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so

40
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it, but I don't get it because it's already here.

41
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.490
ethant: Yeah, the travel restriction. Yeah, I don't know.

42
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.520
ethant: The only thing that

43
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.990
ethant: That I think the the countries that have been successful in

44
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.020
ethant: Like slowing down the spread enough have done basically shut the whole country down like

45
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.550
ethant: You know, serious social distancing stuff like no big events.

46
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.100
ethant: Like basically cancel all social gatherings.

47
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: social gatherings public transportation. Yeah.

48
00:03:48.240 --> 00:04:01.710
ethant: We haven't done. We haven't done that and so that that's not good because that probably means that we're going to have an exponential growth as we did start detecting it better and that's going to mean that our hospitals are going to get overwhelmed and and

49
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.460
ethant: And then the people who are sick aren't gonna be able to all get treated. So that's kind of

50
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: stressing me out a little bit.

51
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's like that someplace else right now to

52
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where the hospitals were overwhelmed and

53
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.130
ethant: Yeah, Italy, it's

54
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.050
ethant: So Italy is shut down. I don't know if you heard about that.

55
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.700
ethant: Like they basically closed down the whole country.

56
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:40.560
ethant: Like it's it's sort of like martial law like no one's allowed to leave, leave their house unnecessarily. So the whole country because the they had that

57
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:51.180
ethant: They detected the exponential growth of the virus and now they're in the situation where the doctors have to decide like who lives and who dies because they don't have enough medical equipment to

58
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.580
ethant: treat everybody that has it.

59
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Yeah.

60
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a horrible place to be.

61
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.280
ethant: Yeah, I know. And that's what we're the United States is sort of

62
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.170
The

63
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:13.380
ethant: Based on what we've done so far, we were heading that direction. So we'll see if because we haven't limited that so like I'm

64
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:24.210
ethant: Taiwan. I think some countries outside of China. What is it, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, they, they all reacted really seriously and introduced and

65
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.620
ethant: Basically told everyone. Don't go to work, close all the schools and they took a really drastic measures immediately.

66
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:40.530
ethant: stop the spread of the virus, because we're in the period now where it's probably spread around everywhere. But since we've only tested a couple thousand people. We don't know.

67
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.140
ethant: How bad how, you know,

68
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About it really is yet.

69
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you would think watching and knowing that it was going to come to this country that we would have be started getting prepared.

70
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, you know,

71
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the beginning, instead of

72
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.240
Stopping travel

73
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

74
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:10.590
ethant: I don't know how the travel thing is interesting and CNN is going over here. Not that it's great, a great news source, but I just heard the President was going to be on. So I turned it on.

75
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.830
ethant: And anyway.

76
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.370
ethant: That's kind of in the background.

77
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:31.440
ethant: All the coronavirus stuff and then on a day to day I'm just like getting a dealing with the stress, the stress explosion constant stress or explosion at work for one reason or another.

78
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.540
ethant: And then

79
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.240
ethant: Yeah, I don't know, I feel like

80
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.560
ethant: So I guess it is sort of situational depression but it almost seems appropriate because things are so crazy.

81
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

82
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you mean by the stress explosion at work.

83
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.150
ethant: Well, it's just a

84
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:07.590
ethant: We've talked about it like because of my job is ending and the company needs me. But they don't. And they don't really know what they're doing. And I'm kind of getting juggled back and forth like

85
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.470
ethant: I don't know, like every morning I wake up this morning I woke up and there was a security incident and the

86
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.490
ethant: Lead security guy was too busy with something so he couldn't investigate it. And so suddenly that became my problem.

87
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.150
ethant: And then somebody else needed help, learning how to do their job, which is

88
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.470
ethant: On the only one that knows anything about it. So I like half of my day got sucked up unexpectedly sort of talking to this person.

89
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:50.370
ethant: And then I'm kind of scrambling to catch up. And then I have this huge audit that I'm running which supposedly is my full time thing. So I kind of scrambled to catch up with that. And then I don't know every day is just sort of like that so

90
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now it's just

91
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:58.020
ethant: I mean, it's just work it just the situation is so weird compared to my usual steady

92
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.890
ethant: Job that I'm used to, you know,

93
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, yeah, which probably is a huge weight.

94
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stress. Yep. You know, I know that.

95
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being mentally tired is definitely

96
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be more tiresome than being physically tired Yeah, you know, so

97
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's probably a big piece of it. Yeah, I'm sure you know how is your dinner. How was your and your wife's dinner the other night.

98
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:44.250
ethant: Oh, that was, that was nice like things are really sweet with Lillian, that was another thousand that was sort of one of the areas of my life that was also

99
00:08:45.990 --> 00:09:00.150
ethant: When my stress was probably the worst was when things seemed rocky with her but I kind of had a little not confrontation, but a serious conversation with her. I took you know she realized how sad and stress that I was and how

100
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:09.780
ethant: The things that were going on with her and her video game and everything was sort of contributing to it and she she kind of came around in a big way so that that was really good.

101
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.800
ethant: And she apologized for escaping into her game as much as she has been and she's been really like

102
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.610
ethant: President and really sort of supportive and sweet and everything. So that's good.

103
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. You need that. Yep.

104
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you guys had a great time.

105
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.300
ethant: Yeah, so we had a good dinner. And also, I don't know if I caught you up on my so I finally had the face to face with the boss.

106
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.130
ethant: This is so this is after I found out that they're not extending my contract anymore.

107
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.360
ethant: Or

108
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they're not extending my contract.

109
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:52.260
ethant: So yeah, I finally had the face to face meeting with him, which was good. And he kind of it was weird. The way that he presented it was like

110
00:09:53.340 --> 00:10:03.870
ethant: We could kind of what we will, we could work with you forever, but I can't have these guys depending on you forever. So the way he presented it it's like they're cutting off their they're using this

111
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.620
ethant: My departure as like the final deadline, where that the company has to get its act together to learn how to do what I do.

112
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.090
ethant: You know what I mean.

113
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

114
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:22.800
ethant: It's kind of like a ripping the band aid off thing. So, and I guess that makes sense. I don't know how much of that is like he's he's, uh,

115
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.790
ethant: How much of that is like politics or, you know, he's just trying to present it in a way where I'll feel the best about it but

116
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so when did he give you an estimate of time.

117
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.140
ethant: Yeah, so my job. It sounds like is is a

118
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:53.640
ethant: Pretty is that so they don't have any what he said was, they don't have any intentions of ending the contract early. So what that means is that I have until July and the end of June.

119
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

120
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.810
ethant: So I basically have

121
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.210
ethant: March, April, May, June four more months. All right.

122
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: April, May, June, because we're yeah

123
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.860
ethant: So three and a half months three and a half months of this nice salary and

124
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.360
ethant: I'm like, if I wanted to, I could try to accelerate it myself.

125
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:26.190
ethant: So if I want to try to go for this job. This is what I have to figure out. Next, I kind of told the other company that they have a specific opening that might be a good fit for me.

126
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.010
ethant: But they're also interviewing other people. So if I want to go for that, then I would have to be willing to leave.

127
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.110
My current gig.

128
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:43.320
ethant: So on the one hand, I'd be it'd be hard to leave in two weeks without kind of leaving them in a bad position and, on the other hand, they're paying me all this money.

129
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:53.790
ethant: That I it's unlikely. I'm going to make the same amount they did, you know, day to day and my next job. It's kind of to my advantage to try to find a job that will

130
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.970
ethant: Start in

131
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.250
ethant: In probably in the month of June, or even ideally at the end of it you know

132
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. You know, in July.

133
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you've got to talk to this other company and just, you know, throw it out there and just tell them you know you want to do it. You want to switch. But, you know, because

134
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:28.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of your work ethics, you really want to see this through, you know, till the end of June, and if they're still interested that, you know, then you guys can reevaluate it but

135
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, just be true to to who you are and you know what I mean and and just lay it out there. Yeah, and you know they're either gonna, you know, be happy that you did.

136
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And wait for you and make sure that you come on, you know what I mean. Because I does show

137
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: work ethics some

138
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, integrity work ethics and that you care about. You know what you do. Yeah, you know,

139
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to think about.

140
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:06.000
ethant: Yeah. So I've already told them most. They already have the most of those little details. I just haven't

141
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:17.670
ethant: With the door that I opened was maybe I could leave early or even sort of suggested maybe they kind of want me to leave early. And so that's what I know that I haven't told them is that no they don't want me to leave early.

142
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.920
ethant: If I were to leave early. I would be

143
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.810
ethant: Potentially, putting them in a bad situation. So that's what I have to

144
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let them know that will know that. Yeah. And you're going to get a severance package that wouldn't hurt for you to tell them that it's also, you know, a huge financial loss for you.

145
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

146
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because what I know is sometimes

147
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If they you know if they're willing to hold on, they'll

148
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They'll compensate you know

149
00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.120
ethant: Yeah, that would be tough, if they if they said oh just screw him. Oh, you know, I don't think that they would play that game.

150
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some real because

151
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because they want somebody that's loyal and has integrity. You know what I mean. Yeah, so they're not going to want you to do that.

152
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would hope.

153
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They wouldn't want him to that I have to stop thinking about that because there's

154
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:24.810
ethant: There are some places like Uber, for example, they're just ruthless, they would if they wanted to hire me. They would they would try to outbid the company.

155
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.940
ethant: They will try to outbid the

156
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.100
ethant: The retention package from the other company to get me to ditch them immediately and like

157
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All's fair in love anymore, right, we're

158
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.610
ethant: That's how they grew so fast is that they have that ruthless

159
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.130
Sort of

160
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.100
ethant: Grow at all costs, kind of attitude.

161
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.040

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:13.080
ethant: So, so I guess I sat up in bed, several times last night, Lily always points this out sometimes like it's kind of like almost like sleepwalking except for I don't get out of bed.

165
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:21.840
ethant: It's like I wake up and I realized that I'm like sitting up in bed like on the edge of the bed. Sometimes I'm sitting there vaporizing like all vaporizing my sleep.

166
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.330
ethant: So,

167
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.270
ethant: Yeah. So I did that last night, I guess I'm sleeping sort of so so

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stress relieving

172
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:03.750
ethant: You know, I don't do that. It's like deliberately, as part of a program, but I just sort of happened to do it. I think I did it last night. Yeah, I drink tea sometimes

173
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:05.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

174
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.690
ethant: It's not like a regimen. I just, I like to drink tea so

175
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Varies I think we talked about it before, but there is these

176
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's the certainties that help promote sleep. Yep.

177
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.610
ethant: Valerian Root

178
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.250
ethant: That's one that I haven't started doing

179
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:33.330
ethant: Really, it kind of wants to see us about that once in a while to maybe I'll get some I'll put that on the shopping list tea with Valerian

180
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.640

ethant: Um,

184
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.980
ethant: It's funny now that I feel like I'm all grown up.

185
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.600
ethant: It's just like, Yeah, everything's stressful and

186
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:13.710
ethant: chaotic and scary, but it just sort of life. So I feel like I'm sort of managing but you know

187
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.710
ethant: I don't feel like I'm

188
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.470
ethant: You know, totally happy and comfortable or anything.

189
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.570
ethant: But I don't know. I should expect to be

190
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that you have a lot of there was a lot of what ifs hanging and a lot of work that was sitting in front of you.

191
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and a lot of anxiety and stress around things that were going on.

192
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That have been going on. And it seems like

193
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One by one, they're kind of resolving. Yeah, right.

194
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.990
ethant: Yeah, that's true, like things are

195
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:56.850
ethant: Better things were rocky with my wife and other better and things were unclear with my position and now it's clear.

196
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:09.270
ethant: I have that huge deadline that I kind of that I eventually finally finished. And of course, now there's just the next deadline. But that's just going to keep going, that chaos is just going to happen as long as I'm

197
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.410
ethant: Any maybe forever, but at least while I'm at this company.

198
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.430
Right.

199
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have a new deadline for something else. Now,

200
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:26.580
ethant: Pretty much, yeah. I mean, it's like I have a here I have a huge amount of work that I know have to get done.

201
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:36.810
ethant: And we're having this audit, but you know these things go. It's like the audit is supposed to wrap up on this week, but if

202
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:43.950
ethant: Oh, I just actually found out today that because of the coronavirus the auditor cancel this flight. So the whole thing is going to be remote anyway.

203
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.530
Um,

204
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.640
ethant: It's one of those deals where they're going to go through and check that we're up to.

205
00:18:51.900 --> 00:19:00.540
ethant: We're compliant on there's like I forget two or 300 separate detailed requirements of these rules that you have to be you have to follow.

206
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.970
ethant: And so they're going to check them all, but then some of them. If we're like, oh yeah, we're working on that right now. You kind of

207
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.280
ethant: You

208
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:15.660
ethant: You get to you get a pass because you're actively working on being compliant instead of actually being compliant.

209
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah.

210
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.950
ethant: So anyway, we'll just sort of find our way through. And that's what we did last year.

211
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's coming up.

212
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:31.410
ethant: The auditor is coming on the the week of the 30th. So that's like, wow, that's like two, two and a half weeks away.

213
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, half weeks away.

214
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.460
ethant: And basically have like hundreds of little

215
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:44.580
ethant: Documents and stuff. I need to organize in preparation for him for the auditor. Oh, and I have to. We have a penetration test.

216
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.110
ethant: Which I'm going to get the results for. So yeah, there's just a lot to do with

217
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.740
Me.

218
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, which I think is a big

219
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is a big piece of your stress and as a big piece of

220
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your restless mind at night.

221
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.540
You know,

222
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to find a way to be able to release it and

223
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get back into that room sleep, you know,

224
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your mind has got to be able to relax to, you know,

225
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:20.850
ethant: One thing I have been

226
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:29.130
ethant: Doing better than I used to have been worse at times than I am now that I am able to, like, it's like I work until I

227
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.830
ethant: meet the goals that I laid out for the day and then I try to stop working and stop thinking about work.

228
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:42.750
ethant: So my mind maybe keeps racing, but at least I'm not I, I used to just keep working.

229
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.940
ethant: And then I would get into the cycle where I would get so tired that you know, it kind of grind to a halt on still trying to work and

230
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.610
ethant: So, at least I'm not doing that.

231
00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Well, that's good. Mm hmm. You know, you're setting, learning how to set boundaries with yourself for that. Yep. What about going and

232
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: hanging out at the sauna or

233
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, being able to, if you don't feel like exercising or working but just going in sitting in the in a sauna for a little bit, you know,

234
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting a virus at the

235
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.140
ethant: Song, but I would get in my own tub. That's a good idea.

236
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your okay your own tab.

237
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.390
ethant: I haven't taken the time at home in like years and years.

238
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good idea. Do you have a big tub.

239
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.150
ethant: To big enough to take a tub Lily are getting there all the time. I just never do it. So it's even clean

240
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say, there you go. You can do it right at home and just relax. You can do what

241
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: really where a lot of women. Do you know, and a lot of guys do. I can't just you know say it's just winning. But, you know, just kind of put on some

242
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Put on some music.

243
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, some happy music

244
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feel good music, you know, your version of what that is.

245
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you want to put some smelly aroma therapy going on in there too, you know.

246
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

247
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.450
ethant: My mom gave me a serenity candle or something. So that'll work for

248
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:31.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: aroma therapy and you know what I mean, you've got to talk to yourself in your head and breathe and don't forget to breathe. Remember to breathe. Yeah.

249
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, no, it's a huge piece of it and just really kind of release all that stuff out of your mind while you're

250
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know in your bath and when you go to bed. You just got to keep telling yourself. I'm not going to think about work. Yeah, I need to relax. It's time to breathe, you know, yeah, you can play, you can definitely practice mindfulness while you're in the bath.

251
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:53.820
ethant: Yeah.

252
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.810

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah.

254
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:09.180
ethant: Yeah, I can just focus on my breath. Yeah, I know you did stuff like that. I've done a lot like a meditation guru, but I know the basics.

255
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay that's mindfulness to

256
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember with DVD DVD, but it, it definitely helps you get out of the stressful, you know, thoughts that are in your head or even in your subconscious that you don't even know where they're obviously there's a lot going on, you know, you know,

257
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.550

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: dialectical behavior therapy.

259
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.310

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being mindful mindfulness

263
00:23:47.670 --> 00:24:01.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why, why is mind making sure that you're not making decisions and reacting out of an emotional mind or a logical mind. But really, that you're you're balancing both of those and making decisions out of a wise mind.

264
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's radical acceptance. You know, I love that one to emotion regulation, you know, DVD has a lot of

275
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.090
It's all the same.

276
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.700
ethant: Yeah, it's kind of amazing variety of

277
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.650
ethant: Just living out of learning how to live.

278
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.120
ethant: Or learn learning of

279
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, learning how to live and developing these coping skills that we never knew how to react and respond to things that happen in our life, you know,

280
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So check it out.

281
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:29.070
ethant: Hey, what's up, I will. I wrote it down. What, what's up with Mary I heard she is she still quarantined or she was on a cruise ship or something.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I haven't heard from her yet so i don't know i don't know i'm going to email her though and and give us Mary wellness check and see what's up with her. I definitely weren't married

283
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:52.170
ethant: If it was the same cruise ship I heard that, that it was like, stuck outside of the San Francisco band, and they finally let it more in Oakland somewhere.

284
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.990
ethant: And maybe people got off and they had to go into quarantine or something. I don't remember the details.

285
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, I read an article on it too. And what it said was 22 people that out of the people that they tested tested positive and 19 of them worked on the cruise ship.

286
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.580
ethant: That's right. Yep. It was all the people that are mainly people that worked on the cruise ship.

287
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is scary.

288
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.760
ethant: Well, they, they live in these really cramped conditions. It kind of makes sense.

289
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

290
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.320
ethant: They're all together in this sweaty little

291
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.730
ethant: Corner say

292
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:39.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how many times do they, you know, continually drop people off and pick people up people off and pick people up. Yeah, but I, my understanding that they are there quarantine to the boat to the ship.

293
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.610
ethant: Oh,

294
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what I read on that article. I was like, Oh, those poor people.

295
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.520
Yes, somebody

296
00:26:48.540 --> 00:27:00.180
ethant: Some infectious disease expert looked at the one you know because they did the same thing in Japan, there is that cruise ship that had hundreds of cases. And they made everybody stay on the cruise ship the healthy and the sick people.

297
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:13.650
ethant: And then some doctor came out saying it was like the worst possible thing to do because there's no the cruise ship is so cramped that there's no way to like isolate the spread. So you're basically like

298
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.170
ethant: Making a subset cesspool of

299
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.680
ethant: spreading it around like everybody is on the ship.

300
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:31.260
ethant: And then that that that's basically as far as I can tell, that's how the community spread started in California. I don't know how the one started in Washington. But from that cursor in Japan.

301
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:43.950
ethant: They flew the, the State Department flew to arrow two planes and people. One of them went to or maybe both of them went to Travis Air Force Base, which is up in fair, you know, Fairfield, it's between

302
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.730
ethant: here in Sacramento.

303
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:58.230
ethant: And then just today there is this news piece about how people that worked in the quarantine unit were talking about how the workers were totally not trained on

304
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:06.690
ethant: preventing the spread. So the workers went and like interacted with the people who are in quarantine and then went out into the community and then what do you know like

305
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:15.750
ethant: Two weeks later, somebody at an old folks home comes down with in this right. It was literally like 10 miles away from the Air Force Base, somebody comes down with

306
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.400
ethant: The virus.

307
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.710
ethant: So they haven't gotten out said that's what happened. But it seems pretty

308
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.360
ethant: Obvious that's what that's what happened.

309
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if it was something that you know your I did it would definitely be all over the place. But there was their mistake. No, keep it quiet and that piece, you know, do you are you working remotely. Are you still going into the office.

310
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.730
ethant: So it's funny. I've been

311
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.780
ethant: It really, it started because

312
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.260
ethant: I

313
00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:09.600
ethant: Have one other guy on my team. He started. He likes to work from home. So we both started working from home a lot. This is like a month ago. Um, are you know because the company is getting absorbed into this other company like we downscaled are downsized our office to this crappy like

314
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.240
ethant: We weren't kind of place.

315
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:26.970
ethant: And then we're really, really busy in the morning because it's the end of Germany's day so however early we wake up or just slammed immediately when we were out of bed. So, it kept happening was, I was just busy. Like, I worked non stop.

316
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:33.780
ethant: From the moment I grow out of bed until about noon. And so I just kept on doing that and I ended up staying at home.

317
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:46.560
ethant: Because I didn't really have any important meetings that I heard when I did, I would go downtown. But when I almost every day, I was just scrambling to keep up for the morning

318
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:56.940
ethant: So, and then, and then the virus came around, so I'm like this is probably good that I'm reducing my exposure, like, yeah, I forget on the train. I don't have to

319
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:12.390
ethant: Face or, you know, being on the crowded restaurants and their crappy workspace downtown softness and then finally today as a lot of companies are doing my company announced that everybody's working from home officially starting next week.

320
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

321
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just make sense.

322
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.030
ethant: Doing it I was ahead of the curve.

323
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're ahead of the curve. Well, yeah. And it definitely protects you from

324
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting sick, you know. Yeah.

325
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.930
ethant: Yeah, because I'm old enough, and I have like enough health that like I am.

326
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:44.880
ethant: Like people who are in their 50s, 60s and 70s with health problems are definitely at risk. I'm in my 40s with like quite, you know, I don't know if I'd consider myself.

327
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.370
ethant: Totally healthy

328
00:30:50.070 --> 00:31:01.740
ethant: Yeah, you know, what do they say people with pre existing conditions there, but they're always talking about people with heart problems or respiratory problems, which I don't have any that I'm aware of. So

329
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or that smoke. Yeah, that's true, or baby.

330
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.930
ethant: A baby. Yeah, probably.

331
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, it just lowers. You know what I mean, it just lowers the immune system and you

332
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can it constricts the blood flow. Yeah.

333
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's a piece of it too.

334
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:30.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, you probably are in that in that category, just based off that right you know

335
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.550
ethant: Better to not get exposed, if I can.

336
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Avoid yeah if you can avoid it definitely

337
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

338
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:45.540
ethant: A little worried about my wife, because when she's been working less because she's trying to sell her restaurant to her business partner. So she's like

339
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.940
ethant: Goes down. There's just as little as she can get away with. But when she goes there. She's exposed to a ton of people. It's a restaurant.

340
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's like

341
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.940
ethant: Probably if if she gets sick, I'm going to get sick.

342
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.290
ethant: And that's probably how it will happen if we if we do get sick.

343
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.950
ethant: Because other than that, I just go to the supermarket and that's about it.

344
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And you guys still got to be careful, even at the supermarket gotta wipe off the cart and, you know,

345
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't touch anything.

346
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's messed up every time.

347
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:28.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Myself and my husband go out. Yes. What he says don't do anything. Don't touch the door, don't touch this. I don't

348
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, but I get it. You know what I mean, trying to be cautious and not bring something home.

349
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

350
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She has a restaurant.

351
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I likes

352
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.760
ethant: Yep. Yeah, I've been

353
00:32:51.090 --> 00:33:00.210
ethant: Trying to impress on her how serious the viruses. She's not much of a of a mean everybody follows social media and stuff. So everybody basically

354
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.870
ethant: Gets the get some level of news but

355
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:13.050
ethant: She is from Ukraine, so she like English is their second language and she's not a huge reader.

356
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

357
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:23.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Explain to me why everybody is buying out the toilet paper and paper towels at Costco.

358
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is that about, I think it's just

359
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.290
ethant: The doomsday people

360
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.340
ethant: Like they're there for seeing the

361
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.750
ethant: Like people are freaking out because the

362
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:46.800
ethant: They're concerned that the the distribution systems are going to start to fall apart like if enough people are sick that they can't drive the trucks, then who's going to bring

363
00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:53.460
ethant: You know, driving the truck to Stockton. The, the grocery store and

364
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But they're they're specifically honing in on toilet paper.

365
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And paper towels.

366
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

367
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.950
ethant: I don't know. I guess that's

368
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:17.550
ethant: Like that is a thing that you need to stock up on, I would think that they would also be like non perishable food like probably if you try to find cam food can beam or something that would be sold.

369
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.290
ethant: Sold out

370
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just amazes me, you know, kind of funny.

371
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:31.770
ethant: I can even probably show you, you see our that's like a industrial sized hand sanitizer.

372
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, nice. Yeah.

373
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:42.900
ethant: I was happy that Lily, I had that she brought it home from work because they bought it for the restaurant or I guess they bought a couple of them. So she was able to bring on home.

374
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's probably I would just

375
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:52.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Assume and based off of that bottle of hand sanitizer. You just shepherd me

376
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that is, she's pretty on top of

377
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, washing her hands and wiping up and cleaning up after you know

378
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.740
ethant: Yeah. The restaurant is pretty clean their shoes very into like

379
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:11.610
ethant: You know she learned all about the health codes and because they have the score that they get from that, from the health inspector.

380
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:21.480
ethant: And anything where there's a score or like a competition and like a rating involved. She's like, really Kimberly and do it. So that's why I'm too.

381
00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:32.040
ethant: And she also likes to buy stuff. So they when they built the restaurant they bought everything that you can buy at Restaurant Supply. That's probably why they had the big hand sanitizer.

382
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.990
ethant: We need to buy this.

383
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's funny. That's cool. Yeah.

384
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

385
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.170
So,

386
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can't even like promote you know I'm sitting here thinking, and I'm like, what do you need to do to help your help your depression right now. Well,

387
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't. It is too high of a risk for you to go to the

388
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. So whatever you do, you have to be able to do kind of at home. Right, right.

389
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.390
ethant: So the bathtub is a great idea. I could also

390
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.220
ethant: I could also do an online yoga course.

391
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.510
ethant: I have done those in the past. I haven't done one recently.

392
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I took an idea.

393
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:32.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely you need to get some sun too. Yeah, you have a garden audio.

394
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:45.090
ethant: And not really I we have a crappy little back walkway. I do, though. I like go out and walk, you know, end up going to the store or something every day. So I like it's not like I'm a complete shut in

395
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but I know that I'm

396
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just standing in the sun, a little bit.

397
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Helps the UV rays helps with vitamin D levels.

398
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: low vitamin D levels can cause extreme tiredness can cause you to feel more depressed than normal. Yeah, you know what

399
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:19.680
ethant: It's interesting. So you've gotten to know me over video chat, just in this period when I've gone from like being a serious message to a little bit better. So I don't know. Was it seemed like I got better. And then I fell into a slump or something like that.

400
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I just think that you're

401
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Using tired.

402
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, I don't think that you seem for me. You don't seem depressed. You're telling me that you're that you're feeling depressed, but what I see is just tired, you know that you're a little tired.

403
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what I witness. Interesting. Okay.

404
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.260
ethant: Yeah, so I got to work on my quality of sleep. You know what I would help.

405
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.240
ethant: I bet is if I stopped vaporizing at like

406
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.740
ethant: 9pm because of nicotine is like a stimulant.

407
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.440
ethant: So, if I could, I bet if I could get through that, if I can.

408
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.770
ethant: Make a commitment to myself until like

409
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.660
ethant: This to stay away from the vaporizer I'd probably sleep more more

410
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.610
More

411
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: soundly soundly.

412
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:33.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, try getting in a hot a hot bubble bath, you know, with aroma therapy going on. And, you know, you really got to work on releasing the stress, you know, so that your body can

413
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Energize itself, while you're sleeping. You know, that's when it does its most work you know when we're sleeping when the healing happens

414
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.160
Right.

415
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.230
ethant: recharging

416
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.820
ethant: Yeah, and it does feel like I've been missing out on that.

417
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:58.500
ethant: Like I wake up after sleeping and I feel like I could sleep for 10 more hours, you know,

418
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you taking any sleeping meds.

419
00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:07.410
ethant: I take melatonin. But not every night. I take it pretty regularly. The

420
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long have you been taking melatonin.

421
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.360
ethant: Years.

422
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:19.620
ethant: Okay. I mean, I could try not taking it. I've been taking it long enough that. And who knows, maybe that's one of the things that makes me sleepy.

423
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that

424
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are some sleep medications that make you feel

425
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: groggy, you know what I mean. The next day, and

426
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:41.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they do their job at night, but in the daytime, you feel tired all day. So like, yeah.

427
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's either getting less sleep or rest asleep versus being tired, are they, you know, all day. What do you do, yeah.

428
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

429
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:57.450
ethant: I took the colonic in a couple days in a row. And usually I don't do that was like over the weekend, I think.

430
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:09.990
ethant: And then I stopped taking it. So it's been like two days since I took it, so you'd think well maybe I'll feel group. Maybe it's a guy could be part of the tiredness that you're seeing as I'm like on that roller coaster.

431
00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And what about, um, you're still eating healthy

432
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.650
ethant: I feel like I'm eating pretty well. Yeah, okay.

433
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't get enough water.

434
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:29.970
ethant: I only drink carbonated water so I could probably do better on the water on it tomorrow.

435
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.980
ethant: So I remember

436
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.270
ethant: Funny or like my life coach as much as therapist is

437
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.120
ethant: Just checking in on all these little things.

438
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, because they they all of them contribute to

439
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How we function right

440
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your constipation is cleared up.

441
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:23.850
ethant: And how that's funny. And it seems like I like I there's a couple days where I was really normal and then I stopped going again even though I'm like I'm eating pretty pretty steadily and I'm taking the same concentration meds pretty steadily.

442
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

443
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:31.920
ethant: It's not as bad at the beginning, it was like, I wouldn't go for five or six days and it's nothing like that. It's like I don't go for a day or two.

444
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, then I'll go again.

445
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, because I know that whenever it's prolonged it can cause you to be real sluggish, too. Yeah, you know, so you have to really monitor that and be careful with that. Yeah, you know, um, do you take any vitamins.

446
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:59.040
ethant: Vitamins, no. I feel like I take a lot of medication that I don't take any vitamins, per se, other than the

447
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.860
ethant: Melatonin if that counts as a vitamin. And then I take mural X in the morning and it takes center.

448
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.740
Which is a conservation thing.

449
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But no vitamin D or vitamin C or anything like that.

450
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that vitamin D.

451
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Could possibly help

452
00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.350
ethant: Vitamin D. Okay.

453
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.610
ethant: I'll read up or I'll check it out.

454
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To see what the benefits are for vitamin D.

455
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where I

456
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where I lived out in Oregon was on the coast and, you know, right in the Washington

457
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oregon kind of border like it was one bridge to get to one state to the other. And it was the highest suicide rate up there.

458
00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And part of it was because it rains so much that the center's NUMBER OUT AND I'M SO PEOPLE vitamin D levels were dropping

459
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so they would get depressed. And of course, you know, thinking straight to mental health that it could be a vitamin deficiency, you know, and so people if they were backed up. They can see people and so it would get so bad that, you know, people would

460
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, kill themselves because

461
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:34.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then they figured out that, you know, the constant rain, the lack of sun.

462
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really drops the vitamin D levels, which can cause that level so

463
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you're inside and you work in an office when you do go out. You know what I mean. So maybe that could help a little bit too. Yeah.

464
00:43:54.180 --> 00:44:05.130
ethant: Yeah, I was on a roll walking so my sister and her two kids live close by and my mom goes over there. A couple times a week. So like help to be like the daytime.

465
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.170
ethant: Child Care.

466
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.340
ethant: I was on a roll. Walking with them, but I didn't do that this week.

467
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.050
ethant: So yeah, I should call and see what's up.

468
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.240
ethant: Getting in touch with mom.

469
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how did you feel after you walked

470
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:24.750
ethant: I always feel. I mean, it's not like it dramatically changed me and feels nice to

471
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.680
ethant: Be in the sun or, you know, if it's sunny.

472
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.480
ethant: And to get a little, you know, walk up a hill and get a little exercise.

473
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:45.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, even something, you know, like that. Can you can definitely benefit from, you know, know will help, but just keep. Are you still journaling. Yep.

474
00:44:46.410 --> 00:45:00.030
ethant: I have several weeks. I don't know. Did you read. I don't know if it, if you can see my chart I mailed one week and then I forgot 2 million in after that. All right. You know, I emailed them to the admissions people and they said they

475
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Put it in my chart. Oh, I haven't looked at, but I will

476
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.450
ethant: Okay. And yeah, don't, don't send the, the last couple weeks. Okay.

477
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:20.970
ethant: Pretty boring. I'm just like little I so I journal I write a little brief entry. Every time I take the the Suboxone which is three times a day.

478
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.690
Mm hmm.

479
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And why do you write in it.

480
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.540
ethant: It just right like

481
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.490
ethant: Just a few words about like how I feel and what I'm doing.

482
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:41.310
ethant: You know how my therapy session went or whatever, whatever stressing me out at work or, you know,

483
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:48.090
ethant: I try to write down like what my anxiety level is which seems to always be between like 20 and 50%

484
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:57.900
ethant: And some nights. So I get a really bad when when when I haven't have anxiety that I feel it in my chest. That's when I think about taking the anxiety that isn't

485
00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He, um,

486
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:07.320
ethant: I will actually kind of wanted to take some today because I started freaking out about all this news, but then I talked myself out of it. I was like, okay, I can't keep

487
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.420
ethant: As soon as I did.

488
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did you do

489
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.670
ethant: I said I talked myself out of it.

490
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You talk to yourself down off the ledge.

491
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:25.650
ethant: No, I said I I was getting panicked about all the news. So I wanted to take some anxiety medicine and I was kind of

492
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:37.140
ethant: The idea popped in my head. And then I talked myself out of it. I said I thought on I can't take every time I get freaked out about the coronavirus I can't like take a anxiety medicine.

493
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I, how did you work through the anxiety.

494
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.190
ethant: I don't know if I did, I mean, I just

495
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:50.280
ethant: I mean, yeah, I guess I did. Because I, I was told is getting

496
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.770
ethant: You're getting like

497
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.070
ethant: panicky. And I sort of talked myself down

498
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you talk to yourself down off the ledge is what you did know.

499
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what you that's a piece that should be in your journal really being mindful about how you did that right

500
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:10.710
Over

501
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because then you can repeat that. And repeat that. You know what I mean. And that type of that type of

502
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Self soothing can help in the long run in several different areas you can expand on that. You know what I mean. Mm hmm.

503
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. That's why I said I was like what you taught yourself off LEAD YOU DIDN'T TAKE MY HEAD, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S those little things like that that we don't realize that we're able to do for ourselves.

504
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you can expand on and help in other areas too. Yeah, okay.

505
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:53.280
ethant: So I have three notes so far I've read about DDT. I've read about vitamin D and journal about my

506
00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:59.430
ethant: About like talking myself out of panic.

507
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How, yeah. How do you do it. What do you say to yourself, what are the things that

508
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go on in your head that calms you down in that moment.

509
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

510
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it just remember to that addiction is

511
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A month mind.

512
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What we're doing is

513
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:28.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's manipulative

514
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

515
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there are these moments when when

516
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have those thoughts to be able to take your mud.

517
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know. You go take your mind.

518
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:51.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then what I like is that you're monitoring it and you're taking it a couple days here, you know, a couple days there and you're not taking it consistently.

519
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just being aware of that piece that your

520
00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That your addiction can convince you that you needed on a daily basis. And then comes more problems, right, because then you become physically addicted to that med to

521
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, it's about, you know what, at what level. Does your anxiety get before you finally come to the decision, but it's time to take it. Take your men. You know what I mean.

522
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:35.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you want to kind of expand on your, your ability to calm yourself down and really expand on those pieces before you revert to to the med right because that's a, that's a help. All we know that that's going to help. No. Just no. But

523
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.670
ethant: You know, they talk about it in a like ease and comfort.

524
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.560
ethant: Like, that's why anybody. It's so simple.

525
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:50.640
ethant: Ever there's everyone always makes it so complicated. Like, why do I drink or why do I take this pill or like it's it's easy and comfort.

526
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:56.070
ethant: It guarantees, it's like guaranteed comfort. Right.

527
00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, get you out of the way you're feeling right now.

528
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A short term solution for a long term problem. Yeah.

529
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

530
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, just focus on those focus on that, you know, what do you, what do you tell yourself. What are the things. What was it that went through your head that that allowed you the ability to calm yourself down, you know,

531
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:31.020
ethant: That's funny. I think it was just like, in part, partially it was feeling the power of not like I'm going to be okay I you know I don't have to

532
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.950
ethant: Know, I was like, it's sort of like feeling

533
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.620
ethant: Like I'm doing the right thing by not

534
00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:44.700
ethant: Taking anxiety medicine. I'm like, I'll be fine. You know, and then just convincing myself of that immediately.

535
00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.200
Comes

536
00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:54.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In there, it sits right there. It's about changing. You know that that mindset changing those thoughts.

537
00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:01.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right panicking about the virus, all the way to wait, wait, wait, wait. You know, I don't need this.

538
00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not going to be fine.

539
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and breathing.

540
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, don't forget that breathing from your abdomen is vitally important.

541
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:12.960
ethant: Yeah, I never think of that, but

542
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:29.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not many people do, though, that's the thing when you're in that moment, and you're veering towards that panic. That's really honest. You know what I mean, that's like the last thing you think of. But if you can get your bring it to your mind and get yourself to think

543
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the abdomen from the abdomen from the abdomen. It's a deeper breathing. Then from your chest. Yeah, you know, and it helps as well as, as well as changing that thought process.

544
00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So Valerian Root. Yep.

545
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.420
ethant: Okay, it's for

546
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You already got any grocery list.

547
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.040
ethant: Oh, you're right, right, right. That's the tea. Yeah.

548
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:06.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just see on the is, you know, see if it doesn't help you get some restful restful sleep.

549
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

550
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.440
ethant: Then I tell you about the word on way I or did I show it to you. I forget.

551
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:25.980
ethant: Know, I had this thing on my eye. I thought it was a little scabs, I like rubbed it off and then it came back the next day and Lily is like what's on your I actually like this word guru on my island.

552
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.300
ethant: So I had to go to the doctor. This is like a week ago.

553
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:37.710
ethant: And they're like, Yeah, that's a word, so they couldn't believe that they froze it with liquid nitrogen rocker right on my island.

554
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, don't hurt.

555
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.670
ethant: It wasn't that bad. It was scary. But after they did it, it was like no big deal.

556
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Money. They said, come back.

557
00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:56.370
ethant: So then it just, it was like this little bump for a while and then finally it fell off and now I'm not touching it. But I think it's pretty much gone

558
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay to success, success story.

559
00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.170
ethant: But it's a perfect example of that. Like my

560
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:08.670
ethant: My stress, the kind of anxiety. I mean, I'm so anxious. I'm getting like virus breakout and my I

561
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I was gonna say, how do you get one on your eye.

562
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:17.130
ethant: I assume because I touch. I probably touched

563
00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:25.500
ethant: I had virus on my skin like the word virus on my skin from touching something and then rub my eyes a lot so

564
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Time to wear gloves.

565
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:38.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gloves will work in God and public mascot glove it yeah don't take the risk

566
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:46.740
ethant: Getting a little better not touching my especially when I my I haven't recently washed my hands. I don't touch my face. That's like a big one.

567
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy. And that

568
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This whole thing. Yep, but

569
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.740
ethant: How about this telemedicine thing, I think, bright heart is ahead of the curve.

570
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody's gonna be

571
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:04.170
ethant: Yeah.

572
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.960
ethant: You guys have been doing this for a couple of years. Right. But now everybody's like,

573
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.530
ethant: Supposedly work from home and

574
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.160
ethant: Call this either doctor and etc.

575
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can see a doctor online for like $45 or something.

576
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

577
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you call him Medicaid from Korea right there. You're not to go to their office and see him.

578
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can diagnose you right on TV.

579
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing.

580
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

581
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.350
ethant: Starting to feel like the matrix a little bit or something.

582
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:54.000
ethant: Like the only connection to the world that we need. Well, I still go to the grocery store that's like my connection. That's my physical connection and everything else, like all my work is just in this computer.

583
00:54:54.660 --> 00:55:01.470
ethant: Like making money spending money feeding the darkness and talking to my therapist going, you know, talking to the doctor.

584
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whole life in a book.

585
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Computer on a computer screen.

586
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a, that's exactly kind of where I think I'm at to, you know, I

587
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I do everything on my computer.

588
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what's the need to go out and traffic and and get hit or

589
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People are crazy out there. Yeah, I'd rather just be Hear me okay

590
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:39.000
ethant: Yeah, I wanted to, I think I've mentioned this in the group I there was this moment when Lily and I both were like, Let's like go to Vegas or like neat.

591
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:46.800
ethant: She's a little too tied down. And then when we realized that Vegas is probably a horrible place to be. During a pandemic. We were like, okay, that's

592
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It.

593
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.760
ethant: I've been working pretty

594
00:55:51.900 --> 00:56:03.510
ethant: Pretty hard. You know, I work 10 plus hours a day, but I really could be doing this anywhere. I could roll out of bed in Tijuana, or you know Cancun, or wherever.

595
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So not Vegas, but maybe a secluded place where you and your wife to be able to go and spend some time together. Yeah.

596
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.680
And maybe the mountains.

597
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Someplace to get some some real fresh air. Yeah.

598
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know and be able to spend some quality time

599
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely will probably help and sit in the sun. It has to be sunny can't be rainy

600
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Vitamin D. Gotta be sending

601
00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.240
And grow.

602
00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:43.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

603
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.290
ethant: Yeah, we have some friends that live up in

604
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.410
ethant: Up in the mountains.

605
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:58.050
ethant: Forget which highway. It is like highway for, I guess, Calaveras County, we could go up there maybe

606
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's time to think about. I think that it would definitely

607
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Revive you a little bit, you know,

608
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make you feel a little bit better.

609
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Besides bubble bath.

610
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Valerian Root

611
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:19.590
ethant: Yeah.

612
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:28.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got all these other things that you're, you're going to try to implement within your schedule to be able to help with that piece and

613
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You should feel better, you know,

614
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:41.850
ethant: Yeah, like you pointed out, I think, actually, I'm on things are getting better. I don't feel like I'm on downward spiral or anything.

615
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't certainly see you see that that's what's happening with you at all. I see that you know you're tackling issues and you're handling them and you're up front. You're present, you know,

616
00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:56.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're doing what you need to do.

617
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:04.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And resolutions are happening. So you know that shows that you're definitely doing the work.

618
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

619
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that.

620
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

621
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:12.990
ethant: Yeah, I feel good, I think.

622
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.930
ethant: I don't stop to think about it. Maybe, but, or, if anything, I have a kind of negative

623
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.260
ethant: Outlook, but I have a lot of things to feel good about it.

624
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You really really do you gotta hold on to those because you know our minds as humans naturally go to the negative things that are going on if it's good, and it's working. We don't worry about it.

625
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you know what I mean we're focused on the things that aren't working. But if we stop and reflect on the things that we've already

626
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:47.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Solved and are making better. Yeah. You know what I mean, it just kind of says haha

627
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's working. You know what I mean.

628
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.870
ethant: Who I know what I'm going to do tonight. I'm going to watch. Better Call Saul, there's a new episode.

629
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.660
ethant: Oh wait, shoot it already. Watch it.

630
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:05.280
ethant: Damn, I find something good to watch. I don't want to watch CNN. I've had CNN on it's like panic central

631
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find some happy.

632
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:16.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, something that's gonna you know make you laugh Yeah, get out of the chaos of the crazy of the world right now.

633
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.160
ethant: I like to know what's going on. But yeah, I have to, I have to kind of manage it. So it's not totally consuming

634
00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:28.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the thing is that you that if that's all you're feeding your brain.

635
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, of course, you're going to be depressed, of course, your anxiety is going to raise i mean it's it's this, it's a world thing. You know what I mean. And, and so you have that in the background going into your brain work.

636
00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:50.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your brain. You know, like, where's the positive sense, it's not going. You know what I mean.

637
00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:59.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to find something to focus on the positive a little bit and get out of all that negativity and breathe.

638
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.300
ethant: Yeah, I think I've called mom tonight to that's always a good thing to do. And I talked to her in a while.

639
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's called a mom's a great idea. Yes.

640
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mom's always a good

641
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.590
ethant: Yeah, I have a pretty good mom I'm pretty lucky.

642
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.230
ethant: Pretty great mom.

643
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How did you get, how did you look at you have a great wife, you have a great mom. You know what I mean, you've got all these good things you're

644
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.400
ethant: Pretty lucky.

645
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:38.070
ethant: Mom, I just lucked out on my wife, I found I guess.

646
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:47.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it sounds to me, based off of the information that you've given me that you know you've got yourself a really good woman.

647
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

648
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.790
Totally

649
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome.

650
01:00:53.970 --> 01:01:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. Okay. So this week we're working on checking out vitamin D to see if it's something that you need that.

651
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're working on journaling when you're able to self soothe yourself out of your anxiety. Yep. You, you want to write down what it is that you did. What did you say you. You already told me

652
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try it again.

653
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and write it in your journal so that you can keep an eye and see if it works. See if we can expand on those pieces. Yeah, I'm hot bath.

654
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. So really what you're doing is you're focusing a lot of

655
01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot on self care a lot on

656
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, DVD skills really is what they are is what you're focusing on. So, and, you know, pay attention to if

657
01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:53.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're getting up all in the middle of the night, you know, if you're sitting up and you're not there, but you're there, you know what I mean.

658
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:59.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, that in your journal to, you know, my wife said, I sat up four or five times tonight. My wife said,

659
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:08.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I didn't sit up once tonight or you know what I mean. And then you can kind of monitor you know what you're doing different and whether it's working or not working. Yeah, you know,

660
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.290
ethant: Yeah, yeah, I'll do all those things.

661
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

662
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:21.150
ethant: The journal was sort of crisis management, up until this point, so I can start to focus more on improvement. I guess now that I'm

663
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.300
ethant: Going through that deadline and all that other stuff that was going on.

664
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And Journaling is a healthy thing to do for anybody.

665
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:40.170
ethant: Yeah, I don't know why I just like writing down like to, you know, take my medicine. I busy doing this, I feel, you know,

666
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.180
ethant: Depressed or not depressed or Harvard. However, I feel, you know,

667
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing wrong with it. It's actually a really, really good recovery skill to, you know, they

668
01:02:52.350 --> 01:03:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Recovery promotes journaling all the time, you know, in any literature that you read, you know the basic tools that you need for recovery and one of them is always journaling, you know, writing, writing down your thoughts.

669
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you go back and you look at those thoughts on the in a year. And you're like, wow, what growth, you see that growth. You know what I mean.

670
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:15.330
ethant: Yeah.

671
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:23.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where your mind was in the very beginning and and you see the progress that you make from from point A to point B. That's pretty amazing.

672
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.590
ethant: I'm curious where. Where are you based

673
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:31.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On. Oh.

674
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.000
Okay, cool.

675
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

676
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:40.770
ethant: So all the bright heart people, people are in California, probably because it has to be state license very

677
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we actually have say state contracts all throughout the country. And we're getting more and more and more and more. I think we just

678
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: sealed up three more on the east coast.

679
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.020
So,

680
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We have doctors in New Mexico, California.

681
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So the idea is just to expand and have

682
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have this open to people in in all states on

683
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.640
ethant: The. Do you have a group where you meet with the other therapists that work for bright heart or

684
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I have supervision that I meet with Helena, which she

685
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is

686
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One of the directors and she's amazing. I absolutely

687
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just think that she's an awesome, awesome person, a great boss, I wouldn't have ever any other job that I've ever had.

688
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've only had a boss like her once or twice, you know,

689
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:58.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very, very good good person and this company is amazing to me you know we we do groups and oh my gosh, New Mexico, where they're an hour different you know the we're not on the same time zone, which really kind of messes me up and it's only an hour, but the simple things kind of scrappy.

690
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And groups in Ohio and groups in West Virginia. You know what I mean. So

691
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.580
ethant: So the groups are all geographical like the

692
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.820
ethant: Members of the groups are geographically close

693
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They are in the different states.

694
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.310
ethant: So statewide as I see

695
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so I hold groups in California and New Mexico right now is where I hold groups.

696
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:42.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have my my certifications are from Oregon, and the state of Washington and California. So I can hold groups. Once we get certified in Oregon, Washington and California. So it's kind of amazing because each state requires has different requirements.

697
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For contracts. And so, you know, there are hard at work, you know, contracting with

698
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.680
ethant: Their contracting with all the insurance companies.

699
