Okay.

74
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.950
Jeremy Robinett: And then after that it was just

75
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.190
Jeremy Robinett: That point in time, I guess it was just easier to stay home. It was Ben.

76
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.910
Jeremy Robinett: Sorry. Um,

77
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.100

82
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:07.080

83
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.520
Once

85
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.830
Natalie Austin: So at what point did you go from the pills to the heroin.

86
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.880
