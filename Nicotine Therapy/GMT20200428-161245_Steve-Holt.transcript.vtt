31
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.740

33
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.250
Garrett Beasley: That was just his time in my life and I talked to them like

34
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.240
Yeah.

35
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.530
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay. Good for you. Good for you. All right, I'm

36
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.830
Steve Holtsford: Trying to get get back up to the to the substance use any Ben's those at all.

37
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.270
Garrett Beasley: No.

38
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.720
Okay.

39
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.530
Okay.

40
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.830
Steve Holtsford: All right.

41
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.860
Steve Holtsford: So, Garrett. The the

42
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.550
Steve Holtsford: The unfortunate reality of methamphetamine.

43
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:59.850
Steve Holtsford: People with with stimulant use disorder and methamphetamine and cocaine and so forth is there's not really a good medication, per se.

44
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:13.440
Steve Holtsford: So you know Suboxone works and it seems like it worked for you and everything is going good in terms of opioids, but the the treatment of methamphetamine is is

45
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:28.590
Steve Holtsford: You know it's it's not medication based basically. So what this is what really this is going to come down to is is really

46
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.660
Steve Holtsford: Counseling and engagement and

47
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.670
Steve Holtsford: Things that you've that you've probably sort of learned

48
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.900
Steve Holtsford: Through the through your prior experience. But really, you know, kind of implementing so

49
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.390
Steve Holtsford: And and bright heart we have wonderful counselors that can kind of

50
00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:01.170
Steve Holtsford: Take that on and and you can be part of their, their groups, but in terms of me. I'm the sort of the medical piece.

51
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:08.940
Steve Holtsford: There's, there's not like a medication for you probably know this for a mess. You know, so

52
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:21.900
Steve Holtsford: But, but I will say that that that bright heart is is going to be here for you and we'll get you plugged in. And it's, you don't have to leave your house and I think there's a lot of good

53
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.740
Steve Holtsford: Positives about it.

54
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.570
Steve Holtsford: Is this

55
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.640
Steve Holtsford: Have you had an appointment with a counselor at bright heart yet or

56
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.100

Steve Holtsford: The paper intake. Okay.

58
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.400
Steve Holtsford: The intake stuff. Okay. Okay. All right.

Garrett Beasley: Depressed now. Yeah.

Steve Holtsford: Okay. All right. But you don't have any thoughts of hurting yourself or others are

62
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
Steve Holtsford: All right. And how many kids do you have care so

63

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.670
Garrett Beasley: She was six months old, so

72
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.400
Steve Holtsford: All right, and then

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.960
Steve Holtsford: Where's. Where's your wife. Now, you guys are living apart now.

74
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.070

Steve Holtsford: To trap house, you know, all I see she

77
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.740
Steve Holtsford: Is wrapped up in it.

78
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.310
Garrett Beasley: Yeah, she kept to the apartment. When we split up or whatever and

79
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.280
Garrett Beasley: Really bad. That's what her parents called

80
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.430
Garrett Beasley: The child famous services on her a bunch of times.

81
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:55.170
Garrett Beasley: They took the kids from her, but then they didn't give them to me because of my legal problems.

82
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.900
Garrett Beasley: I say when that happened, I got pretty bad for you know six months or so.

83
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.770
Garrett Beasley: And then just everything's falling apart. Even worse, so you know lately I've been a lot better.

84
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.530
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay. Oh.

85
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.880
Garrett Beasley: Every day.

86
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.940
Garrett Beasley: After I mean think about 10 days so

87
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.590
Steve Holtsford: You haven't done any math in 10 days. Okay. Good for you. Good for you.

88
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.450
Steve Holtsford: And did you grow up in Marion your

89
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.800
Garrett Beasley: Whole life lived here.

90
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.340
Steve Holtsford: went to high school there. Okay. All right.

91
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.100
Steve Holtsford: How about do you have

92
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.160
Steve Holtsford: How about your parents are they in Marion still

93
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.540

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.990
Steve Holtsford: You're living with them. Okay. Right, right, right, right.

95
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.550
Garrett Beasley: So,

96
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.720
Steve Holtsford: Okay and and how is your relationship with your folks.

97
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.560
Garrett Beasley: It's good.

98
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.290
Garrett Beasley: Good girl doesn't believe in me. But, uh,

99
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.970
Garrett Beasley: They're i mean they're they're helped me through

100
00:12:51.690 --> 00:13:00.150
Steve Holtsford: I was just gonna say it, but they they've got to be happy. Now that you're that you're getting treatment and. All right. All right.

101
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.670
Steve Holtsford: All right, well,

102
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.770
Steve Holtsford: You know, I'm not sure who exactly your, your therapist is going to be

103
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:22.410
Steve Holtsford: And so the whole concept of bright heart health is kind of new in Illinois. So, I must admit that I'm just sort of getting used to it. Obviously, how you saw my problems with zoom

104
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:32.160
Steve Holtsford: But so it's it's only been active for a few weeks, but it's but from my experience it's it's really very good. I mean,

105
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:48.330
Steve Holtsford: You know you and I are are 300 miles apart. But we're having what I what I feel like is a very normal kind of conversation. So it really does and and you're in your bedroom. So it really, I think this is really kind of the future.

106
00:13:50.010 --> 00:14:03.060
Steve Holtsford: For for substance use disorder and counseling for for patients that are that are in an area like Marianne and and you know most of central Illinois where it's kind of difficult to get those services, you know,

107
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.100
Steve Holtsford: So,

108
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.630
Garrett Beasley: Yeah, the like to rehab silly. I mean, I don't believe I need impatient stuff.

109
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.600
Garrett Beasley: Yeah. A lot of people, other people do either. But, um,

110
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.650
Garrett Beasley: I mean the waitlist is unreal for bed right here.

111
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.120
Garrett Beasley: Yeah, so I mean people are waiting a year and stuff like that didn't get a bit so

112
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.870
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, and I agree with you i don't think i don't think impatient really helps a lot of people

113
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.290
Garrett Beasley: Are going to be right back to it. So they

114
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:46.260
Steve Holtsford: go right back to it and and eventually you know after 30 days you're going to have, you're going to be in that same neighborhood with those same thing. So, you know, unless it's a real your, your, your life is in danger, and there's there's not a

115
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.900
Steve Holtsford: safe place for you to be. I just don't think that inpatient

116
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.240
Steve Holtsford: Really

117
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.680
Steve Holtsford: offers much, you know, and I think that's kind of a that's kind of going throughout the whole

118
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:11.070
Steve Holtsford: Industry of substance use disorder. I think you know inpatient beds just aren't aren't needed like they they used to, we know for a fact.

119
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:24.210
Steve Holtsford: That for most substance use disorder 30 days in a hospital bed doesn't do much. You know, you know, for some for some people, you know, maybe a week might might do something but

120
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.380
Steve Holtsford: But most of this work is probably best done

121
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.490
Steve Holtsford: At home, you know, and certainly not

122
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:43.920
Steve Holtsford: You know, flying to Florida or Malibu for that for that kind of, you know, spending $30,000 for something that sends you right back you know that

123
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.940
Steve Holtsford: That's all, that's all thinking, thinking, so

124
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:58.740
Steve Holtsford: All right, well I have enjoyed this. And again, I think, I think my role in your recovery is going to be small.

125
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.380
Steve Holtsford: Because it's not opioids, it's it's it's math, but

126
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.890
Steve Holtsford: Just know that I'm that if you have any questions.

127
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.330
Steve Holtsford: Medical or otherwise I'm here for you.

128
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.000
Steve Holtsford: Alright okay alright makes money.

129
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.500
Garrett Beasley: Most of us have to me so

130
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.710
Garrett Beasley: You're just

131
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:20.370
Yeah.

132
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:36.510
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, exactly. Most of it's up to you. You're absolutely right. Have a friend of mine is a good counselor and he goes, he goes, it's an inside job. It's an inside job and it is it's an inside job. And then, but we just have to we have to

133
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.220
Steve Holtsford: You know, it helps to have support and and

134
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.070
Steve Holtsford: You know, we want to be that support for you.

135
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.830
Steve Holtsford: Appreciate. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, care. Have a good day.

136
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.000
Garrett Beasley: You do. Right.
