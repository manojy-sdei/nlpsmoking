00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
Saraniah Aston: I was like, I have an appointment. When my name is Sonia. This is my credit card.

3
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was touching base with them. I'm like, she said she's

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There can look again.

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of got this slack program where we connect communicate back and forth.

6
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.520
Saraniah Aston: That's good.

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.690
Saraniah Aston: Well, I think, a new guy first

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.120
Saraniah Aston: Opened up the video and then he didn't know what to do. So the, the chick. The girl. I don't remember her name. She just jumped right in

9
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so I'm settling into a note and it looks like you're trying to find a place to have me

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.300
Saraniah Aston: I'm trying to put my phone.

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.330
Saraniah Aston: Sorry.

13
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Me a chance to reveal a little bit

14
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Of last last week's note.

15
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.060
Saraniah Aston: All right, I'm a little crooked.

16
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's not a problem, as long as it's not moving. We're good. So I'm reading

17
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

18
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We had sort of set aside, but maybe, maybe you already did the invitation. The homework invitation.

19
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or no forgotten.

20
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.490
No.

21
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Forgotten

22
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.230
Saraniah Aston: I my the last week has been insane. I haven't done anything productive.

23
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's minimize that, because that might not be really true.

24
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:18.060
Saraniah Aston: Well, except my brother was having an issue yesterday and I spoke to him. He's talking about how he feels like he's going insane living with mom and how he feels like he's sick and alone, and he can't handle mom and I talked to him about active coping.

25
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.480
Saraniah Aston: And

26
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.530
Saraniah Aston: Boundaries.

27
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Ooh, what did he

28
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.240
Saraniah Aston: Want developing healthy detachment.

29
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.870
Saraniah Aston: All of the wish for it all to be

30
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Different yeah that's hard to do.

31
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.010
Saraniah Aston: Wow, sis. You've learned a lot. I would like to talk more to you about these things.

32
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so the fact that you were able to talk to him. Does this mean that he's like he uses math doesn't he

33
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, okay. So what's this deal like what's what's going on with him that makes him.

34
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.250
Saraniah Aston: So, so

35
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.390
Saraniah Aston: Well, he, he is I believe he's bipolar.

36
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:17.160
Saraniah Aston: But every time he gets medicine, he refuses to take it, or he'll take it for a week or something and then he'll get paranoid thoughts that

37
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:27.480
Saraniah Aston: That it's all just a bunch of bull and so he'll go off his medication and he was also taking Suboxone

38
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: For

39
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.980
Saraniah Aston: A fact my whole family has been for about, like,

40
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.450
Saraniah Aston: 10 years, I believe, and two months ago or right before we brought him here. He quit cold turkey.

41
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.500
And

42
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:54.660
Saraniah Aston: And now he's dealing with the aftermath of quitting cold turkey, because I'm thinking it stays in your system for a little while. And that's quite a jolt to your system.

43
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I have heard, and of course it's anecdotal from my clients that are in here that have tried to kick abruptly. The buprenorphine Suboxone is a brand name so it can be can come from different brands, so

44
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That it is worse than heroin.

45
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.240
So,

46
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If he says he didn't taper at all. He just

47
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

48
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.090
He was

49
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss

50
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.570
Saraniah Aston: I guess. Yeah, he was, and I guess that he still is feeling it a little bit. It's been about a month.

51
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.580
Saraniah Aston: Um,

52
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

53
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:46.590
Saraniah Aston: But I told him like, you know, if you're on a healthy path and you need some help. I need some help to and you're willing to communicate with me, then I am willing to give it a try, as well.

54
00:04:49.080 --> 00:05:05.100
Saraniah Aston: He was panicking, yesterday I went over there and he was just sweating and panicking and upset about our mom and and I just did something that our family does not ever do and I grabbed him and I gave him a bear hug.

55
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:15.660
Saraniah Aston: And I just like patted his back, kind of like a man looks like you're going to get through this. I'm right here.

56
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we just take a minute.

57
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that is so different than that image I have him on the couch and there's nowhere for you to go this sense of doing it almost sounds like you knew just what to do.

58
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just did it.

59
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:51.240
Saraniah Aston: Why don't you just saw him in a desperate moment and it could have gone either way, I guess. And it was kind of scary to to approach that um

60
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.050
Saraniah Aston: You know, and to to hug him. And what if he slipped out. He's just he helped me for a second, third, I was kind of surprised.

61
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.450
Saraniah Aston: And then he's like, and then we detach he's like nobody touches me and I'm like, I know it's not just you. It's our entire family. Get over it.

62
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.860
Saraniah Aston: So that was good.

63
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I really different.

64
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I bet that that alone could be a discussion if you decided to talk, you know, hey, hey bro. What was that like to have me do that. Now, this is what I'm doing is I'm trying to tap into that natural instinctual.

65
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Healing that I have for myself, like if I was at unraveled panicking, I would want someone to ground me firmly to and I gave it to you. I didn't overthink it. Yes, I did. I didn't, I just did it.

66
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it went well. He dismissed. You know, we don't don't hug me. We don't touch you know

67
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. He didn't punch in the nose or push it, you

68
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.230
Saraniah Aston: Know he did actually rub my back while I was holding

69
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.810
Saraniah Aston: Him. His hand was on my back.

70
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.470
Saraniah Aston: And Robbie. And then during the PAT PAT PAT AND THEN HE BROKE IT

71
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.930
Saraniah Aston: Was a moment there.

72
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, don't, don't minimize that, though.

73
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good. Um,

74
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That was important.

75
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The message you just sent to that family system is a powerful one. We can not only, you know, write things down on a journal and regurgitate with a therapist says you put it into action.

76
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:43.590
Saraniah Aston: And I gave him one of my mini journals yesterday and I said here, you're an artist and you write put whatever you want in this journal. It's yours.

77
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.420
Saraniah Aston: And automatically I give him a pen. He's like, I've been looking for a pen and my pen.

78
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.660
Saraniah Aston: You have is like he started. He started writing it.

79
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool. Really cool.

80
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we just did a fact finding expedition because you started today with what a week. Right. Oh, this week.

81
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.110
Saraniah Aston: Oh my gosh.

82
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, what are the facts. Let's take all of

83
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The analysis. Just give me some facts.

84
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:22.920
Saraniah Aston: So I have to leave this apartment, um, by the fifth of next month. My mom.

85
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:40.050
Saraniah Aston: This is not a very good situation, but it is what it is. She has a separate studio on her property. And I'm going to just take that until I find another place. I'm moving out of this place because the owner

86
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.230
Saraniah Aston: is disgusting.

87
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.550
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

88
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's always

89
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:55.560
Saraniah Aston: Been like hell and it was supposed to be like this new beginning for me and just the whole thing was just awful. So

90
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:13.440
Saraniah Aston: I mean the the owners okay with it. And he said he would actually give me back my deposit and I spoke with my mom, I basically told her. I'm taking over your studio and putting all my stuff in in the garage and storage and be looking for an apartment from there. Okay.

91
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.320
Saraniah Aston: So, you know, at least it's outside. You know, I have met in space.

92
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.990
Saraniah Aston: It's not ideal but

93
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:30.960
Saraniah Aston: I think it's, it might be good for me to be a little bit closer to my brother right now. I don't know. Okay, maybe

94
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So what else

95
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.420
Saraniah Aston: Um,

96
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.580
Saraniah Aston: I have a lot of problems with my mom and

97
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:50.970
Saraniah Aston: Her bringing my father here and not telling me or my brother, I'm

98
00:09:51.990 --> 00:10:03.840
Saraniah Aston: really messed with both of our heads. So thank you. So go ahead, is it. Most definitely. Most of my head because he seems to have like Alzheimer's or something. I'm taking him to the doctor.

99
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:20.430
Saraniah Aston: And she actually asked me if I would consider taking a year out of my life to rent a house with my father and look after him.

100
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.360
Saraniah Aston: Because she doesn't know what to do with him.

101
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:25.830
Saraniah Aston: And

102
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a bigger than a big ask that was the big, the big ask

103
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And so just take a second don't even know that that's, I don't even know. That's the thing that's not even a thing. So, wait a second, hold on, let's check in on you.

104
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you feel physically when you heard that question.

105
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, the homework was I didn't remember but that's okay I'm gonna see if you actually registered, some of it. It was to pay attention to the body's message.

106
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.740
Do you

107
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: How that I mean even thinking about it now. Well, how about you take a year out of your life. I don't want you don't know this man and and just sort of blood. He's your Father and just you take care of take care of them, nevermind.

108
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Be live in the same town and occasionally bump into him and have a few awkward moments and maybe one good one. Once a year for a few years, but no live with them.

109
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:42.480
Saraniah Aston: And I, at first I felt really strong. And I felt like wow she really thinks I can do something like that.

110
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.900
Saraniah Aston: Like I felt like it would make her proud or something.

111
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.710
Saraniah Aston: And so at

112
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:56.640
Saraniah Aston: First, I was like, You know what, okay, I'll think about it. And then I thought about it, and then I came back to her was like a hell no. What are you thinking

113
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:09.960
Saraniah Aston: There's no chance like to do that and fruit. And second of all, what is our most important mission from when I came back to the States. We had a mission and then mission is he law my

114
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay focused people

115
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.930
Saraniah Aston: Taking care of. I told that to my brother to and he's like, yeah, you're right.

116
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.430
Saraniah Aston: You're absolutely right. And

117
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:30.090
Saraniah Aston: And I told that to my mom to told her I was like, I don't understand where the motivation for Sheila is and I feel like we're going backwards here.

118
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's look at this a little closer. Let's look at this concept of boundaries. Notice how I asked you how your body felt. I didn't get that what I got from you, was yes. You said yes.

119
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt complimented. I like that. My like how my mom sees me she sees me as capable and I feel strong

120
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.350
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

121
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what your body was feeling at the time. I'm still going to invite that homework.

122
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.620
Saraniah Aston: Tense. I already know, I remember tense and anxious and full of

123
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.800
Saraniah Aston: Like when you're about to get on

124
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.200
Saraniah Aston: A roller coaster ride.

125
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't like her. So that's not likely to happen.

126
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.140
Saraniah Aston: Like a yeah like

127
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.520
Saraniah Aston: It was like

128
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:39.690
Saraniah Aston: Oh, suddenly I'm a new world of possibility opened up. And so my body was tense. I was anxious by the thought of it by talking about it. I'm

129
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.740
Saraniah Aston: Meeting. I had to breathe.

130
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.690
Saraniah Aston: I had to get my full breath and

131
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.350
Saraniah Aston: I guess that's all I got from it but

132
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more and more. I'll be being more aware

133
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's okay. Don't give yourself a hard time or feel like, Hey, I didn't do this homework. It's really, it is a hard thing to remember because we don't pay attention to it. You have kind of wondered, well, how do I get started on this process. And this is a great way to do it.

134
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Neat chain of reactions happen can happen. One of them includes time

135
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.330
Saraniah Aston: Hmm.

136
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And the breath. And that allows the mind to connect with different parts of the brain to think, Wait a second. Why am I saying yes I say yes, really want my mom to see me this way.

137
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, it's coming up. What do I want and then right. You could have probably found it.

138
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In the euro, what's my mission. What what what what my need for approval my need to be viewed in a particular way just took off got me to say yes. Wait a second. Wait.

139
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, no. What's the mission all energy toward hema

Gwenevere Abriel: hema hema hema coming here.

141
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.490
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, and it took me a couple of days.

142
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.060
Saraniah Aston: To get to that should happen right away.

143
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're not used to this, you're not used to this know at least you kind of hear. Hey, listen, was there a time in your life you want to move down in

144
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So some credit. Come on.

145
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.930
Saraniah Aston: I just wrote down homework.

146
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.780
Saraniah Aston: How do you feel physically so

147
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is

148
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.940
Saraniah Aston: Written down as homework. Then I'll actually do it.

149
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what it looks like, it looks like this.

150
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I scan my body. I know. Look, I have a phone in my hand right now south facing me see out here, I just put it in my hand. I'm scanning my body. This is what actually do

151
00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.820
Saraniah Aston: I'm writing this down.

152
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it before you look at a text before you answer a phone before you walk out into the public and that means out in the living room. That means before you make contact with another human being you check baseline how you're doing.

153
00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, okay, I can feel a lot of I feel tension up here. These think the trapezius muscles that are kind of what I consider shoulders.

154
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I look at my phone. I see a text and I pay attention to my body, but the text and I don't read it, I just see who it's from. I can usually get a response in the body.

155
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just by the sender if it's my mom, right, or if it's brother. If it's an X. I'm going to Zach, I'm going to feel it. So I'm speaking as if I'm you right that's going to be used. So then you scan you don't read the checks you just pay attention, the body. Where did I feel that

156
00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe you'll notice like this. We're all hunched over some things like you're looking to catch it. You go, Whoa, look at that.

157
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now and then you can write that down. And then you go pick it up, read it, see if there's another one. See if there's another one is you keep reading. That's how you're staying in contact with your body journal it so it's literally before you jump outside check yourself. How am I doing

158
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.410
Saraniah Aston: That's exactly what I wrote. I wrote everything down first.

159
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.630
Saraniah Aston: Check yourself by body scan do the Superman scan is if it's going straight through you.

160
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way into the guts. The bones and muscles, tendons,

161
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.040
Saraniah Aston: OK, and then how I feel. Afterwards, I guess.

162
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. After you have social contact contact is seeing the the center of a text.

163
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right before I logged on I check in.

164
00:17:53.130 --> 00:18:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how I'm going to meet my next encounter. I'm coming with a physical bias already. I've already activated. You know, I'm already with this uncertainty and and see Patsy global nightmare. I'm already kind of edgy.

165
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm known, you know, that's how I am biased when I'm meeting my clients how I'm meeting people socially walking out there picking up the phone. I'm already like right

166
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, already like, I'm ready.

167
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm aware of it, which means I might have some control over it. If I can be aware. I can say, Okay, I've already got a bias.

168
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be able to label when I start to kind of go a little dialed up. I can leave a little, little sooner. I can maybe let people know yeah I'm a little unfriendly steer clear for an hour.

169
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.630
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I think that's what I'm gonna have to do

170
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

171
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.210
Saraniah Aston: Moving on to

172
00:18:53.490 --> 00:19:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Some things stuck there. Let's look at what stuck. There's the what I think happened was,

173
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You acted your brain probably went in lightning speed. I know this is against the family norm, my brother might actually be aggressive and you did it anyway. I wonder how you decided to rely on your intuition of what to do versus what the family dictate is wonder why you did that.

174
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.890
Saraniah Aston: Because I know that I'm different now.

175
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.220
Saraniah Aston: I know that I'm hardcore. I know that I'm tough.

176
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.240
Saraniah Aston: I know it.

177
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:38.520
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I'm tougher than then I'm just, it's just the way that it's not what I've learned over the past 10 years. Yes.

178
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You have faced so many difficult things and you're here to tell about it. I mean, your testament to what adversity. You can endure and you are okay you're here.

179
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

180
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, something happened you followed you followed some intuition there.

181
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.570
Mm hmm.

182
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.480
Saraniah Aston: I saw a man in pain.

183
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.240
Saraniah Aston: And I could feel that pain.

184
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:22.500
Saraniah Aston: And the confusion of the moment in his in his mind. I could feel that I could see that I could see that anxiety in his eyes. The helplessness hopelessness.

185
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.900
Saraniah Aston: I feel those things and people so

186
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

187
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.910
Saraniah Aston: Just boiled and boil and boil it until I was ready to just attack love attack.

188
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, wow. So you sat with it for a while. Actually, you are listening to him for a while.

189
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:54.000
Saraniah Aston: I thought I was talking to him and listening to him, but I felt myself building up to something. Something was building up

190
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.820
Saraniah Aston: And I knew it. And my head started racing at that moment. It was like ah just grab them.

191
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.550
Saraniah Aston: But then I thought, but what if he doesn't like not

192
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:08.550
Saraniah Aston: Just grab him and so I did. I just listened to my intuition completely

193
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.370
Saraniah Aston: And I just kind of grabbed them bear hugged him. Yeah.

194
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But she did more than that you have him you Patty. You remember hitting him like like as in, you know, it wasn't this OH THERE. THERE YOU and YOU SAID WOULD YOU SAY AGAIN.

195
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.040
Saraniah Aston: I think I said I got your back.

196
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.570
Okay.

197
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what I

198
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.110
Saraniah Aston: Learned not crazy. I got your back. I understand you.

199
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:43.890
Okay.

200
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Was there any of the. It's going to be okay or any of those

201
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:49.560
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

202
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.610
Saraniah Aston: I said,

203
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:57.630
Saraniah Aston: It's going in the in the in the big picture, Travis. It's going to be okay. Okay.

204
00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.340
Yeah.

205
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:09.240
Saraniah Aston: I told him I'm struggling to I don't talk about that much, but I really am. And I'm really working on it too.

206
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.670
Saraniah Aston: He's proud of that. He kind of looks at that, like, wow, she's working on herself.

207
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I see out here is what snapshot obviously is far more complicated, but it almost looks like.

208
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were feeling what Travis was feeling AND YOU KNOW IT FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE. It's almost like you were doing that give what you didn't get like you were grounding yourself, you are giving him grounding.

209
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was this mutual thing and it was intense. And it didn't last long. But it worked. I don't know. Let's see. What was the conversation like after that.

210
00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:06.210
Saraniah Aston: Oh. After that, he was like he calmed down, and we left the garage at all happen in the garage and I was bringing some stuff over and he's helping me

211
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:29.400
Saraniah Aston: He didn't really know what to say. Actually, I think the whole thing was just different for him. So we broke apart and he went to the house and I continue doing what I was doing. And then I went back into the house and I he was on the porch and

212
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:46.290
Saraniah Aston: My mother and I were leaving to go to Walmart and he said he said somebody spoke, we asked him travels. Do you want anything from Walmart and he's like very meek.

213
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:53.940
Saraniah Aston: He said, Well, I would like to shave. I want to look pretty to that means he was being humorous.

214
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.510
Yes.

215
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.750
Saraniah Aston: That means his mood change.

216
00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure did.

217
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

218
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.570
Saraniah Aston: And we came back from war. He was great.

219
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.790
Saraniah Aston: He was calm.

220
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.580
Saraniah Aston: He was helpful to my mom.

221
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me which medication works that fast.

222
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave him grounding. You got it. You both got to carry on with your day and it was as eloquent as you're tuning in

223
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of what you needed to just really kind of I really relate to this man's challenge is my challenge to I grew up with this insanity.

224
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can completely spit off in to the ethers with it.

225
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But now hug.

226
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you didn't have this, you know. Right here, right here. It wasn't this squishy thing.

227
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It was really kind of containing the intensity and

228
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't expecting you to say all of these positive things but I gotta tell you something. How much affection. Have you grown up with in your family of origin.

229
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.060
Saraniah Aston: Not enough

230
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.510
Saraniah Aston: Not much at all, actually.

231
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.460
Saraniah Aston: That's something that I've been thinking about recently, I'm

232
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.070
Saraniah Aston: Only when I was little. When I was with my dad.

233
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:43.350
Saraniah Aston: When I was little, my dad and I were very close. I'm like inseparable. But he was also manipulating me to like control my mother too. So that was really difficult but in his own way.

234
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.780
Saraniah Aston: He really loved me.

235
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.710
Saraniah Aston: I forgot what the question was. I'm sorry.

236
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

237
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You just reminisce you just went back

238
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

239
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.420
Saraniah Aston: That's kind of the question, but

240
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The question becomes less relevant to what's happening, what are you starting to think about right now I can bring us back to the original question.

241
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.360
Towards

242
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.530
Saraniah Aston: It's really hard now.

243
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.630
Saraniah Aston: Because I've grown up. And one of the things that he said to me is, you know,

244
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:24.120
Saraniah Aston: Honey, you can yell at me as much as you want as much as you need. Go right ahead.

245
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.120
Saraniah Aston: And I told him I wish you could have told me that like 10 years ago.

246
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.970
Saraniah Aston: Because I really wouldn't have

247
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.890
Saraniah Aston: But now I don't have it in me. I have

248
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell me what the tears are saying

249
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.880
Saraniah Aston: That it's unfortunate that

250
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.570
Saraniah Aston: It'll never be

251
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.990
Saraniah Aston: That kind of bond that we had when I was six, seven years old.

252
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.740
Saraniah Aston: It will never be that it can't be that

253
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.890
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, so in a way

254
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:22.080
Saraniah Aston: I feel like I've totally lost my dad, but I've been feeling that way for a long time.

255
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.900
Saraniah Aston: And know he's here.

256
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:29.850
And

257
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.220
Saraniah Aston: I just, I don't know.

258
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.760
Saraniah Aston: I don't know what's expected of me.

259
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds really honest with

260
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.540
Saraniah Aston: You. I just don't. I just don't know.

261
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:45.990
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

262
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.770
Saraniah Aston: I don't know what he might expect from me or and my mom.

263
00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:03.060
Saraniah Aston: I just don't know. So I'm with you know with all you can do. I don't have the answers. I don't have answers. I just

264
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:04.800
Saraniah Aston: Went

265
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.800
Saraniah Aston: But I know my intention.

266
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's your intention. Tell me about those

267
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.600
Saraniah Aston: To be there.

268
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.320
Saraniah Aston: Maybe not physically all the time, but for it to be known.

269
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:28.920
Saraniah Aston: That I am there if I am needed, but I am there in my way.

270
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.810
Saraniah Aston: I have my way

271
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.590
Saraniah Aston: Not the way

272
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.200
Saraniah Aston: Of my mom, my dad, and with anybody. I have my way, so

273
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.240
Saraniah Aston: If anyone needs my help or my to

274
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.310
Saraniah Aston: Be family and be strong and

275
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.000
Saraniah Aston: Get through this, then

276
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:06.300
Saraniah Aston: Then, allow me to show you a different way than what we've been doing our entire lives.

277
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.110
Saraniah Aston: How about being real.

278
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, yep. So you are indeed it's it truly does look like you're getting your adult feet on the ground.

279
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's still wobbly.

280
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right still you're assessing expectation. So you started this conversation with I'm just still unclear what are the expectations. What's my role here. Who am I, what I'm not six

281
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to have a tantrum. I don't want to be manipulated on one a minute be late.

282
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest and want to be real. And yet the old habit of what's the expectation

283
00:29:52.260 --> 00:30:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's tricky there and but she did come back. He came back to wait a second. I do know what I want. I want to be real. I want to be honest.

284
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. That's my intention. Okay. I want to be honest, I want to be honest, I want to be honest about

285
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's about what I can give when I can give it you guys are welcome to ask me, feel free to ask. And I'll give what I have to give. There's a boundary

286
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a really clear one actually please know that you are always invited to ask. I'm here. If I have the time. If I have money. If I have, if it's a resource of making food or helping clean helping organize a repair something if I have it. I will tell you honestly

287
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If I have to give

288
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different. That's a real boundary type of statement. And I'm wondering if that's sort of the therapist version of all do it my way. I'll do it my way of being, not the way the family dictates, but I'm going to do being available to this family in sarnie his way.

289
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.670
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Well, I mean, that's all I can do really

290
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you haven't been. No, you haven't what you've been doing is twisting around like a plot pretzel trying to match what you're perceived you're perceiving an expectation. You've been twisted around

291
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.720
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's true.

292
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Very disappointed and hurt.

293
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how it looks out here. I

294
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.020
Saraniah Aston: Know you're right it does. Absolutely.

295
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.610
Saraniah Aston: On the news. I was considering

296
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.450
Saraniah Aston: This might be intense if they will the intensity agree.

297
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:51.000
Saraniah Aston: But just to schedule a big old family meeting where we put everything on the table. All of it. Everything, all of it.

298
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:58.020
Saraniah Aston: So I was thinking, Oh, all right. Everybody a letter. I'll schedule a date.

299
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.920
Saraniah Aston: And I'll ask them to get back to me and let me know if they plan to attend.

300
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.970
Saraniah Aston: And I think that might be a good thing to do.

301
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.470
Saraniah Aston: I don't know.

302
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me check in. Let me check a temperature reading here.

303
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: As a family therapist, of course, I love a family meeting all a big fan.

304
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Have had quite a few of them facilitated quite a few of them big fan. Always know before I start, what I want from them. I'm always really clear.

305
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the things that will be discussed. This is time limited and this is what the agenda kinda is, this is what my expectation is this what I want from it. So what do you want from a family meeting.

306
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.170
Saraniah Aston: A clean slate with everybody.

307
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And clean slate.

308
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.870
Saraniah Aston: Mean meeting a fresh start.

309
00:32:52.170 --> 00:33:04.710
Saraniah Aston: After we've dug up everything that we get out for the table, cried and argued over it, whatever felt bad about ourselves, whatever we got over it so

310
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.780
Saraniah Aston: As I say,

311
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want from it is a clean slate.

312
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:21.450
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, but it's a clean slate to start fresh and to get to know each other. Now, as adults, because that's what we have.

313
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That is true.

314
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.020
Saraniah Aston: And time is really, really short.

315
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:38.220
Saraniah Aston: And if we want to be a family. Let's try to be a functioning functional one dysfunctional sick family.

316
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.850
Saraniah Aston: I wonder if that's me trying to take on too much.

317
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, I know I'm kind of freaking out over here.

318
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.440
Saraniah Aston: That's because you like the

319
00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:05.430
Saraniah Aston: The thought of a group me a family meeting and you know that my family is going to be really intense. So, I bet you wish you could be a fly on the wall.

320
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to know. I think it's not that

321
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.400
Saraniah Aston: What you're telling me, please.

322
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Love the idea

323
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But first, let's take a look at

324
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What does clean slate status really look at your family really look at him, not with wishful thinking. But with clear eyes, the ones that have seen years of behavior and evidence to support what is it that clean slate will look like on mom.

325
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That would give you permission.

326
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To be known by her and to get to know her. So on mom if

327
00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: She says you're a blah, blah, blah. And I resent you for blah, blah, blah. And you go, Okay, I got it you resent me for blah, blah, blah. And you call me, blah, blah, blah. And yes, as much as that hurts.

328
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's over. So what is it that you picture. She's now going to be able to do in order to really get to know you, because it's get to know each other and be a functional family. So, but it's about know you. Let's just stay with that a little bit.

329
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it about her that's going to change with this clean slate status.

330
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.860
Saraniah Aston: In her with her. She's actually going to be the hardest one of everybody.

331
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.560
Saraniah Aston: To let go, you know,

332
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.070
Saraniah Aston: I'm not sure I can't see it, really. I can't see what what what how

333
00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:01.200
Saraniah Aston: She would be after that if it would be if it would help in any way for her if she would just

334
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.170
Saraniah Aston: carry on with

335
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.480
Saraniah Aston: introverted inside herself and

336
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.690
Saraniah Aston: Still not

337
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:23.220
Saraniah Aston: Quite open and I don't know I have a little bit of trepidation right word and trepidation.

338
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.710
Saraniah Aston: Um,

339
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But this

340
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of

341
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You can kind of predict a little bit that

342
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This emoting cathartic experience of just sort of scorch. Let's start over. And let's reboot.

343
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I. Where did you learn that that's an effective technique, just tell me where you're coming up with this idea

344
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:08.700
Saraniah Aston: Um, well, I mean, I studied I studied psychology. So, and I just

345
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.230
Saraniah Aston: I just know that about the family meeting you know family.

346
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.150
Saraniah Aston: Family

347
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.130
Saraniah Aston: Family is singing together hunkering down getting through it.

348
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.280
Saraniah Aston: Usually there's a therapist there. There's a mediator some sort, but

349
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.280
Saraniah Aston: And I feel like I'm that person right now but

350
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.700
Saraniah Aston: Like I have to be both.

351
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.640
Saraniah Aston: But I feel like I am the strongest one out of all of them.

352
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So some suspicion that even though she

353
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: cathartic which means we sort of let all of this.

354
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: pent up thoughts and feelings out that she might continue per same behavior. There is a suspicion.

355
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:07.770
Saraniah Aston: Right, I'm not, I'm not so certain that it will have the full like flush over her like it'll fully like

356
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:21.270
Saraniah Aston: If she'll just let out she's got so much inside and she puts it on me and I know all about it. So I will know if she's not duty, um,

357
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.030
Saraniah Aston: So I will know if she doesn't

358
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.830
Saraniah Aston: And

359
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.570
Saraniah Aston: Um,

360
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.700
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. I don't know what I how I would do what I would do about that.

361
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's

362
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.120
Saraniah Aston: The

363
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:49.530
Saraniah Aston: I would have to just be grateful for any kind of positive positivity that outcome from the meeting grateful for what is good.

364
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:55.740
Saraniah Aston: From it, and I really think that my mom, my dad, and my brother will be

365
00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.210
Saraniah Aston: You know, very open and everything.

366
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.980
Saraniah Aston: My mom is one that I don't think is going to be completely on board. I think she'll get

367
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.910
Defensive

368
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:11.910
Saraniah Aston: She'll just get into her ways of making excuses. Excuses, excuses defensive defensive defensive

369
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it possible this meeting.

370
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If your brother talks about how he has felt crazy in some of the dynamics between mother and son you share some of the crazy making experiences and and

371
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad, you know, if she doesn't have the ego strength to hear people's opinions.

372
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How

373
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

374
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.790
Saraniah Aston: How do you want me to tell her that that's going to be part of the meeting.

375
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I tell mom.

376
00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have the ego strength. I'm still going to come out to you with all of this, it's going to feel like a criticism and blame.

377
00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: On you don't have the ego strength. I'm still gonna come out you. How does that serve. How does that serve what you want a clean slate versus her storming out throwing something just leaving the meeting. How does, how do you prevent something like that from happening.

378
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.750
Saraniah Aston: I stopped her again.

379
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.620
Saraniah Aston: I try. I guess by saying, Mom.

380
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.240
Saraniah Aston: I'm your daughter. This is your family go sit down.

381
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:50.040
Saraniah Aston: Please, and then I will see her lips trembling.

382
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.640
Saraniah Aston: And she'll do it i can i can imagine that she would do it. Okay.

383
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:06.360
Saraniah Aston: She probably be silent for most of the rest of the time, but I could see it some point while she's silent.

384
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.220
Saraniah Aston: At some point, I know she's gonna say something and

385
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:20.490
Saraniah Aston: There's she has a chance. You know, it's up to her to see whether she'll take it or not.

386
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think she has that needs to be said. What does she need to get off her chest.

387
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.650
Saraniah Aston: Well, she's

388
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:37.710
Saraniah Aston: It's tricky because there's been tons of lies throughout our childhood and teenage years and years.

389
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.660
Saraniah Aston: So me made so many stories that she made up.

390
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.390
Saraniah Aston: Um,

391
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.270
Saraniah Aston: I don't know, I'm not sure.

392
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.450
Saraniah Aston: Maybe if you know me, I'm meeting isn't a good i don't know i

393
00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.220
Saraniah Aston: Know, we should do it on zoom

394
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so sorry Nia you're getting there. So now I'm posing these questions so that you can sort of think it through, right. These are the scenarios in and of itself.

395
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Great instrument.

396
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But

397
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, I could try and brush my teeth with it. It's still a great instruments. Fantastic.

398
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But i don't know i don't i don't know how to use it.

399
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.110
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

400
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out a piece of this is clean slate for you. Maybe there's a piece. Maybe you can get the pieces that are beneficial about it.

401
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you be doing

402
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That can feel like clean slate. When you enter the home with your mom.

403
00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: She would make contact with your dad make contact with your brother hope would get you to that clean slate state, what would get you there.

404
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:18.120
Saraniah Aston: I think it would be mostly communicating with my father and my brother, because I kind of feel like my mom is a little bit hopeless at this point.

405
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay with Father. Now, your dad. Your father gave you an opportunity and you heard it sort of as if like, I'm not seven anymore. Like, I'm not gonna sit here and yellow you like a seven year old, but don't miss an opportunity if this is

406
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this might be the one you know what dad. It's not going to be like when I was seven. I'm not going to have a tantrum. But I want to get some things off my chest. So, you know, I know you know

407
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:47.760
I'm

408
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

409
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:55.680
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, he did offer me that. So I might is I shouldn't stake in it, I guess.

410
00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:57.810
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

411
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe you'll write it

412
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:06.000
Saraniah Aston: But these things are so hardcore like to give you an example.

413
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course you can.

414
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:15.510
Saraniah Aston: Okay, so every time throughout the years. When I have tried to add him on like my Facebook account, for example.

415
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:25.500
Saraniah Aston: I post my art or myself portraits, or things that people really really like is if they say that I'm talented and all kinds of stuff.

416
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:47.670
Saraniah Aston: But my father never likes one of my photos, not one never presses like on anything. And on his page. He shows pictures. He put post pictures of family members like nieces that have families that he's proud of.

417
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.490
Saraniah Aston: Everyone's mentioning me

418
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:57.930
Saraniah Aston: Never month once mentioning my daughter, nothing. It's kind of sadistic and

419
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:16.080
Saraniah Aston: If I approached him with that question. Why, how would you do that like avoid liking my photos liking my pictures liking what I say anything that I post but throwing it in my face all these other young women that you're so router.

420
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.160
Saraniah Aston: And he never mentioning my name at all.

421
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 of these, these are completely reasonable things to bring up to your father.

422
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're completely reasonable

423
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.440
Saraniah Aston: This is to my dad.

424
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.030
Saraniah Aston: I know. Oh, yeah.

425
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: They are they're reasonable

426
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.960
Saraniah Aston: I just don't know how he's gonna react or

427
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.700
Saraniah Aston: Seek with

428
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, look.

429
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.970
Saraniah Aston: It's a real thing.

430
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing we have. We can't change his solution to whatever his psychology is we can't change it, but you're you're crossing over. This is one of those boundary pieces where you go over into you go over to his side and you

431
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine

432
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't, like, what kind of father would do that how that makes no sense. You can't do it. You go over to the side of where he is makes no sense to you, but who asked you.

433
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay on your side. He didn't say, Come psychoanalyze me what he said was screen, you need to get mad at me and you need to let it all out. Well, okay then that's a different story. Then how about it's telling him how you feel and the meaning that it means to you.

434
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And drop expectation as in here you go.

435
00:46:42.210 --> 00:47:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it isn't a letter or maybe when it said it's and I want to let this all out. But I don't want to hear. Not for a day. I want to be the one more. I say it all and none of it is undone I some story some excuse I want you to hold it. I want you to sit there with my truth.

436
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.170
For 25 true

437
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: For 24 hours. I don't want to hear a yes but from you, not even with an eye roll.

438
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want the rug pulled out from under me. No, that's what I want to add. And then if you do that, I might. I'll see be able to hear whether my reality.

439
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is even close to what yours was dad, but just for 24 hours. I want you to hold nine and imagine what it's like

440
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To think that only cares about other women that are either even like my age, how come me, how come not me. Imagine what that's like. Imagine the pain.

441
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

442
00:47:50.730 --> 00:48:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm throwing out there is, it's not a family meeting, but we're looking closer at what you really need. Maybe there's a different thing. Maybe there's a different instrument that

443
00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You get what you need it. We've already explored this notion that maybe letting go of the wish that mom be different. That might be a thing, letting go.

444
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'll for your own sanity.

445
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know her.

446
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.630
Saraniah Aston: She's a great person.

447
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.140
Saraniah Aston: She's a great person but yeah

448
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If you see something with that there might be something there that maybe you'll have access to a different kind of adult father daughter friendship love relationship there might be an honest chance

449
00:48:41.550 --> 00:49:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sounds like you're curious to know if I do this clean slate thing. Maybe you'll have a chance to see if he's capable of being honest not leveraging not doing any kind of anything to try and angle leverage with you said ex wife and brother and whatever else.

450
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

451
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What about your brother.

452
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you have

453
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of clear with him.

454
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:26.910
Saraniah Aston: Well he's starting to figure it out. Now that like he'll say things to me.

455
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.310
Saraniah Aston: When I say

456
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.620
Saraniah Aston: Okay, well let's talk because we're both trying to like understand what's going on ourselves.

457
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.260
Saraniah Aston: And I'm

458
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:42.480
Saraniah Aston: When

459
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.810
Saraniah Aston: My God, I lose him so add today.

460
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're

461
00:49:51.840 --> 00:50:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to communicate with each other. One of the things that I had asked was, what's the way for you to feel like a clean slate with your brother, and you were started going into we're both kind of learning how to talk to each other, figure out what's going on how we feel in our family.

462
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:15.540
Saraniah Aston: Oh yeah okay is that he is starting to see that within my time in Israel is when I grew up. I am not the girl.

463
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:34.500
Saraniah Aston: That left 1011 years ago, I am so different and he's starting to realize that, so he might say things like, if I mentioned well me we should bring this up to my dad or to our mom.

464
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:44.670
Saraniah Aston: And he'll say, oh, well, you'll start you'll just sit there and then you'll start complaining about. You'll ruin the conversation because we'll just start bitching and complaining about your

465
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:57.030
Saraniah Aston: Childhood blood, the blood. I'm like, Travis. You don't know me now. And he's like, oh yeah, you're right. I keep forgetting you grew up, you're right. Sorry. Since I forgot.

466
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'd be a chance for. So what would, what kind of things would you really want to clear have a clean slate. Do you need to forgive him. What is clean slate haphazard happened between you and brother.

467
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.460
Saraniah Aston: I think we both need to forgive each other.

468
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like a tool. And let me tell you why I think that you know how you just said, I'm not that little girl I don't make any given argument about me. I don't redirect it to. Well, what about me. Look how I was wrong. If you don't do that.

469
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

470
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not saying, hey, my childhood was really bad. We're not going to go through that. So maybe it's about. Let me tell you what I forgive you for

471
00:51:52.920 --> 00:52:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgive you for this, this and this and here's what I forgive myself for and maybe even hey brother. Hey, Travis.

472
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you forgive me for this. I believe I've wronged you. Here I believe I've wronged you. Here I let myself down I let our friendship down I Brett, I let you down. I I'm asking for forgiveness to he's a different kind of

473
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite like this group like brawl, the

474
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:25.260
Saraniah Aston: Individual kind of thing.

475
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:38.190
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that might be a little safer to for everybody. And you know what, I guess that might be good. Since this is my thing. And mostly, you know, it's my

476
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:39.960
Saraniah Aston: Wish

477
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:49.410
Saraniah Aston: But yeah, that might be a better idea. Instead of having everybody just in a group setting.

478
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's process a little bit as we kind of reach the top

479
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.650
Saraniah Aston: We gotta go. Okay.

480
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.250
Saraniah Aston: I wrote down my work.

481
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.670
Saraniah Aston: So,

482
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:03.750
Do it.

483
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things.

484
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I've circled I've taken some notes as we were talking and one of the things that you had kind of veered off from that I said I'll remember it all bring us back was what has been affection, like in your family of origin and then it led us down this conversation. Okay.

485
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.790
Affection

486
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So something to think about not bringing up a new topic, but I said that I would remind you of something that kind of got for

487
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Floor because in tethering it to how intuitive that was of you to reach out to your brother who was in distress and and maybe the new

488
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Solution is hey hey brother. Hey, Travis. There might be times when I just say just hug me real tight or I might reach out for a hug and it's okay. It will only last for a second.

489
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to do it because I needed.

490
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And I love you and I need you and I get lost to I need grounding. Right, so maybe see how there might be something there. I don't know. Some recipe. I'm just saying, take a look at at fam add affection.

491
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the question though the actual question I'm writing it down.

492
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I had asked you what was affection, like in your family of origin.

493
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.970
Saraniah Aston: Okay, because I want to think about that and an answer right down

494
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the other piece. This has more to do with if I have one invitation. Today it's let's go slow. Let's go slow and intentional because you're worth it, because what you're talking about are healing, deep, deep

495
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're not just the

496
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Many

497
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And

498
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So why not go slow. And if you are only get one chance to ask for what you want.

499
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see her when if you only have a little bit of time with someone they only got their attention a little bit of time. Let's see that you really get

500
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: From that exchange and so next time even. Let's take a look at expectation. Again, we did it. I did it with you with the failing meeting. Like, let's take a real close look at what you want out of this and see if this is the right instrument to get you there.

501
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.030
Saraniah Aston: Right.

502
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then under when you looked at it further on your own. You said, Hmm, maybe this family thing this family meeting. I don't know. That's going to get me there.

503
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And when you got there by answering some questions. I just kind of poked at it a little bit. Poke Poke Poke Poke Poke and you got there by yourself.

504
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.550
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I love your little poke.

505
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:53.670
Saraniah Aston: Just guide me a little bit, you know, like

506
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.290
Saraniah Aston: To the right.

507
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But later on, later on, let's say there are some really profound healing events.

508
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you forgive yourself, your father forgives you. He starts to ask you questions that he actually means it like

509
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Like he doesn't already know the answer, where you guys get to know each other. And there's a new sibling trust like oh yeah hey I'm like you. Hey, we're friends like there's a new thing growing

510
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean time down in the future. You could have a family meeting, but it's not it's not a clean slate one it's

511
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check in with each other. How are we doing, hey, let's talk about what this holiday season is going to be we've always done it like this. What do you want from it. I want to be the things I want to do that. Well, what do you want to do.

512
00:56:45.810 --> 00:57:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's about content and it's not about this gut wrenching stuff, but it's about how to plan for the future. What if a family meeting is let's communicate directly about what we want for whatever little things coming up, it could still be useful.

513
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.860
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, yeah, you're right.

514
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.720
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it might be a little less intense and earth shaking

515
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a neat place. It's actually, there's some embedded safety mechanisms in a family meeting that meeting one on one doesn't have

516
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say it is about, you know, the holidays or something, or how

517
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a IF YOUR DAUGHTER DOES GET HERE. What are our resources and what are you guys willing to do what am I will, you know, I don't know what the topic would be

518
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's say everybody's on board. And that's what the discussion is going to be an interesting thing happens because we're kind of held accountable when there's a bunch of people in the room.

519
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We're kind of we're in check. Like, I'm going to maybe say a little bit more care. I'm going to show some cool things can happen.

520
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's witnesses, so I can't get away with triangulating anymore.

521
00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:12.780
Saraniah Aston: That's why I thought the family meetings, it would be good because it's a bunch. It's every there's no hi Renee are hiding and also that way, my mom and my dad are corners. They have to like answer.

522
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. But the problem with it is in this the reason why I went out of the way I did is, they're not in therapy. They don't have new skill.

523
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.510
Saraniah Aston: Right, right.

524
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Honored animal is gonna bite back hard and hurt and lash out and really, it could it could be, it could go south.

525
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.620
Saraniah Aston: Right.

526
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:34.710
Saraniah Aston: And I'm not a therapist either, so we

527
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to make money.

528
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:37.200
Saraniah Aston: And so yeah, you're

529
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.220
Saraniah Aston: You're a

530
00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Smaller really meaningful repairs here with this this relationship and repairing this one.

531
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then that's the new precedent. And then when we all need your mom can either decide to buy into this new honest way of communicating or she can run her own game her old one. But, but she may look odd now that people are talking directly to each other.

532
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and then it's like, she'll get the message sort of passively without being you're the bad guy here. But then she's kind of watching. She's like,

533
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Dang, my family's talking direct I I gotta take a second. I can't play anybody against anybody. I can't be the martyr. I can't do guilt trip. What else have I got to do maybe

534
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'll just be direct. So anyway, it's not saying your ideas and it's a good one. It's a great one. Okay, so let's meet again.

Saraniah Aston: Already I will be here. I'll, I'll come early this time.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, set an alarm set an alarm so that you know i know you're coming because I've got people on a waitlist that are kind of like, you know, might be here and not

547
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Be good to know. As I'm looking in in Slack to see your equivalent would be the waiting room to see if you're there, and I didn't know you're gonna make it.

548
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.120
Saraniah Aston: Oh, I'm never not gonna come to these acquaint

549
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I don't get. It says Sarah Nia on your name here, but they can't see you in virtual clinic. They can't see your name there. They weren't seeing you. I don't know if your name shows up like the way your name is because, well, I don't know.

550
01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So I look forward to seeing you in group.

551
01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:58.890
Saraniah Aston: I do too. Thank you. I really appreciate your care and your time.

552
01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:01.320
Saraniah Aston: All right.

553
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:01.920
Saraniah Aston: Take care.

554
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.270
Bye bye.

555
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see you.

556
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: On time, no see.

557
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.110
Ramon: I even

558
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.130
Good.

559
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I got the sense somewhere. I don't know where which communication that you weren't feeling well. Um, what was going on.

560
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.910
Ramon: Man, I think it's still that situation where they said I'm allergic to marijuana

561
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:59.130
Ramon: So I think this time starting tomorrow I'm going to actually stop for about a month or two, and see it. That's it. Exactly what it is or if it isn't.

562
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that you're vomiting.

563
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:15.570
Ramon: Yeah, it's that my. It's not necessarily that I'm vomiting is I wake up in my stomach hurts really really bad. And because my stomach hurts so bad I start throwing up because of the pain.

564
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:24.270
Ramon: And then from marriages uncontrollably. I can't hold nothing down I start having like closed almost like withdraws

565
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:31.020
Ramon: Almost exactly like a withdraw start getting cold sweat low on energy

566
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.480
Ramon: The shivers.

567
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:47.700
Ramon: cassis can lay still but want to lay still like it's bad. And last is to, like, like, so I get up at six o'clock in the morning, every day, and anytime it happens. It happens around 630

568
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:55.890
Ramon: And it'll last all the way till about five or six in the evening before I'm actually able to get out of bed and actually stand up and do something.

569
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:10.260
Ramon: And this weekend was my the worst weekend yet. It happened to me three times. It happened to me on Friday. HAPPY TO ME ON SATURDAY AND MONDAY.

570
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How soon after you take some oxygen doesn't happen.

571
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.330
Ramon: Almost immediately.

572
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:38.520
Ramon: Because sometimes what I think it is sometimes I'll take my Suboxone and sit down. I'll hop in a bath or a shower not try to do like a 30 minute shower to let us a box and kick in and stuff, but it just doesn't work.

573
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this has been going on for a long time.

574
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.330
Ramon: Yeah.

575
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well keep me posted about the marijuana. If you rule that out.

576
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep communicating that to Dr. Solomon because

577
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not okay. He was on up all the time, there's something going on that's a significant najah in a fever. Those are significant events like really

578
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:15.060
Ramon: District so i don't i don't get a fever.

579
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:27.270
Ramon: I don't like I don't call for nothing. It's not like it should. My temperatures, good my heart rate goes down really low. It goes to like 3332

580
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:49.980
Ramon: And I think that's part of the reason why I feel the way I feel is because when I get sick, my heart rate drops really low, but because they said when you're supposed to get sick. Your heart rate supposed to be like 5060 and minds is anywhere between 28 and 33

581
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So he is a separate get to the point where you don't make it to work.

582
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.940
Ramon: Because yes, definitely. I didn't come to work yesterday.

583
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.460
Ramon: Or Friday.

584
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:13.350
Ramon: And I had to come in and tell my boss exactly what happened to us at the doctors don't know what it is they can't figure it out. It just half

585
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.940
Ramon: And I'm sorry I could try to come work but I doubt it.

586
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:20.790
Ramon: I can't even drive

587
01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you gone when you in the past when you've kind of dabbled in this idea of cutting back on on cannabis. How many days are you able to abstain.

588
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:45.300
Ramon: Zero. It was more like I just cut down a whole lot

589
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:48.120
Ramon: You know what I was doing. I wasn't

590
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.110
Ramon: Looking as much

591
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:55.440
Ramon: But this time I think Imma just try to stop it. See what happens.

592
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years have you been smoking.

593
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.130
Ramon: Pretty much since I was like 1112

594
01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So like

595
01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop doing it.

596
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

597
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:23.130
Ramon: I have before. Like when. But that's when I was young, I guess I had a stuff like probation and I couldn't

598
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:34.530
Ramon: Because I had a female officer. She didn't watch me use the bathroom and nothing, and I could okie doke. My way but I didn't. I stopped and I did it the right way because I could

599
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:43.110
Ramon: So I feel like I should be able to do it again. That was a long time ago that was like 12 years ago 13 years ago but

600
01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:45.570
Ramon: I should be able to do it again.

601
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when you do smoke. What's proceeding, the smoking. Like, why are you smoking, like what comes before the smoking, as it is now.

602
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.800
I'm

603
01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:13.350
Ramon: I guess is just the urge to want to get high either. Same way, I guess I just want to get high weed has also been part of my rehabilitation process.

604
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.030
Ramon: So,

605
01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:32.070
Ramon: It cut like when I was doing the hardcore stuff. I wasn't really smoking weed at all. I didn't even care about it. But after that, I started picking up smoking a lot more weed than what I was because I wasn't doing the other stuff.

606
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: At this point, do you believe in the science of the opioid receptors. Do you believe in the science of it.

607
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:46.620
Ramon: Oh, yeah.

608
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.210
Ramon: Definitely, yeah.

609
01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that mean that maybe the science about marijuana. You might be

610
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: receptive to as well.

611
01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.700
Ramon: Oh yeah, definitely.

612
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So the science. There's a lot of science to it, but one piece that might be relevant right now has to do with the pruning that occurs when you continue to smoke. It's one of the reasons why.

613
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to behavioral health

614
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people will say, Well, we just want to wait as long as we possibly can for a young person to start ingesting cannabis. And the reason is because it's a developing brain.

615
01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's pruning. That's what it's called when you smoke marijuana. It happens when we're like, you know, old to we just we aren't thinking about something and it falls away in our brain and it's gone forever.

616
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pruning our brain decides, Well, you haven't looked at this thought in years. Why we holding on to it. Let's let it go. And so it prunes.

617
01:08:53.100 --> 01:09:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's happening with marijuana, too. And so it's not actually conducive to learning when kids are in school to a developing brain. And that's what we're, you know, we're learning who we are and all these emotional regulation skills and our brain isn't done growing

618
01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also can be happening now where let's say you might run across a coping skill. Let's say you learn something.

619
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It could inhibit your ability to learn it might be messing with the very recovery that you're trying to get it could be getting in the way.

620
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So just something to think about that. It has a pruning effect. It will just sort of pull away. And that's just one piece. You've already heard about the a motivational stuff. It kind of doesn't

621
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So you already know about all those on. But the people don't really know about is about the pruning, it's not it's not a

622
01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Good substance, when people are trying to learn something new, it's not great for that. It gets in the way of learning and retaining information, because if it prints it away, lets it go

623
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.380
No, I know.

624
01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll keep me posted. Let me know how that goes for you.

625
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.440
Right.

626
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And can't help it. Ask. How's your pregnancy going

627
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.570
Ramon: I'm having a little girl.

628
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:16.260
Ramon: She's wonderfully healthy. The doctor said no. Down syndrome, no nothing.

629
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Oh, goody.

630
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:20.760
Ramon: So yeah, I'm excited.

631
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are the dynamics between YouTube

632
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.090
Ramon: Wonderful.

633
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:34.230
Ramon: It definitely is good. I mean, we still have a little tussles every once in a while, but it's not bad at all.

634
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:44.250
Ramon: Especially not as she's pregnant. It's kind of like I have to be like okay, dear, you know, to me, so

635
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: See, notice that seeing her as sort of is it that you see her as fragile, maybe. And so then it's okay. Dear like that.

636
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.050
Ramon: Yeah, I guess you could say.

637
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.330
Ramon: I see here. Oh no, she's like she glows to be now.

638
01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.650
Ramon: If that makes sense. I don't know.

639
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:18.990
Ramon: Like she's always had a glow to her to me. But now she really blows like she shiny. It's weird, like the baby makes her shine.

640
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.300
Ramon: Crazy.

641
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you doing around

642
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, sort of in your community around this social isolation and things like that. Like how is that affecting you.

643
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.850
Ramon: Um, it really doesn't because I still come to work every day, till five and

644
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:45.840
Ramon: Do my normal routines. But I mean,

645
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.840
Ramon: This last week has been kind of rough on me a little bit, only because of

646
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.600
Ramon: I guess.

647
01:11:55.710 --> 01:12:02.940
Ramon: Hockey urges. I've had really bad batter just this weekend I damn near

648
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.100
Ramon: When

649
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:24.270
Ramon: Filled one of my urges like I was so close to doing it and it was only because I was super sick. And I was like, I know what will make me feel better because the doctors give it to me at the hospital when I go, you know what I mean. And, uh, so, but I didn't.

650
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about

651
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Percocet, or something.

652
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:29.550
Yeah.

653
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

654
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know firsthand because you've had this nausea and you have taken a short acting opiate and it got rid of the najah you know for sure.

655
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:45.540
Yeah.

656
01:12:46.980 --> 01:13:00.480
Ramon: I like anytime. Anytime I called the ambulance or whatever they come and they come, give me some pain right away. And so for nausea, but once they give me some for the pain. I like I feel good. Damn near instantly.

657
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:09.120
Ramon: But it's, I don't know why. Why that is maybe because I said I only throw up because of the pain.

658
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.750
Ramon: Is not like I don't throw cuz

659
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:17.220
Ramon: I don't know nauseated I throw because I'm paying

660
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How, um, how, how far back was one of those events. Okay, it's time to call an emergency vehicle to come get me. How far back was

661
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.920
Ramon: Just yesterday,

662
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were picked up by an emergency vehicle yesterday taken to the emergency department and admitted. And what was the discharge diagnosis. What did they, what did they diagnose. She was

663
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.020
Ramon: Same thing. I'm allergic to marijuana. I need to stop smoking.

664
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:08.070
Ramon: Even though I've been to the emergency room like seven times for the same situation in the past year.

665
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.810
Ramon: Maybe even eight times.

666
01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.890
Ramon: Not including the times I've been sick and just stayed home.

667
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:39.840
Ramon: Because the doctor finally told me, like, not this time I went to the emergency room, but the last time he said, Well, this keeps happening. Best thing for you to do is just stay home and try to sleep it off.

668
01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:43.140
Ramon: And that's what he said to do

669
01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:55.800
Ramon: But it's kind of hard to sleep it off when I'm cold sweat and I'm throwing up in my stomach hurts and I can't keep nothing down. It sucks.

670
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So it isn't just pain.

671
01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha

672
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just a pain.

673
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:13.560
Ramon: In the morning, yes. What if starts out as just pain that first in my stomach and then that's it. And that's all it does. And then

674
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:33.990
Ramon: It goes from that to throwing up and then it goes from throwing up to close sweat and then it goes from costless to just being cold and having to figure out whether I want to lay down or sit down or be in a bathtub or be in the shower. You know what I mean, it's crazy sucks.

675
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.200
Ramon: So it's really, really bad.

676
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:49.560
Ramon: Like, I know I never even with with Drew like that when I used to do heroin and stuff. I never withdrew like that before.

677
01:15:50.130 --> 01:16:01.320
Ramon: Like I used to have like restless leg syndrome and maybe a little bit of diarrhea, and that's it. I wouldn't have cold sweats, like, Yeah, I had trouble sleeping, obviously, but

678
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:19.440
Ramon: I didn't have co sweat. I was throwing up my stomach was hurting like the only thing I was hurting was like obviously my joints. But that's because I was coming off the opiates, but I've never withdrew like that before. These feels like super withdrawals.

679
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

680
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I'm surprised with that many visits that they haven't sent you to a specialist or something because this seems pretty significant like

681
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It just, it's confusing. Right. I mean, if that many

682
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:58.500
Ramon: Both. Trust me, I keep going keep wanting to go to the hospital, hoping that they're like are well go here and nothing ever happens like

683
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:10.440
Ramon: They take me they give me they gave me, Mr eyes there. They took my blood gave me CAT scans. Everything. Nothing like they just don't find anything and they just send me home.

684
01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

685
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how are you feeling right now.

686
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.490
Ramon: I'm good right now like

687
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:34.080
Ramon: A little tired, cuz last night, I felt like I was withdrawing. Actually, I couldn't sleep. I have restless legs.

688
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.600
Ramon: I was up and down on night I was hot and cold.

689
01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:41.100
Ramon: But

690
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.130
Ramon: So I was really I'm really tired today. But other than that, I'm okay.

691
01:17:50.520 --> 01:18:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've been taking I wasn't aware though that there was this intermittent short acting opiate use and then long acting and short acting with these visits to the ed that can be

692
01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.530
Ramon: Was no cuz

693
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:12.450
Ramon: Cuz after like the third time I went there, like, All right, well we got your heart rates too low. So we're going to quit giving you

694
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:20.820
Ramon: Pain medication and we're going to give you nausea medication and give you some else so we actually see what the problem is with your stomach.

695
01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:35.700
Ramon: And so they would they quit and then they give me something to drink that numbed up my GI tract or something. It was I forget what it was called like lick lick lick word something

696
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:44.640
Ramon: I know but and it wasn't, it wasn't an opiate at all. They said they wanted to quit giving me the opiates, so they could figure out what was wrong.

697
01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.770
Ramon: But, at first it was like that. Yes.

698
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you meet with them into to see where

699
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:12.120
Ramon: A man Dr alum and never got into deep discussion, like me, you have like I told him. Yeah, I get sick I throw up this map, but we never got deep into the discussion, like you and I have this now.

700
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've, I've got something in the back of my mind that

701
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the next time we're in group, we may

702
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: May want to talk a little bit further with a doc, you may say, Hey, let's talk right at the end, create a little time at the end.

703
01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: About what's been going on, I think, I think we got to sort of get his full attention.

704
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That this has been going on too long. And I just wonder if there's something meaningful that maybe he could, he could contribute to it. I don't, I don't know, but if I was throwing up as much as you are. I sure want to know what the heck I hope

705
01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:03.360
Ramon: I've been like I do. And that's why I keep going to the ER, but they don't find nothing at all.

706
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look at, you know, some other things going on in your life. Um, let's take a look at some of your goals which is I want to be mentally stronger. What's your assessment of that these days. And what are you doing to make that happen.

707
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.400
Ramon: Um, I'm not quite there yet.

708
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.580
Ramon: But I'm still working on it.

709
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:41.970
Ramon: And definitely don't have that criminal mentality thinking like I used to us, for sure.

710
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.640
Ramon: It's totally different now.

711
01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And I remember that we had some overlap with criminal thinking where I might say that's that's the addictive mindset lie, cheat, steal do anything you can to get this

712
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You for this. Hi, I'm so how do you distinguish that from you were saying earlier you were having cravings. Was that pure and simple. I just want out of the pain.

713
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:17.070
Ramon: Just pure and simple. Yeah, well. Well, at first it was I just went out the pain.

714
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:37.230
Ramon: But then after getting out the pain, it kind of went into Oh well, I want some for next time I'm in. I'm hurting. But I might just do it now. So lets you know what I mean. So I just didn't. It was, I don't know, just thinking about it had me going.

715
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So if someone in in this program has said my mind starts scheming, it starts planning. Right. It's like an if then it starts scheming it's little schemes, you know, it's got this contingency going, yeah.

716
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:52.140
Yeah.

717
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

718
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say I want to be mentally stronger.

719
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say, I'm not there yet. I certainly don't have the criminal thinking

720
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know you're not there yet. What will it look like when you reach this goal. I'm mentally strong how you know you're there.

721
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:18.480
Ramon: You know as crazy as you've asked me this couple times already.

722
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:34.200
Ramon: Really sure I said it every time. But when I'm able just to deal with things I'm able to just like, oh yeah, whatever. Okay, and walk away and not get upset about the little do not let people get to me.

723
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:42.540
Ramon: Not finding an easy way out of our situations you know just deal with my situations of

724
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.110
Ramon: Stuff like that.

725
01:22:47.010 --> 01:23:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is a very honest answer. So what you just said, has to do with upset upsets an emotion reference and it's not about physical pain. This is about letting people get to you. So now we're dipping into communication emotional regulation sense of identity. Those are the pieces.

726
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That

727
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know more about I want to know what you're doing.

728
01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're doing something. So this thing, right. I'm not getting as

729
01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well so funny with you, I, I'm really concerned. I'm going to use the wrong word. And then this whole thing is going to go sideways.

730
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

731
01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.650
Ramon: Why do you. Why do you say that

732
01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To just happen just

733
01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, because I want to freely use words I love them but

734
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get distracted by by some of them. And instead of just kind of free flowing

735
01:23:53.490 --> 01:23:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This scenario where

736
01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the name

737
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Pauline.

738
01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is pregnant and she's glowing that that is an external motivator, keeping you

739
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: From getting angry. Now this is

740
01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: May not be true. I'm throwing it out there to say if that's happening, then when we take this external motivator away. Then there's just you.

741
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the same thing with the opiate and with the marijuana

742
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If you keep saying I'm able to to recover. I'm able to be in this recovery and maybe I'm not doing heroin, but I'm I'm attributing it to buprenorphine.

743
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Into marijuana. Guess what, and those are gone, then to so the part in here that happens, hopefully is new skills. But remember, I just mentioned about the marijuana. I don't know how much of it is sticking

744
01:24:57.150 --> 01:25:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe it's just getting forgotten. There's been some other things that go on that maybe haven't you know maybe have gotten in the way too but

745
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I think you're capable of truly

746
01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing behavioral experiments, much like you did with your friend. That said, think of Pauline.

747
01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way you do your Mother treat her see her that way and treat her sort of with that sort of same mindset. I'm going to

748
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this I'm going to treat her with what you would call respect. I'll be kind to her that worked for you. That was a reframe and that worked. That's a skill that takes you remembering what that friend said, and you going

749
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm offended. I don't like what what someone said, I really want to get upset over it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, I'm gonna do this skill. I'm going to see, I'm going to treat Pauline with the same respect as I do, mother, that's a skill.

750
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way, some of the things that I want to do with your skills to

751
01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But we have a particular dynamic that goes on here that gets in the way.

752
01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so there your progress is stalled. It won't move. It'll only get to like right here right here and it doesn't keep going. Now I've gone into

753
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the context has to do with your, your, in your workplace. So you're inhibited from maybe like doing inner child work maybe some regressive therapy. Some VM. Dr.

754
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:40.260
Ramon: Were Linda was going to tell you

755
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:42.300
Ramon: I have internet at the house now.

756
01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You did.

757
01:26:44.580 --> 01:27:01.410
Ramon: Yes, I got it. Like two weeks ago and I was going to tell you this meeting. So we could do evenings or early morning some, I don't know, whatever you good for you. But if we do early mornings, they would have to be like six o'clock because I leave the house has seven

758
01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:02.310
For work.

759
01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:12.330
Ramon: Evenings it would have to be like six o'clock till I get off.

760
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Work at 5am a bit of a pickle there. Yeah. Now I'm going to keep that in my mind when something opens up I'll, I'll send that to you, but I think that is great news that says to me that when there's a window of opportunity we might be able to have you home.

761
01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:32.430
Ramon: Where I feel

762
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You do a little bit more

763
01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.000
Ramon: So we could do it. Yeah, exactly.

764
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And more psychoanalytical stuff because we're sort of stuck with a bit bit of the light and fluffy stuff when you're in the workplace.

765
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

766
01:27:48.780 --> 01:28:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And that said you, um, you may have had an experience just now, though, we could go in her personal and see what that was like I was bringing up some what I call therapy interfering behavior gets in the way of productive therapy.

767
01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a strong reaction to it.

768
01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:09.900
Ramon: To what

769
01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: To our conversation right

770
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:14.190
Oh, yeah.

771
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what is it,

772
01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.920
Ramon: So we're talking about with Pauline, or the inner child.

773
01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:34.740
Ramon: Because we didn't really discuss anything about the inner child. You just mentioned that you would like to get into more danger child, but we can't because of the workplace.

774
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

775
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see.

776
01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to work on my anger. So why don't we visit this idea. I will sort of stay up here on what I was talking about when I was saying internal motivation versus external motivation.

777
01:28:56.250 --> 01:29:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is regulating systems, one of them that you've been able to use. I think has been grounding in the five senses, you've been able to use some

778
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: breathing techniques.

779
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What about something having to do with an identity. What if there's a way to sort of reframe the usefulness. The value of not being angry.

780
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you like it about yourself. Is there any place that you thought maybe interacting with someone

781
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I really don't want to be this. I don't want to be this angry with this person is that come up

782
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. Okay. And who are we talking about

783
01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.990
Ramon: Obviously my girlfriend. Okay.

784
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I was actually thinking was this guy at work, to be honest with you, I was kind of thinking it was this guy, you're gonna bring up so so it is it's happening so

785
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:58.380
Ramon: Like it has happened, I guess.

786
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Let's see what what do you believe about yourself. When she says something that is just inaccurate about you. She has a judgment. She has an assessment and it's off. What does that say about who you are.

787
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning, do you make out.

788
01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:26.460
Ramon: Oh, my guess it just depends on what she says. But

789
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:33.600
Ramon: I don't know. I wouldn't appreciate it. I would definitely

790
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:37.530
Ramon: Get upset if it was something I didn't like

791
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:42.330
Right.

792
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And what has getting angry showing anger. What has it gotten you in this particular relationship. What are some of the

793
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.320
Best

794
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.090
Ramon: Party.

795
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.800
Ramon: Gotten me to be more big a whole

796
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:10.350
Ramon: That's all it like I never, I've never been like, I've told you plenty of times I've never been like this before this the first time ever, for me, so

797
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:20.520
Ramon: What her letting me get away with certain stuff. Maybe it kind of made me get you bigger ass a little bit. I would have been, I guess. Does that make sense.

798
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so.

799
01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what you're saying is

800
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:28.080
There's some

801
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:44.940
Okay.

802
01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some reinforcing that's going on when she what she said she let you get away with it. It kind of random

803
01:31:52.620 --> 01:32:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your behavior. She didn't maybe call you out. And so because you guys have this loving relationship. Maybe you think I can treat her this this way and kind of get away with it, but it's been going on for so long. And now you want to look at it and

804
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember when we were first when we were very first starting to work together. I was introducing to you direct communication skills, how much of that is really stuck. So I'm not going to give away. Want to know what has actually stuck in that you're actually using for direct

805
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:39.690
Ramon: What do you stop. Good. The two things that I mainly use from that time and error because the single like so long ago.

806
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:52.320
Ramon: Is the listening part Lindner explain on how she feels when she's angry and mirroring the thing. She says, instead of questioning her

807
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that still working.

808
01:32:56.490 --> 01:32:57.150
Ramon: Sort of

809
01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.620
What happens

810
01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:05.160
Ramon: Uh, she gets to just talking and talking and she kind of don't

811
01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:18.570
Ramon: Start making sense. And I'm trying to ask her questions and she just wants to like ramble. And it gets frustrating sometimes because I'm like answer, Michael, I'm trying to talk to you, like, answer me.

812
01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:25.410
Ramon: Okay, well, this is how you feel. But why do you feel like that and she will not like answer the question should just go off to why

813
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Me right

814
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. I'm going to say this back to you and I want you to notice what you notice you ready

815
01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. First, you said, I've been listening and mirroring

816
01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you said, I'm asking her questions and I'm asking her why

817
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They were right after each other to you. Are those two things the same listening and marrying the same as

818
01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Demanding she answer your question.

819
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the same

820
01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.100
Know,

821
01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, but did you recognize. Just now when I kind of caught it.

822
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.050
Ramon: I used about the same. Yeah, okay.

823
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: They're very different

824
01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:16.020
Ramon: Yeah, they are. I just use them in a wrong. I use them in the wrong way in the same

825
01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're just separate conversations on one hand you do fine. Let's stick with the first one, then do you know in a conversation. You can say, Pauline. I'm trying to just listen. But I can't think about all the hundred things. You keep saying, Can we take a second.

826
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: With what you just said, do you know you have a right, in a sense, as a human to say I want to process what you just said. So notice how she keeps you called it rambling keeps talking but you want it. I think just take a beat.

827
01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you

828
01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:00.150
Ramon: Yeah. Cuz sometimes

829
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:09.870
Ramon: She'll talk so fast that I got an answer fast. And sometimes I'll say things that I don't mean or something that I didn't think about before I said it. You know what I mean.

830
01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just wait we're doing it again. Answer fast, all of you, if all you're doing is listening and mirroring. There's no answering. So see how I don't know.

831
01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If I was a fly on the wall in your phone. I don't know if you're doing the mirroring. Let's do it right now. I'm just going to pop quiz on. You see how you do. You ready

832
01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so, um, I felt anxious

833
01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:39.030
Ramon: And mostly anxious

834
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Very nice. Okay, so you got it. So, but you do. Yeah. But notice how earlier said I want to answer her fast.

835
01:35:52.620 --> 01:36:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Slowing down Ramon, if you want to marry someone just like you did just now, notice how I stopped talking I stopped getting you or to mirror I shushed

836
01:36:03.210 --> 01:36:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I giggled, because it was funny because you did it so quickly, but you didn't kind of interrupt me. I didn't quite get to finish, but that's okay. You did it with fidelity and you did it beautifully.

837
01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But I didn't ask you a question. I just said you know how I felt anxious and I was gonna say I'm also kind of hungry and you know and it happened when you slam the door when we were leaving us Safeway.

838
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:30.360
Ramon: Oh, so. Okay.

839
01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So having

840
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That part back because I've, I've got embedded in there. I'm kind of blaming you.

841
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.020
Ramon: Okay, so say one more time so I can marry. Okay.

842
01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, no, I don't know that this is how Pauline talks. I'm making it easy on. Yeah.

843
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.500
Ramon: Yeah yeah yeah

844
01:36:53.460 --> 01:37:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel nervous and and i know i'm also kind of grumpy kid for being hungry but it all started when you slam the door when we were leaving Safeway.

845
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:09.330
Ramon: Oh, so you feel nervous and also grumpy because of

846
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:13.140
Ramon: Me slamming the door before we love Safeway.

847
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a mirror doesn't ask a question.

848
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So statement a mirror is a statement. Notice how your voice went up.

849
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:26.580
Ramon: In a question was, could you put a lot of things in one thing

850
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You did great. I know, I know you did great. But it's also right it's also the way it's going to come at you.

851
01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not even going to be that slow. So here's

852
01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.470
Ramon: It isn't that all

853
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be coming very fast.

854
01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:55.620
Ramon: Because she's screaming and crying on top of it, sometimes not. Not a lot lately, not at all like we've been doing really, really well. We've only had one incident in like the last month.

855
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So was the skill that was needed. The ability for you to to separate for 1020 minutes. Get your heads cooler come back and talk

856
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: About how you each feel like I got myself. I feel offended when you blame me for blah, blah, blah. And the other person's like, well, I felt, you know, unimportant. When you blah, blah, blah.

857
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:37.590
Ramon: And you both. And that's, that's pretty much exactly what we did, because I left the house and then I came back like an hour later and we just talked about what happened, and we were cool like we weren't fighting or nothing. It was crazy out worked out.

858
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:38.490
Ramon: Yeah.

859
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.660
Ramon: But it worked out pretty well.

860
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

861
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that you're measuring how you're doing with your anger.

862
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't get upset. I won't care kind of about what people think. Notice that you're kind of measuring your progress that way.

863
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:56.070
Yeah.

864
01:38:57.090 --> 01:39:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have this fantasy. Maybe that you'll never get mad again.

865
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.030
Ramon: No, I just have this fantasy that I'm able to control it.

866
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:14.310
Ramon: Like, I don't have to let people when I mean controller like don't let people see

867
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:25.410
Ramon: See me getting angry. You know what I mean. But yeah, I could go to the bathroom or to the back end, but whatever. When I'm by myself, but I don't want them to see that they're getting

868
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, but is that is that like a pride thing I'm

869
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:36.090
Ramon: Pretty much. I guess you could say, okay,

870
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning they kind of have power over you if they can get to you.

871
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:49.440
Ramon: Yeah, definitely. And that's irks me a lot.

872
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:57.630
Ramon: It gets me more mad when I definitely see that I'm getting mad about it to like it just sucks.

873
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at my calendar here and just see what what might already be open.

874
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're okay with it. Are you still attending group on a weekly basis or bi weekly

875
01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:56.520
Ramon: Weekly, so far as I know love okay so

876
01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When we meet on Friday.

877
01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconscious, let's just set something up. Then as I can't really tell.

878
01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing I have open. Are these are these afternoon times

879
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.270
Ramon: Taking you know I can.

880

Gwenevere Abriel: So right now I have may 13

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a windstorm okay we'll get that one in place in case something else opens up

883
01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do something

884
01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: At home, that's really good news. I haven't been doing any weekend.

885
01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Work the

886
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The eyes. I have to actually rest my eyes, believe it or not.

887
01:41:55.620 --> 01:42:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to find time to rest them because it's, it's, I'm spending a lot of time online. So it's really important in

888
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:03.780
Ramon: Front of the light. Yeah.

889
01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what the heck it is. It's my glasses or not. So I'm gonna keep my eye out for an opportunity. I'm thrilled that you have that internet at home. I'm excited about what opportunities open for us. And I will see you on Friday.

890
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:19.020
Ramon: I'm ready. Thank you.
