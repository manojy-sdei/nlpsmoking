00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.530
Chelsea Stonestreet: So I, um,

18
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:41.730
Chelsea Stonestreet: I like God clean for a couple years. And then last year, like, just like a lot of bad things just happened in my life and I ended up homeless and I ended up using again and I just recently moved back in with my parents here in Victorville where I'm living and

19
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:56.640
Chelsea Stonestreet: I was going to get, you know, get clean by moving. I'm from Sacramento and then when I went to the dentist's office. I met some girl that was like like it pretty much asked me if I wanted some heroin. And I was like, oh my gosh.

20
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.760
Chelsea Stonestreet: So I said yes and

21
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:11.880
Chelsea Stonestreet: Then I just like decided, like, well, first of all, I got really, really sick. And I just talked to my parents and told them that I started using again and that I wanted to stop.

22
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:23.460
Chelsea Stonestreet: And so I just got really sick. And so they took me to the hospital and then they told me about the program. So I've been using it ever since then, like,

23
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.480
Belis Aladag: A week. Yeah. Okay, awesome.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.700
Belis Aladag: So you take it in the morning and night.

27
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.470
Chelsea Stonestreet: Yeah, okay.

28
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.230
Belis Aladag: Doesn't seem to cover cravings pretty well for you.

29
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.700
Chelsea Stonestreet: Um, my cravings are still like pretty bad, actually.

30
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.410
Belis Aladag: They're still there, huh.

31
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.400
Belis Aladag: Yeah, um, do you think you would you be open to increasing your dose maybe to

32
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.050
Belis Aladag: Do that today.

33
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.600
Chelsea Stonestreet: I'd be fine if that's what you think.

34
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.360
Belis Aladag: Yeah, if you're starting

35
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:23.280
Belis Aladag: If you feeling like you still have cravings, then usually it means that if we increase your dose, you might find that that goes away. I'll increase the dose and you're like, it made no difference, then we have some insight that maybe okay your cravings are

36
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.800
Chelsea Stonestreet: There's more to the cravings, like there.

37
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.890
Belis Aladag: Are deeper there more psychological, we need to work.

38
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.540
Chelsea Stonestreet: On that with the therapist and stuff like

39
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.170
Belis Aladag: That I mean

40
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.380
Belis Aladag: There's so many reasons for cravings, but

41
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.500
Belis Aladag: I know that the medication can help you. So let's utilize the to the maximum capacity and then we can work out. Okay, what else can we do

42
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.060
Chelsea Stonestreet: Okay. Sounds good.

43
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.830

Chelsea Stonestreet: Right state.

48
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.170
Belis Aladag: Right. I mean, I

49
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.440
Chelsea Stonestreet: GOT LUCKY RIGHT NOW. YEAH, YEAH. I don't want to waste the opportunity, you know, no.

50
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.190
Belis Aladag: No. So, so things happen. I mean, you go to the dentist and there's this random girl and you know whatever

51
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.520
But

52
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.730
Belis Aladag: It's time for you to

53
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.190
Belis Aladag: Come in and like take control and like really like focus on what you want. And it's what better time to do it, then now we have to

54
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.430
Like

55
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.040
Chelsea Stonestreet: I know

56
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.760
Belis Aladag: Um, so you were. You said you had some variety in the past. So in those times. Were you

57
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.200
Belis Aladag: Ever involved in like

58
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.980
Belis Aladag: Any 12 step things or any like community recovery things

59
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.880
Chelsea Stonestreet: Well, no, I just went to the Methadone clinic and I had like counseling every week. So that was already a lot for me.

60
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.610
Chelsea Stonestreet: Okay. Yeah. And I did that for two years. So, I mean, I say clean that whole time.

61
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.480
Chelsea Stonestreet: Awesome. Yeah. And then I just like felt like I should get off. I probably just got off too soon.

62
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.460
Belis Aladag: Yeah, how much

63
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.890
Belis Aladag: What at the highest how much were you at

64
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.850
Chelsea Stonestreet: 131 30 okay

65
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.200
Belis Aladag: And it was holding you well. So this Suboxone works similarly

66
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:29.400
Belis Aladag: And so just like the methadone. It's like we want to get to that sweet spot where you feel like you're not getting altered, but you're feeling like okay my cravings are under control and I feel okay

67
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.800
Chelsea Stonestreet: All right. Yeah. Okay.

68
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.530
Belis Aladag: Okay, so you did that for two years with weekly therapy check in. That's cool.

69
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.740
Yeah.

70
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.950
Belis Aladag: And that was in Sacramento.

71
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.910
Yeah.

72
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.920
Okay.

73
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.810
Belis Aladag: Okay. And how old were you when you first started using drugs in general, any drugs.

74
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.120
Chelsea Stonestreet: Um, well, I mean I first did marijuana when I was like 12 years old.

75
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.100
Belis Aladag: 12 okay

76
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:13.440
Chelsea Stonestreet: Yeah. And then what happened and then I just started finding like pain pills and my cabinets. When I was a teenager and just like started using pain pills and then I got some prescribed to me.

77
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:26.670
Chelsea Stonestreet: And then I was just like, totally hooked on them. And then I couldn't get him anymore. And so I was just terrible. And so I started using heroin. So it's just kind of been like an ongoing process of. Yeah.

78
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.280
Belis Aladag: escalating use and they were you ever using IV or. Were you smoking in this morning.

79
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.030
Chelsea Stonestreet: Yeah, I ended up like every time I relapse ended up getting worse. So I just recently I

80
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.700
Chelsea Stonestreet: Probably the past like year, two years, I started. I mean, okay.

81
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.530
Belis Aladag: Okay, so, um, so it's important for you to get blood tests done right to make sure

82
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.690
Belis Aladag: That as well. Did you did you do that yet.

83
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.350
Chelsea Stonestreet: With cross lateral I need to do that. Yeah, I know that this week.

84
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.500
Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah, that'll be good just to get some baseline labs and then and then for, you know, hepatitis.

85
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:10.710
Belis Aladag: City and all that stuff. It's not a bad idea to repeat the testing, maybe in six months or something like that. Yeah.

86
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:23.550
Belis Aladag: Just to make sure. Um, what else can I ask you, tell me about any in the past, have you had any suicidal thoughts or tendencies or do you currently feel at risk or anything like that.

87
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.840

88
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.970
Chelsea Stonestreet: Okay, okay. Thank God for that, um,

89
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.990

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:49.680
Chelsea Stonestreet: Yeah, I have like major depression disorder and some PTSD. So I take Lexapro. And I think gabapentin also for that.

93
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.460

Belis Aladag: Has to It's Okay, I think. Yeah. I mean, I think that that's the best policy, you know, knowing your history and all that. I think it's just you would open a new can of worms with the Klonopin if I were you, I would really stay away from that.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.480
Chelsea Stonestreet: I don't. I don't. Okay, excellent.

146
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:59.160
Belis Aladag: Okay, so the way we are kind of seeing patients in the system is in group settings if we can do you feel comfortable with that.

147
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.570
Chelsea Stonestreet: And then, sorry.

148
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:10.500
Belis Aladag: So what the format is that I would do as the physician do a quick check in with you with you and everyone else in the group. Let's say for other people, or whatever.

149
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:27.390
Belis Aladag: And say, Okay, you know, Chelsea. How's it going, is the dose going. Okay. Do you need any changes. Do you have any side effects, whatever, just a brief check in and then a therapist, who's running the group with me would take over and he's talking about some related topic to recovery.

150
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.650
Chelsea Stonestreet: So the whole

151
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.030
Belis Aladag: Visit is like an hour.

152
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.140
Chelsea Stonestreet: Um,

153
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:40.920

155
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:54.750
Belis Aladag: Okay, so we can do Thursdays at 4pm for now and then see how that goes. You will also be assigned a therapist. I'm assuming it's a woman named Serena. I don't know if they told you yet.

156
00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:05.790
Belis Aladag: But, um, if you would like to, it might be helpful to also meet individually with the therapist as frequently as you guys decide.

157
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:13.500
Belis Aladag: You know, your weekly in the beginning, we could do every two weeks, whatever you want just to have your one on one time to just, you know, have a therapist there.

Chelsea Stonestreet: You know, not

191
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:59.970

192
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:07.860

Correct.

194
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.540

Chelsea Stonestreet: Like a controlled substance basically is

196
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:25.800

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.920
Chelsea Stonestreet: Okay. All right. Something should

Chelsea Stonestreet: I don't know why you don't know

200
