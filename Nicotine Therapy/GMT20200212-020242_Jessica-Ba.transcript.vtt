00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said that earlier you were doing some

15
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like side jobs and things

16
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.060
That nature.

17
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.890
Right.

18
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.020
Robert Hammond: Up doing that I've been having to work over here on the house.

19
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.740
Robert Hammond: So,

20
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.560
Robert Hammond: I kind of put me behind. Yeah.

21
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We met mentioned one of the goals that you want to work on was

22
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:36.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, communication and see how to navigate that. And I know that this this to produce some invited for you mentioned having to speak and engage so

23
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think that will benefit from doing 30 minute session because then you can just be very intentional and focus on those 30 minutes committing to like group dialogue and just

24
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really conversations that are intent and purposeful.

25
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:07.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would that be okay for you. Would that be a good service or 30 minutes as opposed to the traditional way five 145 minutes or an hour. Yeah.

26
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.640
Robert Hammond: That'll work. Okay.

27
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think that would help you feel more comfortable with opening up and not feeling like you have to kind of search begins to talk about four hours.

28
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.270
Right.

29
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hurry, so. All right, so we're going to get into it.

30
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:35.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to actually share a video with you. I thought when I saw this. I've been working with helping patients to identify

31
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:46.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The need for healthy relationships. So being able to identify the relationships that are healthy and fulfilling and the ones that aren't healthy

32
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:58.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I don't know what your relationships look like because, you know, you kind of share that yourself busy, but in the event non to develop relationships with their

33
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.480
Work.

34
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the girlfriend.

35
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the spouse.

36
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:19.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anymore relationship, it's important to be able to identify ways to negotiate conflict when there's an issue, the ways to identify boundary and also identify

37
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The unspoken rules and pain mindful attention to them. But what I did at the beginning when I mentioned I recognize that showing up takes a lot for you to come to an individual session one on one, and it just made me and you know you shared with me that it

38
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Creates an invite for you.

39
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:55.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you really don't know what to talk about so and me wanting to develop this relationship so that you don't be uncomfortable. I had a month mindful attention.

40
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And recognize that it could just maybe just 30 minutes. So those are some of the things that's just a little example of mindful attention.

41
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:21.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you pay attention to different body language and what people say and relationships and try to find a way to find a healthy down. So, that was me trying to find a healthy balance of at this day critic relationship. Okay, so in this deal. It's also going to address.

42
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some additional tips on how to identify

43
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How to work in a relationship.

44
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm actually going to hold off my camera and

45
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Watch it, and then we'll talk about

46
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It.

47
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:11.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My name is Eli Goldstein, I'm creator of a course and mindful living and today I'm going to give you three simple ways to strengthen relationships. Okay, so the first way and maybe the most obvious one. Be kind.

48
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One more kind to others, it sends the signal to them that they're cared about their

49
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:24.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a sense of feeling understood sense of being safe and when this happens, there's a greater sense of connection that occurs and connection is the

50
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:33.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: epicenter of us feeling well them feeling well and then we can imagine the emotional contagion, and the ripple effects taking place. Okay, number two.

51
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We want to take an inventory of our relationships. Take get a sense of who's nourishing to you. Who's depleting to you.

52
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See if you can spend more time with the nourishing people make more connect strengthening the bonds.

53
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:55.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the nourishing people in a little less time of the depleting people, but let me just say this. If someone's depleting and you can't spend less time with them family members co workers, that kind of thing.

54
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:12.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See if you can change your relationship to them a little bit. In other words, play with and this might sound strange play with recognizing that there may be some instability with them as well. And if you send them some kind intentions, meaning maybe happy maybe healthy may feel safe.

55
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:24.510
Maybe balanced. See how that feels internally to relax your shoulders and sending that out. The third thing practice just like me plenty of people around us that we feel different from

56
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:32.220
DNA research that shows that no matter your gender, ethnicity, or anything like that. We're 99.9% the same

57
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:41.100
And so see if when there's people around you that you feel disconnected from because you feel that they're different from you. See if you can just say, internally, just like me, just like me.

58
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:50.490
Just like me and then see what you notice this can happen, enhancing effect of feeling connected. Okay, so those three things. The first thing. Be kind.

59
00:08:51.150 --> 00:09:02.430
The second thing, identify nourishing and depleting relationships, many more time of the nourishing less time with the depleting or changing your relationship to the depleting relationships and your life. Third thing.

60
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:13.710
Practicing just like me with people you feel disconnected from are different from. Okay, that's it. Practice this play with it. See what you notice be curious and we'll see you again.

61
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.170
Robert Hammond: Just need to get that is something I should do.

62
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.190
Robert Hammond: Something I should try to do so.

63
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.400
Robert Hammond: Like I got so many relationship. The other like basically dog depleting

64
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.970
Robert Hammond: Just like feels like it just wearing me out.

65
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.770
Robert Hammond: Like my personal relationship friggin

66
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.500
Robert Hammond: Friend friend relationship.

67
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.310
Robert Hammond: Is everybody getting like taking something from me basically

68
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What ways I need to add

69
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.740
Robert Hammond: It's like they're always needing my help for something or something.

70
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.940
Robert Hammond: But I never get anything in return. Yeah.

71
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.120
Robert Hammond: So I make it like a one sided

72
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are some of those things. It wasn't a good relationship wasn't matching

73
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what would they be able to provide you, what is it that

74
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.220
Robert Hammond: Like even just like a help like yo, like I was having troubles. A affording close to promote you

75
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.800
Robert Hammond: Know, things like that. There were NOBODY COULD EVEN KNOW ME LIKE TWO BUCKS. Just give us enough clothes.

76
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.250
Robert Hammond: You know, and it's like, then few seconds later there, hit me up, you know, asked me for 20 bucks.

77
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And these relationships were they established how long ago.

78
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.690
Robert Hammond: Years.

79
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.040
Robert Hammond: Ago, before I even knew about all this other stuff.

80
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.690
Robert Hammond: So I think that's why it's been going on for longer.

81
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.270
Robert Hammond: Continue to go on to retain. Yeah.

82
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:31.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like in one of the things that I mentioned at the beginning is the reason why it's important to identify this is because sometimes when you're in a pattern depleting relationships. You're increasing long. It isn't until that you really need help that you realize

83
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow. This relationship is fine.

84
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:43.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I've been there so much time invested that it's almost like how do you get out of it.

85
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How do you get out of this depleting relationship. How did you find healthy

86
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.690
Robert Hammond: Right.

87
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.810
Robert Hammond: I went to

88
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.450
Robert Hammond: Keep on going from one bank to another.

89
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and some people, some people have bank pattern.

90
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:27.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some, some people that if they tend to be the one that always helps people, they tend to attract

91
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People that are always in need.

92
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so maybe next time we'll watch the video called the drama triangle because what you see is people that are rescuers is the persecutors and there's the difference

93
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so

94
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:53.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The victims, they gravitate to the rescue people. They always want someone to help them to rationalize

95
00:12:54.270 --> 00:13:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their needs and didn't need money. We need money and the rescuer faithful validated I help you

96
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But really the way to break that Trump that drama triangle is for the rest of the world to be more of a teacher to be a coach and not just let me get you out of this.

97
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.790
Robert Hammond: Right.

98
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe the relationships that you

99
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That they're the victim well in the drama triangle and pass

100
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relationship on that you were trying to explain that relationship.

101
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.300
Robert Hammond: Just basically, I know you just described, all that out there. They're always beating something

102
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.540
Robert Hammond: Always constantly hit me up or company asked me what you know what can they get from me.

103
00:13:53.250 --> 00:14:01.620
Robert Hammond: And like every time I freakin tell them you know i mean you do something wrong, you got to pay the consequences. You know, they're not actually having things done to him.

104
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.610
Robert Hammond: Like they live life with no consequence know

105
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:18.090
Robert Hammond: Let them understand understanding that that she didn't write that you don't really, you know, you got other people that bail you out of it and you know you never learned anything

106
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.400
Robert Hammond: So,

107
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.630
Robert Hammond: I've been

108
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.180
Robert Hammond: I actually did their, their vehicle, the other day.

109
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.410
Robert Hammond: You know what I was talking about. But the consequences in Baghdad.

110
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What happened with the vehicle you cut out

111
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.330
Robert Hammond: I ended up taking it from

112
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.440
Oh,

113
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was it your vehicle. That's all.

114
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:47.550
Robert Hammond: Know,

115
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.670

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh you stole it.

118
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.330
Robert Hammond: Right, okay.

119
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.200
From home.

120
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.060
Robert Hammond: By the balls in another

121
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ok ok took it for me, significant other.

122
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the consequence.

123
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, okay.

124
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: your significant other around right now.

125
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.260
Yeah.

126
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When

127
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.190
Robert Hammond: She

128
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When

129
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He's outside. Okay.

130
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what are the consequences that you see in that in that relationship.

131
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.240
Robert Hammond: I'll just let her know that you know it's not right. If you want to get there and constant money from me.

132
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.570
Robert Hammond: Individually not going to pay back. Yeah.

133
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:50.940
Robert Hammond: Then I'm going to end up taking something, you know, if you want to have me do all this stuff for you, then, you know, do something in return.

134
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.890
Robert Hammond: For free.

135
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.670
Robert Hammond: Do you like to play the victim in

136
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.750
Robert Hammond: Blatantly just went out and did something bad for

137
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in the video. They also talked about the nurturing depleting but they also said

138
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Finding that connection. So being kind and just like me.

139
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:27.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any similarities. You see in your significant other, that makes you think, well, she's just like me.

140
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.980
Robert Hammond: Yeah, but it's back when I was a actually using

141
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.760
Robert Hammond: And that's the bad part about it.

142
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are the similarities. You see,

143
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.410
Robert Hammond: Just the whole

144
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.190
Robert Hammond: Self centeredness and all them like

145
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.430
Robert Hammond: Constantly thinking about yourself, like, you know, whatever you do for you and

146
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.180
Robert Hammond: Not in any regard for anything else.

147
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:56.880
So,

148
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See also when he said he

149
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Said, yeah. Yeah.

150
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.140
Robert Hammond: They're still

151
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.060
Robert Hammond: Doing nothing

152
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.060
Robert Hammond: But it makes it really rough

153
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Areas in

154
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the relationship as far as

155
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kind of like Mississippi goes, I do for you.

156
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:48.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then there's barriers when it comes to writing because you have someone that mind you have other things you don't want to be selfish and added and maximum the consequences, where

157
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:57.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see the consequences, you know, living experiences with the consequences from your actions.

158
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:09.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Slap him. Imagine there may be some frustration, anger, when you see someone that can just live their life you don't be fake it, the consequences.

159
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:11.940
That are

160
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.560
Robert Hammond: Right.

161
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.880
Consequences.

162
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: your significant other shared experience.

163
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.720
Robert Hammond: Or even which ran me over.

164
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.160
Wow.

165
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.760
Robert Hammond: I mean, there was nothing nothing done

166
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:37.860
Robert Hammond: So,

167
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.540
Robert Hammond: They're just

168
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.060
Robert Hammond: kind of blew my mind.

169
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.680
Robert Hammond: She just got pissed off at me.

170
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.340
Robert Hammond: It was over something that she actually did.

171
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.220
Robert Hammond: He followed me when I was walking down the street.

172
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:13.440
Robert Hammond: Got behind me and starting to be with the truck. Now the next thing I know, you hit the gas on accident and literally like part the truck on top of me.

173
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:23.670
Robert Hammond: And then she she just panic. So she left it on top of me. I had a yellow letter from under the drug to get it off continue running the over

174
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.530
Robert Hammond: I didn't think I was injured as it was, but

175
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.190
Robert Hammond: You know, once I realized that

176
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.720
Robert Hammond: All the pains that

177
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm thinking of some natural consequences because last

178
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Week, the relationship

179
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.580
Robert Hammond: Alright.

180
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sounds like you're waiting for external outside stuff to be

181
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What yield the consequence. When you're also in a position to use some some natural consequences, you know,

182
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.380
Robert Hammond: Let's just

183
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fast forward, back to the interpersonal relationships.

184
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:33.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And friendships, you know if there's a level of disrespect that just can't be tolerated anymore in the friendship. You know, I'm in marriages when there's certain thousand and

185
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:43.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Things that had been compromised in that marriage and want simpler in relationship with Mary

186
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that relationship.

187
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:59.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: wouldn't even be as complicated as marriage that's not saying, okay, you see the relationship, but it's exploring those consequences. And your response in that too.

188
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:06.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So one of the key skills in personal relationships is having boundaries.

189
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this seems like it's definitely a boundary that should be established.

190
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:25.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No violence in our relationship. And we get upset with each other. We bought resort somebody, and if it gets to that point. And we're done.

191
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that goes both ways, you know,

192
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.270
Right.

193
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This video is good for you in the sense that the relationship that you

194
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:48.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have developed by lots of different skills within the interpersonal contacts that you can utilize

195
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Boundaries.

196
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You've identified that this relationship that is depleting and not

197
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mindful attention. Pay attention to some of those things, the Bible and what's being said

198
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when notice it take action.

199
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.490
Robert Hammond: And I noticed that I've been doing that lately. A lot

200
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:22.110
Robert Hammond: Like noticing when when things are triggering like this tension between

201
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.090
Robert Hammond: Everywhere.

202
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.100
Robert Hammond: So,

203
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.400
Robert Hammond: If he's doing. I gotta get my stuff and go

204
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where would you go from

205
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.190
Robert Hammond: My bad.

206
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.320
So,

207
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.590
Robert Hammond: I'm just here just helping her with

208
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.440
Robert Hammond: Her stuff for now.

209
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.980
Robert Hammond: Oh gosh, you have to watch that video.

210
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The rescuer in you.

211
00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.580
Robert Hammond: Know,

212
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may not notice that you enable you contribute to the victim all

213
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.990
Robert Hammond: Right.

214
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even when she said her response.

215
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't even know if you caught it. He said she was so shocked that she hit me. It's like I had to yell for her to get it's like you almost made it seem like she was in so much shock of what she did, but she didn't even know how to help me.

216
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:34.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whereas if you weren't in the rescuer role, you know, you're responsible have been. I can't believe she did.

217
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This was my last drop

218
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But even almost the way you described. And you even laugh.

219
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:53.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because of the way you want it to know how bad it sounded so you love to kind of soften it so she didn't seem as aggressive

220
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.260
Robert Hammond: Right.

221
00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:01.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She armed you you were still protecting her and even then you just described in this situation.

222
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:06.420
Robert Hammond: I think it's more protecting her to do is basically covering up for my my thought that I had

223
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.120
Robert Hammond: My eventual

224
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.660
Robert Hammond: Yeah, until I can get revenge back

225
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the best thing would be is to

226
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:36.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fill that boundary, because, like we said, what happened in this field is vengeance for the channel. You don't want to get into a position where there's so much animosity so much anger that you do something that, you know,

227
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.030
Robert Hammond: Right.

228
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:55.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What boundaries or contract, you know, rules. You could, could you set up like a member and elementary that was all these different roles and to be in the classroom to not get in trouble if you have rules in your relationship. What rules. Would you say that

229
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.460
Robert Hammond: Right right now with you during then

230
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.030
Robert Hammond: It's just been like a free for all hundred

231
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.390
Robert Hammond: And 30 seconds memory. Tired of

232
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.960
The choice.

233
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:23.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of identified it. And so, so that I think could be establishing

234
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We won't. We won't use violence as an option.

235
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Help each other.

236
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What else could you think of what would you want

237
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.770
Robert Hammond: Is even just somebody actually has been there.

238
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.440
Robert Hammond: From what for everybody.

239
00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.650
Robert Hammond: And all my relationship felt

240
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:00.540
Robert Hammond: Just

241
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.790
Robert Hammond: Wanting somebody to actually

242
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.220
Robert Hammond: Me if I needed to know my River.

243
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:21.210
Robert Hammond: You know, when unfortunately the, the ones that were there were the ones that when I was drinking and it wasn't, you know, in a totally different mindset. Yeah. So it's like I'm getting back everything I put out

244
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:24.930
Robert Hammond: You know, so

245
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:33.540
Robert Hammond: Like I've had some that were there there, you know, they would give me the bottle that I needed or whatever, you know, do whatever they could just tell me through it but

246
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.940
Robert Hammond: You know, and I was just always they're just taking taking taking never giving anything back

247
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.640
Robert Hammond: Now it's just the way

248
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.990
Robert Hammond: Just makes me think, you know,

249
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think you deserve this type of relationship because of you.

250
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.140
Robert Hammond: Know, I don't think

251
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.160
Robert Hammond: It's good that I guess the year because I can actually

252
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.870
Robert Hammond: Like call things out on it and I could help the person, you know, get them to actually see it.

253
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.850
Robert Hammond: So,

254
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.900
Robert Hammond: Just started work on that for them. Yeah.

255
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.740
Robert Hammond: You

256
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The rescue, are you thinking about the other people, but think of yourself.

257
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:23.940
Right.

258
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.850
Robert Hammond: If you had to ask yourself.

259
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would you ask yourself from

260
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.650
Robert Hammond: Me all this stuff. I put myself into.

261
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.270
So,

262
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think of just one rule that you want to establish it can be the ones we talked about the the nobody

263
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:52.410
You know,

264
00:27:53.580 --> 00:28:07.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or it can be something as simple when I feel like this is unhealthy for me and i think that i. This will take me to a different identity that I don't want to be and I will eat.

265
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:22.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want to create some rules for yourself and respect to yourself and Robert and tried to change yourself into being and then some rules for your relationship with your significant other.

266
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how that commitment. The way you have the commitment to your sobriety.

267
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have that commitment to yourself.

268
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:48.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something else that is concerning is not only the violence in relationship and also the fact that she got mad.

269
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:58.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That does not sound like a nurturing or supportive safe from your

270
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.300
Robert Hammond: Right.

271
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.250
Robert Hammond: To keep the distance still

272
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how are you creating

273
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.890
Robert Hammond: Things that I like staying different different areas. I do my thing because

274
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's the point of it, what's the point of even doing

275
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.500
Right.

276
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:40.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's the point of being a relationship where it's like the way we work best when we're together when not yet. Like, that's, that's an oxymoron work doesn't even go together.

277
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:50.730
Robert Hammond: Like me. Yeah, I know. I know we could do like a good dinner. Yeah, but at the same time, it's like

278
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.670
Robert Hammond: We just don't

279
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.360
Robert Hammond: Know that we work together that it's everything's good. But

280
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it when it's good. What does that look like

281
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.940
Robert Hammond: Looks great. You know, everything's

282
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:07.500
Robert Hammond: Great.

283
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.130
Robert Hammond: Like actually no real religious

284
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.760
Robert Hammond: You know, things are going right, you know, just tell you're on the right path. No, that

285
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: was great. The support is sexy, you know, what is it,

286
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:25.860
Robert Hammond: All the way around. It's like everything

287
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:39.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So maybe enforcing some boundaries because if you can envision, we have our best case scenarios and you have

288
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:48.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you can then identify what to do when it's the worst case scenario, or even in the grave.

289
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:57.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is one of the skills you would use in a relationship negotiating that conflict when there's conflict, how we deal with it.

290
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think your relationship is mature enough to have these conversations with

291
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:05.970
Robert Hammond: Oh, no.

292
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.690
Robert Hammond: Medical Doctor you're like that.

293
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.630
Robert Hammond: Even I got to think

294
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.130
Robert Hammond: About it.

295
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's another indicator, you know,

296
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.030
Robert Hammond: Personal skills of what's healthy what's what's not.

297
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:38.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So good. So my encouragement for you would be as you continue to have this awareness and I believe the relationship is nourishing and leading the ones that are depleted.

298
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Figure out there's any boundaries, you can incorporate

299
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that maybe you can get nourished.

300
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:53.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it can feel like there isn't. And there's a way that you can get out of the relationship and do it.

301
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But there's hope you feel like it's to do

302
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that you're not compromising yourself.

303
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your principles.

304
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then negotiate that conflict and develop boundaries.

305
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.930
I make sense.

306
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.510
Robert Hammond: I've been. I've been noticing, so it's

307
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.010
Robert Hammond: Going to work.

308
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.960
You have any questions.

309
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.860
Robert Hammond: No.

310
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wrap up our session.

311
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you been going to group continuously

312
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.820
Robert Hammond: I WAS. I MISSED LAST WEEK. My very first one

313
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.140
Robert Hammond: And I was going, I was going to ask you about that because I'm

314
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:58.260
Robert Hammond: Like remember when you told me before. If I felt forced like I was getting forced into counseling.

315
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.100
Robert Hammond: And I said, I didn't feel like I really was. But

316
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

317
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.740
Robert Hammond: Now, I know I am getting. Fortunately, do it.

318
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.500
Robert Hammond: I'm not getting my script at all without, without the counseling.

319
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:19.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, if you shut the group, you should get the script that you say eating initial group and I haven't seen you in a month. So

320
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.630
Robert Hammond: Maybe we're being

321
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Forced you weren't being obedient.

322
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You didn't show up in a month. So

323
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:34.170
Robert Hammond: You, but when I go to groups, even when I go to group that if they don't get the script to like they're they're cutting it.

324
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.970
Robert Hammond: So that's why I need to talk to you today, just in order to get another script.

325
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.040
Robert Hammond: Because I've already been

326
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:47.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I will let Dr. Allen know that we had a 30 minute session and

327
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:58.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: still make a determination. From there, but from what I know of in the group. I mean, in the program. It's group.

328
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And or individual

329
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:14.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so he was bridging a script like events, until he showed up for individual, but I can assure you we have shown up for group, you would have gotten some medication.

330
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:16.170
Robert Hammond: Right.

331
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:21.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's just the whole model of the plan. And so to be in his program.

332
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:31.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're not just describing Suboxone there has to be some type of therapeutic intervention, be a group or therapy right

333
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.800
Robert Hammond: And that's why is it i mean i'm i'm never missed the group like

334
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.360
Robert Hammond: Even when I wouldn't get it from the other the other

335
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Person in the email now.

336
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He'll send me the script.

337
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.060
Robert Hammond: I wonder

338
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.710
Robert Hammond: If there's any way we can. Like you can like day and

339
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:04.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm, I, I'm going to do the bi weekly

340
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I'm going to be honest. Robert, what we were doing weekly you were showing up sometimes and you work and I missed out on people that I could have been meeting with

341
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A boundary that I had to establish

342
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:26.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that will meet every other week so that I can ensure that I have time for those people. That's really going to show up and I don't have a question if they'll be there.

343
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.140
Robert Hammond: Right. But I mean, good. Give me said like a certain day like
