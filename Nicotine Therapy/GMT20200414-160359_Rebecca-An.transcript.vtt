Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.690

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.610

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.200
Joshua Ward: All right.

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I knew that you had there was a possibility.

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.270
Joshua Ward: That you have this

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Standing appointment, like we talked about

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So no worries. You're not going to get any trouble. There's no you know no repercussions to it. You just call in and let him know that you have a call an appointment and that you have to reschedule. That's all you have to do.

23
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.580
Joshua Ward: Okay.

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me how things are going.

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.880
Joshua Ward: To go a lot better now that I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting a lot better now.

27
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.900
Joshua Ward: Can you hear me.

28
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can hear you but you're going like really slow.

29
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's like

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Delay

31
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.820
Joshua Ward: There's a delay.

32
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah it the internet connection for some reason has just been saying

33
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

34
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.740
Joshua Ward: Yeah, I guess, and like it like I've been doing. I've been doing a lot. I'm doing a lot better now. Like I'm readjusting to being out a lot more

35
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it takes time. Hmm.

36
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.810
Joshua Ward: As well.

37
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'll get it. You'll get in the rhythm and get into, you know, a routine and

38
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you'll start getting more comfortable just when things get tough. The bottom line is, is not to

39
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: impulsively react that's going to get you it in back into trouble, right.

40
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.950
Joshua Ward: Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's about

42
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

43
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.740
Joshua Ward: I think, I think I got the like.

44
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.260
Joshua Ward: As far as like getting in trouble anything. Like, I don't think, I don't think I have it in

45
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just remember that. That's the pattern of behavior that you've had for a while. And so until you create a whole new routine and you start create and you create a whole new

46
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Set of coping skills.

47
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would be easy to react and respond, you know, in a manner that would be

48
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Detrimental. You know what I mean.

49
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's about teaching you new coping skills.

50
00:03:47.280 --> 00:04:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when things get tough and you've got high stress and anxiety is high and you don't know which way to go, you know that you have different skills and different you know coping skills to be able to respond to react in a healthy manner, instead of not only helping on

51
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you get all that

52
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.000
Joshua Ward: Is man.

53
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so in saying that. Tell me, what are some of the things that you would like to change about your behavior.

54
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.200
Joshua Ward: Right now.

55
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

56
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.400
Joshua Ward: I just like

57
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:49.650
Joshua Ward: It is don't want to have. I didn't want to have the one to go out and do the things that I used to do before I went to prison. Like I just don't

58
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.970
Joshua Ward: Want none of that to come back into my thought process. I guess you should say, I should say.

59
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, knowing and understanding that that

60
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thoughts are just that.

61
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. It's a thought.

62
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have a thought.

63
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then you have a feeling that backs up that that

64
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you have the behavior. So you have the, the ability to stop when you're having that

65
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see what I'm saying.

66
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.600
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

67
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to think that you know that you're always going to react to respond to things in the appropriate manner.

68
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that is setting up for failure.

69
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We realistically, we know that we're human, we make mistakes. We do things that we shouldn't do. You know what I mean. And that

70
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If we're practicing it a different way to respond to react to things. We're not always going to get it right.

71
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What we're going to try. We're going to try to get it right. Five out of five times, but it takes practice to be able to do that, right, like when you would normally

72
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: respond to situations out of anger. We want you to be able to stop walk away. Take a few minutes. Breathe calm yourself down.

73
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before

74
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You make your decisions in the behavior that you're going to choose that make sense.

75
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So in thinking about that. Tell me some of the things that you would like to like to work on.

76
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.950
Joshua Ward: Just like right now like

77
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:56.580
Joshua Ward: Like the one thing I really, really want to work on is my anxiety, like I want to be able to like cope with anxiety better like because I get over I get

78
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:18.150
Joshua Ward: Like when I go to new people around or it gets to viewable out around it and like, like other day like an Eastern we had, we had my, my friends, kids over all my kids, my niece's my nephews and it was just way too much for me and like a

79
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.680
Joshua Ward: I didn't know I like I like walk away from the whole situation like

80
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:42.120
Joshua Ward: I didn't like I didn't like not being able to handle it in the moment. You mean like it just like everybody else like it wasn't bothering nobody else. I just didn't like it. I like the fact that is bothering me like it made me feel

81
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.960
Joshua Ward: I don't know, I just kind of embarrassed me because like I couldn't handle it. I mean,

82
00:07:50.550 --> 00:08:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you got to give yourself some a little bit of leeway. And part of that, again, is because you're so new back into, you know, your reality.

83
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:11.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me Your weeks out. You've got to give yourself permission to be okay to go walk away and breathe and calm yourself down and

84
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, take time out when you're in those situations. So you did the right thing and it's nothing to be embarrassed about. There's so many people right now that are struggling with

85
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, anxiety, like that. It's not even funny.

86
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:34.710
Joshua Ward: Was just like I have is easy for me to talk to you than it is my family because they have never been there like an open person like that with my family like

87
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:43.260
Joshua Ward: They get it when I walk away here, but I'm I come back here, but it's like, Are you okay with matter was wrong. And I'm like, I'm like, I get embarrassed. Like, and I don't like to

88
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.490
Yeah.

89
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what was your response when they said that to you.

90
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.740
Joshua Ward: I just said it again, just, I just got overwhelmed.

91
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, there's nothing wrong with that. Because that's the truth. Right.

92
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's nothing wrong to say, you know what I have to go to the bathroom or I need to take a walk. I'll be back in a few

93
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Guys enjoy yourself. I'll be that

94
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

95
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.180
Joshua Ward: This man.

96
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you know what that's called.

97
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Self care.

98
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking care of yourself meeting your needs, you know,

99
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and the longer that you that you practice it. And the longer that you're you know re

100
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting back into your routine, the easier it's going to get. But you got to give yourself, you know, a little bit of compassion and know that you just spent six years of your life.

101
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean is small, confined structure place.

102
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.830
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

103
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are things going as far as communication.

104
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.070
Joshua Ward: Other than like

105
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.220
Joshua Ward: Like I have a hard time like

106
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:23.130
Joshua Ward: With people asking me, my feelings like I just don't like I have a hard time opening up and I should be able to, because the ones that are asking me and they're the ones that care for me, the ones that have been there for me, but I just have a hard time

107
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:36.960
Joshua Ward: Like I have a hard time just telling them because like I get embarrassed. Like, like with you, like, I don't know you. So like it's weird, but I had to have been open up with

108
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:43.710
Joshua Ward: You, but my family like they're so used to me just closing off and like

109
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:54.480
Joshua Ward: I feel, I feel I felt more awkward talking to them because there's like they're not used to me doing it. So like I'm I don't know how to I don't know how to go about it.

110
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense.

111
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

112
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just got to learn how to do it. One moment at a time.

113
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:17.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, got to take you take a deep breath and it's going to be a little bit of stepping out of your comfort zone.

114
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And being okay with being outside of your comfort zone.

115
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's an uncomfortable place for us to be

116
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the more that you practice it, the better at it. You're going to get

117
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you have to remember to that. A lot of times

118
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:51.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our upbringing and this is generational so you have to remember this, that the way that we communicate has a lot to do with the way that we are raised you know society says

119
00:11:53.430 --> 00:12:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That men are supposed to take care of the family. Bring the bright home be the tough one. Be the strong one.

120
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they, they don't cry. They don't feel, you know, I mean, that has been a general upbringing for for men for

121
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: aeons of years.

122
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so trying to learn how to to be in touch with your feelings express your feelings and not feel

123
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like you're vulnerable because that's really, really the issue when you get connected with your feelings and you start talking about it with the people that you love you feel vulnerable.

124
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you have not been in a vulnerable place or been able to be in a vulnerable place in New Years. It's just not something that you do when you're in prison. First off,

125
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.780
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

126
00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's going to take work. Josh, and it's going to take, you know, again, a lot of feeling uncomfortable doing it before you get comfortable.

127
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing it

128
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

129
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.060
Joshua Ward: Yes.

130
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes or no.

131
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.640
Joshua Ward: Is it. Yes.

132
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.840
Okay.

133
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He came through them.

134
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.930
Joshua Ward: I can break. You're breaking up.

135
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, how have you been walking through them.

136
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.400
Joshua Ward: Through

137
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your triggers and your cravings.

138
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.640
Joshua Ward: I really haven't like this box is really like.

139
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.020
Joshua Ward: It's been like it's been really good like

140
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.360
Joshua Ward: So that's the way I would coping with. It was just, it's just the Suboxone

141
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you still have

142
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.120
Joshua Ward: It sometimes. Sometimes I do, and like when I do, I just take this box and I'm fine though.

143
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have to know that that's normal to

144
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To have triggers and to think

145
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every beginning. Yeah.

146
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you hear me.

147
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.410
Joshua Ward: Yeah, the phone, your phone keeps like freezing

148
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know what is going on with the internet, um,

149
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anyways, a trigger has it's a thought. So it can end if you allow it to

150
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understand that

151
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.090
Joshua Ward: There's no

152
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you're in when you're having a trigger or you're having a thought of use. You've got to change it. You've got to get your mind out of that thought and get it on to something else.

153
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.570
Joshua Ward: But like I've changed. I've changed a lot of my five

154
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:38.310
Joshua Ward: I don't go like I just I just surround myself with my family and my kids and like I don't go out I don't go out and see none of my friends and

155
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:49.110
Joshua Ward: I don't know that I've just been staying home and hanging out my kids and my family like I am been going out of doing nothing. So like they haven't, haven't been around and

156
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:59.730
Joshua Ward: I haven't been around those situations where I've had to be around it or anything so like I really haven't had that problem yet, but I don't think I will. Because like I have no one to even be around.

157
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.850
Joshua Ward: None of the people that used to hang around with or anything like that. So as far as that goes. Like, I think I'll be all right, because

158
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:14.070
Joshua Ward: I've seen a couple people like a Walmart that I saying around with, and like I didn't even acknowledge them. I just tried to dump my head and walk past him.

159
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there, there comes a point where you

160
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Aren't going to want donkey donkey duck your head anymore.

161
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well, you can walk through that Walmart and you're going to be proud of the person that you're becoming and it doesn't matter who the, you know, you

162
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're going to hold your head up high.

163
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.090
And be proud of who you are.

164
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That make sense.

165
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:48.900
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:16:50.040 --> 00:17:02.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because right now with this whole quarantine thing going on. I think that you actually got out of prison and a right time because it's given you, you know, this ability to get adjusted and your family unit first

167
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right before you have to, you know, before you have to go get a job and and and get into routine outside of the house with working and stuff like that. And that I think is where you'll find

168
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: More trials and tribulations around your sobriety right now because you have your house and having family and and we're in this whole quarantine.

169
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:38.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thing you know it's limited. And it's good that it's limited because it gives you an opportunity to build up for when you do have to be outside, you know, outside the home.

170
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.320
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

171
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know what I mean. You want you to be proud of the person that you are to

172
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And not have to worry, you know, and when you see those people over be able to

173
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Walk, you know,

174
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.770
Yeah.

175
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

176
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.040
Joshua Ward: Just fine.

177
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.630
Okay.

178
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me, are you

179
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you doing as far as any kind of

180
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support for your recovery.

181
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:33.780
Joshua Ward: I just talked to you guys, that's it. Like, I haven't really been leaving the house like I got one time I leave the house is like when I had to go like, I went to Walmart go times and I gonna have to go do my stuff for my P. O. That's it.

182
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.130
Joshua Ward: Like there's nothing like there's no

183
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:47.340
Joshua Ward: But I have, I have a sister was in recovery to and like, like I can say that like I've like I've talked to her about it like

184
00:18:48.090 --> 00:19:00.810
Joshua Ward: Because she's, she's been doing really good. She's the one that got me like involved with you guys to get on the Suboxone and because like she's been she's been sober for for three years now, and like she was really bad to

185
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:07.830
Joshua Ward: Happen.

186
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.970
Joshua Ward: I haven't been an old me. I haven't been in all meetings and up like that, but

187
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.490
Joshua Ward: Because there's nothing, there's nothing really open like there's nothing going on right now.

188
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.600
Yeah.

189
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What has she been doing lately. As far as staying connected through this whole thing.

190
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know she's

191
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.180
Joshua Ward: She's just been staying home and

192
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:41.190
Joshua Ward: Cuz because there's nothing really going on like she's like, because she was going to na na meetings and stuff, but like, since all this happened like there's nothing going on. So she's

193
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Busy so

194
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.220
Joshua Ward: It just stays home too.

195
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, don't forget you can always go online and go engage in a meeting.

196
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you need to, you know,

197
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're not hard, but it's my understanding that they're like 200 strong

198
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, right now, because everybody is is going online.

199
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's na online virtual A is what it's called. And there's a meetings online smart recoveries online so you don't really technically have to go anywhere. You can engage in self help meetings and stay connected online until you're able to attend meetings, just like you do here.

200
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.720
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

201
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where were you going to meetings when you were in prison.

221
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.220

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.200
Joshua Ward: Yeah, new ball that like

233
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.910

237
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And all that stuff. He had to document.

238
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:35.520
Joshua Ward: This

239
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have the work with you.

240
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.660
Joshua Ward: Do a

241
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have the work with you.

242
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.390
Joshua Ward: Know I did that I did all those in prison.

243
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You left him there.

244
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.040
Joshua Ward: Yeah, you had to turn a man and they graded them.

245
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

246
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what was your grade.

247
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:09.390
Joshua Ward: Was not like a passing or failing grade like they just wanted to make sure you weren't just faking it to make it. You mean like they wanted to do like the social workers like they would

248
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:19.350
Joshua Ward: Make sure you weren't because there's a lot of dudes in there that just go in there to get because they're mandated and like they'll go in there and paid. There's other dudes that go in there and they're mandated to

249
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.370
Joshua Ward: To do the programs. So they'll go on there and they'll just they'll pay people to do their, their books for them. And so like

250
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:36.810
Joshua Ward: As far as I mean like great them but like they would go through and make sure everything that that you wrote down for that week it pretty much matches up with what you said before you mean

251
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.920
Joshua Ward: Make sure you weren't like having somebody else do your work for you and

252
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then they get caught.

253
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.750
Joshua Ward: Oh, yeah.

254
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:54.210
Joshua Ward: I mean, that was the thing because like in a cadre Bay's like sometimes you have to go in the offices and help raise

255
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.390
Joshua Ward: The books, you mean and

256
00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:05.670
Joshua Ward: Like the biggest thing is people don't realize that they you have somebody else do your book for you like your handwriting is different from everybody else's like

257
00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:13.080
Joshua Ward: That's the big biggest thing that will get people caught and then at the, at the end of the week, like you have to do your booklet. There's like

258
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:20.970
Joshua Ward: Different pages every week and like their space one group their space to group next phase three group. Well, each week.

259
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:32.430
Joshua Ward: Each group goes like through the book. I mean, so at the end of the week. Like, you don't know if you're going to be called on to be to talk about what you went went over that week.

260
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:33.510
Joshua Ward: So if you get

261
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:40.680
Joshua Ward: So like after them. We don't do that until after they go through the book. So like if they think that you had somebody else do your books for you, they would

262
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:49.170
Joshua Ward: They would call on you and be like, Well, what did you think about this part and then other books. One of them, so they call them out on it. I mean, but

263
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:49.950
Yeah.

264
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's funny. So tell me, how were you able to

265
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To work through or write down or discuss your feelings why you're going through that.

266
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:11.370
Joshua Ward: Well, it's easy, it's really easier for me to write down my feelings. Because like I can express myself a whole lot better.

267
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.130
Joshua Ward: On on paper because like there's no nervousness, there's no

268
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.750
Like

269
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.770
Joshua Ward: It's just me in the paper you I mean nobody else and

270
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So have you been journaling since you've been home.

271
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.380
Joshua Ward: I haven't

272
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.090
Hmm.

273
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That might be, you know, a good place to start.

274
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:47.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're having when your anxiety is high when you're struggling with being around people, when you're struggling with a trigger when you're

275
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stressed out

276
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to write it out on paper.

277
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And learning how to leave it on paper.

278
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then come back and review it in another 24 hours.

279
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:05.610
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

280
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you go back and you look at it in 24 hours and you read it off a piece of paper. It just doesn't seem It's like it takes the power out of it.

281
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right out of it out of the stress out of those feelings.

282
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:33.420
Joshua Ward: When we talk about that because I get it, I can see myself doing that. Like when I get aggravated just write it into like a journal like I did in our debt program.

283
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

284
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:50.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then bring you know you can bring it to our individual sessions that we can discuss it and talk about, you know, the scenario and how you got through it and how you can continue to get through stuff like that, you know,

285
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.440
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

286
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's your first assignment.

287
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.200
Joshua Ward: Or I will

288
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.210
Joshua Ward: Be no book today.

289
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and you just, you know, and again, this is why I wanted to know the program that you went through and kind of take a look at everything that you've already you know worked through. Now we've got to build off of what you learned in there right

290
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and so that first step because you know you are comfortable with writing

291
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:32.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's why it's going to be important for you to be able to sit down and put on paper, those feelings that you're struggling with sharing, you know, with your family.

292
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.250
Joshua Ward: Yeah, all right. I could do that.

293
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:41.820
Joshua Ward: And then it will be so much silence, whenever we have our meetings like I could just go over what I've went

294
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:42.690
Joshua Ward: Through the other week.

295
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.880
Joshua Ward: Like sense right

296
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:51.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so that is what we're going to what we're going to start working on in the beginning.

297
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:52.560
Joshua Ward: All right.

298
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, and

299
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I encourage you to check out online meetings.

300
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just check it out. Just go engage in one, you don't have to. I'm not saying you have to go into a virtual meeting and and speak or do anything but just go in and witness

301
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:18.900
Joshua Ward: Okay.

302
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See what it's a, you know, see what it's about. I had one client that went in and didn't even turn on our video she just, you know, observed

303
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To see if it was you know something she was comfortable with and that's okay too.

304
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because at least you're willing to step outside your comfort zone and and check it out.

305
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.760
Joshua Ward: All right.

306
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.250
Joshua Ward: And what is it called,

307
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:42.720
Let me

308
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, I can't because I don't have chat anymore. It's called virtual and a

309
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:50.640
Joshua Ward: Virtual

310
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.870
Joshua Ward: Yeah, I'll check it out.

311
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if it's something that you're comfortable with. Then, you know, try to go a try to attend once every couple days or you know as needed.

312
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.920
Joshua Ward: Okay, you know,

313
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When your head starting to get to flip on that that computer screen and go in because it's my understanding that they go 24 hours a day every hour.

314
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.100
Joshua Ward: Okay.

315
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That sounds like a plan.

316
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This man. So the idea is to get you to continue with the coping skills you learned in your

317
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Art program and

318
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of strengthen you know those skills so that when you do go back to work and you are out in society, you're going to have different things that you're going to be able to do instead of reverting back to

319
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Relapse

320
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.550
Joshua Ward: All right.

321
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

322
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:11.520
Joshua Ward: Is there.

323
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything else that you can think of at this moment that you want to work on.

324
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To big one.

325
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The biggest one.

326
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:37.830
Joshua Ward: I think i think i think we pretty much covered like like I'm really not having like I'm not, I'm not having to cope with anything really. Because of this lockdown. So like, there's not really much that

327
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.920
Joshua Ward: There's not really much like I haven't had to really deal with no triggers or anything really yet yeah I mean like

328
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.690
Joshua Ward: Other than dealing with myself, like all the time per diem having to deal with right now. It's pretty much myself.

329
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.820
Joshua Ward: Like I haven't had to deal with outside like being around

330
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:06.990
Joshua Ward: People that I used to hang around with or anything like that. Like right now, I'm just have to deal with my own thoughts and my own my own demons.

331
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.720
Joshua Ward: I think I might have to do

332
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.640
Joshua Ward: Well, like

333
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.130
Like I'm doing I'm doing good.

334
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so this is where we'll start

335
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

336
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you how do you get outside of your head when you your head starts getting to you.

337
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:37.140
Joshua Ward: I'll just, like, like when I went, I went to my sister, one day, like I started like

338
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:45.210
Joshua Ward: I was sitting here talking to talking to my nephew and like he was talking about. He was talking about.

339
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:55.410
Joshua Ward: Using and this and that and like when he left like I was trying. I was trying to comfort him and tell him I live. You don't want to go down the same road that I went down.

340
00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:02.310
Joshua Ward: And go back and does I do you want to be in prison. Like, because he all he talks about how much he missed me when I was in prison anything. I was like,

341
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:11.070
Joshua Ward: They do you want deals. I do want to be. You want to be a statistic like your Uncle George. So you want to just be locked up your whole life. I was like, don't get into it because he's not like

342
00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:20.490
Joshua Ward: He's just getting into the, into it and like he's like I'm trying to get him. I'm trying to influence them. I

343
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:26.070
Joshua Ward: I opened up and told him a lot. I was like, I was like, you don't want to go to prison. Like I was like I told him a lot of things that

344
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.240
Joshua Ward: And after like after I talked to him like

345
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:37.980
Joshua Ward: Like just sitting there talking about using and doing the things I did like it made me like

346
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.100
Joshua Ward: It made me kind of like

347
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.220
Joshua Ward: I wouldn't say miss it. But like

348
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.270
Joshua Ward: But there are parts of me like that, that did missy. I mean,

349
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

350
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:57.030
Joshua Ward: There's things. There's things about what I was doing that I was missing. I mean,

351
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:57.870
Yeah.

352
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's okay to identify that, you know, because it certainly isn't all bad, you know,

353
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But knowing that there are parts you know that you do miss and being able to change that thought to

354
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do something more productive in your recovery. You know, there are going to be those pieces. But you have to remember that, you know, you want a better life.

355
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And although you miss those pieces there.

356
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot better and bigger things that you can and will be doing

357
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From this day forward. Does that make sense.

358
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.730
Joshua Ward: There's no

359
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good that you were able to walk him through that.

360
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

361
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.820
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

362
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be in there for others. How did that make you feel

363
00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:03.060
Joshua Ward: Me feel really good because my nephew. Like, like, like before I started getting like definitely like he always looked up to me like he's older now. You mean like

364
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:13.890
Joshua Ward: And like, you're so good to me and like I just I just told him I was like it was like I was like, I know I let. I let a lot of people down in my life. I was like, you don't want to. You don't want that burden on your shoulders and like

365
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.650
Joshua Ward: It was a real Israel emotional talk with me. I mean,

366
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:33.900
Joshua Ward: I don't like I don't like that was the part that bothered me the most was getting emotional front of people you I mean like, but like it does feel good to help build the is like I felt like I really helped him out. He me. Yeah.

367
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I bet you that emotion driving it helped them out the most

368
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have to know that.

369
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Emotion is important to be able to feel

370
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you're helping somebody having emotion behind it shows how passionate you are about the subject.

371
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's that connection.

372
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that he probably really needed from you.

373
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

374
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.300
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

375
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You thinking about going in and watching

376
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.730
I'm trying to think of an example.

377
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Going to school and sitting in front of a professional

378
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who's trying to explain situations to you without any kind of emotion behind what they're telling you

379
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes the information empty.

380
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

381
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:38.940
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

382
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's then just book book work, so to speak.

383
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

384
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to to have the information and put that emotion behind it shows the intensity of what you experienced with it and then that's the connection with the other person.

385
00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.190
Joshua Ward: Yeah, that's in my

386
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:07.890
Joshua Ward: In our depth, it would have us do our books. And then at the end of the week, they would have a share what we what we went through. Yeah, I mean, so

387
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.590
Joshua Ward: It's like it helped a lot like like I'm really glad I did the program.

388
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.490
Yeah.

389
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I definitely think that there were benefits and you've been able to do that because it kind of gave you a

390
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like a step ahead when you came out.

391
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you have all this information here.

392
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

393
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See that's the thing is that you already have you already have skills that you've built going through that program. Now we've just got to solidify them now that you're out in

394
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The real world.

395
00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.360
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

396
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

397
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:50.760
Joshua Ward: As well.

398
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:52.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

399
00:38:54.660 --> 00:39:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're going to work on emotion regulation, we're going to work on you being able to stay in touch with your emotions.

400
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that hide them or be embarrassed of them or think that you are less than because you have them because none of that is true.

401
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.190
Okay.

402
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

403
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So, your first assignment is to start journaling.

404
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:24.570
Joshua Ward: Okay.

405
00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you find yourself in a stressful situation you find your anxiety. Hi.

406
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: put pen to paper.

407
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.330
Joshua Ward: Okay.

408
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try to identify what is causing that to rise and write it out.

409
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Excuse me.

410
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Also, when you're going through it.

411
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:51.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Making sure that you're breathing from your abdomen, not your chest, deep, deep breaths.

412
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:52.950
Joshua Ward: Okay.

413
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got to while you're going through that change what's going on inside your head.

414
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.070
Joshua Ward: Okay.

415
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Kind of work on that thought process that it helps you slow your breathing.

416
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And helps you calm hearings it

417
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: While you're writing it out.

418
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, you just have to. You just have to remember in your head that you don't have to be perfect.

419
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're learning how to do things different.

420
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to keep that in the forefront of your mind, instead of those self defeating thoughts that we always get. I'm never going to get this, you know, this is too hard.

421
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not good enough.

422
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, all of those negative thoughts that we have in our head when we are struggling with completing something or doing something

423
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I'm talking about.

424
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.160
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

425
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we want to combat those. All right.

426
00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, because their lives.

427
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:09.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're just, you know, self loathing statements that we have implanted in our brain that we need to remove

428
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because they're not true. You know what I mean.

429
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.440
Yeah, okay.

430
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's your first assignment.

431
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Um,

432
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does this time work for you or no. Should I remember we are going to look at Whitney at a different time.

433
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.420
Joshua Ward: Um,

434
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.930
Joshua Ward: Yeah, actually the mornings. All right, like

435
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.170
Joshua Ward: This time, this time 10 O'clock would be perfect for me, but I thought it was a nine o'clock, that's why.
