00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.830
Dawn Abriel: It is January 30 2020

2
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.470
Dawn Abriel: And with any luck, this will be the intake for Danielle Roja R O H. A.

3
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:40.680
Dawn Abriel: And I'm hoping partway through will be joined by going to view our brielle so she can assess whether or not this in lady is appropriate to the program.

4
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.380
Dawn Abriel: But just write down

5
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.560
Dawn Abriel: The questions that go into your ass and this young lady's responses.

6
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.030
Dawn Abriel: But you can only build for my encounter.

7
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.760
Dawn Abriel: Hi, are you Danielle.

8
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.750
Yes.

9
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.070
Dawn Abriel: I'm Dr brielle

10
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.220
Dawn Abriel: And hi

11
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.070
Dawn Abriel: And and the therapist one of your might be joining us. It's sort of depends on on her schedule so

12
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Dawn Abriel: I was reading over the some of the forms that you filled out and I think I need to understand a little more what it is that you're hoping to get out of being in a treatment program.

13
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.720
Danielle Roha: That's court order.

14
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.590
Dawn Abriel: So what would you like, what, what

15
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.780
Danielle Roha: Are you hoping for. And what I'm being treated for, I don't know really explain this to me yet so

16
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.360
Dawn Abriel: What were you in court for

17
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.350
Danielle Roha: Um, I had gotten dob why this is part of the

18
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.760
Danielle Roha: Smoking. So I'm not sure if I have to stop smoking.

19
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.340
Dawn Abriel: Cigarettes.

20
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420
Danielle Roha: I don't know. It didn't specify. I have a prescription for we've and as time

21
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:17.490
Dawn Abriel: Right yeah and and again if you had a magic wand and you could do something that you want from a treatment program, what would that be

22
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.210
Danielle Roha: But just because it's mandatory. I don't think I need a treatment program I'm content with my smoking. Smoking for years.

23
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.310
Danielle Roha: I quit. What I need to, or if I'm forced to if I don't know if I'm forced to. Now, if that's true, that's fine. I'll pray for to spoken as soon as my

24
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.110
Danielle Roha: hunch minutes over.

25
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.850
Dawn Abriel: Haha. So as far as you're concerned, this whole thing is punishment.

26
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.760
Danielle Roha: Well, well, yes. Um, and understand it was like an alcohol education class or

27
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.290
Danielle Roha: I don't know. I don't know what the smoke okay if I quit smoking, that's fine.

28
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.100
Dawn Abriel: Did you quit smoking with your pregnancies.

29
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.630
Danielle Roha: Oh, no.

30
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.570
Danielle Roha: I cut down like have a bad day.

31
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.350
Danielle Roha: perfectly healthy children.

32
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.790
Yeah.

33
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.440
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever known anyone to go through treatment.

34
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.900
I

35
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:21.420
Dawn Abriel: talked to my dad that would make that would make a really big difference. If you've never known anyone who benefited from it, then you're probably wondering

36
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.360
Dawn Abriel: what the possibilities are

37
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.510
Dawn Abriel: So,

38
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.290
Dawn Abriel: Let's, let's just go through the kind of medical stuff that I need to and

39
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
Dawn Abriel: Will decide which group to put you in

40
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.320
Dawn Abriel: Most of the groups, you know, addiction is

41
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.490
Danielle Roha: The same

42
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.480
For cigarettes.

43
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.820
Dawn Abriel: Pardon.

44
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.980
Danielle Roha: This was for cigarettes. I wasn't clear. He asked for different people. No one likes answer directly

45
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:10.110
Dawn Abriel: Well, addiction is addiction it you know you can use this to stop smoking. You can use it to

46
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.950
Dawn Abriel: Cut down on the marijuana. You can use it to understand what was behind your alcohol use, so it's

47
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.990
Danielle Roha: Good to know. And I made a mistake and I'm willing to do whatever the court orders from a for clarity.

48
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.080
Danielle Roha: I don't know. Okay.

49
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.330
Dawn Abriel: And you've never been to therapy before

50
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.450
Danielle Roha: Yes, I'm bipolar I don't really like therapy.

51
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.600
Danielle Roha: Under much of a talker. Uh huh.

52
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.970
Dawn Abriel: So therapy is different than being with the psychiatrist right i psychiatry gives you medicine X ask you a few questions.

53
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.240
Dawn Abriel: And and then you're out the door.

54
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.740
Dawn Abriel: Basically right so that's not therapy.

55
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.010
Danielle Roha: Yes, I'm fully aware they do have therapists in addition to psychiatrists, which you have to see before you go see a psychiatrist.

56
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.540
Danielle Roha: Gotcha. Okay.

57
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.610
Dawn Abriel: And and in that person you're you are continuing to see

58
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.220
Danielle Roha: You're going to fill that need help. This

59
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.100
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh. So part of the treatment program is

60
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:30.390
Dawn Abriel: To be seeing the therapist once a week, not, not in place of the psychiatry. So you would still continue to see the psychiatrist for for the medicines that you need.

61
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.260
Dawn Abriel: But the therapist is that person who would

62
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:49.890
Dawn Abriel: Answer any questions that you have about what's going on in your life. That's not exactly going as smoothly as you wish it would

63
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.680
Dawn Abriel: That make sense, yes. Do you have any of those

64
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.420
Danielle Roha: No, I'm in school in my own home. I have three children. They're doing great school

65
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.050
Danielle Roha: I made a bad decision. I'm being punished for it. I understand that and nor my mistake was

66
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.220
Danielle Roha: I went ahead and got rid of my car to push myself further

67
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.720
Oh my goodness.

68
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:21.300
Danielle Roha: Well, but I did was wrong. So why not get rid of punishment buffalo, but for and where I should have been actually

69
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.460
Well,

70
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.080
Dawn Abriel: Um,

71
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.890
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I don't have a judgment.

72
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.410
Dawn Abriel: About that you did what you thought you had to do and

73
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:43.080
Dawn Abriel: You know I'm way way way a lot older than you, and I know I have made a lot of mistakes. I look back and think. Boy, I wish I hadn't done that.

74
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.970
Dawn Abriel: So,

75
00:06:47.100 --> 00:07:01.740
Dawn Abriel: Most of them. I learned something from. And my hope is that once you see the value of being with us. It will feel less like punishment and more like an opportunity to

76
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.880
Dawn Abriel: Create a social environment that you get to really feel empowered by being around

77
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.080
Danielle Roha: Okay, I don't have. So after the group therapy. I'm not really my person just personality was

78
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:29.430
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you have to do group and you have to schedule. That's what that that's the nature of this program once a week group once a week individual

79
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.300
Danielle Roha: For how long

80
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:43.950
Dawn Abriel: Until the therapy best and the court decide that you have gotten everything you can out of it. So it's really

81
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.240
Dawn Abriel: It's really about attitude right. The attitude of

82
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.710
Dawn Abriel: This is horrible. I don't need it.

83
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.060
Dawn Abriel: That's going to reflect that's going to show

84
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.060
Dawn Abriel: If your attitude is

85
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.520
Dawn Abriel: I'd like to see if there's anybody

86
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:17.970
Danielle Roha: Perfectly fine I can use a nicotine patch if they allow that other I don't mind not smoking. I took my son to Europe last year for an entire month didn't smoke. So it's too much of an inconvenience at airports and Twitter and all that.

87
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:27.480
Danielle Roha: I don't want to help just but I do intend to resume when my probation is over, or what my therapy or one or more strict

88
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.500
Dawn Abriel: Because you don't see any benefit to not smoking.

89
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.130
Danielle Roha: I've had this discussion with my doctor before plenty of times. Plenty of people. I like smoking, it's a lot to do with legal readily available.

90
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.360
Right.

91
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.720
Dawn Abriel: But there are no advantages to quitting.

92
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.930
Danielle Roha: Know, really.

93
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.910
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh.

94
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:58.470
Danielle Roha: I can see. I don't know. I enjoy it. So I don't see why she enjoys right. I don't want to have

95
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.010
Danielle Roha: A long

96
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.870
Dawn Abriel: long have you been smoking.

97
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.480
Danielle Roha: I don't know 20 years

98
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.330
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you already have a cough.

99
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.870
Dawn Abriel: I just heard it. Yeah.

100
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.340
Danielle Roha: Yeah, it's cold winter.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.650
Danielle Roha: That I have as well. Yes. Yeah.

103
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, well, look, I'm not here. I'm not here to talk you into any of this.

104
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.970
Dawn Abriel: I'm following the court.

105
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.630
Dawn Abriel: Order you're following the courts order so

106
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.250
Dawn Abriel: Let's just go through the history part and

107
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:49.170
Dawn Abriel: Then we can decide what to do next. So because it was a DUI. I noticed on the right of you said that the last time you used alcohol was in July. Yeah.

108
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.680
Danielle Roha: 29 yeah I'm not allowed to have a call during my provision.

109
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.110

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.320
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And how old were you when you first started

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.600
Danielle Roha: Well, I don't know.

113
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:19.350
Danielle Roha: It's not a continual everyday thing I drink socially my family were big drinkers, like, give me a call when I was like 12 okay

114
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.380
Dawn Abriel: And

115
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:35.130
Dawn Abriel: So this is more of a question for people who use other drugs, but did you find yourself needing more and more and becoming dependent on it.

116
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:35.880
No.

117

239
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.520
Danielle Roha: Yeah, just whoever's available. You go to the fair the counselors and then if you need meds. They stop. You went with a psychiatrist.

244
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.440

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.210
Danielle Roha: Yeah, I don't know, I'm not a believer, I guess.

248
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a believer

249
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the psychological

250
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.490
Danielle Roha: Stop. That's like you kind of need to want the help nerve for it to work, in my opinion, I don't know, but

251
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes a while for it to work. You're saying

252
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.530
Danielle Roha: No, I said, you kind of need a want the help volume interest, then it's not really

253
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You want

254
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta want it.

255
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of want it.

256
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For it to work. Okay. And, but you did mention a counselor. So I'm guessing you tell me if you get your little toe in it. Did you try and talk with some person. And it was like man didn't really

257
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:45.780
Work.

258
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.570
Danielle Roha: Her quite a few times just not regularly. Okay, what it was irritating. So I just

259
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It was irritating.

260
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.850
Danielle Roha: Because it can ruin my day. So what's the whole point. Like, that seems kind of pessimistic intentionally router all day.

261
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.470
Danielle Roha: Oh, so

262
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me guess what was happening.

263
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe she I'm assuming it was a female right we

264
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to talk about the past.

265
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

266
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:17.790
Danielle Roha: No, just that, that that's what you do with therapy is one of those kind of expected when you go, which is kind of like why live in the past, I'm here.

267
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's let's live in the moment, things are working for you now.

268
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense. I get that. And you said here and there. So maybe what like 510 times since 2010

269
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.810
Danielle Roha: What are you thinking

270
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times do you think you've seen her. About five or 10 times

271
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.360
Danielle Roha: Or something like that. Okay.

272
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you got irritated.

273
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And this. Let's see.

274
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You were diagnosed with

275
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Bipolar disorder where you a teenager, at the time, we are an adult. Like, when was the diagnosis.

276
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.030
Danielle Roha: Or watch the 2010

277
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.010
Danielle Roha: My one

278
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I by validus whole like those guys did it.

279
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.120
Danielle Roha: More yeah somewhere around there and it was too late 2008. I don't know.

280
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you look up that diagnosis, did you kind of go, Man, that's not me that or. Yeah. Boy, that sounds like me.

281
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:19.500
Danielle Roha: looked it up. Make sense of a little biopsy bipolar basically every female and my dad was bipolar. Wow.

282
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I saw a little something something on. I don't know whether it was paternal side that also had a history. Maybe it was paternal like dad side has some schizophrenia. Did I read that right or no.

283
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.560
Danielle Roha: Oh yeah, both sides, but they're all heavy mathematics. And yeah, so no one knows there's too much math for

284
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

285
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.150
Danielle Roha: Like always. Currently, or that this happened or yeah

286
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's the ideology here. And then I also saw a little something that your mother had a history of Matthew's. Does that sound like I read that right. Yes.

287
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:53.970
Danielle Roha: Though

288
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.690
Danielle Roha: Was that fantastic teeth 30 years of Matthew, so. She has her

289
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole

290
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.660
Danielle Roha: Know her my brother both. I'm like, what, what do you slept teeth like I understood

291
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.090
Danielle Roha: Dr. Pepper much

292
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That is that is strong and animal. Okay, so, um, got that. And so you do get a sense that you're being ordered to get treatment, but your understanding is it's for smoking cessation.

293
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:28.680
Danielle Roha: Well yeah actually have the recommendations here it says to quit smoking, and something about understanding isolation.

294
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I saw that, too. I think it's what Dr Arielle I saw what you wrote, Doc, I wonder, she's referring to that.

295
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.960
Danielle Roha: helps us stay in alcohol sobriety. That's one of the recommendations. Okay, they forgive me.

296
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So my question kind of has to do with

297
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting to help right if help is

298
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.080
Danielle Roha: Having to do

299
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Like if you like the alcohol, then it's going to be kind of hard to like want help with help includes not drinking. Right.

300
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:14.070
Danielle Roha: My probation includes does drinking. So I don't drink. Did I just me. I don't mind, okay, I understand, but it's something wrong.

301
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:15.690
Danielle Roha: Okay.

302
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it turns out that part of what's being asked of you is that you you meet with me or someone

303
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking it's going to be me and we talk about the things that you want to talk about, do you have an idea like let's say it's not about the past. Let's say it's about

304
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: interpersonal issues like sometimes I'm a marriage and family therapist. That's my formal training works long time with substance use. So really drawn to the population.

305
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes it's useful to sort of say, well, now I want my relationships to improve, you know, and that's where people are presenting. It's not so much about substance about the alcohol.

306
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's about like I want. I want to feel good in my relationship. Is that something that you think you would be able to work on it wouldn't be as irritating.

307
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.530
Danielle Roha: I'm finding my relationships. Most of my family. I cut off because they're drug addicts didn't want to be with my children.

308
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:15.930
Danielle Roha: So,

309
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay. And, oh, that's cool. Um, tell me about your kids. How old are they, is it a bit easier.

310
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:31.350
Danielle Roha: Oh, it's a wide variety. See, we just have birthdays. There's one coming up will be 13 and four okay and you

311
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: They all live in with yeah yeah how delicious.

312
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.080
Modified

313
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It depends on the day.

314
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.510
Danielle Roha: Two Boys and a girl. The girls right in the middle. So it's

315
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Like God

316
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Me and and I bet you could say there is a difference. You've heard people say there's no difference. But now you know there's a difference between temperaments between girls and boys.

317
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.930
Danielle Roha: Although I couldn't hear up getting a phone call.

318
00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I was saying, do you, I bet you know firsthand that there's a difference between the temperaments between a girl and boy.

319
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.780
Danielle Roha: Oh, definitely. Yeah. Boys are very calm and straight to the point. Girls like so much more story that you need to

320
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They've got they've got all the words. And what I noticed anyway. And I didn't hear you say that the boys have a lot more energy like there's a harder time sort of sitting still, you don't see that with them.

321
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:33.630
Danielle Roha: My oldest is very calm very mature for his age, my youngest he's for but constantly go and he's basically nocturnal, which will throw everybody else's schedule for a loop because he wasn't dance all night and go to sleep when the sun comes up is that we were born and it's

322
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And

323
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This

324
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This agreement that you signed. Did they say how long they want you to participate in I guess they're calling it to address the isolation that may contribute to the

325
00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:00.240
Danielle Roha: Yoga, that when I guess they require the assessment and and they have to go by whatever the recommendation place that's up to you guys. I don't know.

326
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.460
Danielle Roha: No one's out there.

327
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I guess what I'm wondering is the snacks are not saying I should not take exam. It's like the old man. Right.

328
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.910
Danielle Roha: Rather than another.

329
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

330
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The same sort of effects. Right. So we got, let's say,

331
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you were taking that and then

332
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.000

340
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Recently anyway.

Danielle Roha: Anyone else are you going to be here.

398
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just a couple questions just about

399
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you started drinking maybe as early as age 11 and is that right

400
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.280
Danielle Roha: Oh my god.

401
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.300
And then

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Ended that a sort of use and it was 2021 something around there.

403
00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.520
Danielle Roha: No, I took off from home when I was 1314 took off. Yeah, yeah.

404
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you kept drinking

405
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.260
Danielle Roha: start drinking again in college.

406
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.230
Danielle Roha: For about 1890. Yes. Okay. There we go.

407
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

408
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:19.050
Danielle Roha: When I got pregnant. So I didn't drink during my pregnancy or for the realtor and

409
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.860
Danielle Roha: Put it on my calendar. Every time I had to drink. Good enough. Yeah.

410
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This can be a little nerve wracking. So, you're doing great, you know, having people kind of get up in your business, you know,

411
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.890
Danielle Roha: Horrible time and look a linear aspect.

412
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.580
Danielle Roha: Today means everything, everything in the past was yesterday.

413
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in the moment. Cool. Um, so these questions will will be dipping and it's only four of them 124. So did you yourself even even sense, maybe between that 11 and 19. Did you ever sort of think

414
00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to cut back

415
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.300
Danielle Roha: No, I can't tolerate very much the alcohol. So don't break very much anyway, so I don't drop the seed.

416
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You do drink till you're drunk or I don't

417
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.590
Danielle Roha: Know, no. I used to drink a lot more when I was a teenager.

418
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:15.870
Danielle Roha: All right.

419
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And. Did anyone ever say growing it cut back

420
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.450
Danielle Roha: Um, yeah, I guess, maybe. Okay.

421
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.100
I'm

422
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:34.920
Danielle Roha: Mostly teachers. Typically you're late for class like just come up stuck. Where do you like, well, do it.

423
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so they got through to you, there must have been a few that you kind of connected with and respected.

424
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.270
Danielle Roha: So I like my biology teacher, she was trying to push due dates and stuff. And she was great.

425
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you ever do something that you ended up feeling a little guilty about it when you were drinking that you regretted

426
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.590
Danielle Roha: My daughter's dead. Haha just kidding.

427
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.080
Danielle Roha: I'm

428
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.570
Danielle Roha: Really big on regret. I don't know.

429
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well yeah cuz you're not living in the past. Right.

430
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:10.740
Danielle Roha: Yeah.

431
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just checking to see if you felt guilty about any of the drinking just

432
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.700
Danielle Roha: non violence. So there's nothing really there to worry about.

433
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And was there ever a time even between you know 11 and maybe 19 or something or, you know, anytime where you kind of felt yourself like needing an eye opener in the morning.

434
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.620
Danielle Roha: What does that mean like drinking in the morning.

435
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.680
Danielle Roha: Haha, like in the morning. No, I can't even drink and eat at the same time. It's one or the other.

436
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.850
Danielle Roha: Because it all tastes horrible, like what's the liquor.

437
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alcohol to you taste horrible.

438
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.050
Yeah.

439
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.160
Danielle Roha: It doesn't have to everyone. That's why they have concerns and mixed drinks and

440
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So at its worst, let's say, at the most, that you were ever drinking, was it in college was that more of a heavier time

441
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.750
Probably

442
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So added at the most. And it's not uncommon for people to drink a lot more during college

443
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Degree. Did you ever pass out any blackout. History

444
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: At the at the most.

Okay.

464
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so, um,

Danielle Roha: That'll be done in Los Lunas with the city managers. I know.

475
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You said with the city manager, the community service might be done with them.

476

Danielle Roha: Well yeah, I already said it up to them well might have to wait for days where I don't actually have a scheduled for my children are getting picked up.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And wondering if there's one for via del Sol as well, since that you know that's one of your treatment providers. I wonder if it's in there. I'm

481
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.420
Dawn Abriel: Going to hear. I think it, it was more generic finance it was medical

482
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.840
Dawn Abriel: People who are involved in her medical care.

483
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:22.740
Okay.

Danielle Roha: long ways, not much to look out in the desert.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.460
Danielle Roha: Not until you get into Los Alamos, and there's lots to look at. Right.

492
00:40:59.490 --> 00:40:59.940
Right.

493
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this your first

Gwenevere Abriel: Get it is ok you know it was like in there in jail hungry in there for hours.

496
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:20.490
Danielle Roha: It was just a few hours, nine hours overnight. It was the only one in there. Oh.

497
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.110
Danielle Roha: That's nice.

498
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.100
Too.

499
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.070

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that was interesting.

501
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.110
Danielle Roha: I was released on a Sunday morning. I didn't know that, did that.

502
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.320
Danielle Roha: Interesting.

503
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:41.730
Danielle Roha: Yeah.

504
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.610
Dawn Abriel: Usually, don't they hold you over till Monday. That's what I always heard

505
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.310
Danielle Roha: Or thought so. But I guess I don't think they have a female staff so they called the judge or emailed her so we have to put in there.

506
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.110
Dawn Abriel: Right, right.

507
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.090
Danielle Roha: This meal center that have my room with the next day.

508
00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And how I'm just curious regarding the alcohol and how are they testing you for that.

509
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:09.930
Danielle Roha: But you urine tests. I guess the test for up to 48 hours or something. I'm not sure the to the regular drug panel and then the alcohol, stick with a dependency.

510
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.650
Dawn Abriel: Ah, right. Right. Do you get yourself to

511
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A lab to do it.

512
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.580
Danielle Roha: That's when they have to go up me my probation officer.

513
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, I'm in Florida, so I I don't know where the probation offices. If it's like right in with the quarter.

514
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:35.880
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it hurt her probation officer and the judge are their offices are side by side. I was just up there. Yeah.

515
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get random drug screens. Do they like give you a code, you have to call it in every day. Like how did they get you

516
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.690
Danielle Roha: They told me to go up there and then the watch up

517
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just get a call.

518
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:57.360
Danielle Roha: Yeah, okay. You don't have a great day okay yeah I check in with emails IPO once every week, once every two weeks.

519
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:19.080
Dawn Abriel: And I think going to here we we made the agreement that she wouldn't have to do the bright heart health ones, since she gets so many of these that are court ordered and they're going to fax those results over to us since they're observed in random, you know, they're really much more

520
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

521
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:22.680
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

522
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:36.840
Dawn Abriel: Okay. That way, Danielle. We're not asking you to repeat. I mean, it's not that big a deal because ours are mailed to you and you do them in your home and you just hold it up to the screen. The results and but

523
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.210
Danielle Roha: This way, it's more more

524
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.730
Dawn Abriel: Just one less thing you have to do.

525
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:42.780
Okay.

526
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were to work together. Right now you're

527
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're staying at home like what does a typical day look like for you.

528
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.830
Danielle Roha: Well, currently I'm in house arrest, so

529
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.840
Danielle Roha: I can't leave my home.

530
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:03.540
Danielle Roha: I don't generally I like it here. I do online school I'm doing to deploy programs for medical transcription and medical coding

531
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it a set time where you're kind of limited you couldn't. Let's say me with me during a particular time of day or

532
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:20.190
Danielle Roha: You know, sometimes for tests. So that just kind of pops up. But I'll tell me with events when I have a test, but the rest is just one of these are doing the movie night.

533
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you have any help with childcare.

534
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.780
Danielle Roha: I still want my kids when they go to school.

535
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And your little one.

536
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:36.060
Danielle Roha: He told me he's two weeks past the cutoff date for school for preschool this year so

537
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It was we were to be he would probably be kind of hanging out with. Yeah, yeah.

538
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.020
Probably

539
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.750
Danielle Roha: You bought them making the count them.

540
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, I personally would like to work with you. So let's talk and I will talk a little bit

541
00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there anything you notice about what happened in here today that seemed a little different though than what maybe this other

542
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: therapists that you are me meeting with it via del Sol. Did it seem a little different.

543
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:15.240
Danielle Roha: Nothing else is pretty much the same. I did to substance abuse assessments, basically. Same person on the phone doesn't seem to matter much.

544
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Familiar with the online experience. I mean, this is like

545
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.900
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's great for you.

546
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.290
Danielle Roha: I'm a bit of a lot. I'm not a big fan of technology. I prefer paper.

547
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe not. I got you.

548
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:35.730
Danielle Roha: I don't really know how to use most technology all the kids to help me by phone with, I don't know what to do. So I should avoid those the buttons.

549
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you take your tests online right you're doing that part.

550
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:50.280
Danielle Roha: Simple, like other than simple like here, put this, you're not gonna get much more than me, like, I don't know how to make a chat room. I don't know how, like, Yeah, I can't do basic computer stuff.

551
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This one doesn't ask much it's once you get the zoom room. You just plug it in. So basically, everything you know right now is pretty much all you're going to need to know

552
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.500
Danielle Roha: About Us through a lot of pictures of people

553
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.260
Dawn Abriel: Guys.

554
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.830
Danielle Roha: Yeah, you guys got like a fourth of the just do this as a job tomorrow, March, he

555
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.880
Danielle Roha: Thinks

556
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because speaker view. If you go to the right and change it if you want to. If you're on a phone, you can kind of wake it up and at least on my computer. Anyway, there's a choice of gallery view or speaker view will stop jumping around.

557
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.600
Danielle Roha: At marks, though.

558
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.100
And

559
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.740
Danielle Roha: And

560
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.260
Dawn Abriel: Is a care coordinator

561
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.740
Dawn Abriel: He's not actually on with us.

562
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.210
Dawn Abriel: He probably

563
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.690
Dawn Abriel: He helped you get in here.

564
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.550
Danielle Roha: I thought you're gonna

565
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.760
Danielle Roha: Do the cost cutting

566
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.010
Dawn Abriel: Edge ed is in charge of all the care coordinators.

567
00:46:53.130 --> 00:47:05.280
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so he was probably helping this guy help you and that's why yes but yeah if you and if you swipe the screen you can see everyone

568
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.090
Dawn Abriel: And if you get a when a call comes in, it puts you on mute.

569
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:13.620
Danielle Roha: Okay.

570
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Last question. What's the name of your, your pretrial release officer.

571
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.270
Danielle Roha: Same as my probation officer Monica.

572
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.710
Dawn Abriel: weiner.

573
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.840
Danielle Roha: Yeah, they should get married, like couple weeks ago.

574
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.620
Dawn Abriel: She did.

575
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:32.940
Dawn Abriel: On her card, she scratched down to her name and put it in. Yeah, I just

576
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.140
Danielle Roha: All I did was the email was different with different name. I'm like, wait a minute. Yeah.

577
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.520
Dawn Abriel: I can send that to you going to be here with her phone number. Okay.

578
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it was a pleasure to meet you. And I guess we'll be getting that assessment out

579
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:51.120
Dawn Abriel: Do we, do we want to decide which group, she would be

580
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I guess I am thinking that you and I need to talk, but

581
00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.820
Danielle Roha: I'm assuming groups. I'm just gonna sit there quietly I'm

582
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.480
Danielle Roha: Not a big group person. Yeah.

583
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We have groups that are at night. Well, do you want to be the provider, Doc.

584
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:14.730
Dawn Abriel: Either way,

585
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:21.150
Dawn Abriel: I don't, I think I should be because I have gone up to the court and talk to the

586
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.600
Dawn Abriel: Judge and her probation officer.

587
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.050
Dawn Abriel: Just think. I think it'd be easier for Danielle. If I'm

588
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.820
Dawn Abriel: There's that continuity.

589
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:30.690
Danielle Roha: Mother and daughter.

590

Danielle Roha: Yeah, no medication whatsoever.

857
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.370
Dawn Abriel: I don't think you need that needed. I think this is

858
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:33.420
Dawn Abriel: This is going to be fairly brief and pretty simple.

859
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:36.960
Dawn Abriel: I think you'll

860
01:07:38.400 --> 01:08:02.820
Dawn Abriel: It just so happens that I've been putting together a program for. There are a lot of people who are opioid use users who want to quit smoking. So my whole emphasis of the last month has been about smoking cessation, so you'll hear me pushing that because they want to quit. So

861
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:05.850
Danielle Roha: Like you said,

862
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.870
Danielle Roha: Basically a tobacco lobbyists.

863
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:13.860
Dawn Abriel: And

864
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.130
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, like you said it, you really have to want it to.

865
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:31.950
Dawn Abriel: To quit and my job isn't to scare you and tell you ugly stories because I'm sure you've heard them and when you're motivated, you know, you'll

866
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:43.170
Dawn Abriel: You'll do it when you're ready, but you will have the information you need for when you're ready, you'll you'll watch these people struggling and and succeeding and and getting it done so.

867
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:49.680
Dawn Abriel: You don't have to do the urine drug screen. So that's a blessing and

868
01:08:50.700 --> 01:09:02.070
Dawn Abriel: You do have to go back to zoom to the virtual clinic and you have to do one more survey. It's called the ACE AC.

869
01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:16.800
Dawn Abriel: It's called the adverse childhood events. It just gives us a good feel for what your early childhood traumas were the 10 questions one time. You just check it off and you're done.

870
01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:34.200
Dawn Abriel: In when you're in group, it has to be just like this. Good lighting there can't be anyone walking around, because if anyone looks on your screen and see someone they know it would be just a huge violation of privacy right so

871
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:39.240
Danielle Roha: I don't know if I'll be able to find a babysitter. Every time though that's the one issue well

872
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:47.130
Dawn Abriel: To have a child, you know, watching TV nearby. I mean, as long as we don't have to hear the TV. That's fine.

873
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:47.880
Okay.

874
01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:53.520
Dawn Abriel: It just can't be anyone like watching your phone.

875
01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:54.630
Okay.

876
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.190
Dawn Abriel: They do ask that if you've got any kind of earbuds

877
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:07.620
Dawn Abriel: If you could borrow some that way. No one else is hearing what other people are saying coming through your phone.

878
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.220
Dawn Abriel: And

879
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:21.930
Dawn Abriel: So I'm not going to order you any medicine so you don't have to know that I do eat prescriptions. So really all you need to do is show up Monday at one

880
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:36.090
Dawn Abriel: And get your appointment with Guinevere so she's the main person in charge of what the curriculum will look like for you and communicating with the probation officer and

881
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.430
Judge Allen.

882
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:39.780
Danielle Roha: Okay.

883
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.760
Dawn Abriel: Do you have any questions.

884
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.890
Danielle Roha: My court order to quit smoking.

885
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.880

886
01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:02.250
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I'm not clear, either on. So let me get ahold of Monica and I'll see. Okay.

887
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.900
Danielle Roha: Okay.

888
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:15.060
Dawn Abriel: Well, I, I'm glad we finally got to connect. I'm I hope it wasn't as awful as you thought it would be. And

889
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:17.100
Dawn Abriel: Have a good weekend.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:18.180
