00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.620
Jo Delgadillo: And I've been going crazy.

3
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.990
Jo Delgadillo: Trying to find perfect because we always said, oh, because we're like in a rush, or are we just like hurry up. Want to get into. And I'm trying so hard to be patient.

4
00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:00.570
Jo Delgadillo: And let things fall into place. Well, today I posted on one of these sites on Facebook, what I was looking for three bedroom or more pro hundred under and it except Stokes.

5
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.970
Jo Delgadillo: Well, a lady messaged me last night.

6
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:16.950
Jo Delgadillo: And says to inbox, or like private messenger. So I did. So she's telling me she has three bedroom house and that it's moving ready and we're going to do is your first and last and $100 deposit for each dog like cool

7
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.090
Jo Delgadillo: Sounds good, because we had the money. Well, we go look at it this morning she you know this lock boxes they put them on the door.

8
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.280
Jo Delgadillo: Number and she gave us the number to type in, and everything. We went in. We literally went in this House, we got to stay there for 30 minutes and it was gorgeous like was huge and

9
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The yard.

10
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.720
Jo Delgadillo: Was a dream come true. And I'm like, it's too good to be true. And then I'm like, stop being negative because I go there, like

11
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.430
Jo Delgadillo: All the time doing that.

12
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.350
Jo Delgadillo: My kids do it too. Now,

13
00:01:48.540 --> 00:02:05.430
Jo Delgadillo: We got to stop doing that, like stay on one level and stay there. Well, she starts messaging me and then stop messaged me. Well, we're leaving walking out the door. Someone else is coming in and I'm like, she told us that like we were like basically showing like we were going to get it.

14
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.670
Jo Delgadillo: Look at it more like

15
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.680
Jo Delgadillo: Good to go. Well, I started thinking she won't answer my phone calls. And then when I call it was a calling app that was one red flag.

16
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.020
Jo Delgadillo: And then another red flag was

17
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:36.060
Jo Delgadillo: She wouldn't answer. I don't sound like what shocked me. So she messaged us back saying that she works at a hospital or she's out of hospital and I'm just like, Okay. And I'm like, this has to be wrong. So I started doing my little CSI thing and I put the address into

18
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Froze Joe

19
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Joe froze.

20
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hey,

21
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.210
Jo Delgadillo: Lady is still messaging me

22
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.040
Jo Delgadillo: Claiming that this is her house.

23
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.900
Jo Delgadillo: And I'm still in contact with the rule.

24
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.610
Jo Delgadillo: The lady from the religious replace

25
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.060
Jo Delgadillo: Houses 1300, you have to make triple

26
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.970
Jo Delgadillo: M of the house, rent, which he doesn't he makes a little under that so we wouldn't qualify and we have to have our credit score at least 500 which

27
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:54.600
Jo Delgadillo: Is credit, credit scores 534 so we would qualify network. And so I'm like, trying to get it from a real estate lady in which we wouldn't saw just like, whatever. Well, the lady tells me it's my house. I'll meet you there Sunday.

28
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.010
Jo Delgadillo: And the lady. Yes, the router lady swears up and down. It's not this lady's house.

29
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.520
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know what to believe, like

30
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.060
Jo Delgadillo: Your house and you just didn't want to go through the

31
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.220
Jo Delgadillo: People I have them.

32
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.260
Jo Delgadillo: And I asked her, I will get this house from you if you can

33
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:25.770
Jo Delgadillo: Prove to me that it's your house and my grandma used to be. She used to own a whole bunch of houses in California. So she told me to go through their credit assessor thingy and

34
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
Jo Delgadillo: I'm waiting for them to email me back to see her whose name of the houses under she can't

35
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.670
Jo Delgadillo: They can't tell me

36
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.770
Jo Delgadillo: Sister Kim credit assessor whatever you call them. So it's crazy.

37
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That seems so complicated and and just like the uncertainty of it all. I mean, I don't even know if I would explore in

38
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.600
Jo Delgadillo: My head is

39
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.710
Jo Delgadillo: But I started messaging other people that she's commented to and they suspect the same thing that is a scam.

40
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.260
Jo Delgadillo: Don't want to meet. Nobody should

41
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.080
Jo Delgadillo: If that's your house. And that's a gorgeous else you would want to know who's going in your house.

42
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.060
Jo Delgadillo: No, I would, and I

43
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.190
Jo Delgadillo: When she first started talking to me. I told her. Stop talking to me and go to my Facebook and investigate me a little

44
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.920
Jo Delgadillo: About that I should have

45
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.860
Jo Delgadillo: Like a light bulb should have went on.

46
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.060
Jo Delgadillo: Anybody into your house.

47
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.080
Jo Delgadillo: still staying at my grandma's house sleeping on her couch.

48
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.760
Jo Delgadillo: In the living room floor.

49
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.630
Jo Delgadillo: I can't do that little RV no more. I can do.

50
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.140
Jo Delgadillo: Crazy. I was going crazy.

51
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.260
Jo Delgadillo: And now being here is stressing me out because it's costing us a lot of money because you can buy everything to the paper groceries and

52
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.010
Jo Delgadillo: It sucks. Everyone stuck in here. So they just sit around on their asses eaten all day and I can't get mad because what what else are they gonna do

53
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.660
Jo Delgadillo: What I can to keep everybody busy, but there's just so long I can keep them busy.

54
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.660
Jo Delgadillo: Sucks. I just don't know what to do now.

55
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What routes for you using beforehand to to be able to find them on.

56
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:30.960
Jo Delgadillo: Facebook and we were starting with Zillow but we don't qualify for none of that. So we have to go through like a person that owns the house in the second right now. But that's hard because nobody wants to meet with you right now because of the quarantine thing. And they're scared.

57
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.610
Jo Delgadillo: And you really can't blame them. But

58
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:41.640
Jo Delgadillo: If we had a few more thousand dollars we can get this RV that has a bunker in it and live in that like kids to be happy in that

59
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.430
Jo Delgadillo: Into like I don't want a big house.

60
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:52.620
Jo Delgadillo: We don't spend time with each other for the big house. Everybody just goes to their supper room and we forget about each other. I don't want that to happen again. So

61
00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.290
Jo Delgadillo: He doesn't get it. He's like, it's too small will be prompted. I'm like, No, it's you're looking at it that way. I'm looking at is, we'll spend time with each other.

62
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: actually eat at the dinner table and we used to do that, we looked at our other house.

63
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:17.340
Jo Delgadillo: It was smaller. We all ate dinner together. We don't do that. No more. I was used to my whole childhood, we no matter what. Even if everybody was fighting and being crazy, we always had dinner together.

64
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.410
Jo Delgadillo: Even if we didn't talk to each other.

65
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:27.540
Jo Delgadillo: They made sure if you were not home for dinner, you can eat. You had to be there to eat with everybody. Right, so we can see your faces.

66
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.620
Jo Delgadillo: I missed that.

67
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:37.320
Jo Delgadillo: I want my kids to have that I had a crazy channels, but it was. That's the one thing I miss in our family days like we had family.

68
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:48.570
Jo Delgadillo: Days, where it would cover all the windows in our house and it put signs on the door that nobody can not, no matter who you are, don't bother us. We're having family day and we would make forts in the house.

69
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

70
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.560
Jo Delgadillo: Put the TV.

71
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.310
Jo Delgadillo: Reports like I missed that. I want to tell my kids.

72
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.440
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I don't, I don't want to rush, but I feel like I'm about to what I feel it coming.

73
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That, that, that's the anxiety speaking, that's the

74
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety telling you to hurry up act now and

75
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:17.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you said, there's a whole pandemic going on, you know, the good news is that you have shelter. It's not the ideal shelter, but you have shelter and you're in that shelter with the people you love.

76
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:28.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're not in a violent relationship where you need to get out asap because your life is in jeopardy. Your kids are safe. You're in a safe relationship so

77
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:38.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just say, You know what, I'm not in my ideal situation, but eventually I will be because this seems like a red flag. I would pursue it anymore with this person.

78
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:48.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and when everything dies down, you'll be able to find wisdom, you know, more options and me. This is more time to just save up even more money to get

79
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something that's a little more ideal for the family. Yeah, we've spent

80
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.490
Jo Delgadillo: Like $1,000 in like three weeks on groceries.

81
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:06.750
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, but yesterday I checked my food stamp card and I had $1,400 a food stamps. I was like, wait, what I had to show everybody

82
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:21.750
Jo Delgadillo: Because I thought I was hallucinating and everybody is laughing. And I'm like, that's right. Right. You read that, too. And they're like, Yeah. And then I got a letter today. It's for April 714 for April and 714 for March, because of the pandemic. They're helping people out

83
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.770
Jo Delgadillo: So that means we don't have to touch our cash.

84
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.490
Jo Delgadillo: To watch it grow so we can move

85
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes.

86
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.140
Jo Delgadillo: We spent a lot of money being here in the past like month that I sent to start it.

87
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.790
Jo Delgadillo: Sucks.

88
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.820
Jo Delgadillo: And then we didn't stock up like everybody else did. And the prices on everything went up so

89
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.280
Jo Delgadillo: Maybe I should have stopped a

90
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.080
Lot of people

91
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.300
Jo Delgadillo: Like that I didn't

92
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.660
Jo Delgadillo: Because everybody else did it and I see these old people go shopping. They can get what they need, because everybody took it inside

93
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:10.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Considered but that's okay. That's okay. This is going to give you opportunity to save money to find something that ideal for you and it's good that you caught this he signs before was too late. Could you imagine you gave this lady your money.

94
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.090
Jo Delgadillo: And yes,

95
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This wasn't even her home.

96
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.730
I know

97
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.650
Jo Delgadillo: That was such

98
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:17.580
Yeah.

99
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.110
Jo Delgadillo: I started thinking about it.

100
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.700
Jo Delgadillo: And my girl is like, you know what, I'm proud of you for thinking about it before you acted because usually when I'm in this situation, I just act.

101
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.260
Jo Delgadillo: Like

102
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.880
Jo Delgadillo: No, I gotta stop. I gotta start thinking, I gotta make phone calls and I did. And thank God I

103
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.270
Did

104
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.310
Jo Delgadillo: She showed she's the lady hacks that little lock thing.

105
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.530
Jo Delgadillo: But it scares me because she has my email address and my phone number. Now,

106
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.190
Jo Delgadillo: I'm scared. She's are trying to have my phone or my bank account or something.

107
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.840
Jo Delgadillo: Very

108
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.550
Jo Delgadillo: smart man.

109
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah just

110
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:05.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just change the password in your email, you can do that from your phone just to be safe.

111
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if that's all the information she has. I don't think she could get any bank account information.

112
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:22.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On, but I know in situations like this where you feel compromised. You want to put something in place and type of safety measures to make you feel like you did something so I would change the password on your email.

113
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Address by one character and and that makes you feel like you put some safety guard measure in place.

114
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Close communication going with grandma.

115
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.200
Jo Delgadillo: Okay.

116
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.160
Jo Delgadillo: I need to go get her pills today. So she was my best friend.

117
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.230
Jo Delgadillo: She can't leave.

118
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:53.040
Jo Delgadillo: And I'm the only one that goes with her to doctors appointments and it's pain pills, so they can't just released anybody and the doctor wasn't there. So she wrote out a whole bunch of

119
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.330
Jo Delgadillo: Prescriptions just handed to

120
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.260
Jo Delgadillo: Me that the door. And I was like, that's crazy like anybody can come in.

121
00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

122
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:00.720
She's like,

123
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.910
Jo Delgadillo: Now you want to talk to me. She doesn't talk to me two days. And she's like, You need to go get it for me. And of course, I'm gonna go get it for you.

124
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It.

125
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:19.470
Jo Delgadillo: Sucks that nobody talks to me until they want something just like my son. He doesn't talk to me like four days and then two days ago he needed a bed so

126
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:21.780
Jo Delgadillo: Talk to me.

127
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.460
Jo Delgadillo: My husband's been stepping up

128
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me, Stephen.

129
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.300
Jo Delgadillo: Probably just we got into a fight, and I wanted to leave.

130
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.490
Jo Delgadillo: And he actually yelled at me slam the door and everything he does not raise this course.

131
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.530
Jo Delgadillo: And that made me think he was guilty. He had bad intentions and he got caught.

132
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.000
Jo Delgadillo: So you got the cancer.

133
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.780
Jo Delgadillo: And he did. I seen it, and I called him out on it. You just didn't like. We call them out on it.

134
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was the argument about

135
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.750
Jo Delgadillo: He asked. He hates Sabrina. Sabrina is

136
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.280
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, Sabrina is healing Aiden smoke.

137
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.360

Jo Delgadillo: Be married to her and I'm silly legally married to shame.

139
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.420
Jo Delgadillo: He said, he asked her how she's been doing like

140
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.140
Jo Delgadillo: Emotional and I overthink things. And my mom's earned tier, so I acknowledge it a lot. Now, but

141
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.830
Jo Delgadillo: He doesn't ask me, and he asked her, and it hurt my feelings like

142
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:46.020
Jo Delgadillo: You hate her. And you asked her how she was doing and if they're okay. And like I get mo P part you're asking about your daughter. But you asked how she was doing

143
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:54.690
Jo Delgadillo: I just, I didn't, I didn't like it, and it wasn't that I was jealous or that he was sheet. It was the most part.

144
00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:07.620
Jo Delgadillo: Like he has no emotion towards me and he did towards somebody else on that and he did not get it. He was like, you think I'm gonna go cheat. I was like, hold on. That has nothing to do with what I'm trying anyone. Let me explain you just freaked out slim it

145
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.340
Jo Delgadillo: Sounds like that tells me your intention for bed like

146
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.880
Jo Delgadillo: You don't act like that until you're caught doing something

147
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

148
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.630
Jo Delgadillo: Even though you didn't really do it you in here. You did.

149
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

150
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:26.310
Jo Delgadillo: For Joe and because that's what happened last time when he gave some lady right I smoke cocoa butter and my car.

151
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.230
Jo Delgadillo: Was pregnant. I could smell.

152
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:35.640
Jo Delgadillo: dirt from a mile away. And he was like, I was like, Why do I smell cocoa butter my car, my truck. And he was like, what

153
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:36.930
Jo Delgadillo: And it's

154
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:53.010
Jo Delgadillo: Big and you got all defensive started with the bottom of the head and kind of like trying to ignore me but talking shit. Same time when it was a cup of butter in and then I found out like two hours later, my friend seen

155
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.310
Jo Delgadillo: Him.

156
00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:02.010
Jo Delgadillo: Giving a girl. Right. So I was right there. Any finally admitted that he did. He gave a co worker. Right. And I'm like, but if you want, doing nothing wrong why lie.

157
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.900
Jo Delgadillo: And then that's another time he

158
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:13.920
Jo Delgadillo: And then he finally admitted it probably like two, three weeks later did it. Did you ever ride and she did kind of flirt with him. And I'm like, but you didn't do anything. There's hope.

159
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.940
Jo Delgadillo: She's learned

160
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.580
Jo Delgadillo: You can't control with someone else does.

161
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.880
Jo Delgadillo: Like, but you can control yourself and you did I just, I didn't want them to lie just want he wants to start flying

162
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

163
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.540
Jo Delgadillo: Let's kind of work to sucks.

164
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:46.350
Jo Delgadillo: But he's been helping with dishes and everybody knows I hate doing dishes from since being a kid, I would throw the dishes away and hide them because I didn't want to do that. And when I got older, I told everybody I will never do this, should I do them but

165
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.530
Jo Delgadillo: He's been helping with the girls, but the only thing he slacked off on was helping me with the girls his homework.

166
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:56.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

167
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:09.810
Jo Delgadillo: I don't, I don't know if it's just because we're all tired of being here which the girls are starting to fill it to its online. So I kind of like slacked off on it too, just because the more harder I push her to do it, the more she writes me

168
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

169
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.490
Jo Delgadillo: Her teacher

170
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.030
Jo Delgadillo: told me to go outside and teacher because the work that I've been turning in for her is double what they're asking

171
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:27.360
Jo Delgadillo: But Julie's behind and I feel like she needs to be brought up because I was in denial that her speech was delaying her learning for a long time.

172
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:38.610
Jo Delgadillo: And now she's actually an attempt speech therapy in school. I started see it. So I'm like, Okay, I need to stop being in denial and just help my baby and

173
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.830
Jo Delgadillo: She's

174
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.770
Jo Delgadillo: She's got an attitude. Now she's been talking to me like that with her head and

175
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.630
Jo Delgadillo: Who are you

176
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, it's too early for that.

177
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.360
I know

178
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.050
Jo Delgadillo: Of course your beautiful

179
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.870
Jo Delgadillo: Blue eyes.

180
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.060
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, sure.

181
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You, you have a lot of personalities are dealing with in their home. I could see why you trying to find a place to go.

182
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:29.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you're trying to keep the guys closing your husband's like okay, maybe we could separate ourselves a little bit. You think, what do you think is really about him changing now and doing all these things. Did you have a conversation about it.

183
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

184
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.720
Jo Delgadillo: I tried, but he doesn't listen on the top.

185
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.980
Jo Delgadillo: I think

186
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.260
Jo Delgadillo: Somebody had he had to talk to somebody

187
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:38.970
Jo Delgadillo: And

188
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.570
Jo Delgadillo: I think because he's not working, and he's here saying that I never get to sit down. I don't, I don't get sick like

189
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.210
Jo Delgadillo: constantly going and

190
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:55.770
Jo Delgadillo: The therapy. She told me that he's proud of me for doing it because I'm helping myself and I was just like, that was the first time he's ever

191
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.570
Jo Delgadillo: Knowledge it at all. He asks, Why are you always doing some kind of therapy or

192
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:07.980
Jo Delgadillo: You're always kind of trying like there's a lot going on here that you won't understand it and you guys do.

193
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.630
Jo Delgadillo: And it helps

194
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:10.650
Jo Delgadillo: I like it.

195
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you get an opportunity to practice that i feel i understand i need

196
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Communication skills yet.

197
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.580
Jo Delgadillo: I did. I tried. That's when I got into the car I got in. I made myself.

198
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.380
Jo Delgadillo: Calm down, like

199
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.470
Jo Delgadillo: I had anxiety. So that's when I went to talk to him when he started yelling at me and

200
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.340
Jo Delgadillo: looked down

201
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:39.120
Jo Delgadillo: And I tried to and I told him like two days later that I was trying to do this what you told me to do and

202
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.620
Jo Delgadillo: He started with

203
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.790
Yeah.

204
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh no, that's about him and not meal right and that's that's where not allowing that scapegoat cold to be thrown on you again.

205
00:18:53.430 --> 00:19:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where people have used your reactions as a way to justify why they can treat you a certain way or they can respond to you a certain way.

206
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:21.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so by you keeping on the hero cape which you have chosen that that is what's most suitable for you. Now when you don't react the way they expect you get changes in their behaviors, you know, because now you see him he's cooking. He's cleaning. So maybe HAD YOUR REACTION BEEN more aggressive

207
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.800
Jo Delgadillo: It didn't. I didn't

208
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. And usually I want to talk about it.

209
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh yeah, just like

210
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.090
Jo Delgadillo: Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. I'll follow them around.

211
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.380
Jo Delgadillo: Please talk to me.

212
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.760
Jo Delgadillo: And I didn't

213
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:45.120
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't talk to him for the whole day and a half and and he kept trying and trying to hug me and I'm like, I'm not gonna help you because it's not okay like I'm not okay well you said in the way you reacted wasn't okay and I need to know that.

214
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:59.010
Jo Delgadillo: You need to know that I need you don't understand it. My feelings are stupid just aren't stupid when I try to tell you, I feel you can't tell me, Oh, I feel like this. You can't compare your feelings to mind, he doesn't get

215
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:18.720
Jo Delgadillo: Credit for that. Before he wasn't even his son, Aiden was like, Why does my Dad, why do you spend so much time with me and my sister and you don't have to. And my dad has so many opportunities because you do so much with us and it made me sad that he said that

216
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.200
Jo Delgadillo: He sees it, but he's such a place on the way he reacts for me when I say

217
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:37.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, what I've learned what I've noticed is that people that don't have the skill set on how to communicate being hurt. They're not good at communicating, or they just lack

218
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:46.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of the experience of being able to do it but they tend to do is when someone that's better at communicating express how they feel.

219
00:20:46.710 --> 00:21:01.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They use that as as a way in to now tag on to that person's emotions. So, for example, Joe, communicate, she's frustrated about A, B and C. Now your husband tries to tackle along with that. Well, I've been frustrated about A, B and C.

220
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:09.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then it causes an argument, because, well now is not the opportunity to express your frustrations when I'm talking about mine.

221
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You should have communicated the frustrations, you had when they when the onset arrived. But that's what people tend to do when they lack the skill set on how to communicate.

222
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:30.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So be aware of that when you're trying to communicate how you feel. And the better you get at it, you're going to see that, you know, he may try to model that

223
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:41.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it may be frustrating because it's like, Nah, he's not listening to me. But when it is, is he seeing you express themselves and now he's thinking, well, this is my opportunity share Highfield

224
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so where the hard work comes in as because you're expressing it because you're killing it in that moment, you want to address it. And now here's somebody comes in trying to talk about how these are really all you need is someone to listen.

225
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:09.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the hard thing is navigating that okay how can I extend the grace because I know he likes the communication skills, but how can I also make sure that my needs are being met and

226
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:22.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the way you do that is still I feel I understand, and I need. I still feel frustrated about a b&c I understand that you're trying to communicate to me right now. Also how your film.

227
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:32.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But right now I need to have time to express how I feel when I'm done, we can talk more about what what you wanted to stress.

228
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:44.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because because your escape goal and people use that. I don't want you to see him communicating and speaking up that now you neglect your own emotions because you're focusing on him.

229
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

230
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.350
usually happens when

231
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're with your side and what those different things. You said your son or your grandma. They only call you when they need something

232
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:08.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's because you're an empathetic person you feel for others. And so you get that validation whenever someone needs you.

233
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:18.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like you get charged up like if you were a battery and you are about to run out of juice, but someone needs you. It's like your battery starts filling up

234
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:38.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the empathetic person because they feel for others it challenges when they want to do something for themselves. They're a constant combat over. How do I help others which is it makes me feel good, too. But I'm noticing that I'm abandoned and myself in this process.

235
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's the boundaries. It's the dominant myself. Yeah.

236
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.630
Jo Delgadillo: You know tell myself not to do that.

237
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.930
Jo Delgadillo: I need to take care of myself do

238
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.010
Jo Delgadillo: In order to care.

239
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.790
Jo Delgadillo: For and

240
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.510
Jo Delgadillo: It's hard battle was myself over it.

241
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.180
Jo Delgadillo: sucks because

242
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.420
Jo Delgadillo: Justin one that I told you a cancer that I cleaned his house last week.

243
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

244
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.700
Jo Delgadillo: He called today.

245
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:17.430
Jo Delgadillo: And I don't know what he wanted. I didn't get to talk to my left my phone that doesn't answer day and supposedly he wanted me to come over there, do something because he was born, I don't, I don't know what it was. Maybe it's just an excuse to give me other house.

246
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.380
Jo Delgadillo: I don't even

247
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:28.950
Jo Delgadillo: Like a senior pictures you look stressed out, just like wait, what you're paying attention. He's like, yeah, you're always busy. And I'm like, you see it in a picture of

248
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.080
Jo Delgadillo: My face.

249
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.790
Jo Delgadillo: He's like, if you ever want to lie and say you're coming in and clean.

250
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:41.550
Jo Delgadillo: My house, you can, but he weighed like 250 pounds and now he weighs 130

251
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.160
Jo Delgadillo: He's like

252
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:55.980
Jo Delgadillo: His leg was like this big around and I seen him two months ago and he was big and all of a sudden he's skinny, but he said Canter and I'm like dude, but they didn't want to come on. Ask him like is your answer by

Jo Delgadillo: Dark Brown.

254
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.830
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, it's like you're not okay. You need to go to a doctor and

255
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.510
Jo Delgadillo: She's currently

256
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.080
Jo Delgadillo: sucks because I feel what he's feeling and I hate it.

257
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:23.670
Jo Delgadillo: I can be

258
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.960
Anybody in through it.

259
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:34.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see, he's also, um, I mean, maybe I'm overthinking this, but is it is he interested in you romantically

260
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.050
Jo Delgadillo: I played off the wall for everybody that's in our lives.

261
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.220
Jo Delgadillo: I'm like I don't even want my ma'am. So why

262
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.300

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He's already enough. Okay. Yeah.

265
00:25:51.780 --> 00:26:02.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, trying to get you out the home and all of that and maybe just wonder, okay, having a hidden agenda here. Yeah. And I told him in front of my son. One day I was like, you know, I like you.

266
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:14.100
Jo Delgadillo: Got a weird it was right there. I seen where his mind went and I was like, because you've never hit on me with or without him around. I like that. That's respect like

267
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.870
Jo Delgadillo: cross the line ever did.

268
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.460
Jo Delgadillo: And I call you out in front of him.

269
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.350
Jo Delgadillo: He's never, never tried

270
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.780
Jo Delgadillo: It's always been respectful. I got caught him looking at my boobs and stuff like that. That's normal.

271
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.430
Jo Delgadillo: Everybody in the world does

272
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.870
Jo Delgadillo: Not happen.

273
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.680
Man.

274
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:42.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I'm gonna give you some more nuggets on with the anxiety. So I'm going to play a video for you that just talks about what grounding exercises.

275
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't get discouraged that the I feel I understand and it didn't work out because your husband.

276
00:26:47.910 --> 00:27:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wasn't in the space to receive that keep practicing it because you'll see that gives you the structure and even if you just have to do it internally to help you check in with your emotions, you'll see how you're able to just regulate yourself and not have to

277
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:19.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Get the validation from your husband in regards to your feelings. I'm being uncomfortable in I feel upset and it's okay and I'm justified, you know, even if he doesn't get while I'm upset. I have a reason to be

278
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let me share my

279
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.550
Jo Delgadillo: Screen messes up when you blink and it makes your eyes look crazy.

280
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:14.820
There we go.

281
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.070
Jo Delgadillo: Through the parasympathetic

282
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.840
Jo Delgadillo: Response grounding.

283
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.710
Suicides

284
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:40.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in a previous episode, we talked about the importance of our nervous system in managing our emotions, there's both the sympathetic or the alerting activating response in our bodies.

285
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:52.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the parasympathetic reaction which is the calming restoring part of our nervous system. And if we want to be healthy. We need to have a parasympathetic the dominant nervous system.

286
00:28:52.680 --> 00:29:10.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the ways we create that is by intentionally ground in the body in our senses. So here's a quick exercise on how to do that start to pay attention to the present moment, and the circumstances around you. So go ahead and take a deep breath and let it out slowly.

287
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now we're going to start by grounding our body in our senses. So the five senses that we have are essential to managing our emotions. So let's start with our sense of touch.

288
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:44.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So go ahead and touch three things in your environment. And as you touch them describe them in your mind. So for example, you might touch the desk and say this is smooth and cold do that with three objects.

289
00:29:52.290 --> 00:30:02.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The next sense that we're going to activate is our sense of sight. So go ahead and notice three things in your environment that you can see describe them in your mind as well.

290
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:24.000
The last sense that we're going to use in this grounding exercise is our sense of hearing. So try to notice three different sources of sound in your environment and in your mind to describe what they sound like.

291
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.490
As you notice this sensory input your body should become more grounded in the present moment.

292
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:43.620
This is important because in order for our bodies to feel safe and for our minds to relax. We need to send the message that they are safe.

293
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:59.520
And in general, the present moment that we are in is actually safe. So by grounding ourselves in our senses. We can send a message to our body and our brain that we are safe. Pay attention to the difference, you're feeling in your body as you become centered in this moment.

294
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.490
By becoming more grounded. You have impacted your nervous system.

295
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.710
This is a little activity. You can do throughout your day to feel a little bit calmer and to trigger that parasympathetic response, the more frequently you do it, the stronger your parasympathetic reaction will be

296
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.170
And your nervous system will become dominated by a calm resolve. I hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching.

297
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Before

298
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:33.960
You know,

299
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:42.750
Jo Delgadillo: The surroundings one. Yeah. Or, and then listening. I've done the listening one and then when I was in therapy on and i was a kid.

300
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.030
Jo Delgadillo: That was my highest and

301
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.210
Jo Delgadillo: Listen to everything around me and sprees with it.

302
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.810
Jo Delgadillo: And then when we opened our eyes. We have explain what we were

303
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.600
Jo Delgadillo: And how made us feel. Yeah.

304
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, what do you remember about Danny, what was most helpful for you.

305
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.290
Jo Delgadillo: Actually everything

306
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.520
Jo Delgadillo: Because I got beat

307
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.650
Jo Delgadillo: So I think I couldn't tell her, but

308
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.030
Jo Delgadillo: I'm pretty sure she knew

309
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.460
Jo Delgadillo: She just didn't come out and say it because I scare my mom was like, kill me and your

310
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.250
Jo Delgadillo: Mom beat everybody up so that we could

311
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.170
Jo Delgadillo: Say nothing because then I'd be scared. Oh.

312
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

313
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.840
Jo Delgadillo: He knew my mom.

314
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.040
Jo Delgadillo: And my grandma.

315
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.480
Jo Delgadillo: I needed her to break down or meltdown.

316
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:38.520
Jo Delgadillo: In class or anywhere because I would just go to these regions right stretch myself and for my hair and I hurt myself. I cut, I am I used to cut myself and

317
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:50.250
Jo Delgadillo: And then when they caught me doing my wrist. I started on my leg but but just she just helped you out to LA until I got pregnant with Jacob, and I couldn't explain to her how

318
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.070
Jo Delgadillo: To start applying just

319
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.040
Jo Delgadillo: Told me that I've only got pregnant. So I would have somebody to love me.

320
00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.880
Jo Delgadillo: Therapy. So yeah, so I stopped going to her after that because

321
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.310
Jo Delgadillo: I cried and cried and cried because that woman.

322
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:15.840
Jo Delgadillo: Was there for me for years from elementary to junior high, and she had she had a kid. I didn't see everybody here and then she came back no her daughter gone. It's a wreck it was paralyzed quadriplegic where we call it

323
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.980
Jo Delgadillo: And she couldn't come back to work. But she came back to work. When I went to high school.

324
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

325
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:28.230
Jo Delgadillo: I stopped seeing her after high school because I gotten pregnant and she started seeing that stuff. I bought for a long time and I didn't tell nobody why

326
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:43.170
Jo Delgadillo: And I finally told my grandma and I wasn't really stopped going to she couldn't figure out why I stopped going to her is because she said that to me I trusted I trusted that woman like she was, she was really, I was really close to her. We cried together over her daughter.

327
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.570
Jo Delgadillo: And my aunt and my mom.

328
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.650
Jo Delgadillo: had cancer.

329
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.570
Jo Delgadillo: Treatment. That's how I felt hurt.

330
00:33:53.580 --> 00:34:08.670
Jo Delgadillo: Especially in like junior high, as you start to grow and feel awkward. And I did. I just, and then I got really rage like rages like I'd go crazy. No reason I'd get mad and

331
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.520
Jo Delgadillo: Instead of hurting people because my mom beat me. And I know I didn't like the way it felt her hitting me I would hurt myself.

332
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.630
Jo Delgadillo: Like say the neighbor made me mad. I bought a house, I hurt myself.

333
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:33.570
Jo Delgadillo: And then they put me on medication. When I my girl wouldn't let them. But when I got older, I love my mom. They finally let her put me on medication. She, she was cool with them putting me on pain pills at 14

334
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.700
Jo Delgadillo: But not on antidepressants and

335
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.140
Jo Delgadillo: Stuff and and

336
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.360
Jo Delgadillo: mood stabilizer. So I wouldn't be going

337
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:47.130
Jo Delgadillo: Crazy. And I couldn't figure out why I just felt it like my anger level with just rise and rise and I couldn't control it.

338
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:58.830
Jo Delgadillo: And then I will tell them, and they wouldn't take me serious nobody did like just controlling you this so they started to put us a sports and it didn't help. I just, I just, I don't know what it was, but

339
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.260
Jo Delgadillo: Eventually when I got older, I started to realize, and then I had a kid young so

340
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.240
Jo Delgadillo: For him to be like that.

341
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Misunderstood

342
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.590
Jo Delgadillo: Because I hurt.

343
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.360
Jo Delgadillo: My whole life. When I was a kid I

344
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.920
Jo Delgadillo: Didn't know they said it was growing pains my legs, but it wasn't my back.

345
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.510
Jo Delgadillo: Was everywhere. Sometimes my neck and my uncle, my aunt and all them will say almost she's lying. She's doing it for attention.

346
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:45.300
Jo Delgadillo: And then I started my period at 11 and I had horrible cramps. I couldn't move my legs what my left leg wouldn't work. And I just scream and they didn't believe me, nobody believed me that I have there, like, See, she's just trying to get all this attention.

347
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:58.680
Jo Delgadillo: Is because Carol. Carol visited my head yes or why would I want the attention doesn't make sense. And he just hated me it's because he molested me and he thought if he get me scared of him. I wouldn't say anything. And I didn't

348
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.970
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't say anything until I was

349
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.840
Jo Delgadillo: 21 years old.

350
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.750

352
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Areas to miss understood in right now.

353
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:22.800
Jo Delgadillo: Are you cut out

354
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:30.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I said, so there was this pattern of being misunderstood as a child and what areas. Now, do you feel Miss understood

355
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.160
Jo Delgadillo: When it comes to being paranoid about the kids.

356
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:45.540
Jo Delgadillo: everybody just thinks that I don't want them to live life and I'm just want to be selfish and keep them here, but I don't. It's what I've been through it scary.

357
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

358
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.210
Jo Delgadillo: My own family molested and

359
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.770

Jo Delgadillo: Pieces like

361
00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:04.530
Jo Delgadillo: It can happen to anyone at any time and it scares me to death. And now that I have daughters, it's gotten 10 times worse like on the level. I can't even sleep.

362
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:04.860
Jo Delgadillo: If

363
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.860
Jo Delgadillo: I hear somebody in the yard. I'm gonna they're gonna kill our babies.

366
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:23.280
Jo Delgadillo: I just don't want the kids to go out and have lives. Yeah, that's not it. I do want them to

367
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:33.330
Jo Delgadillo: And they're like, Yeah, but you want to go with him. That's me protecting them like I feel like I'm doing the right thing and then I want to let go, but I'm scared if I let go, something happened. Yeah.

368
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.790
Jo Delgadillo: And then the pandemic happen.

369
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.640
Jo Delgadillo: Right when I was eating going out with this sprint at the movie theater.

370
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:53.100
Jo Delgadillo: This happened. He's like, See, you're only seeing that because this happened is convenient. I'm like, No, I was gonna surprise him and call his friend because he has a little friend that only I have phone over to the modern she lives out here was going to surprise them but

371
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.230
Jo Delgadillo: I can do it.

372
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:01.560
Jo Delgadillo: sucks because he needs it. He's around his sisters, all the time. And they're driving him crazy

373
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You ever diagnosed with PTSD as a child.

374
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.130
Jo Delgadillo: Um, no, like,

375
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.530
Jo Delgadillo: Probably like

376
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.290
Jo Delgadillo: I remember wants. Yeah, but

377
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.570
Jo Delgadillo: It's like in my 20s.

378
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did they say with the onset, was it

379
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:25.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was it the great

380
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.000
This

381
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.240
Jo Delgadillo: Has to do with everything that

382
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.950
Jo Delgadillo: Was it

383
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:40.680
Jo Delgadillo: I don't remember who I was going to know it was a lady with short hair, but I didn't go to a very long because we move

384
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.830
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so on sprint for us to

385
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:57.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Only x because of, you know, these are normal reasons why you would have this response. I mean, being sexually abused physically abuse cell common behavior as a way to cope

386
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:06.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, interesting aspect I didn't want to take my impression on others the way I did the way I experienced it. So I took it out on myself.

387
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:20.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: just internalize and a lot of that that so hurts and I see the pattern while you're not cutting yourself. It's still the self hurt because so many people are just, it's called an action.

388
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Creator energy

389
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:46.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even though you don't have the physical warm from being cut internally, I, I hear the ones that are being developed from the her a lack of relationship and and security and connection with your son with your husband, but sometimes you're in there with your grandma.

390
00:39:48.750 --> 00:40:07.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So if you would think of, okay, this self care why it's so important and why I stress it so much is because it's almost like the adult you is harming yourself I doing so much for other people that aren't reciprocating that for you.

391
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:22.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now you're you're evolving, you realize that you didn't deserve to be physically abused you didn't deserve to be sexual abuse. You don't deserve to be taken advantage of. Now in your adulthood.

392
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He doesn't read a lot that has balance.

393
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.710
Jo Delgadillo: You know, I talked to Dr. April about it.

394
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.000
Jo Delgadillo: Because the little memories that I have of how my son came about.

395
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.420
Jo Delgadillo: Thought about getting hypnotize but do I want to know, because look where I'm at already

396
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.980
Jo Delgadillo: Maybe my brain. It's like walking all that out, or I was drugged. I don't know.

397
00:40:47.310 --> 00:41:00.540
Jo Delgadillo: But I know I'm remember bits and pieces like my feet, my feet. A number of water bed and I remember a sexual position and my friend in the same one crying. I remembered that. And I just remembered that, like, three years ago.

398
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.570
Jo Delgadillo: So my brain wants to hear, but it doesn't, but

399
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.520
Jo Delgadillo: I kind of do what I kind of don't

400
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:11.640
Jo Delgadillo: Know if I do and I talked to my son about it like three weeks ago and I asked him, because that's kind of bothering me.

401
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:22.590
Jo Delgadillo: And I know it bothers him. He says it doesn't. But he's these six, three, so he's like, where do I get my highest and he said people at work, say you're talking to your dad's short and you're not. You're tall.

402
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.060
Jo Delgadillo: And he doesn't tell them

403
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.010
Jo Delgadillo: So my dad because

404
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.540
Jo Delgadillo: He doesn't have to explain us

405
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

406
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:37.500
Jo Delgadillo: I know he wants to know, because he's mentioned it was one of those guys are tall, which one of them have here he backs have be gases like she has questions. And I'm like,

407
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.630
Jo Delgadillo: I don't remember, like, my friend. I never looked at them that way there, my friend, my friend.

408
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.200
Jo Delgadillo: My friend.

409
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.400
Jo Delgadillo: My other friends.

410
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:59.040
Jo Delgadillo: And then if he's like, I want to find out. I'm like, but if you find out who your dad is chicken. That's basically they rapes me, Jeff, I never ever considered to have sex with neither one of them. They were in their 30s and I was

411
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:01.530
Jo Delgadillo: Either way you look at it this

412
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.610
Way. Yeah.

413
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.040
Jo Delgadillo: Don't have to own that

414
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.060
Jo Delgadillo: Lead to admit that and

415
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:06.960
Jo Delgadillo: I don't think

416
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.840
Jo Delgadillo: I do myself and I know I shouldn't but

417
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.710
Jo Delgadillo: You still gonna hold on to go like he's just like,

418
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.170
Jo Delgadillo: I'm working on it.

419
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.120
Jo Delgadillo: Yet I want him to have work on it.

420
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:22.980
Jo Delgadillo: Or

421
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.900
Jo Delgadillo: Not but he's asking all the questions in part of me wants to get the answers for you.

422
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.820
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. And then the other part of me is like, do I need that to do that to myself.

423
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:46.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so whenever any Yeah, will you actually have the anxiety, but you also because of the anxiety, the need to control certain situations. So when you when you reflect through this whenever these thoughts come up

424
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:57.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, will you access to. I want to know, because it's going to give me more clarity and help me feel or is it so that I can finally say, I know.

425
00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:08.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this is more about the control and if it's more about the control, then I would say don't do it work more on the coping skills to get yourself stable enough

426
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But even when those moments those memories resurface you're able to regulate yourself and get back to present day and be collected

427
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But some people find it healing to retell the stories and the safe place.

428
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:31.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you think as you're like, No, this isn't really about control. This is about me wanting to heal from the unknown, and I say, Yeah, do it.

429
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:40.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you have to determine what's more for you. And the good news is it's no rush you have time to think about this and figure out what you want to do.

430
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

431
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.600
Jo Delgadillo: It is more about control. That's how I don't think I'm ready to know

432
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

433
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.480
Jo Delgadillo: Because, already HOW PARANOID, I am with people coming around us, or I think would just get word

434
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, just

435
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.670
Jo Delgadillo: Trust, but I wouldn't have no more trust her. And I don't have trust for anyone. Anyways,

436
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.980
Jo Delgadillo: Mm hmm. It just got worse.

437
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:01.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so then instead of

438
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:11.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know the gnosis. And that might change to make it more stable and how to manage the anxiety and how to deal. You may say I think I'm writing

439
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:23.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then you make a note, this is not helpful for me at all. What we can do is the next time to me as I can teach you different ways different images skill set, so that if a memory replace itself.

440
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:30.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can learn how to manage that and be like, Okay, this is a memory. This is where I'll put this and keep moving forward.

441
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.040
Jo Delgadillo: See how do I know what's the memory of what my mind's like making up

442
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.380
Jo Delgadillo: Mm Hmm, that confuses me to

443
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:39.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or

444
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.290
Jo Delgadillo: Am I

445
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.000
Jo Delgadillo: Just overthinking things and

446
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:43.590
Jo Delgadillo: In there now or

447
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:50.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If it's just coming up. If it's just coming up. That's just the natural brain recalling events that happen and

448
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If

449
00:44:52.800 --> 00:45:02.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There. Yeah, if you're sitting there, which I don't see you doing this, you're not sitting in a car, you're thinking, okay, I want to relive. One of the most traumatic experiences of my life.

450
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:16.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, let me think of this. No, it's not that I'm really believing that these were different memories that were so traumatic and so painful that your brain found a way to protect you from it and they suppress the memory.

451
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now, the better you get in your emotional regulation, your memory is starting to replay different subtle scenes for you.

452
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:42.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what you do is you just find ways of how to do when those little memories Fletcher, your brain again okay you acknowledge that that was the memory and you store it away, but you need imagery and guidance and supports on how to do that. So we could do that. The next time you

453
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:49.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can do you want to meet. We're on a bi weekly schedule right every other week.

454
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:51.750
Jo Delgadillo: You tell me.
