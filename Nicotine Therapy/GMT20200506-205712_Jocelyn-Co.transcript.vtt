Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

270
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:43.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so let's continue on. So you've mentioned about what's working out for you. Could you tell me what seems to be not working well for you, like, for example, because right now you're telling me that you're able to sleep well.

271
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, what seems to be

272
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.060
Robert Russell: What

273
00:24:49.140 --> 00:25:00.780
Robert Russell: Is whenever I get overwhelmed take on too much at once, or don't take like like have like a task, and I don't like I like in

274
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:17.370
Robert Russell: A span of time, but in my head. I just try to rush and do everything that we met but so to prioritize and time management. That's what, that's what's not been working for me. So, but I am getting I'm getting into under wraps.

275
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. So it's so what's that going well for you right now it's time management.

276
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.910
Robert Russell: Right. Yeah, maybe. Time management definitely that's, I mean,

277
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:34.410
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like you have so many things to do it that you're not able to do it all because you know you're not able to manage it well.

278
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:44.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe we could do that. We could include that in the plan. So what we're going to do is that for you to be able to manage your time. Can you list down all the things that you know

279
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.840
Jocelyn Corrales: That you need to do in a day. Like, for example, you need to, you know, it starts from waking up and what are the possible activities that you need to do so.

280
00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:01.590
Jocelyn Corrales: For you to be able to manage your time and to do all the chores and tasks that you need to do you need to list it out.

281
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.250
Jocelyn Corrales: And try to stick on the plan. Like, for example, you know, sometimes you know there are times that you're going to play.

282
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:20.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Just in case you have to take care of the kids and play. You could actually you also include that in your list little a time. So just in case you get interrupted because you know of

283
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Changes in your plans are in your playtime you could, you know, just rearrange that

284
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.020
Jocelyn Corrales: The plan that you have for the day. So try to list out the things that you need to do.

285
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:42.060
Jocelyn Corrales: So there are actually some chores that this not need to be done in a day. You know, like for example, there are some charts that has to be done every week. So you could actually schedule that so that you could know

286
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Do those things and I think you've mentioned that you've been playing computer games or Xbox.

287
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could limit your time.

288
00:26:54.390 --> 00:27:02.340
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you could limit your time playing with it. Probably 30 minutes to an hour and also just to discipline your kids, you know,

289
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:18.600
Jocelyn Corrales: It's that good to be playing all the time. And once the kids gets used to playing, you know, they wouldn't stop playing and it would be playing the whole day every day and it would also tempt us playing. So maybe you time yourself you know for you to be able to do more in a day.

290
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:27.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to limit your time playing games, but it's okay to play games, but not but not too long. Maybe you've been dead.

291
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:27.660
Jocelyn Corrales: For that

292
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.450
Robert Russell: Definitely, I definitely know

293
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:46.080
Robert Russell: So I definitely a lot and we because we say my oldest son that we just got out of that. Like he used to cry like throw it when you got to put the game away. So we definitely we have that time management on that on your

294
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.580
Robert Russell: Yeah, we got that because that was a nightmare. I didn't get rid of that.

295
00:27:51.690 --> 00:28:02.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, that's good, that's good. You have to time it, like for example you're you're allowed to play, but only 30 minutes or just an art. And after that, we'll stop it. So, you know, until he gets used to it.

296
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.540
Jocelyn Corrales: And also, do you watch TV a lot or this your son, your kids watch

297
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:22.200
Robert Russell: We don't, we don't watch that much TV. I mean, now just because things are because we're house rating as a little bit different. They gotta but they have like they go to school online everything now. They got lat laptops.

298
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.770
Robert Russell: So they're kind of like forced front of a screen right now.

299
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, because you know that's that's for educational purposes. That's fine.

300
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:38.910
Robert Russell: Yeah, so, so they do that, they go, they do that for a few hours a day, and then they have homework that they have. And then, and then. So now we're not just always on.

301
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Stuff like that was good.

302
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:48.390
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good. It gets keep BC and you know you are able to chew through them at the same time and guide them with their studies.

303
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:10.530
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to your emotions or moods, is it it's working out well for you, right, or I dare dare or sometimes that these does. He does not work for you.

304
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.450
Robert Russell: My move. So sometimes they don't work for me. But for the most part it is

305
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:17.820
Robert Russell: Like I'm

306
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.220
Robert Russell: I'm learning how to control it.

307
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.370
Go.

308
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:46.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Into this

309
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Just run away like that.

310
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:50.970
Robert Russell: takes off.

311
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.470
Robert Russell: Yeah.

312
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.150
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know, and she will

313
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.090
Jocelyn Corrales: And when she wants your attention she goes back again.

314
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.470
Robert Russell: As long as I can hear.

315
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:03.450
Robert Russell: You

316
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so we progress through your spiritual self, you've mentioned your question.

317
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.900
Robert Russell: And you go to church.

318
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.240
Jocelyn Corrales: I don't think you have any problem with that.

319
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.250
Jocelyn Corrales: No. Yes.

320
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:35.760
Jocelyn Corrales: And regards to your social relationship. I think you're, you know, it's getting better than it was before you're you've been in contact with your family and you have a good

321
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:44.730
Jocelyn Corrales: working relationship with your coworkers and a good relationship with your girlfriend and your ex girlfriend or her ex boyfriend.

322
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:45.930
Right.

323
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:07.140
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to financial stability. Do you have some problems with regards to that. Or everything's working out well for you.

324
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.250
Robert Russell: What we're finding because she's still working in. Like I said, I get unemployment or we're good.

325
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.170
Robert Russell: She still works for me.

326
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:35.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, that's good. So let's start with your routine. I'm not going to change your morning routine because you wake up early already maybe your step kids.

327
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Should also wake up early, just like you do, maybe six

328
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.790
Robert Russell: Well, they got to get up early to go to school. So they gotta wait

329
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.650
Yes, like

330
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:58.590
Jocelyn Corrales: So what what what what type of their classes. I think they're having online classes or they're having early in the morning also their online classes.

331
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.860
Robert Russell: Staff some at eight and then they have some at nine and it depends on the teacher, it's not

332
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.840
Robert Russell: All one teacher, sometimes in different

333
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.810
Robert Russell: Class.

334
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.770
Jocelyn Corrales: That I think they should wake up early, instead of we can

335
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Do in the morning.

336
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.660
Jocelyn Corrales: But I think your team is skewed already

337
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.210
Robert Russell: Yeah, just in case we get back to school.

338
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.040
Robert Russell: Yes.

339
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.640
Robert Russell: It's a, it's a, even in the summertime they they have a certain routine so

340
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.660
Robert Russell: They're. They're good.

341
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:31.230
Ronnie.

342
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:38.070
Jocelyn Corrales: I think your girls already have the return because you mentioned that you wake up the same time your girls little girls.

343
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.300
Robert Russell: Yeah, the young ones, they definitely do to they wake up with me. So go to bed.

344
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.760
Jocelyn Corrales: We'd be good to eating. Are you able to eat three times today and snacks also

345
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.400
Robert Russell: Now I just mainly stack all day.

346
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, so you don't eat meals, you just eat snacks.

347
00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:05.010
Robert Russell: I mean, if I mean if there was a meal there. I mean, not really because I'm in. I'm not hungry. So that's kind of messed up because we aren't we do kind of eat based off my appetite.

348
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:11.880
Robert Russell: Like the kids get meals and stuff, but I just, I don't know. I just don't really, I need to get my teeth fixed. I think a lot of it.

349
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:25.560
Robert Russell: So it's real difficult for me so I don't like to go through the trouble and I'm worried, it's a it's a rock and a hard spot man because I'm petrified of going to the dentist, because I had to get for what I need done

350
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:26.910
Robert Russell: I'm after he couldn't sleep.

351
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.310
Robert Russell: So I don't

352
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:43.200
Robert Russell: I don't grasp the concept of how cuz sometimes I have a hard time going to sleep as this. I just in my head, I can grasp the concept of how I would count backwards to any amount of numbers and fall asleep from some gas, it's

353
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Also

354
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.920
Jocelyn Corrales: And you also know that this

355
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:50.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Is

356
00:33:51.120 --> 00:34:03.870
Robert Russell: My sister. He soon, stuff like that. And like, and like, if I can grab like grab a grasp that concept or if I can, like, get on board. I like somewhat understand what it is. I'm like, hell yeah i just i just can't get with getting gas now.

357
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.550
Jocelyn Corrales: I don't know, just, yeah, right.

358
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.350
Jocelyn Corrales: And that's why you don't like going to the dentist.

359
00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:20.580
Robert Russell: That's right and use it as like, it's like the normal human like I like have come like a little bit immune to tooth pain like no bullshit man because like I have

360
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:32.610
Robert Russell: Like, like, like I've had two panes. I'm trying to shift. So, but I still have them. But I'm saying, like, I like like I need like not just one tooth. I got like 73rd like

361
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:42.690
Robert Russell: By broke to the root, like it's bad, but I'll be all right. I didn't know I learned how to eat certain things and I got a bunch of no means stuff so

362
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so that's why instead of eating a complete. So if you're

363
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.030
Robert Russell: Going to eat a

364
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.190
Jocelyn Corrales: Meal, it's going to be painful.

365
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.200
Robert Russell: Right, it is

366
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:53.910
Jocelyn Corrales: At least try.

367
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe soft stuff or maybe

368
00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Like a sheet like you know

369
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.320
Robert Russell: I'd like I do eat like that or like a, like, like mashed potatoes or yogurts

370
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.980
Or

371
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.880
Robert Russell: Yeah. Damn, I am real picky man because

372
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:22.980
Robert Russell: Yeah, my taste. I plus i, because I did do I was incarcerated. I was locked up for nine and a half years consecutively. So I did nine and a half years.

373
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:35.430
Robert Russell: Flat. So learning how he couldn't. You don't want to eat that food in there. Sometimes, man. So learning how to eat and survive off of eating snacks and shit. I, I became a an Olympic gold medalist at that

374
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so you don't consider going to the dentist to have your teeth.

375
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.200
Robert Russell: Know, yeah, we're almost there. I've made I've made enough appointments to where the dentist or get mad. Tell me if I do it again and I can help me out to where I know that

376
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.040
Jocelyn Corrales: I gotta go.

377
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so that he can

378
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.290
Jocelyn Corrales: He can eat normal meals unity.

379
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.260
Robert Russell: But see the sacking of success. I'm at all my teeth. Gotta go. Like, I'm going to get all my teeth gone

380
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh,

381
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:07.950
Yes.

382
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, but

383
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.680
Jocelyn Corrales: You just have to use denture spin

384
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, but the advantage of it is that you don't feel the pain and the more

385
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.240
Robert Russell: That's right.

386
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.250
Robert Russell: I got

387
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.120
Robert Russell: One left to be pulled. So that's why I'm freaking out and so

388
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.120
Robert Russell: Because I had, I

389
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:35.310
Robert Russell: Had, like I had like nine or 10 to know about 70 move remove

390
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.560
Robert Russell: My it just gave you the shots.

391
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.880
Robert Russell: And I seen how took to go through that to get those teeth out

392
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.060
Robert Russell: So I can, I can imagine the other like 20 something on it. Like, that's why I freaked out.

393
00:36:49.620 --> 00:37:03.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Wake up, do it on an installment basis when they have your teeth, you know, remove, like for example, you're going to have your teeth removed, maybe a few teeth today. Then a few teeth. A month after and a

394
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:12.360
Robert Russell: Few i think i think that's why now that and then I gotta get into that and I got I got all that you stop now because I live in Clovis, New Mexico.

395
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.260
Robert Russell: I gotta drive to Albuquerque for this to get the

396
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.840
Robert Russell: Movie and all that and the gas out like that.

397
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:24.810
Robert Russell: So that's why I got to get that my next my next appointment stuff. I'm going to happen to make it because it's going to

398
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:31.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Be a true yeah yeah today, are you going to do it one time at least tied to do. Yes.

399
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:37.680
Robert Russell: It's a one time. That's why I'm this Psyching myself up. I'm almost there, because nobody can deal with it.

400
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:50.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah yeah i think i hope you feel better than after your, you know, dental appointment and I'm sure you just stay positive. You know, it may be scary at first, but you

401
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.520
Know,

402
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.240
Jocelyn Corrales: He's going to be really of the theme.

403
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.500
Robert Russell: Yes.

404
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.720
Jocelyn Corrales: So for the meantime.

405
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.880
Jocelyn Corrales: For the meantime because you're not able to eat.

406
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:15.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Well maybe try to eat healthy shakes. You know, like fruit and vegetable that they mix in. And you know, I think for protein. I think you could eat eggs. I think that's sorry

407
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.990
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not hard. Instead of eating a meal, you know, a hard time to meet baby could eat eggs.

408
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.840
Jocelyn Corrales: And

409
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.090
Robert Russell: Try that. I gotta do that.

410
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.560
Uh huh.

411
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:38.160
Robert Russell: Like rice, rice and

412
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.050
Robert Russell: Yeah, then hamburgers are pretty easy, cuz like

413
00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, you can you can still eat hamburgers.

414
00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah okay but

415
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.430
Robert Russell: Anyway, so I'm all right.

416
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.880
Jocelyn Corrales: But what I wanted to do, because you've mentioned

417
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.180
Robert Russell: That you

418
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.050
Robert Russell: Are having a

419
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Hard time planning your day or time management.

420
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.250
Jocelyn Corrales: I think you have to plan your meal times. Like, for example,

421
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:09.450
Jocelyn Corrales: This is not actually only for you, but also for your kids to that they would have a routine in their meal times

422
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:16.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Right. Yes. So you have to, you know, even if you're just only taking shape or just eating, you know,

423
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Potatoes and

424
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:28.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Show thrice or, you know, other stuff instead of money from time to time basis, while I tried to schedule it on a

425
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:28.860
Breakfast.

426
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.170
Jocelyn Corrales: eater, we've

427
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Become a routine for the kids.

428
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:41.490
Robert Russell: Right. I like the yes and we do the snacks are snacks and stuff. We like bananas and

429
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.230
Robert Russell: Yeah, yogurt, and like

430
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:49.380
Robert Russell: Like because my my girlfriend, she's like, I know like on a day to remember. But like, we're really

520
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.430
Robert Russell: As an exercise.

521
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.330

529
00:49:53.310 --> 00:50:00.900
Jocelyn Corrales: So it's, it would be like your routine daily thing so you don't need to make a list every day, so it's

530
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Just like a guide for you to do.

531
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.190
Jocelyn Corrales: And

532
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:22.980
Jocelyn Corrales: So I only also included in the activities because you know you have to do you have to do me a weekly plan and list of activities limit the time on playing with the Xbox.

533
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:29.040

Robert Russell: Drawing, yes.

537
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.000
Yes.

538
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:52.980
Jocelyn Corrales: And I like the idea when you mentioned to me that you're making clay. Yeah, that's instead of, instead of buying out the clay you teach them how to make a clay and of course they would play with the clay.

539
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.840
Robert Russell: Exactly.

540
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.400
Jocelyn Corrales: And also that would also take your time of, you know,

541
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:09.930
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, some thinking so it will take your mind off something

542
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.390
Jocelyn Corrales: And keep you busy.

543
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:14.430
Robert Russell: Busy, yes.

544
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:30.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and it will keep your mind, have you know some thing, thinking about a lot of things, at least, you know, do some craft, you could actually search for craft things to do in the internet, like for example paper crafts.

545
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:31.800
Yeah.

546
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.380
Jocelyn Corrales: You know activities like that.

547
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.700
Jocelyn Corrales: And also me

548
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.630
Jocelyn Corrales: You could do so.

549
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:42.150

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:13.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so you sleep early so we'll just stick on that weekly plan before we do some major things to do, because I think your main problem is time management.

556
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.380
Jocelyn Corrales: So you really have to make a weekly plan.

557
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.150

589
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:30.480
Robert Russell: Control Johnson's screen. Okay, here, all right now.

590
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.790
Jocelyn Corrales: And then you try to say

591
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.120
Robert Russell: Mouse hard. I tell

592
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.730
Jocelyn Corrales: You you sign it, you move it like you're, you know, you tried to press

593
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.920
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like you're citing using it. It's like your finger is your pen. When you sign

594
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.460
Robert Russell: This is not

595
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, see the bed now.

596
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes it takes time to reflect. Let's see. Let's try but if not, it's OK.

597
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.230
Robert Russell: To talk

598
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:09.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I also see the depth.

599
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:10.860
Jocelyn Corrales: It's fine.

600
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:11.790
I got

601
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:19.860
Robert Russell: My finger. I'll do the dot button. Whenever I go to sign my name is a piano movement. Nothing pops up.

602
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.980
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay.

603
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.290
Robert Russell: All right, well, you can just do Dr you're tracking, I can confirm it.

604
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:39.300
Jocelyn Corrales: No, it's okay. I it's really not required for you to sign it, but it's it's better if you're able to sign up. But if not, it's, it's still okay no worries about that.

605
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:51.300
Jocelyn Corrales: So I'll just send you a copy once. I'll be able to finish the editing of this plan so that you have a copy. But don't forget whatever way you have led are talking about that.

606
00:56:51.870 --> 00:57:03.150
Jocelyn Corrales: You're going to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner on a routine time even if it's only a shake or just like meals, make sure it's a routine time so that you could also set a routine for your kids.

607
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: List down the things that you need to do in a week. So you have to do a weekly plan and a daily routine plan for you to be able to manage your time and limit your time playing with the X Box. I think you play with the Xbox or other computer games.

608
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.120
Okay.

609
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:30.270
Jocelyn Corrales: And so that you could also set a discipline to yourself, not only for yourself but also to your children as well.

610
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.970
Robert Russell: Yes.

611
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:38.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, it was great talking to you. Russell. I'm going to check on you again.

612
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.350
Jocelyn Corrales: In the next 30 days and see how you're doing.

613
00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:45.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I hope it's going well for you. Okay, thank you. So, have a great day.

614
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:46.950
Robert Russell: You too. Bye bye.

615
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:48.120
Bye.
