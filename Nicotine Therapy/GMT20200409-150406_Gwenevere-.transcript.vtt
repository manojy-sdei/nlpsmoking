00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.920
Jen: Worries I'm trying to figure out how to take it off of like seeing both of us to just see oh speaker view. Maybe that's it. Yes.

2
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think while your website. You don't want to see my Chester. Yeah.

3
00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:18.420
Well,

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.900
Jen: Whatever you would like I am fine.

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.800
Jen: I would rather see your face and your lovely Nicholas. Oh, yay.

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection with face to face contact, you know,

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.640
Jen: Definitely

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I doing I'm splitting my attention from here to going and not start a note up here.

9
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: At this standing desk, which is amazing, but it just kept on a surface area.

10
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.020
Jen: Is it one of those desks that you press a button and it goes up and down.

11
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.590
Jen: Those are so rad. My friend has one

12
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
Jen: Now that I'm doing all Tele health I'm considering getting one just because

13
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.880
Jen: You know it, then I can

14
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.780
Yeah.

15
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be moving your

16
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You could use your slate.

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Working your lower back.

18
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
Jen: On a ball or something. No. Totally. Well, yeah.

19
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Going, going, going, yeah. And then whenever I want to do like breath work. I'm right here. I mean, I think.

20
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.290
Jen: That's so awesome.

21
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Highly recommend it. It was a good investment, but I just felt, cried the price was not

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.620
Jen: Yet totally

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: not conducive to my income.

24
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
Jen: My friends, was I know her. She was over two grand but

25
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then, I can tell you mine was not that. And there, there is something you can get mines white and gorgeous and

26
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All you

27
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Press. It's hydraulic. It's amazing.

28
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What you press on the right. And I just do this.

29
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.110
Jen: And it just like God.

30
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.360
Jen: Was like, that was awesome.

31
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.580
Jen: I just was like, um,

32
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

33
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I won't get a sense of it here. If you ever wanted what it is I can make that available to you.

34
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Yeah.

35
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely. That was smart. So I like it. Alright, so

36
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much stimuli on my desktop here.

37
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680
Jen: Where I wanted to show you the mask that my friend made me

38
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. And it's so cute, too.

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.000
Jen: Adorable. I always like I have a whole new like fashion and like

40
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.190
Jen: Right, it's all around masks.

41
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I was thinking about that too. And I'm like, people could really be making a killing right now with this if they made them cute like I would have like an Iron Man mass with a little thing in the front or whatever.

42
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.550
Jen: That's brilliant.

43
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: actors out there that have masks.

44
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, or blaming or little statements like you could Velcro.

45
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So cool. Right. You could Velcro how you're feeling there.

46
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.450
Jen: Oh my god, I love that. That's brilliant.

47
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you people you

48
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Can make a profit off.

49
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And say, nice.

50
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Off people's misery, but you get my point.

51
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.900
Jen: Oh, I do. Yeah.

52
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:32.790
Jen: What are we so nice because like, since I have asthma all of my like friends. I have a lot of like nurse friends and teacher FRIENDS. EVERYTHING. So they've reached out to me and been like, I've made you a mask. So I have like eight

53
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.470
Jen: All on their way to me. But this is what I have now. Yeah.

54
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I liked hearing. I don't know if you were there that day that they had a nurse practitioner practitioner in

55
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.560
Jen: No, no.

56
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: She was saying, Go get a painter's

57
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: overalls, and they have some sort of filter in some must be in the chest or somewhere. I don't know where

58
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It out. I could create your own mask. And I was like, that's cool, like from Home Depot.

59
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.780
Jen: Oh, cool. No.

60
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, none of them are going to be as cute as yours, but

61
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your burden.

62
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.600
Jen: My burden my cross to bear true

63
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.820
Jen: True.

64
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. I think I'm starting to figure out what I'm doing.

65
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I could tight so let's just see where

66
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We left off for

67
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I'm off to the side. I'm not going to do this for long, because obviously I'm no you're

68
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.630
Jen: Fine.

69
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: center screen here.

70
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm be I wouldn't mind checking in on how you're doing on refined sugar intake. I don't think I asked about that last time.

71
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.760
Jen: It's interesting because with

72
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.310
Jen: The quarantine. It definitely makes it a parent's

73
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:10.860
Jen: How often, I would buy sugar and that information was never seen by anyone but myself because I would buy it. I would either that work.

74
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.580
Jen: Even if I ate it at home, I would bring home like a box that had like a few left in it. Um, so I would say that

75
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.670
Jen: It's definitely less than it used to be, because I do not have the kind of access that I used to have.

76
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:38.640
Jen: And so I have to be really mindful of it and also mindful of the fact that, like everything I buy is coming through the front door and being monitored not monitored, but someone else will see it.

77
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.490
Jen: And

78
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.780
Jen: Also everything that comes through the house. We clean

79
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.630
Jen: We actually saw this amazing video on YouTube that this doctor put together about how to bring in your groceries and Takeout food.

80
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, be curious about that one.

81
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.080
Jen: Oh god, it was so helpful because we had cut out Takeout food. Because we were just like, it seems like a risk, but

82
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.500
Jen: It was so awesome. He was like, if you stick to things that are hot.

83
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.690
Jen: And when you bring them in, you immediately dumped them on to a place that is clean dispose of the packaging wash that hands.

84
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.960
Jen: And then put it into the microwave until it steams

85
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.130
Microwave

86
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Wait, my family will thank you.

87
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand why we can't have pizza.

88
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.210
Jen: They totally

89
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and that's why

90
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.910
Jen: Well apparently pizzas are actually the best because they get heated up very, very hot and then after that, they usually are not touched by human hands again.

91
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.710
Jen: The only thing is that then they go into a cardboard box and you don't know

92
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.400
Jen: But you can take it out and put it on a plate, and then he did up

93
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like that heat up thing.

94
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.430
Jen: The heat up thing.

95
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.050
Jen: That I'd like to change my life.

96
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if they're willing to tolerate that reheated crust.

97
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly, yeah.

98
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.930
Jen: So I was super happy about that.

99
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Made some friends over here and

100
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.740
Jen: So yeah, I feel like my my sugar intake has reduced drastically because

101
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.170
Jen: It's sort of like in this new world we're living in.

102
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.850
Jen: The things that come in. I guess I'm just thinking of things in much more utilitarian terms.

103
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.050
Jen: Because it's sort of like what do we have that we need

104
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.730
Jen: And

105
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.720
Jen: No one ever needs refined sugar, um,

106
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not how I do my ordering

107
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like,

108
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels like I need that.

109
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.140
Jen: No. Totally. And to be honest, I mean, I'm still good stuff. Um,

110
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.030
Jen: But it's interesting. Like, I'm like, I made putting

111
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.140
Jen: Because we had because we had ordered half a gallon of milk.

112
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:15.900
Jen: But they didn't have half a gallon. So they got us a gallon, which was not my preference, because we don't go through cow milk, very, very quickly. So I was like fuck all this milk, and I don't want it to go bad. And I don't want to waste it. So I made like lemon pudding.

113
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.890
Jen: So that was like our dessert for like a week.

114
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And having someone see it.

115
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of puts in perspective, is this something I would do or say if someone was around. I got to check myself what am I really doing

116
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.910
Jen: Yeah, yeah, it's

117
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.660
Interesting.

118
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:44.520
Jen: Well, and it's interesting too because I realized that like like as a child I started dinging

119
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:59.130
Jen: Not realizing that I was mimicking my mother, who was binging and purging but my mother was keeping the purging from me, but not the bingeing so I just got the bingeing so I kind of joke that I mean I'm really glad that I didn't get the purchase.

120
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.760
Jen: If I had to get one. At least it's one that I can more easily control and

121
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:14.760
Jen: But I mean, I remember like hiding behind doorways with like a tub of frosting like as a child.

122
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:34.050
Jen: And so it was interesting, realizing how many of like those habits got carried on into my adulthood without me thinking about it like even like if I'm not, I'm not eating a tub of frosting anymore. I'm not a tub, but

123
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:50.100
Jen: I my like have things that work and eat them behind a closed door, not in front of plants or peers or anything, but just by myself. Specifically, and like not realize in the moment that that's what I'm doing.

124
00:09:51.150 --> 00:10:14.190
Jen: Whereas now, I feel very much in touch with what I'm eating and I'm eating so much less because honestly like I'm just not doing as much. And so my body requires less and realizing like that. There are times when I really want to eat because it's part of my habitual routine right

125
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So this continues to be an important goal. It's not. I mean, it may on the surface look simple but you know for many people foods are first addiction.

126
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, the first love affair.

127
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Complete sugar.

128
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.920
Jen: Ah, do

129
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe it's fried chicken or something, you know,

130
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.280
Jen: Oh yeah, totally.

131
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.150
Jen: And it's hard because you can't cut it out completely. You do need it to survive.

132
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

133
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you would know when you're eating.

134
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: To fuel versus emotionally. Do you

135
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they know it's a routine. It can be habitual. Do you know when you're doing it.

136
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.600
Jen: I think I know more

137
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:19.560
Jen: Now, if that makes sense. What's interesting is that like I i am even as you were talking, are you eating for fuel and I can't remember.

138
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:30.180
Jen: When this happened or where I would read it, or where I, you know, saw a TED talk or something about it. But someone was saying like, Do you even know how it feels to be hungry.

139
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:40.140
Jen: Because many people don't like because we eat so continuously individually that sometimes people don't even know what it feels like to be hungry.

140
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:52.080
Jen: And so it was awesome, because it very much taught me to like go without food, until I was certain. I was hungry. And so, I realized that like some of the tells that I am hungry or that like I feel like the slightly bit nauseated.

141
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.360
Jen: I feel

142
00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:12.390
Jen: Sort of like a churning in my belly and I'm used to. And I usually start to get cranky and irrational, but like knowing like that. Those are triggers telling me that I am hungry.

143
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.250
Jen: Actually took me a while to understand them figure out

144
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How are your relationships. These days where you and your husband know you know

145
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.480
Jen: That's so funny. I mean, not to try and cover it with humor.

146
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But

147
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:44.730
Jen: My husband and I are good, but he sent me the funniest meme yesterday that said my wife and I play this fun game during quarantine. It's called, why are you doing it that way. And there are no winners.

148
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: No one wins with a why question. It's just going to go badly.

149
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.130
Jen: And the whole, why are you doing it that way. Oh god.

150
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:07.740
Jen: Yeah. And so, like, I think that we have gotten on each other's nerves pretty much on a daily basis. I mean, it literally just happened this morning.

151
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.070
Jen: Because when I picked up my Wonder Woman mask. I picked up one for him as well.

152
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:21.180
Jen: When I bought them. And he was like, we should wash them. And I was like, good idea. So like hand wash them very hot, soapy water.

153
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:28.920
Jen: And then I let I laid them in the sun too dry and then I put them each in Ziploc bags and his end. Both of them were kind of damn coordinate went in.

154
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:40.080
Jen: And it didn't strike me as being a big deal. But then he told me he was like, by the way, the mask was damn. I was like, Oh, sorry. And he was like, what, why did you do that. And I was like,

155
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:54.720
Jen: I didn't think it was too damn so I figured it would continue to dry. And he was like, but do you understand that when you put something in a Ziploc bag it proceeds to develop more condensation and actually gets more and I was like,

156
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:09.000
Jen: I wasn't thinking about it. I'm really sorry not going to do it again. I know it was just like, no. But do you understand that when you put something in a ziplock and I was like, Nope, I don't understand it, you're married to a fucking idiot.

157
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.150
Jen: And that's how we ended.

158
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to say it slower because I feel like a 10 year old and I want to be like a five year old.

159
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you feel

160
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.510
Oh,

161
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.430
Jen: Five.

162
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.710
Jen: Yeah.

163
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The rage.

164
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Of insult. I'm not

165
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.090
Jen: No totally

166
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to put the mask on.

167
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll talk to you with my mask on.

168
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.340
Jen: Areas.

169
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yeah, see. So those why questions.

170
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you even know. Do you even know. I mean, right, you're trained in it. We still, it doesn't matter. We still get activated the same way emotionally hijacked get ourselves insulted, but

171
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What did he fail to do

172
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He showed you something instead of telling you something.

173
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.340
Yes.

174
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.940
Jen: Which is something I do constantly

175
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

176
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.160
Totally

177
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, you guys have a neat thing. I wonder if you could take that that style.

178
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.090
Jen: Yeah.

179
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And turn it

180
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you did that one thing where you're like, Hey, you play my side, you'd have to have a lot it for you guys to hold that off. I was impressed you can fold out

181
00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: People could do that because the whole point is they don't have a capacity sit with others in their busy being right but if you can see that you're doing that, like in that moment, if he was doing that, you're like okay this is some movie.

182
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So book can try it. Okay. You're trying to show me something.

183
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right. It's a guessing raids and the Sri it's feeling charades.

184
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.420
Is it

185
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that one. Honey, is it

186
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.980
Jen: Right, or is it

187
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.460
Is it

188
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it scared.

189
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you show me how you feel me see. Okay.

190
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How you know and making it into a game somehow

191
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.550
Jen: No totally

192
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's going to happen anyway you know

193
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.930
Jen: What that's a good point.

194
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you have the skill you guys have all these really cool things.

195
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.470
Jen: See, and that's what's funny is

196
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.700
Jen: Is in those moments like you can have like all the skills and you'd like lose it.

197
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:12.480
Jen: It's so funny because a lot of my clients will say to me, they're like you just seem like you have it all together. Do you ever have like a bad moment with someone and I'm like, Oh, honey.

198
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.400
Jen: What do I beer.

199
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.410
Jen: Not literally, but

200
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.140
Jen: Yeah. It's funny, I don't, sorry. Go ahead.

201
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Just, just thinking about how

202
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's how we can relate right that's the upside of is it. That's how I can name it.

203
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.140
Jen: Walk.

204
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Through do the chain analysis of it. I can walk through because I've walked those coals, I've

205
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.540
Jen: Was so we

206
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Were getting on each other's nerves on a daily

207
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:52.890
Jen: Yeah, definitely. Definitely on a daily, I would say that my relationships outside of that I'm

208
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.310
Jen: A pretty good. I actually

209
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.910
Jen: I was joking with my brother recently that it's it's nice not to

210
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.840
Jen: Feel like you have to make plans with anyone.

211
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.860
Jen: That

212
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.170
Jen: That you later will be like, Oh, I wish I hadn't made those plans. I just don't want to do that.

213
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.230
Jen: Now, there are no pins to be made, except for meetings over zoom

214
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.220
Jen: And so I actually did that.

215
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.130
Jen: For the first time, with a group of friends who I have not seen like the four of us have not hung out together.

216
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.280
Jen: In over 20 years

217
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I love it, and you did a ladies.

218
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.990
Jen: Night did it was two women to men. Yeah. But yeah, the four of us like got together and

219
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:51.510
Jen: We all learned how to play guitar and wrote songs together. And so we like whipped out the guitar and did a little playing and singing and

220
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:58.560
Jen: We talked for like 90 minutes and caught up and two of us have kids now and

221
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.880
Jen: Yeah, and we were all in different time zones, it was hilarious.

222
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.260
Jen: One meet one in

223
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.660
Jen: Washington me here, one in Chicago and the one in New York, it was hilarious.

224
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, what's interesting about your particular composition is y'all knew each other. I tried it with new people.

225
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.650
Jen: And when

226
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: He

227
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.140
Now I will say,

228
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That I am a rescuer for so I got in there because I know group. And I'm like, yeah, so there's no central topic.

229
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no

230
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Groundwork so they were starting to, well, what do you do for a living. And I was like, well, I'm like, I want to play.

231
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Your all you know I you know I know I play

232
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.410
Jen: Right yeah I

233
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can do it, I was like, okay, looky here, here's the topic we're going to discuss. I ended up like taking over.

234
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And

235
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We're able to kind of have a central thing to sort of focus on, but I didn't want. I didn't really want that. But I see that the dynamics that would typically the dinner table is I'm going to turn this way. And I'm going to chit chat here.

236
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: On the way we join

237
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But we don't have that flow because yeah probably hear each other. Well, when you cross talk. So it did need more structure. So I was thinking if I were to do it again, certainly with people that don't know each other, be more like book club or

238
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yeah, you know what I mean, like, where there's a topic we already know kind of what will be responding to an a collective mind on whatever it was my first time years what so much better. You hadn't music and friendship.

239
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And this around.

240
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:43.920
Yeah.

241
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And the people that normally I'd make fun of like I couldn't make fun of that person because it is there, you know, it's like, I can't. No, I'm kidding.

242
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.580
Jen: That's so hard. Oh.

243
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I

244
00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:03.180
Jen: Like one of my favorite things about meetings. Is that like I have my people like we sit in a group and we basically are very caddy and say things under our breath.

245
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.140
Jen: You know won't be like, Oh, that's a great idea.

246
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.850
Jen: Yes.

247
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:21.930
Jen: Yeah, it's funny. I don't know if you've ever experienced this, but I do a lot of couples work and so um I've had this happen twice now where my couples.

248
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:32.850
Jen: Are in front of me and we're doing couples work and they like have a sidebar is how I say it because I can't hear what they're saying like will be in in therapy and all of a sudden, they're like,

249
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.590
Jen: Oh, money.

250
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.200
Jen: And I'm like,

251
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.310
Jen: What's going on.

252
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I haven't had it that way. But what I do is I

253
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I had couples work where they're in separate rooms and separate zoom

254
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.970
Jen: And just, I just did that for the very first time.

255
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice. That gets in a distance.

256
00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I would i'll do is i'll say I call I name the gossiping, because it to do some role play right in front of someone to process and I'll say

257
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's gossip. Okay. So you're thinking this, you're feeling this way. How do you want to say it to her. Okay. Well, say it to me first. Right. I would use this skill. Okay, now turn to her and do it. So I caught I it's a call it gossiping to be

258
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: really lets you and I. Quick do individual quick skill bill review building and review. Okay.

259
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.780
Jen: Now it's back into it.

260
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.200
Jen: Yeah.

261
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.490
Jen: Oh, I love that.

262
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To see it like they get to hear the real stuff they're listening so they hear it twice, and it's kind of

263
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.640
Jen: Way.

264
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I gotta for a second.

265
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.490
Jen: And I love that. I'm so ceiling that

266
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally. Totally. I'm trying to also get back up on my Big Mac to see if I can be

267
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Better

268
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:59.640
Jen: Like you you especially if you're used to that computer. It sucks to have to go to the other one.

269
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:13.620
Jen: That's another interesting thing is that we only have one computer at the home and now both my husband I are working from home. And so it's this morning he woke up very early because he knew that I needed the computer from nine until 6pm

270
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:25.080
Jen: And so, um, yeah. And I was like, I can't use my phone. It's really not a big deal. But he's been very kind, as far as like letting me have it since I'm used to having it.

271
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's touch base on some other other areas, you had a big change.

272
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the work setting.

273
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing around that history how fresh, is it still intruding into your emotional life.

274
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:53.970
Jen: You know, it's interesting. I'm, I'm still in pretty close contact with one of the therapist who still there. It was my closest friend there Nadia is her name.

275
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.490
Jen: And she actually just reached out yesterday I was talking about tele health

276
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:09.690
Jen: And she asked me how I was doing. And I was like, you know, I think I'm getting to a place

277
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.440
Jen: Where God, how did I put it. I really liked the verbiage I used

278
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:34.470
Jen: I said, I've let go of the negative terms on which I left. And I'm feeling so good about working with me again.

279
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:49.380
Jen: So my my new boss, as she puts it, she's like, I'm not your boss. I'm clearing house, your, your boss, because she lets me operate as if in private practice and she's just doing the billing um

280
00:24:50.070 --> 00:25:11.040
Jen: And but she's just so kind and sharp and just like in the way that she communicates and everything. I'm not sure if I had told you this last time. But when I worked for her before I had to wait until the insurance companies paid her before I got paid. I did this last night.

281
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she gives

282
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: She was

283
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.810
Jen: Amazing. And so I i and I'm making so much more money.

284
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:27.240
Jen: Which is crazy to be saying that right now. Specifically, but but because she's paying me more.

285
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:40.140
Jen: I have new clients coming in every week. I have a waiting list now because I was like, I can't do any more 30 bills in a week is definitely where I start to like become crazy

286
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:52.200
Jen: So I was like, I'm keeping it at that. But even that is like such a gift like I just feel so happy and like every time I interact with her like

287
00:25:52.560 --> 00:26:00.450
Jen: I remember when I would get emails from Damien. And I would immediately feel like a sense of like consternation.

288
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:10.380
Jen: And I feel that with her like she just sent me this great email this morning that was like, hey, I don't know about you, but I'm finding that Tele health actually like makes me feel more tired.

289
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:22.410
Jen: And I just found this great like three minute video that talks about why. And so she sent it to me and like or other therapists are joining Telehealth and it was just she's very like that she's thinking about these things.

290
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is a good fit. You are independent. You, you have all you know all the brain work and you don't, you're not. I mean, I think you're a good good candidate for an independent

291
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Person.

292
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.860
Jen: Well, what's cool is, I don't know if I told you this already, but she's helping me become totally

293
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.020
Jen: On my own by September 1

294
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.200
Jen: That's neat. It is. It feels good.

295
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.180
Jen: Yeah.

296
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So letting go there.

297
00:26:54.510 --> 00:27:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Any of the the cravings that come up around pain around negative self appraisal. Any other triggers going on.

298
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.230
Jen: Pain.

299
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.430
Jen: Definitely I'm having such an awful.

300
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.800
Jen: Sigh advocate for up in my right hip.

301
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:24.090
Jen: And like I cannot walk more than I guess like 20 feet without it. Just like overwhelming.

302
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.690
Jen: And as long as, like, I sit or lie down and a specific

303
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:38.160
Jen: Way, then it doesn't hurt. But yeah, that has been difficult.

304
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.890
Jen: It has definitely

305
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:48.030
Jen: made me want to, we're not made me want to, but I've wanted to medicate more as a result.

306
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Through with it.

307
00:27:51.870 --> 00:28:01.830
Jen: I have definitely been a medicating more THC wise but eventually I just stopped because it wasn't helping like I was, I think it was it 200 milligrams

308
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.040
Jen: Of edibles yesterday and

309
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.010
Jen: It just wasn't making anything different. So I was like, well, there's really no reason to keep doing this.

310
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.670
Jen: And so I've been doing Tiger Balm Epsom salt bath stretchy stretches

311
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.490
Jen: As my husband likes to call them.

312
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.650
Jen: What do you stretch your gestures.

313
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.890
Jen: And then just deep massage. I have it an s massager.

314
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.230
Jen: Yeah. And then I also have

315
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.140
Jen: Were you looking at something

316
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh well, because I'm typing on my Mac and this show. It's totally awkward. I'm wondering if we can

317
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:45.690
So that

318
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

319
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Showing up more present

320
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.540
Jen: Oh, you're fine.

321
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to see. So here's what happened. Let's see if I can log out of here. It doesn't want to be in two places. I can tell it's getting

322
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Worse. So if I log out here and I log in on my my big mac I just shut down restarted and I'm hoping that it doesn't make me upgrade over here, because that's what caused this whole kerfuffle to begin with.

323
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll just open up another meeting, but it should be over here, worst case.

324
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.200
Jen: Probably will just start to

325
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Come right back.

326
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.020
Jen: So should I go ahead and sign out and then come back in like two minutes. Cool.

327
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Not even two minutes 20 seconds.

328
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.650
Jen: Awesome. Okay.
