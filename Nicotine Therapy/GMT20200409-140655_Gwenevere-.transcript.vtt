Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I gotta, I gotta reduce temptation, much like if I'm trying to cut back on chocolate. I don't keep it in my cupboard. I'm like, Oh, would you hide it from me, just get it out of my face.

141
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wonder how many Tuesday was Tuesday's would have to happen for you, like, yo, I've got it, I've got to change my environment.

142
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.480
TCL A501DL: Just that one Tuesday.

143
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you still want to see how long you can go while you still have an option to get pooling

144
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.800
TCL A501DL: No, I haven't been drinking. I don't think you get it. I

145
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't think I follow

146
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.610
Yeah.

147
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Your last

148
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your last drink was 331 believe

149
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I get it.

150
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.800
TCL A501DL: Tuesday.

151
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

152
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.920
TCL A501DL: Well well last two on there. Okay.

153
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I get it.

154
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.160
TCL A501DL: Yeah, you got that part.

155
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I get that you want to

156
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: be faced with the challenge. See how long you can stay sober without telling your homies to limit you.

157
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.910
TCL A501DL: Kind of, I mean I don't talk to

158
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.860
TCL A501DL: Me more real much they're all busy. They're all at work, I'm awake. I don't see them.

159
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.840
TCL A501DL: Be fine.

160
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's a convenience. So now picture everybody's off work now everybody's got all this time.

161
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: See how that's an external constraint versus internal is listen guys,

162
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Love yet but dude can't hang doing the drinking thing. Let's hang. Let's do something else.

163
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.660
I'm

164
00:16:47.130 --> 00:17:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to keep going at it. But I wanted you to see that there is some choice in there that we may end up visiting this again. But you'll do it on your terms you'll do what you're going to do you already know kind of what consequences are on the line for you right

165
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.930
TCL A501DL: Yeah so liquor stores are now close to New Mexico, so

166
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.940
TCL A501DL: I wanted the ball.

167
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Journal still external

168
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:11.880
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

169
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You

170
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The difference is when you set it up versus this is just convenience. Because guess what, when that convenience opens up again. Now you're left with you to make a decision.

171
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm

172
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.140
TCL A501DL: Probably not gonna drink again because I don't want to go back to fucking jail for some petty ASK GOD DAMN bullshit.

173
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one that's that that anger right there might just be the one that's internal motivation.

174
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

175
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now it's, um, it's a play on words, actually. Typically I still call it external but we're going to go with it for now. I don't want to go to jail.

176
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right for this.

177
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: F bomb reason

178
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want my freedom.

179
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.120
TCL A501DL: You know,

180
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're how old okay

181
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, the drinking age is

182
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a fact liking or not liking hypocrisy or not, it's still 21 out there, isn't it.

183
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

184
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't want to go to jail for breaking the law.

185
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.380
TCL A501DL: Yeah, basically my probation.

186
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay.

187
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

188
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's take a peek at this other one we've noticed around on this little bit. This was, I want to join the Navy and Marines.

189
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a little bit of info here around

190
00:18:51.420 --> 00:19:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of see through community college and possibly true try whole Community research FREE AFFORDABLE app for math tutoring. Okay, so we were kind of just lightly touching on ways that you can kind of stay focused still driven towards this long term goal you have

191
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it fallen by the way are you basically working sleeping working sleeping drinking to say working sleeping.

192
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Or are you creating some time of investment in this this navy Marines part

193
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.840
TCL A501DL: Well, I've been investing a lot of my time into that by lucky I go to where

194
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:46.470
TCL A501DL: I do when I go home a workout. I go for a run through on what we have what we call or what's called the pack Venice. It's a 4475 pound best

195
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:55.290
TCL A501DL: Yes, I put that on. And then I go for a walk with it. And then I come back I do pull ups, squats. Push Ups sit ups and then

196
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.910
TCL A501DL: By then, usually. It's dinnertime. And then I eat.

197
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:08.700
TCL A501DL: And then I go just play video games or read a book about something or I don't know. Look around for a bit. Okay.

198
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't remember that the exercise was the challenge because you didn't say, Oh, I'm having a hard time getting my tissue off the couch.

199
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What what was. Yeah, so you're doing the thing that that's already kind of comes naturally to you the part that where it got wiggly was

200
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I because I'm saying, well, what's getting in the way. What could get in the way of what you identified was I wrote challenges math was difficult in high school might research FREE AFFORDABLE app for math tutoring maybe check out through community college or possible tribal community.

201
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Also that probation. Then another barrier is it's to the probation requirements are tedious and they're a hassle.

202
00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but what about the I could have checked out math tutoring. Did you even after we talked. Did you even think about it one time.

203
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:15.120
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I thought about it a couple of times, I didn't, I didn't look up tutoring, but I went through some of the books at my dad's house and went through some of what he has like

204
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:27.570
TCL A501DL: Like what front like math books from when I was in high school and math books from my my sisters were in high school. So just kind of like flipping through the pages like looking at them baffled or like how the fuck am I gonna do this.

205
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay. Okay.

206
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So all of a sudden, I just thought of something I can't remember if I mentioned this to you before. Let me see if I can find

207
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, this, this doesn't mean this is the be all end all this is just an idea, a brainstorm. Okay. So I'ma show something to you you cool with that online.

208
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Yeah.

209
00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The share my screen. Um, because I I work in this program. Um, and I like the instruction of, I don't know that I'll be able to

210
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Get you into let's say it's algebra.

211
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something, some of the stuff they're doing kind of like it might be like, I bet it's going to be somewhere in here so

212
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This honestly I'm my a people person. This stuff just is just daunting for me. But what yeah but it's not. But watch inside of it. I hope I can get that far. So let's say I go to

213
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What's a friggin energy. Right. Okay. So let's say I want to know what an integer is and I want to. It's cute because they give you a little test and whatever. But watch what happens when I get it wrong and I will because I barely even know what the heck, this is

214
00:22:47.670 --> 00:23:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what the heck I don't, I don't remember this which integer presents this scenario which should bring my kid in here which integer represents the scenario five kilometer decrease in distance. I know I'm gonna go with this with tech. Oh, I guess that right

215
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When I get it wrong. This is the part I want to show you. So what they don't show me is how to do it until I get it wrong.

216
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh shoot, I got that one right to I'm trying

217
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I just say you're guessing stop.

218
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here.

219
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.130
TCL A501DL: There you go.

220
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch sorry incorrect. Look what they do. They teach me how to do it.

221
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here's a review which energy represents a scenario, giving away three cookies from a cookie jar.

222
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You answered three

223
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So a positive number can represent a game, which is applause or an increase. So positive number can represent again a negative number can represent a loss or decrease read this, this scenario again.

224
00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: giving away three cookies from a cookie jar. Number one, I would only give one I want to eat those other two, but I won't get into that.

225
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. For me, a one on one for me. Okay. So giving away three cookies from a cookie jar would cause me to stress.

226
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The scenario involves a loss or a decrease. That's true. That would be like a minus. I'm thinking us a negative energy to represent this scenario, the integer would be negative three.

227
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of get that. Did you just get that like it's take away like it's a negative because I gave away the cookies.

228
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

229
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they did a good job. I think

230
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.900
TCL A501DL: So what you mean.

231
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly. So, I, I'm just saying that in here is cool stuff. They'll me. I am not smarter than a fifth grader. So I probably start reviewing third place.

232
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care.

233
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm humble. Look at all these third graders are doing. I

234
00:24:51.810 --> 00:25:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: First I want to know the words are using like fractions of a whole I mean seriously, they're going to be doing. I'm like physics now in third grade. It keeps getting harder for each generation. So here's fractions.

235
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Of all, you said

236
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.220
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

237
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You get it in. Correct. That's when you get the good, that's when they kind of explain how they came to it. So this could be

238
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A place for you to learn, you know how you're sitting there looking at those math books, guess what, if you write this down is called just that's I excel. I remember it is XML learning, but I guess it's I excel. Now I play

239
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. I think I pay $15 a month, but I think there's a free

240
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Period of time or there's something that happens that you could jump into it straight away in a free scenario if memory serves, I had this account for quite some time.

241
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, what do you think

242
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.160
TCL A501DL: I might be down the check it out.

243
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.180
Right.

244
00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, nobody's like confusing. You can sit there with the problem. Take as long as you need do another one, get it wrong either intentionally or whatever. And then you can look at another scenario or backup to an earlier concept review those I honestly think I would start to cry.

245
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.080
TCL A501DL: No, I get

246
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: These things I remember when I was like cutting and pasting. That's all I remember. I don't remember.

247
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.600
TCL A501DL: One.

248
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Incident teachers just people, okay.

249
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so that was a little brainstorming.

250
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously, that's one idea. There's a ton of different ideas out there that's just one, but at least I hope you've come away with

251
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling more comfortable with the idea that there are resources out there where you can kind of do it a two in the morning if you couldn't sleep and you're like, man, I need to sleep aboard and just put me to sleep for sure.

252
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.280
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I get that.

253
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You imagine I'm doing math at two in the morning, that is making me tired so

254
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, my name.

255
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh man, so much. Okay, so what else, um, and it's kind of nice. They, they give you those little like gold star know they send you this little email like, way to go, you know, and so there's these nice little rewards along the way and it might seem silly but

256
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.230
TCL A501DL: We all

257
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we all kind of want a gold star.

258
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter how old you are.

259
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

260
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so here that. What else do we have in here. Now, as far as I'm

261
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotional

262
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I wrote myself. This is the first time we met, and I never did finish this task I when I first met I had in my mind.

263
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that one I had question after question after question after question after question, remember that day that first day we met. I hadn't

264
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Needed to do what's called a safety.

265
00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Plan.

266
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I didn't know if you were presenting with a lot of depressive symptoms.

267
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

268
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We can just do that now. So let's do this. Let's do develop crisis safety plan. So, today's the night

269
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you kind of have thoughts of, let's say, hopelessness.

270
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.690
TCL A501DL: Not often, not that often.

271
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what would be an often amount

272
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.520
TCL A501DL: Like every day. I guess would be often

273
00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So does that mean you have a sense of hopelessness, which is often tied to depression. Would you say you have that every week, every other day. Like, how often do you think

274
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.400
TCL A501DL: I know it's not that often though it's only When shit hits the fan.

275
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So shit in a fan and not often. I won't be able to measure. So let's hang in there for a little bit more precision on the timing.

276
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.420
TCL A501DL: Every other week.

277
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. It's not. It's like, it's an approximate

278
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.000
Yeah.

279
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about

280
00:29:47.250 --> 00:30:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What about feeling like, so having hopeless. Let's say it's about every other week somewhere in there after shifts hit the fan and do you ever think, well, I can't deal and I wish I was dead. Do you ever have those

281
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.480
TCL A501DL: Sometime, yeah.

282
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.800
Okay.

283
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes, is it about

284
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Every other week.

285
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.220
TCL A501DL: Yeah, more or less.

286
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Week.

287
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

288
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So then it's kind of a good thing that we're doing this now because I think we should have a little plan.

289
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So identify risk factors note those that can be modified to reduce risk. Okay, so

290
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Shit hit the fan scenario. Are those the cop pulling you over. Are we talking about the same thing.

291
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.740
TCL A501DL: Oh, kind of not really

292
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. Well, then, can I hear the proverbial excrement hitting a fan. What

293
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.750
A scenario.

294
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:08.340
TCL A501DL: It would be more or less like me going to jail me fucking up on probation.

295
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.530
TCL A501DL: Um,

296
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.790
TCL A501DL: No, just

297
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.070
TCL A501DL: Fucking

298
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.660
TCL A501DL: A check breaking my heart. Again, I guess, I don't know.

299
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's one. Sure.

300
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we feel emotional about them. And then so

301
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically after it's hit the fan and the event has happened heartbroken.

302
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: F up on probation.

303
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like that, after

304
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm is it your next thought to drink.

305
00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.700
TCL A501DL: Sometimes, yeah.

306
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And since you aren't really supposed to do that.

307
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What's an alternative

308
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.670
TCL A501DL: I've been working out.

309
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing you can do is I can work out.

310
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And what else do I do

311
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what about this. What if you knew even though you may find me annoying some level irritating frustrating.

312
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm forced right it's like I didn't choose to hang out with this lady at eight o'clock in the morning I'm being made to do it. But in a way, what I am is a type of medicine. No, it's kind of weird, but

313
00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you look at it like that. And in some ways, not only is it scheduled medicine every Thursday at eight in the morning, but it's also as needed.

314
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So if you're like mother.

315
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The fan is full of, you know what, and it's flying everywhere and

316
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're able to catch it. And sometimes it's a such an instantaneous flash. Well, this right now, the automatic thought is drink. I can't do that, I want to go to F in jail.

317
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's what can I do. Amen. TEXT TEXT one and maybe all that I get in the text is effin shit.

318
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

319
00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Me or I get, you know, this or emoji, you know, at the teeth or I get little you know something

320
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I

321
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But the neat thing about that is

322
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not suffering alone.

323
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's really, it's something else to be going through that fan thing.

324
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And be miserable and to feel like there's no one I can talk about it with

325
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:17.160
Yeah.

326
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to see if you were open enough

327
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to, you know, carry on. If you don't want to with me, but at least to know

328
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got someone you can text someone that you could send a quick message to you keep it. You can even call and I would see if I can meet with you. We can create another time. But he didn't want that much contact, but what you want. It was just

329
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, these Bitches be trippin. You know, or whatever you want to say, okay,

330
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.080
TCL A501DL: I gotta go to

332
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but you but you get my point. Right. You notice how that hopelessness can sometimes happen when we're in a sad.

333
00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Heartbroken disappointment in ourselves. And then on top of that, ain't nobody going to understand me that one. That's the one that can kind of push us into

334
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the point. Why am I alive can push us there. And I don't want you to have that I want you to know. I'll just text. This lady. Yeah.

335
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:21.870
Yeah.

339
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.260

TCL A501DL: I hit up a couple holes and go fuck them to get over it.

345
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: On the treatment plan but i think i think i think we got home girls gets the point

346
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, and a sexual

347
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.290
TCL A501DL: Outlet can

348
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be useful. So can masturbation that can be an outlet instead of a fucking by a hose.

349
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.120
Yeah.

350
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so

351
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got that consider it.

352
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because I'm now my text back you'll probably notice. And so I want to do a heads up on that. I can't really do psychotherapy through texting. So you probably get

353
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like you're going through a difficult time. Is there a time that we can meet you, it was for me is going to feel probably really weird. Unfortunately, because I can't see how I'm able to use the words I am right now. Like all of your words.

354
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Text. I won't do that. I will put in hiding that stuff like

355
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But I might say something like, let's remember healthy coping skills. Let's do some deep breathing real quick let's just

356
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch a funny video let's real quick. Go for a walk, don't overanalyze it we got to do it right away, and you're going to be okay. You are loved. You're okay.

357

Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm going to want to be able to do that in person, you won't get much of that from a text. I've learned over the years. It's

358
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It becomes back and forth, back and forth. Of course it doesn't work. But the key pieces that you have the ability to reach out, that's what's really important. I want you to have that additional space. Okay.

359
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:42.060
TCL A501DL: All right, I know what you mean.

364
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Like if I were to put it in writing and remind you, at some point, possibly. Yeah, but you do have reasons to live. What might they be

375
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.040

Gwenevere Abriel: Can't be alcohol that's numbing, then I'm not moving through it. I gotta move through these feelings. I can't bypass them with drugs and alcohol. I gotta move through them and it's hard but they will pass. Can you add that piece.

378
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.250
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I could add that piece.

379
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So look, I'm going to continue to develop the safety plan with you. But at this point, you've got some good progress on that, um, let's review.

Gwenevere Abriel: But you did miss a group so that that kind of a plus and minus this week.

388
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's review next Tuesday is seven in the morning, whatever you gotta do to protect sleep the night before. Right.

389
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That might need a nap tell one in the morning so that you're not sleeping through an alarm. That's usually the trick that does it for people is, I've got to show up. So I got it man. I want to stay up, we'll do some math. That'll make me tired and I could go to sleep.

390
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.550
TCL A501DL: You know, making a joke to me.

391

393
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:57.660

394
00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.440
