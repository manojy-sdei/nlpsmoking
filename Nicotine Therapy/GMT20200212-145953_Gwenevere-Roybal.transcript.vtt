47
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.020
Nicole Roybal: But we've been texting him there. And I'm found out I found out that he was just as miserable as

48
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.490
Nicole Roybal: He said that he's been like going through a real bad depression. He's been just like

49
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:59.790
Nicole Roybal: You said I hate reality already. I just wish it would end. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, like what's going on, like, why are you so sad. You know, and

50
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.390
Nicole Roybal: I was just talking to him and trying to like motivate emphasis that phase, if you wanted it to end. I was like, whoa, that's that's big like don't say that.

51
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:19.710
Nicole Roybal: really scared me so I've just been trying to, I guess, text in here and there, little motivational texts. I love you. Have a good day. Be good to yourself, like, stuff like that, you know, but I don't know what's been going on with him.

52
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.650
Nicole Roybal: So I guess I'm more on the roller coaster of being on his side. Again, the Canadian

53
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, it's your roller coaster. Right. You can get off when you want to

54
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.400
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, just, it's hard. I can't just drop him like I left him.

55
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me see where we left off before we were

56
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Starting. Oh, I see. Okay, we were starting to do a little bit of the

57
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: VM. Dr. And

58
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm tell me over the last few days, let's say today is Wednesday. So as far as your ability to get up get done what you want to get done kind of walk me through what these last couple days have been like

59
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:30.120
Nicole Roybal: I'm actually I've been feeling really good. I keep like feeling like I'm getting sick and then it goes away. It'll be here for like a day and like last week I was throwing up like crazy, like I couldn't stop. And then the next day I finally eight and then I felt better.

60
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.860
Nicole Roybal: Because I haven't really been eating as much as it's like also like depression you know

61
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:48.000
Nicole Roybal: And so I've been getting sick here and there, but then it goes away and then it comes back. And so, some days I'm great. And I'm get up and I feel great. And then there's the days where I'm not sure if I'm getting sick.

62
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not you're not drinking alcohol.

63
00:08:51.810 --> 00:09:00.330
Nicole Roybal: No, no, I'll just feel like really nauseous, sometimes, but then it's also, I'm not eating good. So like, I'm not eating enough

64
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:12.450
Nicole Roybal: So I think that has a lot to do with it. Some days, I'll go without eating just because I just nothing. Sounds good. I don't have an appetite. I guess is what it is. And I just, I don't want to eat. Okay.

65
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.080
Yeah.

66
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

67
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:27.180
Nicole Roybal: To the point where I'm I get nauseous. I'm still hungry. And then finally, I'll make myself, eat, and I'll feel better. I think it's just being malnourished is the problem. I don't know why I'm doing it myself.

68
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's what's in your kitchen. Now, is there a piece of toast that you could be what's in there now.

69
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:42.750
Nicole Roybal: I'm really big on bread. So it's like, can we have, we have a lot of food to choose from. It's just, I just don't want anything to that.

70
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a different. So what's in there.

71
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.450
Nicole Roybal: Um, how to serve.

72
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Their cereal.

73
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.720
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, but I don't eat cereal because milk hurts my stomach. Okay. Oh, I'm

74
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.620
Nicole Roybal: Eating and I have

75
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.010
Nicole Roybal: I do have lactose free milk. So that's actually just an excuse

76
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.550
Nicole Roybal: Me either cereal and there's

77
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.840
Nicole Roybal: There's toast.

78
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:22.920
Nicole Roybal: There's like leftover food. My mom's we making like there's meat will finish to listen. Okay. But there's food, you know, it's just, I don't know. I don't want it.

79
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.950
Nicole Roybal: And cucumbers now and there's making me feel gross.

80
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right so cucumbers, maybe, maybe that's not the way to go, not feeling good eating that.

81
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you are doing something a little different. Why don't you see if eating a piece of bread.

82
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you put butter on it, maybe you don't. Maybe put peanut butter. I don't know, but put. See if you can try it maybe take a little bit

83
00:10:51.030 --> 00:11:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you're right about that. Maybe in the morning, making sure that you have some food in your stomach when you're taking taking this medicine. Maybe that'll help

84
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:09.840
Nicole Roybal: And that's it. I was wondering if maybe it's affecting the medicine is affecting me more to because I don't want to my stomach. So it's just medicine, that's, you know,

85
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and you're, you're so right now.

86
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice that you're hungry.

87
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.960
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so very like Lucy.

88
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so why not go in and get a piece of bread. You don't have to toast it just take a little bit, bring it in here with you hold it and let's just see what happens. Let's just grab a piece of bread.

89
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we go with that.

90
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Water near Bubba to

91
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Or coffee, whichever

92
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.800
Nicole Roybal: Try to close it, just a little bit.

93
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You toasted a little bit

94
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.690
Nicole Roybal: There's a little bit. I didn't really toast.

95
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.470
Nicole Roybal: butter on it wouldn't just tear up the bread.

96
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see what's happening when you kind of look at it and you think about breaking off a piece and having a little bit to see what comes up for you.

97
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.400
Nicole Roybal: So disgusted honestly don't.

98
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't look good. Okay, well, since this isn't you're not eating to eat emotionally you're eating for fuel.

99
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK.

100
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.360
Nicole Roybal: OK, I will

101
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:27.240
Nicole Roybal: To like like I haven't been wise during the money part. But then I also need cigarettes, but I haven't even like been able to donate because I know my iron yet. I might go to you won't be high enough, you know,

102
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So how does that get improved. What are you going to do there.

103
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:44.580
Nicole Roybal: Well, I need to eat and I soon as I need to be eating high protein and iron foods and that's, like, read me ok October peanuts and I do have peanuts. I've been eating peanuts actually happened eating. Okay.

104
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any would it be better if you put peanut butter on the bread.

105
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.260
Nicole Roybal: I don't like peanut butter.

106
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.560
Nicole Roybal: So picky like like I'm stupid. I'm crazy.

107
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.270
Nicole Roybal: I'm worried about it.

108
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So the

109
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep and eat are are pretty critical for functioning. So notice how even you laid out what's happening, because this is disrupted.

110
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.760
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, right. I know like I already know the reasons are, but I don't know, I can't fix it.

111
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is

112
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the reasons.

113
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:31.830
Nicole Roybal: Well, I don't. Well, I know like I'm not eating because under passing on my eating just listings, but I know why I'm feeling nauseous. Why keep feeling sick, it's because I'm hungry. And I know that's why that's all I'm saying is, like,

114
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.940
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so

115
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can kind of put the brighter side and maybe go grab that bag of peanuts.

116
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Delicious. Look at those making promises, but we can at least have them.

117
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.880
Nicole Roybal: Ever my next

118
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Okay.

119
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's already open.

120
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:50.910
Yeah.

121
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just take one out, take a look at it.

122
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.770
Nicole Roybal: Okay, you know,

123
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And so looking at it, kind of like this is a bit like medicine. It's something that your body actually has to have or these other negative things happen. Kind of look at it like that.

124
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How much, how many of those do you think that you need today this morning to kind of give you some protein.

125
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.240
Nicole Roybal: Like three bags.

126
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot.

127
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.120
Nicole Roybal: Because I know it's low

128
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What if you just eat maybe five of them right

129
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.880
You could do that.

130
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You got something to wash it down with

131
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and and it's not eating emotionally. It's, I need to feed this body. That would be the mindset behind it.

132
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on.

133
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.980
Nicole Roybal: I just don't want to.

134
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to

135
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, now once in your mouth. What are you noticing.

136
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.600
Nicole Roybal: Very dry.

137
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we got some water there.

138
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It tastes good. Is it salty. Is it a little sweet, are those the right nuts.

139
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.240
Nicole Roybal: Because I'm going to say anything.

140
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:33.600
Nicole Roybal: Kind of black yeah yeah cuz I don't, I don't know, it's because of my mindset. Now I'm thinking. Let's go stop.

141
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Go. Stop. Okay, well you know what, we still need to still need to eat.

142
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.660
Nicole Roybal: I know so much water.

143
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.250
Nicole Roybal: It'll make me not just because I drink so much water. Sorry.

144
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationship with food changes, you know, so keep keep nibbling on it.

145
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: As you can see, you can see the connection. You're, you have some depression, you don't feel like eating don't enjoy the same things the way you used to. So lots changing, we've got to make. And so you're not protecting sleep you're not protecting your eating. Think about it. These are critical.

146
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.600
Nicole Roybal: Got to eat. We have

147
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.930
Nicole Roybal: Ya know,

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know,

149
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:29.520
Nicole Roybal: I guess I don't care. This was at the moment. Maybe, maybe.

150
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.240
Nicole Roybal: So, so

151
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Last, last week we were talking about

152
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you had mentioned that your dad was sort of

153
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Pushing guilt.

154
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a job.

155
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like the dynamics between

156
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: YouTube has relaxed a little bit

157
00:18:50.190 --> 00:19:02.760
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, definitely. I just noticed. Don't go in their room processor at times. So when he's a little to buzz and starts being an asshole. So, okay, start seeing away more even more than I already do do

158
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.700
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I'm just

159
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.690
Asking

160
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:15.060
Nicole Roybal: Him to look like seven. He's like, Oh, you're ready going to bed. Sorry, I was like, no one thing like to tell you, I'm gonna go and say,

161
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.970
Nicole Roybal: Okay, the other room.

162
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.400
Nicole Roybal: Everyone always fix that. So I say inside. It's like we're outside no insight into another room.

163
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

164
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.040
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

165
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When

166
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: When we were talking last last session about this belief you have about yourself, right, we were moving from sort of a negative belief.

167
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To a positive one, which is I can do this. I'm strong enough.

168
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.500
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

169
00:19:47.700 --> 00:20:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember the next day and you know if that's Friday, I think we probably met on a Friday. Right. That's pretty typical for us if we met on Friday, which we did. What did you end up doing on on Saturday, February 8 20 do

170
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:11.940
Nicole Roybal: I know I was using those exercises a lot with plates Jami myself in my mind with the people that I think are strong and support me and stuff or

171
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

172
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.550
Nicole Roybal: People. I don't know what everybody

173
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:23.820
Nicole Roybal: And I was doing on Saturday, and then it kind of just like faded away as the days went on like I just, I kind of forgot about it, I guess.

174
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine. What did you do, Sam.

175
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.810
Nicole Roybal: Did physically what I did on Saturday was me and my sister. We went to the gym.

176
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.510
Nicole Roybal: Job in China, like at least every two days, I guess if that and

177
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.170
Nicole Roybal: Jam and stay too.

178
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.920
Nicole Roybal: Do much today. Honestly, I think I just stayed home after that and just oh I clean to clean the house again and I slept, and I'm often everything and

179
00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:02.790
Nicole Roybal: Then I just know I'm living room. I think my sister and her boyfriend was in here. So I think main however mainly just hanging out all day. Okay.

180
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And just taking a look at your readiness to either be volunteering in the community because staying busy is is an important piece of this saying, okay, I want to, I want to look for a job or I want to do some volunteering either one.

181
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't career. This isn't you know the big I want to go back to school moment, but it's a keeping busy thing. So I love the fact that you're going to the gym.

182
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.050
Nicole Roybal: I think that's outstanding.

183
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's still a lot of negative influence around you right now with the alcohol. So I'd love for you to be busy, busy.

184
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what are some ideas that you can put put in motion.

Nicole Roybal: I

191
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:28.200

230
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.690

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. They've got, um, they had it. They had a little hike. They had one in January.

240
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

241
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.620
Nicole Roybal: not really one for like church stuff.

242
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.550
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. You mentioned gardener thing, but I just, I don't like wearing a shirt.

243
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fine. I yeah I'm not pushing it. You mentioned it. And I happen to pull it up here. So, for

244
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.600
Nicole Roybal: You know,

245
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: For you hearing certain things when you say church stuff. What is what's the part that you get kind of uncomfortable around or

246
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.840
Nicole Roybal: If it's just

247
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:45.000
Nicole Roybal: Every day I went to this legacy church that's more down the road. And I think that's an action might be a Catholic Church. It's not Christian.

248
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:52.500
Nicole Roybal: And also, so I went to this legacy church and they're Christian to and like every time I went the guy was like talking about he was saying like

249
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.370
Nicole Roybal: You don't pray for people that are dead. They're already gone and I had just lost my best friends like it like hit me hard. I was

250
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:07.680
Nicole Roybal: Like forget you, like, why would I pray for someone that's already good and then like certain my goal. I notice there's always something that I don't agree with what they're seeing

251
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.500
Nicole Roybal: If I can raise my hand and be like, hey, you're wrong.

252
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.740
Nicole Roybal: And I'm wanting to seek my opinion. So it's hard for me just to stay quiet.

253
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:25.350
Nicole Roybal: And I think, I think that's what it is about it is I get uncomfortable with some of this topics. Yeah.

254
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

255
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, for some people it's taking in the parts that they liked it feels like a connection to spirituality and they can push aside the delivery of the information and maybe there's a particular sermon. They don't like or there's a pastor, they don't like.

256
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep in mind that you can take in what works for you just sort of let let the rest go

257
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're still, you're still a very young person, you know, I mean, you're still kind of figuring out who you are and

258
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What you like and what you don't

259
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of time to get that all worked

260
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.790
Nicole Roybal: Out. Yeah, that's hard. It's hard to figure that out.

261
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's take a look at where you are with. So a really important. What is is that primary care physician. This is about a month or two overdue. Um, I don't know how I didn't focus on that with you before. It's been on the list of to do's

262
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.110
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I don't think you've ever told me to do that before.

263
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's under

264
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Under alcohol dependence schedule appointment with primary care physician client will call insurance carrier and obtain three names numbers and addresses. I think I probably talked about it, but you were still working.

265
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Off of the alcohol and wasn't remembered

266
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, wanting you to monitor heart rate pulse and other symptoms of the detoxing so I just really want to make sure you're in good health. Okay.

267
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.900
Nicole Roybal: Okay, that's

268
00:29:52.590 --> 00:30:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then come back and you know it could very well be when you investigate this stuff at the church around volunteering, you may dove tail or redirection somewhere else. I don't really care where I think the idea is, get in the community get in to your life. Get in there.

269
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's not a job that's fine.

270
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But getting busy. It's going to be important.

271
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.290
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I know. It's very important.

272
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you mentioned a depression, so

273
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What are some that I heard about the the appetite.

274
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it getting to the point where you are, you're wanting to take your own life is depression getting that bad. No, I didn't know if

275
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You noticed it in your boyfriend and it alerted you and you didn't like that. Right.

276
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's um let's move over to some of these sort of introspective concepts that we started to explore before and

277
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe bring me into a topic that's come up that was maybe upsetting for you or kind of bring me into what's been setting. It can be anything you want.

278
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:17.130
Nicole Roybal: Well, just, I mean, mainly, of course, my boyfriend or and that's a sucks. I don't even know what to call me and if I call my boyfriend.

279
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:25.590
Nicole Roybal: And that's really been getting to me. It's just him and I find myself thinking about it. Then I just don't even want to get out of bed summer league.

280
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.880
Nicole Roybal: Lane my own puddles pity.

281
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:42.300
Nicole Roybal: Right. It sucks because they like a goddess after myself just pity party that's ridiculous. Get up, stop being depressed, like, it's like he's like, I need him to be me. You know what I mean.

282
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's, that's really what I'm wondering.

283
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: For a lot of people they

284
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: They feel as if they've lost half of themselves when they break up or there's a separation or divorce.

285
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been such a split like you're going to be this part and then there's me and without you. I'm half. I'm just not this whole person and

286
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so why don't you tell me a little bit about what you think you're missing.

287
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.050
Nicole Roybal: I'm

288
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.590
Nicole Roybal: Like the

289
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:21.630
Nicole Roybal: I don't know.

290
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:37.050
Nicole Roybal: It's like everything I do now is just like halfway. Like, I can't put my full like feelings into anything that I feel because I, they're not there. I don't know how to explain it. It's weird. Like, I can't be happy because I know

291
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:56.190
Nicole Roybal: I'm actually not happy. I don't know. I can't explain it. I just, I feel like I'm being fake all the time like I'm putting on a fake smile when inside. I'm actually crumbling up. You guys okay and that's how I don't know how to explain all that. That's basically the gist of it, I guess.

292
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.250
Nicole Roybal: And that's not what you asked me either.

293
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty a pretty quality answer I would say I think you're really trying to understand and

294
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: what it sounds like.

295
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've talked to me about this before that.

296
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this man is where, you know, in his company you feel loved.

297
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just wonder, without that kind of nearby or knowing that you're going on to it or it's going to be there later.

298
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're left with

299
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.010
What

300
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.260
Nicole Roybal: Exactly.

301
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:52.140
Nicole Roybal: And I'm like, I'm like, no, I live in my way. And I come to my mom's house. And I'm like, trying to, like, make them change the way they live because I'm how I'm used to, like,

302
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:57.870
Nicole Roybal: Like cleanliness and stuff like I'm like washing the dishes like little things. Just little things.

303
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:07.140
Nicole Roybal: And I by myself trying to make them change the way they live. And it's like, oh, well, I kind of do that and then I feel like I'm shooting even more in their house. Nice. It's like I don't belong

304
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever felt like you belong in this family.

305
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:28.800
Nicole Roybal: Guess not thought about that because I'm the middle child. I've always been like on the middle child. No one cares about me and like I've always got my least attention. I guess it's about. It's about not saying that's how it is. But that's how I felt.

306
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:30.660
Nicole Roybal: And

307
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:39.390
Nicole Roybal: Like I'm the only one that graduated and everything, but then all my other brothers and sisters get way more stuff for my parents tonight and it's like what

308
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't make sense to you.

309
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:43.950
Yeah.

310
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:57.930
Nicole Roybal: But I mean, every child is different. And as the kids. My parents have so many kids. I think now they're down to their last one that's still in his teenage years. They're just like, whatever. Let me give you once

311
00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You graduated from high school.

312
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:07.320
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, yeah. And none of my other siblings. They got TVs and stuff, but they didn't actually graduate high school

313
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes it a lot, a lot more effort to actually show up every day and go to those classes and do the homework so much commitment.

314
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.590
Nicole Roybal: And I stayed an extra year to

315
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.400
Nicole Roybal: Add to senior years

316
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.020
Nicole Roybal: Why

317
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.540
Nicole Roybal: Just cuz like for seniors kind of partying.

318
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:38.700
Nicole Roybal: You know, being a teenager. And then the second year, I took like I had like nine classes a year and I just worked my butt off and I graduated

319
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.520
Nicole Roybal: So no, I have to together but

320
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you do.

321
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole is anyone in your life, encouraging you.

322
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.450
Nicole Roybal: Know my

323
00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:03.210
Nicole Roybal: My little sister. I told you I've been talking to a lot. She really encourages me a lot to do what to just to be better and like she like

324
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:14.370
Nicole Roybal: Always like if I'm excited about Danielle. She like remind me like the bad stuff and like remember like there's these cons. Like, don't be sad. Like you could be better. You could do this like she's so tell me that

325
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.350
Nicole Roybal: So one or two.

326
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: part. That's the part I'm interested in. So someone that's nurturing and maybe your sister has that in her but has she the ability to nurture for self is she going to school. Is she seeing an embracing her own potential and therefore can see it in you.

327
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is this all about boyfriend have one don't have one, which is, it's a very different leverage of self esteem focusing on. Do I have boyfriend or not. Am I okay without right this other person.

328
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.620
Nicole Roybal: And for you.

329
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now while you're doing this.

330
00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Work. I just wonder what it would be like if you just did a little exploration and see, see what interests you.

331
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in school and kind of remember back when you were in high school and say, Did I kind of like math. I like science. Did I like poetry. Did I like writing. I like what Kate you like. Do you remember

332
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:30.690
Nicole Roybal: Rosa thing. Yesterday I was actually talking about that. Oh sounds really good at it. I just don't like it. Oh, you asked me what I liked them and then

333
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:38.640
Nicole Roybal: Because I know I was really good at some things, but I didn't like it like I was really good at architecture, but it's just boring.

334
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:47.760
Nicole Roybal: To measure, measure, measure, measure, but also good at it so good it even have a credit seeing them in architecture already

335
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.160
Nicole Roybal: But I didn't like it.

336
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing that ever actually really like

337
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So how likely is it you're going to be

338
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to figure that out when all of your mind is going to

339
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel's with me, Daniel. Start with me. DANIEL. DANIEL. DANIEL

340
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.170
Daniel

341
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

342
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take a minute to kind of say, well, what, what do I like and you get to go find out. Same way with architecture, you get into it and then you find out real time. I don't like it. I don't like it.

343
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:38.760
Nicole Roybal: One thing I love is. I love cooking and I always wanted to be a pastry chef. When I was younger, but I don't want to get into a career of that and then end up hating it is something I love and I don't want to end up hating it you know

344
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.660
Nicole Roybal: So that's where I kind of like where it blocks squared.

345
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.280
Away tonight.

346
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you cooking pastries now.

347
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.770
Nicole Roybal: No, I'm more just like a regular cook now.

348
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't really know if you

349
00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ended up hating making pastries, tell me what the downside is about

350
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:15.150
Nicole Roybal: Because I want a career. Enjoy. I want to go to work, like I want to have a job that I want to go to, not a job in my work again. I hate my life. I hate work great job. I want a job that I enjoy where it doesn't

351
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Work right but you went you moved from I think you went so fast. I think I'd like it. I don't want to do it because then I don't WANT to hate it.

352
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you, you haven't gotten out there yet and really done career stuff which is very different jobs are different than careers careers. You have plenty of time to get the training.

353
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're there getting training really learning. Is this something I wanted to do you get to find out. And the reality is

354
00:39:45.480 --> 00:40:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people change their careers. They go in, they think that it's this may make a change, there's not this big I they're not I wasted my time. Now it's my interests have changed. I have changed. So you're getting way ahead of it and it's keeping you from even starting

355
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:20.970
Nicole Roybal: Well, I feel like whatever my next job is, it has to be my lifelong job because I'm getting to the age where I gotta, I gotta be steady and I got to have a job that is going to last forever. So that's like pressure on that.

356
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole that's irrational, where's that coming from

357
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:40.800
Nicole Roybal: Because I'm getting older. I'm going to be 32 years and I just, I feel like we like us to be together by that like Time's running out. I need to get my life together and even have a steady job I need how's

358
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:47.850
Nicole Roybal: Everything good and I need to have a job that I'm ready to keep for the rest of my life. Because if not,

359
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that that's not realistic, Nicole.

360
00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:00.360
Nicole Roybal: Sure about getting a job. That's why I like it freaks me out because I need to get something that's going to last for my life.

361
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What you need to do is be busy. The rest of its going to fall in line. You don't know that yet. And it just, you may have to rely on what I'm saying.

362
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone else that you trust, Nicole. It's going to come in line.

363
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It will. But the point is not that it maps. Some. This is the recipe of what happy will be no you're going to recognize happy along the way.

364
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know you get if you got yourself into a job. We don't even know. Yeah, you've been drinking before you get there.

365
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're like, Huh. Well, I kind of like this idea of moving up I want to explore a little bit more responsibility and maybe it's only about feeling what it's like to be a manager. What's it like to be in charge of people I want to know what that feels like.

366
00:41:52.830 --> 00:42:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. And then you talk to someone you run into someone and now there's this whole other field that opens up for you. We know that's a rare person that knows exactly. Okay, this is where my passion is. And this is what I want to do.

367
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: People go out there and they test out some things

368
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:23.430
Nicole Roybal: It's just I feel like I have to get everything together. Else, my life is going to just stay the same. And I'm always have mediocre jobs.

369
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But, Nicole. You're you've been using that logic. And where has it gotten you

370
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.310
Nicole Roybal: Know I just

371
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:38.670
Nicole Roybal: Not in school. Now that I'm sober everything. It feels so much more. I feel everything so much more now.

372
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.420
Oh, yeah.

373
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.890
Nicole Roybal: It's hard. It's I'm already an over ready over exaggerate everything. So now it's been worse. I'm like really

374
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, right. Okay, so we're so I'm picking up on

375
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.240
Nicole Roybal: Something

376
00:42:51.420 --> 00:43:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit maybe about myself and and the key is you just you just do one thing. So today, it's about physical health. Notice how it was about food. Notice how we were talking about sleep, you can have these lofty dreams. If you're not sleeping and eating.

377
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're not even protecting your sleep.

378
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how are you going to protect sleep when you have a job, how you going to protect sleep if you commit to a student loan and you're going to school and people are noisy and write your logic is why I want to, I want to smoke.

379
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want to be somewhere else. You have a you have still some kid logic.

380
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right.

381
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what that's fine to me you're you're you're young and in more. So this alcohol has inhibited the growth. So although chronologically, you may say, Okay, I'm pushing right you're 27 or something.

382
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But sort of on a psychological level, you might be much younger than that. So it doesn't surprise me and

383
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:08.850
Nicole Roybal: I feel like late because of all these years I've been drinking all basically all my 20s on Warren, obviously, but like when it got really bad was like all of my 20s.

384
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:23.190
Nicole Roybal: And I like I lost all these years, and all of a sudden, bam, I'm gonna be 28 this year like whoa okay we have to get my shit together. I've been acting like a kid all these years, maybe I'm kidding. My brain, but it's like full map to grow up like I have to be sure I have to

385
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.510
Nicole Roybal: Go back now and after

386
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not now. No.

387
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:27.570
Not now. Get a cook. No.

388
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you know i feel i get i know you're saying that but that's making you overwhelmed. That's not going to work. What works is one thing at a time.

389
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You go you protect your sleep. You make sure you're eating at least three times a day you protect those things. You come back to yourself and you say, well,

390
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If I was taking care of a child would I make sure my child. Ate, and slept. Yes, you would. Well, how about you treat yourself at least as valuable as that.

391
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to protect those things. Okay, I've got a handle on that. Well, I certainly need to go to a pediatrician. Okay, I would make sure that there were routine checkups.

392
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I just stopped drinking. This is huge. I want to make sure my physiology is in good health and I go and I get a checkup.

393
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your you just push that off to the side that thing you do, or I've got to already have it all figured out. No you don't, you're healing right now. Right now you just do some basics, get some confidence under there. You come back in here and you say, I did them.

394
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I took care of myself. I can show myself responsibility because what you look like is you look like you're Shane activated, it doesn't look like you're just in in accountability and responsibility.

395
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's wiping you out that says to me, that's shame it. Look how productive, it is, it makes you want to not move.

396
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.670
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, really.

397
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work. I have yet to see it work with people.

398
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.440
Nicole Roybal: Think I just thought I'd be in a much better place than I am. When I was younger, at this age, I thought I'd be

399
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.030
Nicole Roybal: Not here to have been a better place. You know know

400
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to spend time. Feeling Like Crap, have that thought.

401
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.530
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, true, very true.

402
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, I'm not exaggerating, you can dip into that and feel bad anytime you want to. It always be there. I could do it to

403
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone can do it. The second you compare yourself to other people or some imagined sort of thing that you had in mind about who you would be, you can make yourself feel bad.

404
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not a motivator. It's not

405
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The opposite, opposite. That's why I keep trying to tell you guys that doesn't work.

406
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the things we just talked about.

407
00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your sleep. Make sure you're eating healthy as in this is your medicine three times a day.

408
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not chips talking about a balanced meal. We're talking. You've got to have fruits and vegetables. You've got to have protein. You've got to have sort of those complex sort of whole grains.

409
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's what you're needing you need to see a primary care physician. So you do that you come back in here and you do the thought stopping and you say, I'm detoxing from shame. Now to

410
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.710
Nicole Roybal: Well, it's always something crazy nuts.

411
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: push it aside.

412
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicola, you have an incredible amount of time on your hands for people that are not working in our in school, you have all the time in the world to spend

413
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking thinking, thinking, thinking,

414
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were busy, there would be less time for this.

415
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to call the volunteer place, go find out.

416
00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're spending a lot of time ruminating and thinking about that stuff. OK.

417
00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.080
Nicole Roybal: OK.

418
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I truly believe you accomplish these little tasks and you come back to me and you tell me I did them.

419
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.330
And hey,

420
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A friend said something about going to to school to try out culinary arts or something like that. I looked into it or you got to the point where you got online and you started to Lucky went to the library and he checked it out.

421
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you come back and you tell me

422
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What you found what you felt when you did that, that is, that's the step. It's not this other stuff this this whip that you're putting yourself through like I'm a bad person, because I should be somewhere else in my life.

423
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't waste your time. It won't work. I mean, you're going to do what you're going to do.

424
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll probably be miserable, like this, like you said that pity party thing.

425
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't seen it work with anybody.

426
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have

427
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:05.670
Nicole Roybal: If it doesn't

428
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, I promise you if it would work.

429
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We would have a group on let's all call ourselves these horrible names. Let's do it together. Now I'm a shit and and it's going to motivate us today, but it doesn't

430
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.470
It really doesn't

431
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:32.910
Nicole Roybal: And I don't know why us as humans we do it to ourselves and knowing that we're doing it to ourselves and we just keep doing it I sorry

432
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How did your mother and father motivated you

433
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.010
Nicole Roybal: They've been good actually. I haven't really been fighting with them at all like

434
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Younger

435
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were younger.

436
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How did they motive. They you

437
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.850
Nicole Roybal: Oh, you cut out you and say, my dad and

438
00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:04.770
Nicole Roybal: My mom would always just say so me as long as I get good grades and I go to school, then I could smoke me

439
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:17.520
Nicole Roybal: And I feel like that's in a weird way, how they motivated me it'd be like you do good and you like do all this good stuff. Like, you're gonna graduate and you'll be able to have a good life and

440
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.800
Nicole Roybal: But also, like, you'll be able to. Here's your reward for going to school, getting the greatest joy.

441
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.590
Nicole Roybal: I know we're probably

442
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me say it back to you.

443
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.340
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know it sounds bad.

444
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Snow but but listen to it.

445
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were taught was that you get to have a drug.

446
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get good grades, go to school.

447
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And the promises that everything's gonna work out fine.

448
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:49.350
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

449
00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.370
Nicole Roybal: That'd be able to like have a good job, stuff like that.

450
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Was she correct

451
00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:04.650
Nicole Roybal: The school part. Yeah, but how you said how like smoking weed stunted my growth in my brain.

452
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It did.

453
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.690
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so

454
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened was because you were smoking weed during that time. A lot of the information that maybe could have been stored and

455
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have learned life experience. It got pruned marijuana cuts it off. It just cuts off the memory just CO, CO, CO. So you notice how right now you're sweating to give yourself a hard time. Why am I not further ahead.

456
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Combinations combination of probably some environmental stuff and you were smoking weed during that time. And then there's alcohol so cut yourself a break.

457
00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The kind of parenting that we're talking about.

458
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I never read in a text. I've never heard from anyone that rewarding their children with marijuana

459
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: An effective parenting approach.

460
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.880
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

461
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it sound was like I was

462
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:12.960
Nicole Roybal: Gonna I was gonna smoke it either way. I was already smoking. It was just now. They knew and so they're like, Okay, well, we won't

463
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.740
Nicole Roybal: Be mean to you about it as long as you're getting good grades.

464
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you do that for your children. So, picture your 10 year old is in middle school and they're they're smoking weed. Would you do the same thing.

465
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

466
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.420
Why

467
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.030
Nicole Roybal: Well, I say beat the shit out of them.

468
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:44.670
Nicole Roybal: No, I'm just kidding. But no, I'm knowing. Now if I hadn't done therapy and I had never met you know this ever happened.

469
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:58.470
Nicole Roybal: Probably would probably just be trying out everybody smoking, but knowing. Now, what it does to your mind and how it starts to grow in your mind and everything, guys. Why I wouldn't let them because I don't want them to be like me.

470
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.520
Nicole Roybal: That make sense.

471
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. I guess I'm still. Do you have any little young nieces or nephews.

472
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any that are little like eight 910

473
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:18.720
Nicole Roybal: My niece belly up. I never really see her. It's my

474
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:27.510
Nicole Roybal: older sisters first daughter. She had and she got taken away when she was like seven and now she's like, I'm gonna be 10 I think

475
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:28.950
Nicole Roybal: And

476
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.170
Nicole Roybal: But yeah, I don't ever. I never see her. She lives in Silver City or no, no, no.

477
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.900
Nicole Roybal: Well, that's what we're seeing.

478
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture her for a second picture telling her. Yeah, you're gonna

479
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to see other kids will think it's cool. They're going to want to do these smoke weed and drink.

480
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you teach her. What would you tell her about what she could do instead

481
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:18.210
Nicole Roybal: Well, I tell her to get instead of to make sure to stay away from those kids going out with them because it's going to suck you in and then you'll want to do it being around them seeing them doing it. So make you want to do it. So just stay within the bad kids join cheer join club.

482
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:25.890
Nicole Roybal: Join like a lot of like school activities, you know that. What's going to distract you from hanging out with those bad kids.

483
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.730
Nicole Roybal: Well,

484
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're not bad kids.

485
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.930
Nicole Roybal: Well, not that. Oh yeah, that's true. I shouldn't be saying it like that.

486
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because think about it.

487
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just like you right there are bad people.

488
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They're choosing and probably their families and doors. This idea that drugs and alcohol are acceptable for young developing body and

489
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Every house is different, every home is different. The rules the expectations are different.

490
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:04.770
Hmm.

491
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:07.440
Nicole Roybal: It's definitely true.

492
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If there. Watch this is good for you, Nicole to say this stuff out loud. If we don't call them bad once you talk about what cheer does, what does joining choir do what does running track playing an instrument. What does it do for developing

493
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Mind and a growing body. What does it do for a young person to do these these activities.

494
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.370
Nicole Roybal: One is the for college apps.

495
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.500
Nicole Roybal: Just kidding. But, but, no, I think it, what it does is it just it

496
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:55.800
Nicole Roybal: Puts you in your own world in a different world from those people. They live in different worlds, whatever, but it puts you in your own world where you're going to be around other people that are in a good world. I guess I'm Tansy and that

497
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.540
Nicole Roybal: I'm

498
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:10.590
Nicole Roybal: Just being around more positive people being around more people that are still burn just they do they go running for fun early. I do not explain what I'm saying.

499
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but do you notice that it is hard for you to identify the value of cheer.

500
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And right it doesn't come naturally to you. It's, it's, it's still comparing it to bad kids. But it's more than just the fact that you're spending time with this group of kids. We've covered that that part you can identify

501
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When a child. Studies music. It literally develops the connection. The corpus callosum between both sides of the brain. I don't really care whether my son plays a trombone, or whatever. I like what it does for his developing brain.

502
00:56:51.330 --> 00:57:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And more than that, he gets to see what it's like. Watch to do something he literally looked at this little.on a piece of paper and he never. He was like, what is that squiggle, that's a note.

503
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, if I if I make this sound here. I look at this, I can make that sound and then he learned something else, he saw something that once you did not know. And now he knows how to do it. He knows that about himself and guess what that does the self esteem.

504
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.050
Nicole Roybal: Hey raises it

505
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Back. Yeah. Does what just going to a chair and no and you are like, Oh my gosh, I have no idea what this new routine is going to be

506
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what you do. You hear the music you watch it, you feel yourself doing it. Do you have any idea what that does for a young person that content, I can go from knowing nothing

507
00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To practicing it I face that fear and I did it, guess, guess what happens

508
00:57:52.980 --> 00:58:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When she goes out and wants to do something she's never done before she has a lifetime. She has 10 years of having gone out with a supportive apparent right saying

509
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you don't know that you can do it, but I've watched you write a parent says to their little one. I know you got this all right here. I got your girl.

510
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not just about avoiding bad kids. It's about getting into your own efficacy and I'm looking at you right now. Nicole that was missing.

511
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:23.040
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

512
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see it. So I'm sitting here, fighting like I'm like, where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it, I'm like, wait a second.

513
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You have done difficult things and I understand you have forgotten and it hasn't stuck. But you have gone to jobs that you did not know how to do it. You didn't know how to do.

514
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The, what was the

515
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Not algebra, but

516
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What the heck was the thing you said it's boring. When you do all the angles.

517
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.560
Nicole Roybal: Geometry. No. Oh. Architecture architecture.

518
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't know how to do that until you learn how to do it, but you forgotten that you have that skill.

519
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this has to do with a self esteem piece and it's just it's gotten some erosion to it. I know you're going to be just fine. I truly do but you're getting ahead way in the hypothetical stuff. I know you're going to be fine.

520
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:26.820
Nicole Roybal: As my teachers. I feel so much pressure on my teacher

521
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.530
Nicole Roybal: When I hear you. I felt because I can hear your dad saying you need to go. Hurry up. Hurry.

522
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Up know they they kind of failed.

523
00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:43.200
Nicole Roybal: It's also Daniels always pushing me to be like he's the main one up with the idea in my head that I need to have my life together by 30

524
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, where was he when you were drinking

525
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you know this is a lot more complicated than that. Nicole, you are missing a good enough piece from your caregivers to say

526
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not okay. It's not okay that you poison your brain while your, your brain wasn't even done growing literally until last year and you're giving yourself shit about it. That's ridiculous. No.

527
01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.700
Nicole Roybal: Stopping associate about it. So now it you know

528
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That that doesn't, it doesn't work. What works is you need as if you were that little 12 year old right

529
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's going to go out for cheer you need someone on your side saying you've got this girl I'm here.

530
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You go out, you like it you don't like it, you kind of suck at it and you don't want to keep trying to get better than you come back we reconvene and we do another one. We go do something else, just that simple.

531
01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: No shame nothing negative we go, just go out, go find out what you like. None of this, I should be married about that all that, that, that, that, that, that's all you're going to get the life you want, it's going to be this stuff.

532
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You give your, your penalizing yourself along the way.

533
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.790
Nicole Roybal: That isn't that something

534
01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the journey, that's going to get you wanting to drink.

535
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:10.680
Nicole Roybal: Now on that's I feel that way. It's like I wasted all this is shrinking and poisoning my body. Now I'm clean but it's like oh you wasted all this time. You don't even deserve to
