00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.690
Ramon: Hi Greg, I'm so sorry. I like work with slow this morning and then we got to look like the last hour. We got hit with all kinds of customers and

2
00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.900
Ramon: I lost track of time. I'm sorry. I apologize.

3
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So my guess is we're not meeting next week for individual therapy. So I think we'll take today to this little

4
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at your goals and see how you

5
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.950
Ramon: Do. Okay.

6
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.320
Ramon: All right, so

7
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: One of your goals is I want to work on my anger.

8
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you've been working on it.

9
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.580
Ramon: Yes, a lot

10
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are you noticing that you like when you have the experience of anger coming up. What are you liking that you're doing.

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.120
Ramon: What am I liking that. I'm not blowing up.

12
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the absence of blowing up. What are you doing,

13
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.000
Ramon: Um, I guess, controlling my breathing thinking about what I'm gonna say before I say not letting just words come out.

14
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're doing the breathing and you're thinking before you speak.

15
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.850
Ramon: Yes. Okay, instead of just

16
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.360
Force thinking

17
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.890
Okay.

18
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice you're not blowing up.

19
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And what are you noticing in your relationship was the feedback. You're getting back from your environment as you're noticing this change in yourself. What, what are you noticing in interpret coin.

20
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.920
Ramon: Everything's changing the way we treat each other. The way we talk way we act everything our relationships, a lot better.

21
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.560
Ramon: Not so stressed out.

22
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we've gotten behind what you saw was working, have there been moments where it was more challenging.

23
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.000
Ramon: And

24
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.750
There was

25
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of maybe some anger. Shut up more than you really

26
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.270
Wanted

27
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:43.290
Ramon: Um, I don't necessarily know about challenging but there have been moments where I forgot to execute what I learned in therapy or do what I will. You know what I what I said I was going to do or some and then afterwards. I'm like, Oh shit, that was the time to do it. It didn't do it.

28
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

29
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.540
Ramon: You forgot to use the skills and

30
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What ended up happening.

31
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.960
Ramon: Oh we argue, she cries. We don't talk for a minute, and then the conversation, pretty much.

32
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long does that she's crying, you're arguing. How long does that last

33
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.370
Ramon: Hour to

34
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does they get resolved.

35
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:30.450
Ramon: Well, pretty much what ends up happening is, we'll hang up with each other, something and then just wait it out work and then later on. End of the day. We'll just call an act like nothing really happened.

36
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.240
Ramon: We'll get home and then we'll like talk about it in person face to face.

37
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.740
Ramon: She fell how I felt she was thinking what I was thinking.

38
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so whatever it is that you're doing. It's it seems to be working. And whatever she's working on. Do you see her changes to that she's

39
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.430
Ramon: She's yes a lot

40
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.950
Ramon: A lot. A lot. She's really good.

41
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you love to see those changes.

42
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.800
Ramon: Yes. Well, I haven't recently. No, but I tried to okay

43
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we could reinforce it by letting her know what you're seeing, and that you like it.

44
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's move to the next goal, which is I want to say 1500 so we can get a place well

45
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you've already got a plan. They're very wrapped with that.

46
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.650
Ramon: Oh,

47
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.080
Ramon: Really close

48
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.180
Ramon: All really really close.

49
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How much money you got

50
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.790
Ramon: A pretty much got the 1500. It's like a little under like 4060 or something.

51
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.200
Yeah, so, so, uh,

52
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.910
Ramon: But about another week or two, and we should be good.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.600
To have

54
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.720

Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and milligrams

82
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.080

83
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.240
Ramon: A 1623

84
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I feel like you've been at 23 for

85
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.730
Ramon: Two weeks now. I was out. Yeah. About two weeks now. Okay.

86
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you think the next time you see the doc who you would like to mention a plan to taper again.

87
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.380
Ramon: Well, I would love to, but I still have this problem that

88
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.100
Ramon: I feel like

89
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.520
Ramon: When I'm done with this.

90
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.210
Ramon: I should reward myself and I should go get high.

91
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.740
Ramon: What I mean

92
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.460
I do

93
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.750
Ramon: So it's kind of as I'm not gonna lie to you it's becoming a little harder because I'm scared.

94
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.510
Ramon: Relapse not scared to cut down, not just scared to relax.

95
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. What you just said, and it's about this reward you must have used getting high as a reward in the past.

96
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.480
Ramon: All the time. Yeah.

97
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.540
Okay.

98
00:08:46.560 --> 00:09:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, is it possible that you can do both that you're not there right now. This may take from on. What if we said that's a year away. Don't. Don't get distracted with the number but look at the distances is from today.

99
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.940
Ramon: Yeah, my also looked at that. So,

100
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, way out there and look how much you've changed just when you really immersed yourself. You really started to take in some of the things that

101
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That I've been saying or the doc has been saying, or maybe a group or any from your friends. You know when you really turn your attention to opening your mind, your heart, your spirit to that. Look how much a little bit of change and how you speak and

102
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.190
Ramon: Somebody called me a messed up the volume.

103
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that happens.

104
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear me

105
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.640
Ramon: Test test test or Yep, yep.

106
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

107
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.310
Ramon: I don't know where

108
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't hear me, so just acknowledge for a second. The fact that you made a change in thinking right you held off speaking

109
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You learned a breathing technique you use information from a friend, you've used information and applied it now those changes.

110
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Those are small changes and big impact the relationship with your sweetheart has changed in a big way. So look, looking ahead, a year random number. How much change how many more coping skills, you're going to have, how much more confidence, you're going to have

111
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:29.310
Ramon: Just imagine that I think a lot. I think so, too, like me and my girlfriend. We're talking about it already like

112
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.880
Ramon: Look at where we're at in a year module will be in a year now. Yeah. If you've been telling each other that

113
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If you keep absorbing it

114
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And not let

115
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what a lot of people do is they let their pride and

116
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.710
Ramon: Ego get in the way, like

117
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't want to take things

118
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.350
from, let's say,

119
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets a bit in the way and it might delay it, but you look like you're taking them in and you're applying it.

120
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If it works.

121
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Great, if not Pitch it.

122
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into this piece about reward for a moment.

123
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever seen anybody that rewarded themselves with something else.

124
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.150
Ramon: Yeah, definitely.

125
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:22.260
Ramon: Like gone by themselves. Something mainly that's really what it is going to go do something or something like going out to eat.

126
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:34.620
Ramon: Going to amusement park or going out to a concert or buying clothes. Oh, I'm gonna do this for myself because I had a good week or I was, you know what I mean, sure.

127
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.030
Ramon: People do it all the time.

128
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.130
Ramon: What's your my way of rewarding myself was just cheap and quick.

129
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right isn't

130
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It quick that immediate stuff is going to be important. So we're going to work with that so

131
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel in your imagination, what would feel right away that you can do.

132
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: As a sense of acknowledging that profound

133
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Work that you put into healing. Right. It's a huge piece of people's life story their recovery. It's a huge part of your timeline.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.300
I mean,

150
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:28.440
Ramon: First day my my reward the way my life was turning

151
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.830
Ramon: Like I

152
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.570
Ramon: Think My reward is what I've earned and that's my girlfriend her daughter this job.

153
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.840
Ramon: Like all that came from being sober.

154
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.360
Ramon: There's no way and how I would have been able to keep out of I was messing up

155
00:13:51.450 --> 00:14:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You know yourself, also, that something happens where you say probably something like this, correct me. I, I like being wrong and means we can get to your truth I deserve.

156
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.510
Ramon: See if them.

157
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.080
Ramon: I guess it only comes up in some situations, not really a lot

158
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.570
Ramon: But in some for sure.

159
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever done anything that's difficult

160
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.270
Ramon: Yeah.

161
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.260
Xiaomi

162
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.990
Ramon: This difficult as in

163
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Showing up to these groups showing up to individual therapy being held a

164
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: bridge between services at one point.

165
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.800
Ramon: Right.

166
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You just challenged a lot for you. Okay. And it's inconvenient to go to the pharmacy and there's all these pieces of when you

167
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Look into a future without an opiate there's a lot

168
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.070
Ramon: Oh, yeah.

169
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.160
Ramon: The only thing that was quite as challenging as this would be staying out of prison.

170
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.610
Ramon: Okay, that was about

171
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.990
Ramon: Or equal to as hard as this is

172
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you done stay out of prison.

173
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.910
Ramon: Stay Sober okay

174
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you had thought I should reward myself. Look at me, I'm not in prison. What a good boy. I am don't get hung up on those words. What a good boy. I am I'm such a good man, sorry, good man and I deserve any that come up

175
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.310
Ramon: Um, yeah, definitely.

176
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.710
Ramon: Definitely like

177
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.020
How

178
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.260
Ramon: Like oh, last Friday.

179
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, last Friday.

180
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: pretty recent. Yeah.

181
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk me through that story.

182
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:10.500
Ramon: I am a part of this little group on Facebook called free pipe frenzy and if you when they send you a free tobacco pipe.

183
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:21.300
Ramon: And all you gotta do is pay the shipping and handling shipping handling, like a books and last Friday I told my girlfriend will since I one

184
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:33.150
Ramon: And I've been doing good. I'm gonna just go ahead and bite us for me because it's for me this reward myself. She was like, Oh, I'm glad you bought yourself something because you never do.

185
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:47.460
Ramon: By like the way I reward myself is I get to see my girlfriend and her daughter, be happy. You know what I mean. I go take them places I buy some stuff I give them whatever I do whatever they need me to do like

186
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.730
Ramon: And then being happy as my reward.

187
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.490
Ramon: I LOVE IT. I DON'T GO OUT MY WAY TO GO BUY meat is or I don't go on my wedding.

188
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:03.750
Ramon: I don't to reward myself. My reward is seeing them being happy seeing and being comfortable. No worries.

189
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:21.510
Ramon: Like, that's how I really reward myself because I don't go by myself stuff. No more. I don't get high. No more like so I really don't know what our reward myself with

190
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.380
Ramon: Can we go

191
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's back up a little bit. Let's back up to

192
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The free pipe frenzy. Did you follow through with that.

193
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.370
Ramon: Oh yeah, okay.

194
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How did it feel when you got it in the mail.

195
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.150
Ramon: Wonderful. I love it. So yeah.

196
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.640
Ramon: Like, even though it's just a piece of glass. I was really happy about it.

197
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.180
Ramon: And it was mine to give it to my girlfriend.

198
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I talk to you a little bit about

199
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.760
The

200
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Caution that I write the cautions of

201
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your happiness being your reward being contingent on someone else's behavior. Can I just talk to you a little bit about it.

202
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

203
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If my happy just to keep it really simple meaning reward my happiness is contingent on the face of my child.

204
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I see he's miserable.

205
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've worked very hard i given him everything I sacrifice.

206
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.620
Ramon: My health my time my

207
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.370
Energy

208
00:18:45.420 --> 00:19:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You know my passion for something in order to ensure that he was want for nothing. And he's not grateful and he's impatient and he's rude and dismissive and and angry. In fact, I'm not seeing him.

209
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Be happy.

210
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to feel the reward. I'm going to be likely really resentful.

211
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got

212
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.150
Set up

213
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

214
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You broke up a little bit. I think you said, Yeah.

215
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Did your mouth. One think it said, Yeah.

216
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Test, test. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, but that does that.

217
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sense to you.

218
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.060
Ramon: Yeah.

219
00:19:47.220 --> 00:20:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um, whereas with this piece of this object that you had, you could say, Well, I did this thing. I worked very hard for it. This is a little reward, and no one can it's yours. Notice how you said it's mine.

220
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So knowing

221
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: On transient moods people purposely trying to hurt us like none of that like none of that is included in when we just say I went and I went to a car show

222
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I went somewhere.

223
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I worked hard for this.

224
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This is something I care about. And it's not subject to the whims e to the changing mood of someone else.

225
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So the upside of actually an object with what you did.

226
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it's not it's not something you can get

227
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Disappointed someone else and resentful.

228
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And someone can't manipulate you either

229
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.420
Ramon: Make sense

230
00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go back because the overarching pieces wanting to make sure we identify what can feel rewarding.

231
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And no resentment is building up but something that we can report. So, picture, picture a year from now, what would be a true honoring of something that you worked profoundly hard for and it might be a combination of

232
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.020
Ramon: I'm living my co

233
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, car, and to be a combination of unfree meaning I'm not imprisoned I'm free.

234
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.520
I'm silver

235
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.650
Ramon: And my car.

236
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: My car. Tell me, tell me what tell me the car that would

237
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like reward, because that that were far I need more details there.

238
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:47.790
Ramon: I would say, as of right now. I don't know what type of car I want, but I want to forward. Dr. Michael foot in and not a four wheel drive. Okay. Yep. So

239
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:56.070
Ramon: Yeah, cuz the car I have now I really like it. It's really old almost has 200,000 miles on it.

240
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.540
But

241
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.860
Ramon: I'm not even dumping it off, yet I still owe $300 okay and

242
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:20.520
Ramon: It's mine. Like, it's my car, my first car I've ever had. And I think a year from now if I had a newer car better car. That would be a really good word.

243
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.530
Ramon: Honestly,

244
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you. And do you notice right, it would be yours.

245
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Not context. So watch what can happen. I'm just saying, God forbid something happened to this other relationship, something happens it the context, the composition. So dynamics change if you continue to see

246
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.920
Ramon: This record for

247
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying free and out of prison and sobriety. It will still be there for you. You can still continue to work hard and save for it and still envision it

248
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Whereas if something happened with this.

249
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Relation

250
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be concerned that now your freedom, your, your sobriety right is a little in jeopardy. I get worried right there.

251
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.650
Ramon: Will make sense.

252
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

253
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't having four wheel drive great.

254
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Last longer than that, what the 32nd hi of heroin.

255
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.480
Ramon: Oh yeah, definitely.

256
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Because all of all of the good stuff. You're talking about falls apart with substance use falls apart.

257
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:45.960
Ramon: Yes, it does. And I've seen it firsthand and I never mental functioning addict, like, and I know a lot of them. Yeah.

258
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Eventually, write it because tolerance builds, they're going to end up needing

259
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.390
More

260
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna pull from their savings.

261
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're gonna pull from their

262
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Family, you know, it's going to start to a road all the things they care about.

263
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you thought about that before that a four wheel drive car might be

264
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel

265
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.850
Ramon: Bad about

266
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.220
Ramon: I thought about it, but I never really told myself, use it as a reward.

267
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

268
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.980
Ramon: Alive. I just said.

269
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:26.400
Ramon: You need a car because this was gonna break down. So we'll get you a four wheel drive or something like that.

270
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what we can do, if you like. And this ties into something you wanted to talk about which was money management, I wrote it down. You said it. You had said.

271
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Money management was the topic you kind of want to just touch on today. It's kind of relevant right now because could you be doing a little reward on a regular basis. Um, I have this special savings, no matter what I send $10 I send $20 think over here. Watch it might mean

272
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Little girl doesn't get a sparkly pair of socks. I don't know. I'm just saying, but

273
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You are rewarding your

274
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.920
Artwork

275
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are reinforcing that you have value at what you're doing.

276
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: In and of itself is terribly important.

277
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand it reinforces you are important.

278
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like that.

279
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: These people aren't going anywhere, based on 10 why I'm picking a random number on $10 going over here that loves will still be there.

280
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at what they're going to say she's gonna say, wow, look at you, loving yourself. That's beautiful.

281
00:25:48.180 --> 00:26:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: She already said it with the little glass object. It's the same thing. Right. I can read. It's not selfish and go, I gotta check in and see if that's what you do with it. Does it seem selfish to imagine every paycheck, putting aside money. So you get this four wheel drive.

282
00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:16.590
Ramon: Well, no, I've tried it and it's really hard on my part, because I kind of live. Check, check. And when I stopped putting money away in my savings.

283
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:29.850
Ramon: And up having to go into my savings to grab it to use it for like gas or cigarettes or, you know, stuff like that. And so I never really get to save it. Okay.

284
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But this idea of it. Do you like what we're talking about.

285
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.410
Well,

286
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we get this

287
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we went electronic and we we got you using one of these little

288
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There's these little apps that will take money. Let's say you use this card on something and it costs 675 they'll take that money and they will round up

289
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And Jill automatically grab that 25 cents and they're going to drop it in your savings, you don't think about it. You're not going to notice it. You know, it's 25 cents.

290
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, and it's going to sit there and sit there and sit there every time.

291
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Save save save save save say it's not painful, you're not like

292
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.940
It just go off.

293
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's one thing you can do, and I'll forward you right now. I thought I have my little list in front of me, but I don't have it in front of me. If you're interested, I can send that to you.

294
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.960
Ramon: Yeah, send it

295
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because how cool is that and and if you wanted your girlfriend could do it too. She can have her own little, little pile and your little you know

296
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Her. She could do it. And so then you're sort of building that and there's other little mechanisms little tricks that you can use.

297
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think it's on a card, then it just sits there.

298
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.480
Ramon: Like that. Yeah.

299
00:27:49.560 --> 00:28:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And right randomly. Oh, you get a windfall you work extra on a weekend or something that some sort of bonus experience you drop in another you know $20 into it. Another $50 you drop that in there and you can just leave it because you're not using

300
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.450
Ramon: You're not going to be pulling

301
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: From it to pay for anything. Right. It's just going to stay and stay in that in that savings.

302
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so what else happens around money for you were. Remember, he said, I want to talk about money management, what's the challenge for you.

303
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.110
Ramon: Saving

304
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it is about saving

305
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.320
Yeah.

306
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.880
Ramon: Like I'm pretty good about spending like

307
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.740
Ramon: You know,

308
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:42.990
Ramon: How can you say it, I got on buy expensive stuff like find some better. I will. And if we need it. That's when we buy it. We don't just go buy

309
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:54.870
Ramon: Stuff that we don't need just because it looks good, right, like we needed we buy it and then we say the rest of the money. But like I said, we end up living check to check that. Yeah, so

310
00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: People are living chatted back you know that's that's real. How much money would you like to have saved so it didn't feel like check to check

311
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.870
You'd still have 5000 5000

312
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That is that a, like a rainy day. What if something happens to my job or someone has an emergency room visit or something big happens like that.

313
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.660
Ramon: Oh, that's more like

314
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.970
Ramon: Don't have to stress on rent for the next three months.

315
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.900
Ramon: On bills and stuff because I got money there. That's really what that's for. Okay.

316
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.580
Ramon: Instead of like, oh, I have to get paid before the first and

317
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.180
Ramon: Save this for a week and a half. And you know what I mean.

318
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so how much typically are you taking home. What's your check like every two weeks, or every week.

319
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.110
Ramon: Every two

320
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:53.820
Ramon: And

321
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the average number that's coming in.

322
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.710
Ramon: Oh, about eight

323
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.750
Okay, so at

324
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.880
Every two

325
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.890
Two weeks.

326
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. In 12 months, you could have 1900 and $20

327
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay if the savings is accrued slowly.

328
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:41.580
Ramon: Yeah.

329
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so all I did just now as I took

330
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I took. Well, let's work this backwards and then come to this number in a second. How much you spending right now you am

331
00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Your girlfriend on cigarettes and we these days. I know it's been an effort to decrease what how much you spending.

332
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.550
Ramon: Oh,

333
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.870
Ramon: Oh ball $45 a week on cigarettes.

334
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And does she sharing that expense or you cover all of it.

335
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.420
Ramon: I cover everything

336
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: May see what 40 would do.

337
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So in a year. You could have $960 in savings.

338
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I just did right now is I, I said, Okay, if you just talk decide $40 every paycheck.

339
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.240
Ramon: Is

340
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be unquestioned that it's gone, it's already given that it's gone. It goes into the savings account every paycheck. So every two weeks, you would have

341
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Close to $1,000 you'd have $960 at the end of

342
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.880
Ramon: The year

343
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: As for life. Yeah, if it was 80 which is about right 10% of that 800 you would have close to $2,000 so that and all that is is that cigarette money.

344
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's $40 plus singer money if it went over here.

345
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You have close to $2,000 after a year you have 1900 dollars.

346
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have you see it does grow. It's just this if I could take off the way each time of prioritizing competing

347
00:32:53.460 --> 00:33:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Degrees of importance for where to put this money if you don't question. It's automatic friends for automatic, no matter what. So your money is in a physical check that's handed to you.

348
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Go automatic deposit what to do.

349
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.190
Ramon: Yeah, direct deposit

350
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have a, like a bank that would do an automatic transfer to savings.

351
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:23.850
Ramon: Yeah, the last Friday of every month they transfer $25 in savings. Okay.

352
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you end up just an intuitive what's going on. Yeah.

353
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.160
Ramon: end up needing it for gas or something. Yeah.

354
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's another place where that's leaking. See if there's other sums of money without $40 can where you're saying 25 right

355
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: See where else money is is getting spent

356
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.960
Ramon: That, oh yes food.

357
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Fast food.

358
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.690
Ramon: Yeah, definitely. We'd almost every night.

359
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But fast food is not terribly expensive. I mean, way down, how much it would be to make sort of chicken and hamburgers at home, kind of thing.

360
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.060
Ramon: The way down. Like I can make

361
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.200
Ramon: I can make a whole meal for like 10 bucks night.

362
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.330
Ramon: And we could have seconds.

363
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.550
Ramon: And or I could go to McDonald's for 10 bucks and get like three cheeseburgers right

364
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what are you to like a little story of where the hardest working laziest people remember that was kind of a funny thing last time.

365
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: At night when you guys get home or on the weekend. Do you have any interest to have that be, and maybe it'll be, you know, a few weeks in your

366
00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Home. But what if that becomes like a routine gathering where okay let's make food for next week, maybe we'll, we'll do this this month, all we will lasagna.

367
00:34:51.330 --> 00:35:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You do chicken parm you do cordon bleu I'm going to do chiller rianna or whatever, right, and you make it like this gathering where you just do the food prep because you guys are poked at the end of the night. Right.

368
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.700
Ramon: Yeah, pretty much. We get home, about six and

369
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Yeah, I know you guys are working hard, so look like most of us right we work. And then we have, but you can where you guys have time. Where do you guys have time on the weekend or where is it

370
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.980
Ramon: Really really on the weekends, which Sunday.

371
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.390
Ramon: I would say Saturday because Sundays we go to church and stuff.

372
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.470
Ramon: Okay so Saturday say Saturday's really are only

373
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.970
Ramon: Yeah, are only

374
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture that being kind of fun like making a meal with her.

375
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.990
Ramon: Yeah.

376
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A big one right

377
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a couple meals and getting the shopping and making it, it's all set up for them. We stuck in the freezer guys pull it out and you are working together.

378
00:35:53.190 --> 00:36:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To put the savings together so that you have this more comfortable life and you get to hang out with each other and enjoy each other's company. And there's another hobby. Oh, oh, you know what my friend at work told me about how to make

379
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: enchiladas using debt that I want to make some and and throw those together, or when you're making enchilada. Let's buy a little extra this and I can make you know the White chili stew or something to meals at once. It's a way to connect with her and spend more time.

380
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:34.290
Ramon: I like that idea. I think I'm definitely going to try that. And then we could just freeze the food for the week home and defrosted. Yes. That makes sense. I like it.

381
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.960
Ramon: A lot of sense.

382
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the night so even two days if you if some real frozen you two days before you take it out, then it has those two days to defrost. Then you come home at six o'clock you stick it in the oven. Whoever gets home first

383
00:36:50.370 --> 00:37:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that fired up. Now you have a family meal you have eating here you're eating wholesome food that doesn't have all those chemicals in it. Think about what that does for the daughter for you right as you're healing your body

384
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.240
Ramon: I like that idea. Yeah, okay, really good idea.

385
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me see what else you talked about. Let me ask you, um, do you want to set another

386
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want another goal set is something coming up for you where you'd like to kind of have us both watch and monitor progress around something either like to do more of or something you'd like to do lesson.

387
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:37.980
Ramon: Um, no. Not at the moment. Okay, other, other than like other than being able to like save money.

388
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.450
Ramon: Yeah.

389
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you also mentioned, I want to be mentally stronger. That was another goal, um, where is it that you are seeing

390
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.730
Ramon: Is pretty much like the anger stuff.

391
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if those are really a melding of the same thing.

392
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.250
Ramon: Maybe, maybe. Okay. Well, maybe not. Let's see.

393
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.840
Um,

394
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you assess yourself over these last couple weeks as not being strong mentally

395
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:27.750
Ramon: In doing pretty good. Other than, like, one day, like a week and a half or two I kind of broke down mentally like I text my girlfriend. I was like, Yo, I can't do this no more. I don't

396
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:37.770
Ramon: I would, I don't know what it was. I was just I can't, I don't want to work, no more. I don't want to do this no more. I'm done.

397
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:54.270
Ramon: I'm tired of paying bills. I'm tired of fucking oh and money. I'm tired of stressing over this, but then later on in the day I got over it, you know, but it was just, it was hard that day for me.

398
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How how down. Did you get

399
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.780
Ramon: I cried. Okay.

400
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember the context of what was going on today.

401
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.500
Ramon: It was mainly bills, I guess.

402
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:18.900
Ramon: Jill's stressed out about what I owed who owed. When I got to pay in

403
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.730
Ramon: All

404
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember at the time.

405
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What your predominant belief about yourself was at that time. And you'll find it with this sentence of I am

406
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: See what negative belief about yourself was present during that

407
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Moment.

408
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.000
Ramon: What negative belief.

409
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'll know it through that finishing the sentence, I am

410
00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:01.110
Ramon: Oh, I guess the only belief at that time was

411
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.690
Ramon: I wanted to quit.

412
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe in

413
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: At that time, these are harder to get I

414
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.200
Ramon: Was that I was a quitter.

415
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what brought the tears on

416
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.080
Ramon: Probably

417
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Got real

418
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you met you got real close to it right and then can't believe this is happening. This is happening and you reached out for support. You got support you got through it but you got real close to that experience of quitting.

419
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it. Did it scare you a little bit

420
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.270
Ramon: Oh no, not really.

421
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the

422
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the emotion going with the tears, then

423
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.020
Ramon: Like stressed out, I was stressed stress on the chair started coming along.

424
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

425
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Ugly stress is associated with a physiological response of an increased heart rate short sort of upper chest breathing.

426
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Tension muscle tension.

427
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you when you were, you know, crying, right. You were tearful

428
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible there was another emotion there.

429
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.190
Ramon: I'm worried

430
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Worried is a cousin of fear. So watch if I'm worried I'm anxious. I'm nervous. I'm scared I'm afraid of something in the future. Well, what were you worried slash nervous, anxious, afraid of

458
00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:06.630

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.900
It.

460
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:28.680
