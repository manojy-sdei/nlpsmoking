7
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.920

9
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.220
All right.

10
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:53.100
Belis Aladag: Um, tell me a bit about yourself. Tell me, you know, the latest, we can start now. And then we can go backwards but right now it looks like you're taking three films a day. Is that right,

11
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.500
Ryan Burks: That's right.

12
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.260
Belis Aladag: On the Suboxone. Okay. And with that, do you feel like your cravings are under control. You feel okay

13
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.190
Ryan Burks: I do I feel good with it with this dosage you

14
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.630
Belis Aladag: Do you take it like one in the morning, one at noon one later in the day.

15
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.770
Ryan Burks: One and a half in the morning what happened. Okay.

16
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:30.000
Belis Aladag: Okay, so one and a half twice a day. Um, and. Okay, so tell me a bit about yourself. Like how did this whole opioid use disorder start for you. Were you very young.

17
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.900
Belis Aladag: They just start with other drugs. First, or what happened.

18
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:54.690
Ryan Burks: Um, so I grew up, like in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I rich like I smoke pot for from like age 14 to constantly every day, till I mean, up until right now but I first found or tried like oxy cotton.

19
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.340
Ryan Burks: My mom had some extra pills. I took them and that's kind of where the whole thing started.

20
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.620
Ryan Burks: And went from roxy's to fentanyl within a few years, once I got the cup college

21
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.610
Belis Aladag: Okay, so when you first tried the oxy you were what 18 or less, you were

22
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.260
Ryan Burks: 16 yeah

23
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.540
Belis Aladag: Okay, and then went on to fentanyl kills where you're crushing them and supporting them or what were you doing

24
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.990
Ryan Burks: I was getting pure fentanyl off the internet.

25
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.340
Oh, wow.

26
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:47.400
Ryan Burks: Okay. And so who is just powdered form and obviously with the potency of the drug is really hard for me to have consistent, consistent

27
00:04:49.590 --> 00:05:00.120
Ryan Burks: Dose dosa Jang or whatever you want to call it. Um, so it got pretty out of hand because I could I just started to go up and up and up. So, yeah.

28
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.860
Belis Aladag: we're injecting it

29
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.510
Ryan Burks: I was smoking.

30
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.800
Belis Aladag: Okay, got out of hand and then did you have an overdose, or a couple or what happened.

31
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.720
Ryan Burks: I had probably in total like four or five overdoses. Yeah.

32
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.580
Belis Aladag: Gosh.

Ryan Burks: Yeah.

35
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.620
Belis Aladag: Did you have some injury with one of them. There's something in your chart about that.

36
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.540
Ryan Burks: It wasn't yeah yeah it was for a mixture of federal and Ketamine together.

37
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.670
Ryan Burks: Both like in the Senate. So it just kind of shut my body down

38
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.860
Ryan Burks: You know,

39
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.300
Belis Aladag: That's really scary.

40
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.750
Ryan Burks: To consolidate this I have this on my legs and stuff like a head compartment syndrome and

41
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.190
Oh,

42
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.620
Ryan Burks: Yeah, yeah. I lost like 30% of my muscle mass, because of the

I don't

52
00:06:49.950 --> 00:07:01.710
Belis Aladag: It's a good habit, good thing to have around. I mean, you're taking the medication. Now, and the chances of overdoses Suboxone are like almost impossible compared to where you were with the fentanyl and everything, but still

53
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.730
Belis Aladag: It's just good to have around. Right. And you can use it on other people. If you see anyone passed out. You don't know why.

54
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.100
Belis Aladag: You're right arm them if you try to use it.

100
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:19.470
Ryan Burks: Unfortunately, we don't talk that often. I mean, I mean, I understand with my addiction in the last, you know, several years.

101
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:30.750
Ryan Burks: But I'm hoping that through sobriety and continued sobriety. Um, he'll come back around and you know we'll be talking. Good.

102
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.490
Belis Aladag: Yeah, because

103
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.890
Belis Aladag: We are very close age.

104
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.600
Belis Aladag: Right, yeah.

105
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:44.340
Belis Aladag: I see and what you started cannabis. He was very. He was like 10 or 11

106
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.160
Belis Aladag: Yeah, well, who started you on this stuff.

107
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.470
Belis Aladag: Was like a like.

108
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.930
Ryan Burks: A you kind of cut out there. How did my using start

109
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.570
Belis Aladag: The canvas. Yeah. Do you remember

110
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.040
Ryan Burks: I mean, I got it.

111
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.010
Ryan Burks: illicitly up until I was 18 and then I got like a medical card.

112
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.080
Okay, yeah.

113
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.460
Belis Aladag: So now, now that you're in sober living, are you using anything other than the medication, we're giving you

114
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.870
Ryan Burks: No, no.

115
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:36.600
Belis Aladag: Okay, great. So good. So, carry on that sobriety. I think it's really important for you to have a clear head, especially after all the overdoses the injuries and things you have to do you want to finish college like you got to have all your motivation and and a game on. Right.

116
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.130
Ryan Burks: Right, definitely.

117
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.550
Belis Aladag: How about nicotine. Are you sleeping, are you smoking cigarettes.

118
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.250
Ryan Burks: Yeah, I, I, they

119
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.370
Ryan Burks: And I say that with kind of

120
00:12:52.650 --> 00:13:10.290
Ryan Burks: I don't know, you know, with all this stuff that's on TV. You know I shouldn't be a thing of my nicotine addiction is super not intense but it's high, you know, like if I were to switch to cigarettes. I go through like a pack every two days or something.

121
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.190
Okay.

122
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.040
Ryan Burks: Even you know my mom was like, I'd rather you smoke cigarettes and baby. And I don't know about that. So,

123
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:40.380
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah, it's kind of she's saying that because we're hearing about all these pneumonias that broke out, and people with their lung problems and stuff, know that smoking tobacco has its own problems, you know, cancer, etc. So I mean, either way is bad.

124
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:56.490
Belis Aladag: Is there. Would you consider at some point, if not now, would you consider giving we could give you like laws and just nicotine laws and just that you could suck on so like you could do that every time you have a craving for nicotine.

125
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:16.860
Belis Aladag: Half a pack a day, approximately, is what you're thinking, you would use. So that would be you know about 10 so each lozenges is is worth like one cigarette. So that's like one milligram nicotine. So you could do like up to 10 laws and just a day if you wanted to.

126
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.870
Ryan Burks: Yeah, not I'd be

127
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.670
Ryan Burks: For sure.

128
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:34.470
Belis Aladag: You know, just remember though it's nicotine. So it's still a stimulant and you don't want to overdo it. So if you're going to do this. You should really do make a huge effort not to do the beeping. So you don't double dose on the nicotine. Yeah.

129
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:41.220
Belis Aladag: Right, okay. So yeah, if you want all order that for you to the laws. And just so you can try them.

130
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:41.970
Okay.

131
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.990
Belis Aladag: And it's oral you notice it's something you're sucking on it might actually be something you could do.

132
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.550
Ryan Burks: Like sublingual

133
00:14:52.290 --> 00:15:04.470
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I think it's you. Can you, it's not the GM the GM you chew and then you kind of park it I can do the GM for you too. But I think the people like the laws and that's like the hard candy.

134
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.130
Ryan Burks: Which one yeah allowances. Okay.

135
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.960
And then

136
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:20.580
Belis Aladag: A other substance. So everything that you were using, like, I see history of cocaine as well. Sometimes cocaine. You mentioned ketamine.

137
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:29.430
Belis Aladag: Xanax Valium, all those things, all of it stopped in November 2019

138
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.640
Belis Aladag: Correct. Okay. And you've been good. Since then, you know, seeing on this path.

139
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:42.210
Ryan Burks: We obviously I have like urges and stuff. And I go to. I go to meetings. I mean, outpatient rehab.

140
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:51.690
Ryan Burks: So I get a good amount of help and distractions from crazy things and people who goes who with I want to talk

206
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:29.730
Ryan Burks: If it's cold, it's worse. And if I'm like laying down, it gets bad because my blood kind of pools.

207
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.230
Ryan Burks: So I have a hard time when I sleep. I have to constantly switch back and forth because you know

208
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.280
Ryan Burks: Yeah.

Belis Aladag: Oh, OK. OK, so your regular about taking them and in the sober living where you're at. Do they give you the medications. There's a place you go to get your months.

212
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.520
Ryan Burks: No, we just we hold on to the meds ourselves.

213
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:27.450
Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, good to regular about taking them yourself. Yeah, um, gosh, I'm sorry to hear about that, that's just, that's, that's a lot. You're dealing with, you know, trying to just cope with the pain and the

214
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:34.530
Belis Aladag: Just the way your body is now you know getting used to it and getting trying to take care of it the best you can.

215
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.460
Ryan Burks: Yeah. Appreciate that, sir.

216
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:52.890
Belis Aladag: Um, okay, US suicidal thoughts. Have you had them. Have you had a tense of where some of these overdoses those things, or are you what's going on with that.

217
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.270
Um,

218
00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:01.770
Ryan Burks: Some of the overdoses. We're not intentional, but they were

219
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:14.730
Ryan Burks: Brought on by kind of an ideation, like a suicidal ideation but not necessarily like I want to end my life so

220
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:32.490
Ryan Burks: I'm it's complicated. I you know I don't, I don't want to die stuff sometimes like the pain and emotional pain gets so bad that I'd rather not be here, but I don't want to be dead. So, yeah.

221
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.010
Belis Aladag: Got it, got it.

222
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:57.420
Belis Aladag: Yeah, it gets hard. It's hard, and you, you don't want to give up, but you just kind of, yeah. But do you feel that you know you feel at risk right now. Do you feel at risk of like making a plan or like actually being at risk of of a suicide.

223
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.370
Ryan Burks: No, no, no.

224
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:13.050
Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm glad I'm glad for you because, yeah, that would not be good. You're you've come a long way. It sounds like since these overdoses in this kind of whirlwind of substance use.

225
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:26.310
Belis Aladag: And you're working your way out of the rut, you know it's it's a thing. You know, you got a lot of things you're working through including your physical pain and your emotional pain that flares up with it. Yeah.

226
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.270
That's

227
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:39.780
Belis Aladag: What I mean it's good that you surround yourself with people, you're living in a, you know, like a community place. So you have people you can talk to and you see right and then we'll go to meetings. Do you have a sponsor.

228
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.520
Ryan Burks: Who sponsor.

229
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:56.550
Belis Aladag: You have a sponsor and then, you know, we'll do regular meetings as well. So speaking of which, um, so the the Suboxone follow up meetings are going to be Thursdays at 4pm

230
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.140
Belis Aladag: Do you think you can do that.

231
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:05.430
Belis Aladag: I can. Okay, perfect, perfect. So, so the next time we meet hopefully it'll be in a group setting.

232
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:22.320
Belis Aladag: You and maybe a few others just to check in. Hey, how's it going, Is your dose, the same any, anything you want to tell me medically to, you know, update that. And then it'll be a therapist to kind of lead us through just a therapy session on anything recovery related

233
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.310
Okay.

234
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.730

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.500
Okay.

237
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.820
Belis Aladag: So when we

238
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:53.640
Belis Aladag: When we hang up when you when you hang up with me today. Just make a point to call the virtual clinic again and say, Okay. She says that she's renewing my medication. And then I need to see her again in the group setting on Thursday at four.

239
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.050
Ryan Burks: So,

240
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.600
Belis Aladag: So they can book that in. Yeah.

241
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:08.130
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, I think that will be the best for us. And then we'll just keep doing that. And then we'll see how you're doing check in with each other and then

242
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:15.300
Belis Aladag: I'm here for you. You know if you need anything, you let me know. We're going to see each other. Hopefully soon and get to know each other, more and more

243
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:25.680
Belis Aladag: And you know, I thank you for taking the time to share your story with me and you know there's a lot of stuff that you've been going through that you still are working through

244
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:39.840
Belis Aladag: amends with your family, even right. It sounds like you have some some history there that you're just starting to kind of work on. So I wish the best and I'm here with you. Hopefully on this journey to a better place.

245
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.710
Ryan Burks: Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. What is your name again.

246
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.370
Belis Aladag: I'm Dr. Allah de la

247
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.880
Ryan Burks: Thank you. Appreciate it.

248
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.150
Belis Aladag: You're welcome.

249
00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:13.680
Belis Aladag: So what I'll do is all refill your medication to cover you. Until next week, next Thursday see each other and then we do this again, like I said, I'm also going to order you Narcan this time, just so you can pick that up if you want and just have it on you. It's a nasal spray

250
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:24.600
Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah, um, anything else that we forgot to touch upon are you. Oh. Oh. Also nicotine laws and just you wanted, right, we're gonna try

251
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:40.350
Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, let's try that. So nicotine laws and judges remember one equals like one cigarettes worth of nicotine. So you don't want to go above 10 because that defeats the purpose. You don't want to start a bigger problem.

252
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.030
Ryan Burks: Yeah, sure.

253
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.060
Belis Aladag: So let's see if that helps you stay away from the beeping a little bit. And if we can do that. That'll help

254
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.010
Belis Aladag: And your mom will be happy.

255
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.540
Ryan Burks: Yes, you.

256
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.400
Ryan Burks: Okay.

257
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:59.220
Belis Aladag: Okay, cool. Alright, so I'll see you then. And I guess you can end the meeting now.

258
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:07.860
Ryan Burks: Though, okay, real quick is so Thursday. Is it for anything, any other times better to be were wary of

259
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:26.550
Belis Aladag: Um, for me, that's all that I'm thinking we need to refill. Um, I know that every month. They're going to send you a manila envelope. Do you know how to do that where you get the envelope you don't open it. You go to the virtual clinic and then you open it in front of them and you do I

260
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.380
Ryan Burks: Have not done that.

261
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:36.360
Belis Aladag: So, so that's what so you'll give them they should have your updated address, hopefully. Just make sure the virtual clinic has your address.

262
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.210
Belis Aladag: And I'll send you something. And they'll look like a big

263
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:50.850
Belis Aladag: yellow envelope. Don't open it up, log into the virtual clinic and say, Hey, I got this. They'll say, Okay, let's see. You open it you open it in front of them. It's like a witness test, you know that.

264
00:28:51.510 --> 00:29:02.790
Belis Aladag: Little cup inside you do your test in the bathroom, you come back and you show them the temperature and okay I did my test. Here's what it shows that testing. That's how we do the testing once a month, I believe.

265
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:15.480
Belis Aladag: So when you receive that just be on the lookout. That's what you're going to do with it. Um, the other thing is blood tests. Did you ever do a blood test for us. Did you go to a quest lab.

266
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.070
Ryan Burks: I think I did. Yeah.

267
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:29.760
Belis Aladag: Okay, so if you already took care of that that should be done. Um, and then in terms of therapy visits, you and the therapist that you're assigned to

268
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:44.670
Belis Aladag: can meet as well, like you and I will meet in a group setting with the therapist and everybody else but you and the therapist alone can have some alone time. You can do like a visit with her every week, every two weeks.

269
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:51.600
Belis Aladag: Whatever you guys feel is is good for you. It might not be a bad idea. Honestly, with you right now.

270
00:29:52.080 --> 00:30:02.730
Belis Aladag: I know you're busy. You got stuff, but maybe it's not a bad idea to carve out that extra time with the therapist to just kind of just, you know, open up about what's going on your pain.

271
