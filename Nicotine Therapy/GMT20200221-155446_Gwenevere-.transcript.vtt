00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, was that by accident or on purpose.

2
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.040
Michelle Lucero: No, my alarm went off and I wanted to go back to sleep. So

3
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do with your time.

4
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:40.590
Michelle Lucero: I finished laundry and got up and took a shower. Got my son ready for school. And then I have to go to Walgreens to get an approximate because I started this morning and my cops are killing me.

5
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.780
Michelle Lucero: So,

6
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.030
Michelle Lucero: That's it.

7
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.910
Michelle Lucero: I'm excited.

8
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
Michelle Lucero: I get one of the babies today after our meeting.

9
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I know that makes you happy.

10
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

11
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.620
Michelle Lucero: I really haven't seen her since the Super Bowl.

12
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is this Genesis was us.

13
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.360
Michelle Lucero: Know it's Laila, it's my other nephews daughter, he's kind of banned from her right now because he's not doing very good

14
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:28.020
Michelle Lucero: And so, for some reason, when he's not doing good. The family's not able to see her either but I stayed in close connection with the mom and

15
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:40.050
Michelle Lucero: Talk to her almost every day. So she's okay with me, seeing the baby she knows that I won't go behind her back and let my nephew come over is the year because he's not doing good. So

16
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.040
Michelle Lucero: I'm happy. But it's kind of kind of bittersweet because I can't like post anything because I don't want my family to know I have her

17
00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:00.660
Michelle Lucero: Because they'll get mad at me for still talking to the mom but i mean i think she's in the right by not letting me be a part of her life because he's not able to stay sober.

18
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta turn this phone.

19
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: turn the ringer off ring a ding. Alright.

20
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do something a little different. Today, Michelle, let's actually do some some interventions here.

21
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get

22
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got your phone resting very nicely. Let's go get some of these items that we can do some bilateral stimulation today.

23
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Two things that can be vases, they could be the total mugs something where they're about the same height and put them about shoulder width apart right on either side, left and right of your phone.

24
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.730
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

25
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.600
Michelle Lucero: Let me go get him.

26
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.740
Michelle Lucero: Go for it. I'm gonna have to move my phone because I have it resting on a box.

27
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.920
Michelle Lucero: Right here, so I'm gonna have to move it, so I'll be able to put them beside it.

28
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, take your time. I know I'm gonna take your time. I just opened up a note.

29
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.490
Michelle Lucero: Are they supposed to be heavier. Doesn't matter if there's anything in them.

30
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's it's so that you're going to be looking at the top of them. Try to get them at the same height.

31
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.060
Michelle Lucero: I'm

32
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A little taller than your phone.

33
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.740
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

34
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Alright, so let's

35
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a little test here just kind of look at those. The top of those items left and right, just back and forth all point. I just want to see kind of a comfort level that you have with it.

36
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.310
Michelle Lucero: And they need to make one hired

37
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.360
Okay.

38
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so yeah off to the side. So take your, your arms, your shoulders and just sort of going straight out and see if they're about shoulder width apart.

39
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I'm going to point to each one and just sort of at my rate out of the corner kind of peripheral vision. You don't have to watch my finger. Just look at the two tops of those objects. There we go. So at the rate that I'm directing

40
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it'll be a little slower.

41
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes a little faster.

42
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. Did it strain your eyes just now.

43
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.770
Michelle Lucero: No, it made me bleeding.

44
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

45
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.110
Like we got a blank.

46
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no.

47
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.140
Michelle Lucero: Hurry, but

48
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes there might be times when you want to stop and I might be taking too long.

49
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do that. Do the iterations very long, but you may want to do this to me, and then I'll stop or you may, and there's still a lot to go into about it, but you might want more, you might want to continue. There might be a piece

50
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Of memory. There might be a thought that you're not quite done processing yet and you wanted to continue. I've been doing it about between 20 to 50 seconds.

51
00:07:46.680 --> 00:08:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might notice. Oh, I want a little more, and then I'll just continue. Okay, so those are. We're just doing just the very, very beginning early phase of preparation. So part of the preparation is also taking a look at your resources.

52
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been a while. There's a few things I want to do with you and I don't know what we've already done. Did we develop your resource team you're protected figure. You're nurturing figure in your wise figure, you know, okay, well, let's do it today. This is, this is a nice feeling so

53
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle real or imagined. I want you to think of

54
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Who comes to mind.

55
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That has the quality of a protective figure real or imagined really embodies the quality of protectiveness

56
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.970
Who do you think of

57
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.880
Michelle Lucero: My sister in a while.

58
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me about the quality of Noel that she embodies that protectiveness

59
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:11.790
Michelle Lucero: Um, she's always there when I call her, if ever, and for an emergency. She's always the first person I call. Okay. And she always answers and she always tries their best to help me with whatever I'm

60
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.800
Okay.

61
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about someone imaginary

62
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you've seen it in a movie or a TV show or read it in a book.

63
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.370
Michelle Lucero: I

64
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know. Okay, well we can come back to it. But for now, we've got Noel right

65
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And now, real or imagined. I want you to think of who comes to mind that has the qualities of a nurturing figure

66
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This would be someone or some things. For some people they can go to an animal or they can go to a particular image from from a program or from a novel that they've read

67
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then a nurturing figure the primary sort of role and quality of a nurturing figure is is that they want your growth and your development.

68
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They encourage your growth your development. Sometimes there is an affection piece of it in the nurture and sometimes there's not, who comes to mind.

69
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.680
Michelle Lucero: Tell me, Okay, God,

70
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else and they can be multiple figures.

71
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.380
Michelle Lucero: And my dad.

72
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about how dad I heard some stories about Tammy how she wants your growth and development. How does dad want your growth and development.

73
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.770
Michelle Lucero: Um, he always

74
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.250
Michelle Lucero: Will since I was little. He always would

75
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.660
Michelle Lucero: Push me to do my best and

76
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.920
Michelle Lucero: praise me when I would do good.

77
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.030
Michelle Lucero: And always have like really good advice for me.

78
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what about Tammy. What are the qualities that come to mind for her.

79
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.320
Michelle Lucero: Um,

80
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.170
Michelle Lucero: She's always very positive.

81
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.860
Michelle Lucero: And she always, it seems like long term.

82
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:49.980
Michelle Lucero: Rather than me. Just like day at a time, but she thinks of white book. What is this going to happen or like, what is this going to

83
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.760
Michelle Lucero: Be like in a month from now like she's

84
00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.400
Okay.

85
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.060
Michelle Lucero: And she also gives really good advice.

86
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else for the nurturing figures.

87
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.520
Michelle Lucero: Um,

88
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.460
Michelle Lucero: No. Okay.

89
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And the third one is a wise figure. So thinking about two real or imagined.

90
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Figures that represent

91
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise quality.

92
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.200
Michelle Lucero: Can imagine be like my mom being that she's not here.

93
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.190
Sure.

94
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.570
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I always thought my mom was like the smartest

95
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else for wise figures and body that wise quality.

96
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.230
Michelle Lucero: Know, well, why is also

97
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know what so she's going to kind of be present in maybe both the role as a protective figure and as a wise figure

98
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. All right, let's do a couple more here. Let's do

99
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:35.790
This

100
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: For. Okay, let's do a container. So you've heard people maybe in casual conversation say oh I compartmentalize that event in my life. I don't think about it. You ever heard anybody say that

101
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.210
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, okay.

102
00:13:54.990 --> 00:14:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So this container that I'd like you to develop is kind of like that.

103
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In this work that I'm going to invite you to do sometimes feelings may come up or a memory may come up and you don't want to

104
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Work through it or you and I run out of time and you want to put it in this container. So what I want you to do is this is your creative mind since you're right.

105
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: right brain working here. I want you to think of a container that would be big enough strong enough to hold all of your sort of emotional stuff.

106
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me, what comes to mind. It can be whatever you want.

107
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:54.270
Michelle Lucero: Wooden jewelry box. I don't know. Is that what you mean like just a container.

108
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.150
Michelle Lucero: Something to put in

109
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's the only instructions really are that it feels true for you, but the instruction is that it be big enough.

110
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And strong enough, sort of in this is this is imagination. So you picture your emotional life your

111
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: History of memories and things that you may not want to be thinking about all the time, but sometimes will want to visit them to do some processing. And so this container would have to be big enough and strong enough to hold all your stuff. And do you want to keep wooden jewelry box.

112
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you want to do.

113
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.750
Michelle Lucero: A big chest

114
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Chest. All right. What's it made of

115
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.490
Michelle Lucero: Wood. Okay.

116
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there a lid. Yeah. And is there a lock. Yes. Okay, and what kind of lock is it key combination fingerprint. Who's got the access to it.

117
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.320
Michelle Lucero: It's a key. Okay.

118
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're the only one having the key. Yeah, okay.

119
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And for some people it's that lock that keeps all the stuff in there.

120
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people, there's something in it where those

121
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say all that stuff will want to stay. So some people it's positive. Like they'll say, Well, there's a disco ball and there's really fluffy pillows and then the stuff wants to stay

122
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people are like forget them. They're all negative misery loves company, they're going to stay in there. I don't care, they're locked in.

123
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it really varies for you when you picture that there might be negative feelings that come up and you want to put them in that container because it's inconvenient. Maybe you're at work or maybe it's the end of our session.

124
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to put them in there. What do you think would help them stay there.

125
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.560
Michelle Lucero: What do you mean

126
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me your, tell me what you don't understand

127
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.510
Michelle Lucero: What will make them stand there if I just put them in there and lock it.

128
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is the lock enough to keep it keep those emotions and memories there.

129
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.320
Michelle Lucero: Um,

130
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.180
Michelle Lucero: No, I would just have to not think about them.

131
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.480
Michelle Lucero: Or occupy my mind about thinking about something else.

132
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well go with the lock. Let's go to this other piece, this is

133
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna give you some examples of a distancing metaphor. Do you know what a metaphor is it represents something in in a story or an image, but it's not the real thing.

134
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

135
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a distancing metaphor. So let's say the same kind of service to you. Let's say there's something comes up, it might be in the middle of a session.

136
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're feeling very upset. Very activated maybe very sad very scared very angry and you want to get some distance from it. You know, I might

137
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Invite you to picture. And here's some examples. Once you to picture you're on the riverbank your with your team of resources remaining on the riverbank. And what you see is a little a leaf floating further and further away.

138
00:18:51.270 --> 00:19:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's drifting away and you can barely see it now. And you notice that you're there on the riverbank feeling sort of grounded in solid in your resources of protection nurturing some wisdom, but what you see is this leaf floating away or he might

139
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: See a balloon kind of floating off into the sky and then it's just this little dot and then it's gone. He might be at an ocean and you're on this sort of seashore. You can see the sailboat, and slowly disappears and you can't see it.

140
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a train and it's passes by, and then write it drifts off into the distance.

141
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are some metaphors for taking something that you want to put some distance between feeling it right now experiencing it right now and putting distance and actually having it go further and further away. When you think of your own distancing metaphor. What might that be

142
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.920
Michelle Lucero: A car driving a wave further and further

143
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

144
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And in front of you, heading in the same direction further away.

145
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.140
Michelle Lucero: Yeah. Further away in the opposite direction.

146
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go, car driving away in the opposite.

147
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.870
Direction. There we go.

148
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Lovely.

149
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we did go over, I believe the kind of getting the, the temperature reading up some events in your life.

150
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of them was

151
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We found a 50 like a distress level of 50 WE TALKED ABOUT YOU, YOUR SON'S FATHER WAS NOT home to pick him up from school. I was irritated his dad didn't think it was important enough to get here on time for him.

152
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you kind of knew in your mind. I know, I know he's safe. So you were able to still think straight

153
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of something in your life that

154
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Was more distressing maybe maybe up there is I was about 50 maybe getting up into 70 or 80 or maybe even higher thinking event that was very, very distressing for you.

155
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.890
Michelle Lucero: Um,

156
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.380
Michelle Lucero: When I had my own place and didn't have a vehicle.

157
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.340
Michelle Lucero: Is Jeff on had announcement attack.

158
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:55.050
Michelle Lucero: And I couldn't take him to the emergency room. I had to call an ambulance to come pick us up to take us

159
00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's scary.

160
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, had asthma attack.

161
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.680
Ambulance

162
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Time, a night or day to that happened.

163
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.080
Michelle Lucero: It was in the middle of the night, probably like three o'clock in the morning.

164
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you feeling right now.

165
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:35.430
Michelle Lucero: I'm it's still stresses me out thinking about it like that was

166
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.370
Michelle Lucero: One of the worst nights of my life.

167
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling what emotion. Are you feeling

168
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.420
Michelle Lucero: Kind of angry.

169
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of angry.

170
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:02.520
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, cuz I didn't have a vehicle because his dad had my car out drinking

171
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You handled it and took care of a Stefan.

172
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.650
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I surely didn't

173
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:25.200
Michelle Lucero: I didn't even think to call the ambulance. Honestly, I called Noel first and she told me hang up and called my mom was

174
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:36.630
Michelle Lucero: That was the credits for my mind. I was like, I'm gonna go knock on a neighbor's door and get a right. And she's like, don't bother just call 911 so I did.

175
00:23:49.080 --> 00:24:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that in your mind for let's get it a number. How distressing and I use that word distressing because that's what this temperature reading is from zero to 100 you said to the feeling was kinda angry.

176
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, kind of angry. It was one of the worst nights of my life.

177
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What number would you put that from zero to 100 in

178
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Subjective unit of distress, let's say,

179
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.860
Michelle Lucero: It was like an 85

180
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When you said you were kind of angry.

181
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.730
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, and

182
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.900
Michelle Lucero: And unsure that

183
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.420
Michelle Lucero: Could be strong enough to keep it together for him.

184
00:24:48.150 --> 00:25:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being strong enough to keep it together for him. Let's go without a little bit longer. This one, this is harder to get to, so be patient with yourself. Okay, just sort of keep talking until we get there.

185
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the belief about yourself at that time. And you know what it is probably with

186
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And I believe I am dot dot dot

187
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your belief about yourself. I am what

188
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.010
Michelle Lucero: Strong enough

189
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Belief that you would have liked to have had

190
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the positive cognition, the

191
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the negative one. I'm not strong enough. But the positive belief at that time for that memory, right, all of the

192
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That anger. Scared and unsure what would you like to have believed in yourself at that time.

193
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:07.860
Michelle Lucero: That I had everything under control and I couldn't handle me

194
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I can handle anything. Yeah. OK.

195
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So the I can handle anything. This is a different scale. I want to ask you.

196
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: From one to seven seven is it's absolutely true.

197
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can handle anything right now. Right. How true is that for you. Seven is absolutely true. Once know

198
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.140
Michelle Lucero: Right now, today. Yeah.

199
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.580
Michelle Lucero: I'm probably like a five.

200
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is that negative thought that negative belief about yourself. I'm not strong enough.

201
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in time and try and find the earliest age.

202
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.840
Michelle Lucero: Yes, age, I can remember thinking that

203
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

204
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.200
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god like kindergarten.

205
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.890
Michelle Lucero: Literally, where's the kindergarten.

206
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me what you remember is that about age five.

207
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.840
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, okay.

208
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And this other one when you had your own place. Just curious. How old were you then.

209
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.310
Michelle Lucero: I was like 12 years ago and I'm 40 now so

210
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What missing. Yeah.

211
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.270
Wait.

212
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yeah so age 28. All right. This one we're age five. First day of kindergarten.

213
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What what thoughts or beliefs are going in your head around that that memory.

214
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:35.940
Michelle Lucero: Um, I was just thinking like I couldn't stay at school all day without my mom.

215
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.710
Michelle Lucero: I can make friends without her there.

216
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.960
Michelle Lucero: I just wasn't comfortable being there without her being there.

217
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you stay the whole day.

218
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.120
Michelle Lucero: Um,

219
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:23.160
Michelle Lucero: I only stayed till lunch. And then I ran into my sister for lunch because she went to the things or Angela and she saw me right and she called my mom and my mom came and got me, she's like Michelle still crying, Mom.

220
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.250
Michelle Lucero: Okay, mom went and picked me up.

221
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember what happened after she picked up.

222
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.830
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god, I felt so good.

223
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:49.110
Michelle Lucero: But I was nervous because I knew I had to go back. So like, it felt good in the moment, but

224
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.060
Michelle Lucero: When it was like, time for bed. I started feeling

225
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:59.220
Michelle Lucero: Like inches again because I knew I was going to have to do it again tomorrow.

226
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put a number to this one, and this is hard to do sometimes, but from zero to 10 how distressing is this memory.

227
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.000
Michelle Lucero: Um,

228
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.880
It's like a 770

229
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.530
Michelle Lucero: I mean, yeah.

230
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.640
Michelle Lucero: Okay, what it was about each one

231
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:39.510
You remember

232
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were thinking at that time.

233
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.030
Michelle Lucero: I'm

234
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.930
Michelle Lucero: Like why I didn't want to be there.

235
00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This memory. Do you remember what you were thinking during this this memory, you're thinking of right now, you weren't doing it 20 minutes ago. You're now thinking of that memory. It's in your working memory, it's up here in your consciousness.

236
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can figure recall what you were thinking

237
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: His thoughts and beliefs, kind of going on.

238
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.710
Michelle Lucero: I was just scared and I didn't believe I could make any friends.

239
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.400
Michelle Lucero: And I believe I didn't believe anyone would like me. Okay.

240
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember the second day

241
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You went to school.

242
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.140
Yeah.

243
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.240
Michelle Lucero: How did that.

244
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.780
Go.

245
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:59.010
Michelle Lucero: It went a lot better because I rode the bus. So my mom was an outfit school

246
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.640
Michelle Lucero: And I remembered

247
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:12.570
Michelle Lucero: I was remembering her telling me that morning. Yeah, to be a big girl and get off the bus and go straight to your classroom.

248
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:22.500
Michelle Lucero: So I wanted her to be proud of me. So I remember I got right off the bus and went straight to my classroom.

249
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:31.440
Michelle Lucero: And there was like morning Greece. So like you had to go outside before you went in, but I didn't. I went straight to my class.

250
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did the day go that second day of school.

251
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.240
Michelle Lucero: It went better. I made a friend.

252
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:47.760
Michelle Lucero: And

253
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.530
Michelle Lucero: I

254
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.640
Michelle Lucero: Kind of warmed up to my teacher, a little bit more that day because the first day I didn't even want to talk to her.

255
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:06.900
Michelle Lucero: And the second day, she had me like she had a Teacher's Pet Seat. She had me sitting in her teacher just that the

256
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:21.450
Michelle Lucero: And I got to hand out crayons and stuff. I remember. So I felt better that next day, but every morning right before school I'd get this huge knot in my stomach.

257
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.310
Michelle Lucero: And just have that first days memory.

258
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.770
Michelle Lucero: Like feeling of just being terrified to go

259
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:41.250
Michelle Lucero: Every morning, and then I'd get there and it would go away. But on the way to school. It was like the worst right ever

260
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Tanya.

261
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.800
Michelle Lucero: Honestly, very long time. I remember

262
00:33:51.090 --> 00:34:06.540
Michelle Lucero: The last time I felt like that or like very scared to go to school was in eighth grade finally in eighth grade and I was in seventh grade twice. So it was one year even more.

263
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was with you for a really long time.

264
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.060
Yeah.

265
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:22.470
Michelle Lucero: And now with my kids. It's with me for them. Like I don't show it to them because I don't want them to feel the way I felt

266
00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:26.850
Michelle Lucero: But I feel the same way with them like going to school.

267
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you mean. So they're getting ready for school what happens

268
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.720
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I get nervous for them like

269
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:54.420
Michelle Lucero: For well not like Jeff on the first days of school. My first day of step one seventh grade, this year I was very nervous for him like he wasn't nervous at all. He knew all his friends and he's going back to the same school

270
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.020
Michelle Lucero: But I was nervous for him like

271
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.660
Michelle Lucero: I had that feeling back again. But it wasn't even for me it was for him.

272
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.020
Yeah, okay.

273
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do, let's do some positive stuff. First, let's do

274
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Some integration of your resources around this this memory at age five.

275
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This wasn't there before. So let's see if we can do something a little different this morning.

276
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be looking at the top of those two containers containers right

277
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.150
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, there's

278
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.950
Michelle Lucero: One bottle. The other

279
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, great, great, great, great.

280
00:35:48.720 --> 00:36:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And we just make my screen a little bigger. So what I'll be doing another kind of the, you know, the periphery of division, you'll see my finger moving. You don't have to watch my fingers just going back and forth with those

281
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Those images. So this is going to be a little different this is basically what it, what it will look like.

282
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes I'll say, I want you to picture the worst picture of that event right if that kindergarten day to hold it in your memory.

283
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to think about, let's say this thing, and sometimes it'll be the positive cognition. Sometimes it will be negative one. I'll remind you what it is.

284
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to look at, at that moment, it's my finger. You don't see the light on this one, you'll be looking at those two water bottles. Okay. And then, so I'll do it about 3050 seconds and then you'll see me do this. And we'll say let's inhale together.

285
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll inhale and then

286
00:36:51.600 --> 00:37:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it go, and then it's your turn to share what's going on. Now what's going on, can be a new thought or I noticed

287
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a tight chest or I felt relief or I got tense or I relaxed or there's nothing or a relaxed body, whatever it is that comes up, I think you've known me long enough that I'm interested in the body.

288
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm interested in the emotion. I'm interested in a thought. I'm interested in a new picture that comes up whatever your truth is I'm interested. Okay, that's the next thing.

289
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I might say, let's go with that. And then I'll say go with that. And I'll pull up also that worst image. Okay, so there's not going to be a back and forth dialogue.

290
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of me talking and processing with you that light is going to do it for us. Okay, so it's really different.

291
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So on. Also check in with you and see how you're doing.

292
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If it gets too much. What's the sign to stop.

293
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you want more.

294
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And of course you can talk. There's no way for you to do this wrong. I'm your guide. I'm the one that kind of keeps an eye on on what's going on. And, you know, you just whatever comes up for you.

295
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also possible is something really important happening. Maybe you want to let me and maybe there'll be something that's happening in the imagery

296
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to share it with me. Just, just continue on and continue to watch those two objects left and right. We want the the bilateral left and right hemisphere activated and that's what you're doing when you're looking left and right.

297
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you game.

298
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:38.910
Yes.

299
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it'll be a little different today. Okay.

300
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:44.700
Michelle Lucero: So,

301
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's do this together. I want you to will kind of have a positive experience, let's let's interweave some of these resource images that you've created. Um,

302
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So the movement is going to be really slow. So first, Michelle, I want you to pull up the worst part of that memory okay at age five and kindergarten, first day, hold it in your awareness.

303
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I also want you to really be present with

304
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Well, always being there and an emergency.

305
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Tammy wanting the best for you very positive.

306
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just all the quality of Tammy and nurturing, my guess. Back then right when when you were a little he would push you to do your best and would praise you.

307
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And also be be present with mom.

308
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: As a smart person right now smartest person I knew really be present with that wisdom.

309
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you may want to start with this. I know I'm going to be asking you to have your eyes open. But first, in order to get there, you may want to close them. Let's do it together. I want you to really picture.

310
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the thing. Michelle is something in you right now says I can't use so and so anymore. We've got to replace it. Let me tell you how you might know that that's happening if there's mixed feelings. This needs to be

311
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: On ambivalence no dissonance no mixture.

312
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to keep creating these these figures. If there's mixed feelings about them.

313
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

314
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't rob yourself of the effect by having mixed feelings. So just sit with protective quality of Noel and see if that feels just right.

315
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see her maybe her face. You can see or hear her voice.

316
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, beautiful, and then bring Tammy into the same space. Everyone's going to be interacting. This is your imagination. So you're going to be interacting with each other. So let's check what just happened.

317
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.140
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I felt unsure about Tommy being there.

318
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What came up. Do you think

319
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:30.480
Michelle Lucero: Um,

320
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.660
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, I just, I don't think I would

321
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.160
Michelle Lucero: I don't know how to explain it. I wouldn't

322
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.760
Michelle Lucero: Call her to like bail me out of something or

323
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: She's here for your nurturing

324
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: She's a figure who is. That's why there's separate figures.

325
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.270
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

326
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The Tom is there for you as a promoting your gross and your developer

327
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.980
Michelle Lucero: I see that. Oh my god, he's gonna die.

328
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.530
Michelle Lucero: That my triggers right here.

329
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.240
Just that part you're going

330
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.550
Michelle Lucero: Oh God, I thought

331
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We're still we're still here.

332
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.380
Okay.

333
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.310
Michelle Lucero: All right in

334
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:15.720
Our out

335
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

336
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A low to you're going to, it's the eye movements going to be a little funky, but we will see. So if you are looking at top of the objects are you going to be able to still kind of see the pace.

337
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

338
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, because that core is probably right at the bottom, isn't it.

339
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:49.110
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, that's why I have to put it upside down or sideways like this, I guess sideways is better.

340
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's days.

341
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you're on your containers are still shoulder width apart.

342
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.650
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

343
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

344
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So first, actually let's spend some time really really getting into this imagery. I feel like that that might be a better use when one even pull in the negative stuff. Let's just really get into the positive

345
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back in here now that there's more instruction Tammy gets to just represent the quality of nurturing your growth picture something she has said see her face, as she believes in you.

346
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Encouraging you and giving you good advice.

347
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Then bring into that space, the protective quality.

348
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Of Noel

349
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring into that same space. And have you be there as well. You're going to be with them. They're going to be surrounding you either combining with you.

350
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Becoming you or they're just there as a team, they're interacting with you and each other. It's a really wide open invitation, just see what happens. And then also, as they're interacting, you've got

351
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Tammy is a nurturing figure in a well as a protective figure. Then you also have

352
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom there with her wisdom.

353
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see how she might be interacting with the nurturing nurturing quality of Tammy.

354
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Always very positive.

355
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking about more than just short term gain she's thinking about long term happiness and goals and life satisfaction, maybe

356
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking a little longer term. And then there's also your dad who

357
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: pushes you to do your best. And praises You, when you do good.

358
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: He said good advice for you to

359
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing only the positive attributes and qualities of protective nurturing and wisdom.

360
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Watching how they're interacting and supporting

361
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You

362
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All there.

363
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for you.

364
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel like you've got a pretty good sense of it. Okay, so I have you look at those two objects are gonna be watching the time a little bit but so take a look a whole that in your awareness, the quality you just had nice and slow.

365
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to focus on those qualities

366
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget to keep breathing.

367
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe them together. Inhale into that lower long

368
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the top too long, and then

369
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:49.650
Nice.

370
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it again. We're going to inhale and get that arrow down to the bottom with a long

371
00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Percent belly out up in your shoulders. Let's get at the bottom of the long, you get down there at the bottom and then out of the mouth. Exhale.

372
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So I saw a lot of shoulder movement. Did that go down to the bottom.

373
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So what are you noticing as you spend some time just focusing on on your resource team.

374
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.210
Michelle Lucero: And make me feel more confident

375
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do one more time.

376
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.830
So,

377
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What What room are you in. She happened to catch that you notice kind of where you brought everybody together.

378
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Where were you

379
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:57.600
Michelle Lucero: You know, I was at my elementary school right my classroom.

380
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's crazy.

381
00:48:59.460 --> 00:48:59.850
Yeah.

382
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.630
Michelle Lucero: Right pictured everybody okay

383
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we do that, let's since you're already, you already organically are already going. Let's pull up that that angry right I'm uncertain. I'm scared.

384
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what feelings you are feeling actually terrified even

385
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: On that day, so picture that Worst Picture in kindergarten and now I also want you to hold with it the imagery of your resources, those three figures of protection nutrients and wisdom. Okay, hold it together in your awareness.

386
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale into the bottom of your lungs shoulder stay put. Push your belly out. Get all that air at the bottom.

387
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

388
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me in a little bit about what you notice

389
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.610
Michelle Lucero: Relax.

390
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.560
Michelle Lucero: And not as 10

391
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Where were you noticing attention before

392
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.140
Michelle Lucero: In my late

393
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.230
Night. Okay.

394
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.550
Michelle Lucero: And I just feel like Luther, not so tight.

395
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Overall looser

396
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha.

397
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

398
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm to stress level right now, what would you say you're at

399
00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:26.760
Michelle Lucero: Distress.

400
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:27.870
Uh huh.

401
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On the sides right zero to 100 where yet.

402
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:34.290
Michelle Lucero: I'm like,

403
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:40.710
Michelle Lucero: A 10 don't feel very little. Okay.

404
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to

405
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Try something this one the iteration. And what I mean by that is, that's going to be the back and forth.

406
00:51:55.290 --> 00:52:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to go a little faster. This is desensitisation so you've got this this space of grounding this sense of resource that we've we've just done a little bit of

407
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you can incorporate whenever you want to. You don't have to wait for me. Okay, you already know that. I hope you know that, but for now I want to, I want to pull up that one of the sort of terrifying things for you had to do with

408
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: In in in elementary school and kindergarten, your first day of school, which is that worst

409
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That worst image and I think

410
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't think I know what it is yet.

411
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I was scared it and believe I could make any friends. I think it's that I can't make any friends. So let's go with that one. Okay, hold that worst image and I can't make any friends ready. Hold that up into your awareness and we're going to go a little faster.

412
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: With me, inhale deep belly breath.

413
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale out of the mouth.

414
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

415
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gently. Notice what comes up.

416
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.540
Michelle Lucero: I get

417
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.580
Michelle Lucero: Really sad thinking about that.

418
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, get really sad. And where do you notice that lands in the body that sad what what may have shifted

419
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.330
Michelle Lucero: Um, my stomach.

420
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To get

421
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:19.320
Michelle Lucero: Tight in my chair.

422
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the sort of belief about yourself. Do you remember or right now. Like what's kind of thoughts and beliefs going on.

423
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.920
Michelle Lucero: I feel so bad for myself because I didn't

424
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.730
Michelle Lucero: believe in myself to

425
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.630
Michelle Lucero: Make or to be likable.

426
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the, what's the

427
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The phrasing of to be likable it confuses me so see if we can shape that in a statement.

428
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.600
Michelle Lucero: I even believe anyone would like me. Okay.

429
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And does that make you sad.

430
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.870
Yeah.

431
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we're going to go with that worse picture I didn't believe anyone would like me.

432
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale into the lower part of your lawn, nice and deep

433
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, it all out our emails.

434
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Will keep those eyes closed, if you can, and just notice what comes up for you.

435
00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:26.910
Michelle Lucero: I feel better. I don't feel

436
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.950
Michelle Lucero: That anymore.

437
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.710
Michelle Lucero: I feel hopeful.

438
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna go with that. Worst Picture.

439
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's hard work, think that that worst image and I feel hopeful.

440
00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through your nose. A belly breath.

441
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, it all out nice and slowly it all out of there.

442
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Your eyes closed and just pay attention to what you notice

443
00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:58.170
I don't

444
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.050
Michelle Lucero: Know anything really.

445
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: scan your body start down there with the feet.

446
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: As if a Superman x ray vision moving through bottom of the feet and ankles.

447
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The calves, the knees and thighs, the seat phone

448
00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing the hands for arms.

449
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.290
Up the biceps.

450
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Even passing through the gut got x ray vision going straight through all of your viscera bonds, your tissues in your skin.

451
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Past the tummy.

452
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the chest.

453
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the shoulders.

454
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To the neck.

455
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's a lot when there's other things going on. Just keep returning back to you. This is your time for some refueling and healing.

456
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the throat.

457
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where we breathe.

458
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's where we speak. It's where we eat.

459
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That awareness up into the years and cheekbones.

460
00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To the eyes.

461
00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, just let me know how the body's doing

462
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.540
Michelle Lucero: I started

463
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:44.790
Michelle Lucero: I'm not stress, but not

464
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:48.780
Michelle Lucero: Confident, my guess.

465
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right about when because, first it was, I don't feel anything. And then we did the body scan. What do you think happened.

466
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.620
I'm

467
00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:02.310
Michelle Lucero: Just right after that. But it's because not because of like what we're doing. It was

468
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling

469
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.320
What happened on

470
01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.930
Michelle Lucero: My knees driver.

471
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.990
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, like knocked me out of that.

472
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.560
Michelle Lucero: That's okay. I was in the way I was thinking and

473
01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.240
Michelle Lucero: I was

474
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so I'll bring it to a close. So let's do you want to put whatever's left over any charge a little bit of nervousness, you want to put it in the container.

475
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:25.560
Michelle Lucero: You want to

476
01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it in the container. Okay so name what you're putting in there. What are we putting in there.

477
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:30.840
Michelle Lucero: Because you

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:32.790

479
01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:35.730
Michelle Lucero: I'm putting in there. My

480
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:43.260
Michelle Lucero: My thoughts of not being lovable and my fear of being left alone. Yeah.

481
01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being lovable and fear of being left alone. Go inside the container.

482
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Close it up.

483
01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Put that key away. And do you also want to have a distancing from it or do you want to just kind of keep it around. Keep it just in the container.

484
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.150
Michelle Lucero: I think I'll just keep it in there. Okay. Alright.

485
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another appointment.

518
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, this is you've got set yourself some some goals that I know you want to accomplish. It's not forever.

519
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.380
Right.

520
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So we could just kind of maybe just take it one at a time. Like, let's just give it a chance with this new arrangement.

521
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I didn't get your details about it. So I'm going to put Michelle wednesday thursday on call. What that means is I think we've done it before I give you a call. I say, Hey, you know, can you be ready kind of last minute.

522
01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:56.190
Michelle Lucero: Between this

523
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Time, and this time.

524
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you also you know how you were taking the Seroquel before and then you stopped because it was to making you to drowsy.

525
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.000
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

526
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you remember also while you were taking it, you were in a good mood. Do you remember that.

527
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So it's, it's an antidepressant right in. So it doesn't surprise me. So this. It's like, yes, we were addressing the sleep, but it also may have been making you feel happier you I

528
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Only invite you to talk with Dr. Real about maybe getting on an antidepressant, just to feel better, so that you're not kind of getting this fatigue and feeling low serotonin because buprenorphine drops down your serotonin levels. So you're going to end up feeling kind of mopey and depressed.

529
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.360
Michelle Lucero: Yeah yeah

530
01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:58.260
Michelle Lucero: Should I talk to you about it today. Cool.

531
01:05:59.280 --> 01:05:59.940

Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see where we were in. Okay. You can email or you can call her.

533
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And or you can wait. It's up to you just let her know what you've tried before. What you haven't. And you guys can start moving forward on that because we already saw you had an elevation of your mood. I really love seeing that you seem like a different person there for a couple weeks.

534
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:29.430
Michelle Lucero: Okay, yeah, I'll email her today and see if we could schedule, maybe

535
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:32.220
