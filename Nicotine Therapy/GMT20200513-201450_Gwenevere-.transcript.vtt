Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

26
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you gaining any way.

27
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.960
Jay: I don't know yet.

28
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, I hope so if you want to. I mean, I don't know about weight. But, I mean, it seems like a good sign.

29
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.090
Jay: Yeah, I've been eating a lot more

30
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.770
Jay: Appetites definitely back

31
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Since the 13th. We're at two to 10 teams to

32
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Three.

33
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero.

34
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost presence.

35
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Focusing on document.

36
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your thing. Do you know how many times a day to day I say let me open a note. Let me open a note.

37
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because it's like, you know, on a phone. We're very awkward when their silence.

38
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that same feelings in here.

39
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.200
Jay: When

40
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're when there's quiet. Most people like and they fill it.

41
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: With talking. And so it's really, it's this new phenomenon. This video therapy thing. It's a

42
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't treat silence. The same way I do you know if you were right in front of me. We could go a long time in silence, and you'd be perfectly therapeutic

43
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And nobody would think you might be a little uncomfortable, but I would use that discomfort and we would process that later. I don't do that in here. You guys never get me. I never shut up.

44
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.790
Jay: That's for me. Yeah.

45
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is, it's a missed therapeutic opportunity. It is. It's a downside and it might be my fault. I gotta look at that.

46
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:11.970
Jay: I like doing it like this. I'd rather do it like this thing go to my local mental health resources. My IPOs allowed me to do this instead of that.

47
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's great.

48
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.130
Jay: I'd rather

49
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.810
Jay: I'd rather do this.

50
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, then you don't have to schlep down there have to do a parking. Oh, these people, these people. They're so rude. Sometimes

51
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.790
Jay: Well, and then I mean group with a bunch of people that I know and I don't like it.

52
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you been on like a kind of thing, like the year, you know, and from the area.

53
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.020
Yeah.

54
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it because they're still using and and they're not telling anybody. And so you can't really open up

55
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:53.040
Jay: No, it's because everybody in that group is on probation. So the first thing you want to do is go hang out.

56
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.130
Jay: What's that lead to

57
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know nothing good.

58
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.340
Jay: I hate going to him and the peels don't understand that. But the one I got. Now he understands and look how good I'm doing

59
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:16.020
Jay: I can avoid all those people, you know, that's my whole mission. I don't want to be around them people. Why are you forcing me to be around these people

60
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a great point.

61
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a really great point.

62
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't speak to the benefits of bright hearth health, exactly, but I'm just playing with you, let's let's spend a little time thinking about how what is happening while you're here in group.

63
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take take Monday, for example.

64
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What was, what was that a group like for you. I only get to hear a little snippets from people I don't get the full Michela um. What did you notice about that group, how you felt what you notice about yourself and others.

65
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.040
Jay: Um, I, I like hearing about how it affects everybody else.

66
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:09.630
Jay: Like I'm kind of like you guys I like, I like to see the different side effects, the different effects the different medications combinations

67
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.060
Jay: You know, the, the thought process of the drug addict.

68
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.690
Jay: I enjoy learning about that stuff.

69
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see my own note here. Am I, am I, I just caught it. Um,

70
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We, what did we do. Did we do target tapping. We did target mapping found some stories, some history.

71
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you are not sure of. You've got some pretty intense things that have happened to you in your life.

72
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

73
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

74
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

75
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm Bet you I bet you're going to be surprised at how

76
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What we talked about

77
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You right near the end, we're talking about you know when when I see a kid at Walmart acting bad

78
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember the time when you were acting out like this like your mom would say I remember time when you were acting out like this.

79
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How you got this image of yourself as being a bad kid not because you remember being bad. But because of the stories that people tell about you.

80
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.180
Right.

81
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Has your mom corrected any of that. Or she continues to go with that that version of history.

82
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.540
Jay: You know, I don't talk too much about it.

83
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You went on and said, the kid was telling his mom know and cussing.

84
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting things in his pocket and the mom was slapping his mouth.

85
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you thought when you saw that enactment.

86
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That boy needs to get get busted with a belt.

87
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.840
Jay: The belt.

88
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.650
You did.

89
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.350
Jay: I never use a bill.

90
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know why he said that

91
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm, I'm assuming this is transcribed. So, you know, maybe there was a Miss. Miss hearing as possible. I leave room for that I'm seeing the boy act like that was like, whoa, and you were having pretty pretty like you were really having to self sooth right here on your neck.

92
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.030
Jay: Yeah.

93
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that

94
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.070
Yeah.

95
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just thinking, let me just look down a little bit more some couple more notes here.

96
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do some em Dr today.

97
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.930
Jay: Okay. Which ones that

98
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the the eye movement desensitization.

99
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.870
Jay: With the clubs and stuff.

100
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I put the cups and stuff.

101
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.550
Jay: Okay, I'm gonna go to the table. Okay.

102
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm pretty sure what I did was only the positive interweaving I think I probably focused on all the positive I don't know me just see. No we did the seat girlfriend cheating inside. Let me see if we actually did it.

103
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.420
Jay: I know we do this I think once

104
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

105
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.660
Jay: That was weeks ago.

106
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think this was targeted mapping, because I can see girlfriend cheating 50 COUPLE OF TIMES IN PRISON blacked out

107
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: 70 blacked out fought with dad 70

108
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom told me you spend the rest of your life and

109
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: My sister. Oh yeah, this was still

110
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.040
Jay: Okay, I got them set up.

111
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, perfect. So we've got a we've got some choices here you have lots of stories and this i'm sure doesn't even begin to touch on all of them.

112
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But where I'd like to start with you is

113
00:12:43.740 --> 00:13:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens to you. Currently, so there's a probably a pattern of maybe you get defensive or angry or sad or afraid.

114
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You may notice that there's a pattern. Now, the only thing I know for my tiny little bit of time knowing you is

115
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When people

116
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I say they don't see

117
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your aptitude and the good works. You're doing so when you are not seen for who you are, what you already know and your good works, meaning the kindnesses the generosity, the hard work, you're already doing when you are not seen the way you see yourself.

118
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, correct me if I'm wrong, you get irritated.

119
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.130
Jay: Yes.

120
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how often does that happen.

121
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.270
Jay: less frequent now since I started smoking weed. It's

122
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.110
Jay: Gone down a lot is to have been to 310 times a day. Sometimes

123
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.360
Jay: Especially when it rolls out we're

124
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.120
Jay: Like working for my mom.

125
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if we're going to suspend this thing with we that it's this perfect substance on this planet. And the reason we're going to suspend it is because of the message, you already know i i don't hide my bias and I'm going to, you're going to find out why.

126
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of the message that it sends to your mind, which is

127
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're never going to be okay.

128
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're always going to need something

129
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not okay a fundamentally you're always going to need something see life's going to give you a hard time you're going to feel irritated. Guess what you're going to need something

130
00:14:50.880 --> 00:15:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Aren't you, you can eat something. I don't believe that there's something that you're going to need is you. I think you are enough, I think your body, much like mine, his and hers is made with a biofeedback system that self corrects

131
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But you may not have learned how to use it, you may have been robbed of those opportunities because he did

132
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The reaching behavior instead cookie. Some people is sugar.

133
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's all just obsess over cleaning for some people it's sex sleep drug

134
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Drug includes alcohol.

135
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But either any of those things. It's not sitting with the distress long enough to figure out what it already knows what to do to take care of itself. And so no, I'm never going to be this cheerleader for any substance, including sugar.

136
00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't, I'm not discriminating against we because I got something against weed, it has anything to do with anything that is outside of you.

137
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And what we're wired for which is interpersonal regulation so regulating with the self and interpersonal regulation. So I'm going to be biased. I already come with that.

138
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's because you know my training or whatever. But so don't take we'd like Man, why you gotta hate on the week. Hey, not everything.

139
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm a fan of you. I'm a fan of the human body, a fan of the human spirit and its

140
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Its energy that will head towards congruency authenticity and healing.

141
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're made

142
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To heal itself. I don't think you're made

143
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To have to go search for something to fix you.

144
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back.

145
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you say to me, and then I found we before that, let's stick with the first part of that explanation of three, two times 10 times a day when I was

146
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What, how did you feel when someone did not acknowledge who you really are people really see you

147
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.110
Jay: Frustrated.

148
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

149
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you tried

150
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That has failed to communicate that frustration with not being seen known and understood

151
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.200
Jay: I've tried talking about it.

152
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.190
Jay: I've done everything come back from 100

153
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.210
Jay: Go take a walk smoke cigarette. Yeah.

154
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've done the anger management protocol.

155
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.960
Jay: Yeah.

156
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, smoke a cigarette, that still substance so I'm down with

157
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: count backwards, take a walk my goal. With that, let's put the cigarette. You can have those things right back at the end of today, but we're going to put those reaching for something else I want them like not on our fancy therapy list. Okay.

158
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Not on my list.

159
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.200
Jay: Oh, listen to music.

160
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Music and walk. Yes. Okay. So you tried communication. So I'm going to try to stay focused and not not veer off into a different approach to try and stay focused on my target mapping here. So let me bring myself back. Okay.

161
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this that we're talking by route right now.

162
00:18:53.490 --> 00:19:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Has this been the cause. Would you say have big problems like going to jail or severed relationships or really profound

163
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Problems in your life being misunderstood.

164
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.390
Jay: Yeah, it could be a portion

165
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me what's at the core of it.

166
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.210
Jay: I just don't feel

167
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.880
Jay: Like people take me seriously if the things that I tell them

168
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.710
Jay: I think people nowadays are so used to people being full of shit.

169
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

170
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me rephrase that, take me seriously. Let me see if this is what is going on.

171
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do people not believe that you are an honest man.

172
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.030
Jay: Exactly.

173
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.110
Okay.

174
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How is people in the world.

175
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't believe me.

176
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it different than people in the world.

177
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't see me know me understand me. How are they different

178
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:14.940
Jay: Demo

179
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're real similar, right. So you first. I was playing with this theory and then you said no that's that's a portion. But it's this other thing.

180
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe if I say it like this is one of the core things that maybe therapy can do is to process this phenomenon this repeated pattern of you feeling misunderstood not seen and not believed and not taken seriously now. Are we catching a big part of

181
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It is at the core of how life has gone sideways for you.

182
00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.360
Jay: Know that's just recently I thought you're talking about just since I got out of prison.

183
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.350
Oh,

184
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

185
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what's even more at the root.

186
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.680
Jay: Goods

187
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

188
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Age that you first started, use it.

189
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.980
13

190
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back in time and see

191
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.510
Jay: This is

192
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What we'll do the empty your heart.

193
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think back to this experience just now where you fine tune this notion of, it's really important that I be taken seriously and believed

194
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Seen

195
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, not the way you want to see me but like see me that one.

196
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And having the world.

197
00:21:47.760 --> 00:22:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Step father, mother, whoever not really see you. How old is that how far back, let's try to bridge it backward to the oldest memory of that. And I know your memory like you told me your mom remembers that are, but this is a personal experience. I don't think she would know how old you are.

198
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.160
Jay: I've always craved attention, she's told me

199
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find one on your own through walking it back. Let's we'll, we'll start with 10 so you're in fifth grade. Do you remember feeling really seen and understood and validated at that age.

200
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.780
Jay: No, I was always like

201
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.370
Jay: I'm not gonna say super popular but I always had, you know, finance, I guess I was pretty popular

202
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.950
Jay: played sports.

203
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So your peer group you knew how to get your needs met socially through your peer group and had friends. You had another

204
00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.790
Jay: I want to say, probably around 10 whenever I was able to start staying on my own home.

205
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.460
Jay: Because my mom started working. I was I was probably about 12

206
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:15.300
Jay: Maybe 1112 will never, it's probably the furthest back. I can remember of it happening.

207
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.930
Jay: She started working a lot and we never seen her.

208
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then DID YOUR HONESTY, your unique talents and skills and perspective, they started to be put into question.

209
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.560
Jay: I don't know if in the question they were just unnoticed.

210
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.490
No.

211
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.780
Jay: No. So I just started acting out to get attention.

212
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's just proof check something. Okay, let's just move back a little further, let me just check on age nine,

213
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we were we were going with 12 just now, right, or was it 10 we're going with 10

214
00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.760
Jay: It's it's around 1112 whatever cuz I was still in elementary when my mom's

215
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.960
Jay: Because she used to babysit.

216
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.230
Jay: And so I was in probably fifth or sixth grade, which he stopped babysitting started working

217
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it.

218
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to nine so fourth grade. Do you remember

219
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom notices me she notices when I'm tired, hungry. I want to play. I'm sad. I'm scared I'm angry, a sense of I really worrying about whether someone notices me or not there was your needs were met at nine.

220
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

221
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.230
Jay: I don't. I mean, I don't remember.

222
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't remember.

223
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.150
Jay: Know, so I'm telling you. So for this back I can

224
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

225
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.950
Jay: I'm still working at Albertsons

226
00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go work and she was, and then she wasn't noticing you

227
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:14.340
Jay: Don't know i i was also a medications and stuff too. So I was also dealing with depression, bipolar. Oh, anxiety, I was dealing with stuff at that age. I was on at a rock.

228
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.040
Jay: Concert a

229
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.010
Jay: Typical

230
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Good gosh

231
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.260
Jay: That was only one that was only one one.

232
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.080
Jay: And then later. Later that year, I got put on Xanax for about four months.

233
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with this, this isn't a very young age to be telling me.

234
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If his if you're a, you don't mean to. But if he has an accurate history that you were diagnosed with bipolar disorder as early as nine

235
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:57.780
Jay: I don't know about nine I was taking meds at 11 and 1215 sixth grade. And so when I started taking medication.

236
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go like this about

237
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: 11 right about the same time that mom.

238
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Started working at Albertsons

239
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You were diagnosed with heavy duty stuff bipolar is

240
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

241
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be misdiagnosed

242
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.100
Jay: Well in, to be honest, probably, I think I was probably 11

243
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.900
Jay: I was out back and there's a bunch of mice that getting the dog food.

244
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.550
Jay: Uh huh. So I caught him out and I took a

245
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.880
Jay: We call an axe and I killed the mouse with the x

246
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you like it.

247
00:26:51.480 --> 00:27:00.660
Jay: I don't know, I just thought I was killing a mouse, you know, they put they put poison out so I didn't think what I was doing was unique.

248
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.130
Jay: But they gonna be a serial killer and she

249
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticed that I asked you remember my question.

250
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

251
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it

252
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.460
Jay: No, no.

253
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice, it's the same as right i just recognize the familiar one, which is, I thought it was doing what I always did. I was doing what my family always did.

254
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If there was money if there was keys to a car and go take a tractor. I would go do because it was here that's normal for me. I just heard another one. What's the difference between cut his head off and

255
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Poison, maybe it's nicer. So they don't suffer.

256
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.800
Jay: I was too young to

257
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.420
Jay: Think about it like that. I just

258
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.020
Jay: I don't know, they don't

259
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it would be different, just philosophically. Let's play this out a little bit because it's true. That's one of the questions we asked. And in fact, I asked you if I met you. The first time I'd say Were you cruel to animals.

260
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.950
Jay: You know what he did ask me that.

261
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.190
Jay: Yeah, I didn't see this being crew.

262
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we're talking about it right now. Could you have done something with that mouse since you caught it, that would meet the threshold of cruel or would it be

263
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.010
Jay: A torturing it

264
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.820
How

265
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.890
Jay: I don't know, burning it dipping its legs off I

266
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Did not

267
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.830
Jay: Know why

268
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Why stay with me. Why not, why wouldn't you torture it Pulitzer little legs.

269
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.990
Jay: BECAUSE THAT'S TORTURE that's making them so

270
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, who cares. It's just a mouse keep telling talking to me, why not

271
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what

272
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean

273
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:54.210
Jay: I didn't kill it to enjoy it today stacked it and kill it, because it was running around.

274
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a cockroach right it's it's it's

275
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.160
Jay: It's a

276
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Roadmap. That's what

277
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.730
Jay: That's what is a pest.

278
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the word

279
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you tortured animals in your life and enjoy it.

280
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What else you got buddy, I'm probably going to stay here. We may not do the EM Dr part I think I've got a lot more informative still need to get some more history taking because something happened here at age 11 they took you chop that analysis head off.

281
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you learn to chop off the head. What else is going on in your environment that that was a thing. How would you even know to do that.

282
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.790
Jay: On TV you see so much stuff on TV.

283
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.750
Okay.

284
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were allowed to watch violence on TV at 11

285
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Years before that, too.

286
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.840
Jay: I mean, yeah, I pretty much was what I wanted.

287
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:59.190
Jay: The most part it was cartoons, but every time I would go to my dad's house. We could watch cartoons. So

288
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.500
Jay: That's where we'd watch all the

289
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.210
Jay: action packed gory movies. I was real being into

290
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.680
Jay: Jason board. He's in the Michael Myers.

291
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.350
Jay: From God probably 97 until 2005

292
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.240
Jay: I was real big in the horror of things I like them anymore.

293
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just investigate. One more piece of history. If you had a timeline, to the best of your knowledge. If you don't remember. Now, that's fine, but I just am curious to know that mouse.

294
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it happen for you, you saw your cousins, you killed

295
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.480
Jay: No, it was after

296
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.280
Jay: I think that might have been when everything started

297
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You were labeled bipolar.

298
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And

299
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Had you. Was it right at that point you were also diagnosed with ADHD.

300
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.340
Jay: No, I was diagnosed ADHD. Actually, before I went to code for you.

301
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but, and then have any meaning to me. I don't know how old you were when you went to California.

302
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.500
Jay: Maybe I was 10 I was 11 when I went to California.

303
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So age 11 is pretty Pivotal. Don't you think

304
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.310
Yeah.

305
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have this label of yourself that you are bad.

306
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But I keep trying to figure out where the evidences of that. Do you see me searching for that trying to find it. I can I keep a get ahold of it. I'm like, oh, you killed a mouse. Okay, that sounds bad, and then under further investigation.

307
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.100
Jay: You want to hear all the bad stuff. And I've been

308
00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:01.200
Jay: Okay. Um, I took my mom's CREDIT CARD AND I ORDERED like $600 worth of porn.

309
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How old were you

310
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:09.060
Jay: I was about 1112 think goes through team.

311
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

312
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.860
Jay: I was just

313
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Puberty okay ordered $600 worth of porn. Had you access to that credit card for other purchases that were

314
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

315
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.140
Jay: Oh, I mean at the time we were using newbie.

316
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, right.

317
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.810
Jay: So, I mean, it wasn't

318
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:37.920
Jay: It wasn't unlike me to get the credit card and put in the numbers and bid on something for them, you know, I'm saying

319
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's 13 $600 worth important. What else you got

320
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:48.990
Jay: I didn't know it was $600 I thought it was just one purchase for 999 or something. I thought they would never know because

321
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, God, God, you didn't know

322
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:57.240
Jay: I didn't know. I didn't know why it was charging that much. I guess it was going to different links.

323
00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:09.360
Jay: And it kept putting in the same credit card number because I kept trying to go a step through that site. It kept going, different sites. So I would pay for those. And I didn't know that it was charging or that. Okay.

324
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.710
Jay: Um, yeah, they got pretty pissed about that. I went to jail for that.

325
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You went to jail.

326
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.980
Jay: my step dad press charges.

327
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Ah, that's still, it doesn't go into bad. I'm sorry. That's actually pretty consistent with a 13 year olds naivete. You're just ignorant. I didn't even know that you just gave me

328
00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, than the sexual behavior is right on time as a 13 year old is all about Venus right that's right on time.

329
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep going, what else you got bad boy. Let me hear it.

330
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:54.870
Jay: I used to steal their truck every night. And then when they caught me doing that I stole the key cuz my step dad was a

331
00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:06.480
Jay: Like a 30% owner of triangle Ace Hardware down here. So after school one day I took the key to my grandma's car, and she had already passed away.

332
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:18.330
Jay: But I made a copy of it and I put it back on my mom's TV. And so when they caught me are still in the truck. I started stealing my grandma's car and it was a book, it would just

333
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.390
Jay: It would start off slow and

334
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.390
Jay: To build momentum but I mean I drove it

335
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I got I got we gotta go back a little bit in time.

336
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to steal step dad's truck every night. Once they figured it out. What did your parents do to discipline you right there.

337
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:46.050
Jay: Um, well, at that point, me and my stepdad had already gotten into physical altercation. So he didn't put his hands on me no more. So they really couldn't do shit so

338
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.730
Jay: I did what I wanted.

339
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:56.910
Jay: They started, they started locking it they started checking mileage on. That's how we originally caught me they check the mileage

340
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:58.260
Jay: And

341
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.030
Jay: Even then, after they caught me and I would still take it when they would go out of town.

342
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.750
Jay: I had Mon pair to everything Mon spare key to everything.

343
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When was he tell me the altercation date when was that, how old were you when you really you really had physical

344
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.020
Jay: I was in junior high. I don't know how old I was, um, maybe 15

345
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's 15 you're starting high school. There's something really important years for you are writing that 11 1213 it's right in there.

346
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right after what happened with your cousins.

347
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.650
Jay: It might have been in mind to be an eighth grade, seventh grade.

348
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.050
Jay: I can't

349
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, okay, okay.

350
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:51.420
Jay: See that's whenever I started getting drunk and I started you know I was doing math. I was you know that the only thing I hadn't tried was cocaine at the time cocaine and heroin. I was doing pills.

351
00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:00.330
Jay: What else, I see. Oh, I would steal their liquor. Oh, his guns. I took his guns and I robbed.

352
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.950
Jay: Robbed for for crack dealers. But that's still way later on.

353
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see, I'm still trying to see how you're a bad kid I've always been about you, my mom tells me so I still I'm still trying to see it. Because right now, I keep seeing this pivotal event that happened it at 11

354
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:26.130
Jay: They couldn't brown me if I wanted something I would take it was stealing from the stores.

355
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.030
Jay: I stopped.

356
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing that at eight and nine years old. Is that right,

357
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No, then I'm sorry.

358
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't buy in. I'm going to hold tight to this.

359
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:45.060
Jay: AD. I don't know. I can't tell you. I don't remember that far back. That's what I'm saying. I thought we're talking about 11 and 12

360
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We are. We are. You're doing beautifully and I keep trying to see if there's enough evidence to just say,

361
00:36:54.750 --> 00:37:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I haven't gotten there because here's the same thing I mom does your behavior, I get it, I get it. Nobody likes that behavior. I get it.

362
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.280
Jay: Well, they said I was mean to my sister, too.

363
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Tell me about that.

364
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.530
Jay: I don't really remember much i mean

365
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.250
I was

366
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.200
Jay: A big brother to a big industry, you know, I remember protecting her

367
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.350
Jay: I remember, we're not allowed to have boyfriends and

368
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:27.840
Jay: I'll be damned if there'll be at the house and you know what I mean, I remember she like, I don't remember, but they said I was they said I would take her toys from

369
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.400
Jay: Austin that

370
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.860
Jay: I would always make her cry.

371
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now that that has some meaning right there so that I wonder about. Now what I wonder is how your family addressed taking toys it at three and four and five and six years of age, what your family was doing to shape appropriate behavior.

372
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When toys were taken.

373
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:05.190
Jay: I vaguely remember them making me stand in a corner with my nose in the corner for a little while. Um, I remember having to go to my room.

374
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.460
Jay: Okay. Oh, extra chores.

375
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.640
Jay: Oh, you know, they would take my TV my video games. Yeah.

376
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all healthy, normal, healthy parenting behavior.

377
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, do you kind of remember it was like, Oh man, I don't want to go through that again and you wouldn't take your toys. Do you remember that it would help at all.

378
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.770
Jay: No, I was hard headed

379
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: hard headed

380
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:43.680
Jay: Nothing, they could tell me if I've got my mind made up my mind set on something. There's nobody that can tell me anything different. And I've always been like that.

381
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you still like that now.

382
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.350
Jay: I am but I'm more wise in my decisions.

383
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

384
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:59.040
Jay: Like what I choose to pursue in believe in, I take them better. A. A.

385
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.320
Jay: deeper look into it.

386
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you think about the consequence if this is your choice. It's not just short term kind of think it through.

387
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:17.850
Jay: Yeah, cuz I've always been impulsive and I'm the type that I would do more for my friends and my family. That's how I was when I was younger.

388
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.470
Jay: I think I resented my step and

389
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you resent him for

390
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:44.490
Jay: Really, I could, I couldn't tell you I mean just the way that he acts with me now. But what I did for him to act that way with me. I don't remember. I couldn't tell you what started it. I just, you know, I just know we don't get along.

391
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:51.030
Jay: Never have. And my mom says because I used to put my dad on a pedestal.

392
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.570
Jay: I talked to him and like 18 years

393
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember a period of time when you were with your biological dad.

394
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:14.100
Jay: Yeah, I lived with him for a little while because my mom and then kicked me out of the house. I see. It was my step dad, my mom allowed

395
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Me to try again. What age, what age were you with your biological dad.

396
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.160
Jay: I was 15 it was right before I went to the boys school

397
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.590
Jay: He was in prison from

398
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.450
Jay: Us in prison from 87 no way from eight until

399
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.280
Jay: 9797

400
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.400
Jay: That's whenever I first started going to visit him and on the weekends and stuff.

401
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's been a dynamic between you and your step that for age 15

402
00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. So how did you come to idealize Your dad was it you really hadn't known him yet and

403
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.090
You I

404
00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:10.830
Jay: I don't know you was my dad. You know, I don't know.

405
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.020
Jay: He was my dad. You know what I mean that's how it was.

406
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And step dad is not your dad, no matter what, no matter how party tries or has good intentions.

407
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.520
Jay: He, he's not then

408
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.090
Jay: Yeah. And then my dad gets out, you know, I haven't seen him. So it's all to talk about that's, you know, for years.

409
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.450
Jay: To finally figure out the type of person he is

410
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:50.700
Jay: I mean, even then whenever I go to his house. I didn't enjoy it because his, uh, his wife's kids, they were just mean to us, you know, I kind of blame them a little bit for

411
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:59.700
Jay: The way I am, because they were hard on me anytime something went wrong. They blame me, whether it was me or not.

412
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And as a 10 year old you were

413
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Bipolar Disorder add

414
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And home alone with your sister.

415
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:22.800
Jay: Yeah, so sometimes. Sometimes I think I was more old and she would go to a babysitter, or stay with a friend.

416
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it that you came to see

417
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The death of your cousins at 11, how is it that that was a possibility.

418
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.280
Jay: I went down there to stay. The summer.

419
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.720
Jay: My and him had just got a new house, and Bill

420
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.850
Jay: And they invited me to come stay with them for the summer went down there and

421
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.010
Jay: All hell broke loose.

422
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had children would you have them in that same environment.

423
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:03.540
Jay: I don't think my mom knew the environment. I don't think I don't think my aunt knew the environment.

424
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that makes sense.

425
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.380
Jay: I don't think we knew what was going on.

426
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:19.080
Jay: You know she has three boys and a daughter, you know, she's gonna do more worried about what they're doing in the three boys. The three older boys.

427
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do it the same way you think that you wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on with your voice.

428
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:28.170
Jay: I don't know.

429
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:36.930
Jay: I don't have kids like I don't know. I mean, I could spot things that most people couldn't just because I've lived it.

430
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you would have spotted

431
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.430
Jay: I mean, just the fact that they were getting high gangbanging

432
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But when a parent. Now, if you were a parent that your kids were gangbanging. How would you know

433
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.980
Jay: Well, I wouldn't know. By the way, that somebody is dressing.

434
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Dressing yeah yeah

435
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:02.460
Jay: Apparently not going to understand what a colored bandana means, you know what I mean.

436
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:03.180
Okay.

437
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.760
Jay: Nowadays you might put on the 90s.

438
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.120
Jay: Especially not moving from Orange County to Victorville

439
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If you did have a little boy and he was like you

440
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you have treated him.

441
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.860
Jay: Like, what do you mean if you did some bad

442
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sure.

443
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.150
Jay: would talk to him.

444
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how would it sound like hey don't take the toy. Let's

445
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.490
Jay: Start

446
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. And then, so that's you, right, then what

447
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.700
Jay: What I raised my voice and usually it doesn't go past that with me, kids. Normally, listen to me.

448
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.340
Jay: Once I put some basic language.

449
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:19.260
Jay: So I've my ex. I was with her for four years. She had a two year old when I got with her and she was pregnant when I go with her. It wasn't my kid, but I stayed with her for four years and her oldest I spanked him one time in four years.

450
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:22.740
Jay: And he lives.

451
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.060
Jay: He listens to me, he

452
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't your step dad raise his voice to you when you were younger.

453
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:34.860
Jay: Oh no, he was real quick to go for a bill spankings

454
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So the

455
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Punishment didn't really match the crime as a little guy.

456
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:54.300
Jay: No, it didn't matter if I spit in his face, or if I throw trash on the floor and told him I wasn't gonna pick it up. He wanted to speak.

457
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember feeling unjustly treated when you were a little

458
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.420
Jay: At that age, you don't know what that is.

459
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I just asked him.

460
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.720
Jay: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

461
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.610
Jay: I know I felt her like

462
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.580
Jay: What kid, wouldn't you know what I mean.

463
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

464
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.070
Jay: I'm getting discipline.

465
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not getting what you want.

466
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.060
Right.

467
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:37.320
Jay: And I was spoiled. I didn't have a bad life, don't get me wrong, I had a good life. I just had a lot of mental health issues that I don't think we're properly diagnosed

468
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well certainly the one at 11 I could I'm mostly concerned right at that one. Um, you know, as, as a historian, you're not awesome

469
00:46:50.790 --> 00:47:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right. You say, I don't know. I don't know, I'm not sure I'm not sure you question and sometimes your timeline, you'll pull back and say, Actually, that was younger, or actually that was older. So as a historian,

470
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We might say unreliable. But that's not because you're intentionally evading the answer I think your, your memory storage is corrupted either from the cortisol stress or from drug use. I don't know.

471
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But

472
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.790
Jay: I'm bird. I have a hard time remembering stuff.

473
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:21.570
Yeah.

474
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's a blessing. Maybe

475
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.200
Jay: I could tell you the story.

476
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I'm getting out today had more to do. And we put this other plan aside because I wanted to understand more about how you were deciding that you were bad and how your mom came to that conclusion. And then if you had YOU AS A SON, you would come to the same conclusion.

477
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure you come to the same conclusion.

478
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.000
No.

479
00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:01.560
Jay: I don't think my mom would ever tell anybody else that I was bad. I think she does it. Just talk to ship.

480
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.250
Jay: I mean, I do know I was a jerk. I was an asshole. I know nobody

481
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:10.020
Jay: Huh.

482
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Later, though.

483
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.610
Jay: That know even early. I know I was a jerk.

484
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.730
Jay: If I'm taking my sister's toys and stuff like that. I'm a jerk.

485
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but every kid is going to take another kid's toy that's developmentally appropriate

486
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the everyone's gonna do that.

487
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom did it. Step Dad did it. We don't differentiate what's mine from not. We don't have that distinction until we do until we learn

488
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it's something that's taught. Somebody said, as a consequence for that you've heard this person's feelings. This is a consequence and we we do parenting around that. But what I still don't know is if you got hit.

489
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.590
Jay: my step dad spent me a few times. My mom's never put her hand up.

490
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what i don't know

491
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if age 11 you experienced. To me, it's easier to PTSD right there. That's just like that's a no brainer, but

492
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Why were you in like long term treatment for that.

493
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.970
Jay: I was in therapy, since I was, I told you, since I was a kid.

494
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What did it work.

495
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: No why

496
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.980
Jay: Wasn't if I could tell you that all my problems would be fixed when

497
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.840
Jay: I don't know.

498
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah me neither. So I'm I'm investigating because it isn't just

499
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:57.660
Jay: It's just another person that's judging me for my problems. And I've always seen it like that, you know, I'm trying to use it as

500
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:05.490
Jay: As a tool to make myself better because I understand that I have flaws that I need to work on. So I practiced humility.

501
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:17.850
Jay: Every day when I come to group and I go to therapy and stuff because I haven't had I haven't had very good experience, you know, but I keep trying, because it does help some people and right now it's helping me

502
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's why I asked about the therapy because you can have 10 years of therapy with a person that you don't trust.

503
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.190
Jay: You don't get

504
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a waste of your time.

505
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to find the right medicine right, notice we did that with the medicine with you. We had to had to kind of say. Mm hmm. It's the same way with a therapist if you don't trust me, this ain't gonna work.

506
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.320
Jay: Exactly.

507
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You think I'm busy in the background really thinking you're a dirtbag. We're going to go anywhere.

508
00:50:52.470 --> 00:51:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't going to work this trust part the rapport, the place where you can risk being humble risk that I might eventually

509
00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Say something mean or her to there's a lot at stake, I might reach traumatize you. This is a really vulnerable place to be, where you're at. With me you're risking a lot

510
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everybody gets that

511
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Even people that are supposed to that are in a position of power and authority, they don't get it.

512
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So it says to me, if you didn't trust this person that you were working with, when you were younger, you may indeed still have untreated PTSD.

513
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think that all that misbehaving.

514
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Was you channeling that charge of witnessing that horror

515
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And it just never got processed.

516
00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I think. And on top of that you're spicy kid, you got you got your own opinion, you've got, you know, and maybe you really do have some conduct disorder. Maybe that's true. I don't know.

517
00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All the marks are. They're like, okay, well you did this thing to the mouse and

518
00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He's sassy to is throwing trash or he does these things. Okay, you'd probably hit the mark. There'd be there'd be this checklist and you'd be like, Okay, we could give them this label. But that's not the end of the conversation.

519
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's, like, so there's a checklist. But who are they, who are you, why would you continue to do those behaviors, thinking that they're going to be effective to get what you want.

520
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you needed a particular type of attention. Maybe from a particular person said enough to say your attention seeking close attention to what you want. And why didn't we give it to you.

521
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What's wrong with wanting attention. I love attention accept when I don't

522
00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.540
Jay: See back in. It wasn't like it is no

523
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.970
Jay: Therapy is way different now.

524
00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:01.230
Jay: And I'm not just saying just from my experience just

525
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.700
Jay: Personal back in as a kid.

526
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:09.510
Jay: Yeah, it was kind of like you're supposed to be seen not heard

527
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:17.670
Jay: You know, I was always wrong no matter what my feelings, no matter what they were wrong.

528
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:27.750
Jay: And that's, that's what I took away from therapy for eight years as a kid, you know, is it everything's Michael

529
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: J. That is an epic failure on my fields part that has nothing to do with when it has nothing. Oh therapies change. No, you had shitty people

530
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: They were shitty and they failed you, and I speak for all of us. Fail clients over and over all the time. I'm so sorry. Really sorry and I'm embarrassed to be a part of it. You're not wrong.

531
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the best you can.

532
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.960
Jay: It took me years to figure that out.

533
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That should have been done a long time ago.

534
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope you hear in the kinds of questions that I'm asking that I'm on your side that I want. I want to meet that sort of space that tender vulnerability of that younger person that 1011 year old that had to

535
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To navigate. How do I live with this memory.

536
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I supposed to frickin live with this. What am I supposed to do.

537
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Who wouldn't want to use drugs when we don't know how I wasn't a living here, no. Oh no, about how to live with that kind of reality that that's

538
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: No adults can handle that. And you're asking an 11 year old.

539
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

540
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's trauma.

541
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did the best you could to survive that experience and yes you use drugs.

542
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people would

543
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The

544
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't see it as a failure. I have you, I see it as a failure of our of our system of our culture of mental health. I don't see it as you're wrong. I'm pointing all 10 at me. It's our fault. We failed you.

545
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You had so many doors open, where someone could have helped you. How am I right, how many people tried

546
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, over and over

547
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.600
Jay: Yeah, probably had 15 therapists.

548
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.210
Jay: Elise

549
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.200
Jay: And that's not counting prison.

550
00:55:47.850 --> 00:56:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And they all basically just wanted to look at you cut the mouse his head off. If you there's just, it's wrong, right, they just kept focusing on that kind of thing, like what you did the drugs and you know that that's wrong. And that's wrong.

551
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.590
Jay: It should hurry.

552
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.360
Jay: Yeah, what's currently happening.

553
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Every focus on that.

554
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

555
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe

556
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Like marijuana like that cigarette that you're craving right now. It is a solution. I know.

557
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: nice lady. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I got, I want to go smoke.

558
00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. It is your solution.

559
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not the right solution to the problem, the more habitual you and I can sit with what the core problem is meaning.

560
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like feeling angry or I don't like feeling anxious or I feel wrong. I feel stupid. I feel small. I feel helpless, I feel, I feel, I feel that's what interests me. I get you have a solution. Everybody's got those lists. I get that.

561
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But I really want to understand the history behind it. And the story behind how you've come to see these things as viable solutions because not everybody

562
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Who has the kind of trauma that you went through. Sometimes people get a psychotherapy treatment soon enough early enough that they go, oh,

563
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm healing. I feel better and they don't start acting out and they don't go that direction, but I think you didn't get the treatment that you need it soon enough.

564
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I think. All right.

565
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's my story. I might change it next week. But that's what I'm sticking with this week.

566
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I like your humility. Let me tell you something. There ain't no way you and I would get along without that, and I wouldn't either. I could get. I could get myself offended all the time with how people talk about me and how they talk to me. Right.

567
00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've got lots of humility. I know I'm a fool.

568
00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not and then I can work with that.

569
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's do this again on a different week

570
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can always text me if for some reason you get a really good gig and there's like, you know, I got this real deal kind of job thing going just to okay because I want you to have that that for yourself. You just have to let me know.

571
00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

572
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Right now, of course, you got group on Monday. And then what if we did

573
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:43.650
Dude,

574
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: See, I'm like wait so long, I gotta go two weeks ahead. So I don't have to put myself through this account and you okay okay let me focus next week. How about Wednesday at 210

575
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:58.260
Jay: Wednesday. What's the date.

576
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It is may 20, if you can believe it's on my mind.

577
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

578
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:05.790
May 20

579
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: freakish

580
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it will feel a lot like this. I think we're doing what we just did today. Yeah.

581
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I want to move ahead and catch something a little earlier in this just a little earlier in the day. I want to catch a little ahead up into week may 25 and I know if something comes up where you get

582
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a more like consistent job thing you just let me know and we'll change it, but I want to get something in place. It's not quite so late in the day.

583
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.950
Jay: Well, though. What time was the MAY 20th.

584
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: To 10

585
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.350
Jay: Okay.

586
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 minutes after two

587
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.660
Jay: Okay.

588
00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we do instead

589
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: 11am write this one down may 27

590
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.920
Jay: at 11am 27th, not the

591
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.490
Jay: 27th 25th.

592
01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's a group, you'll be going to group on that Monday, but 27 is about individual therapy.

593
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:10.470
Jay: Okay.

594
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.220
Jay: At 11

595
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And 11am earlier today, and then

596
01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe then

597
01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do.

598
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That still hard. I'm still having a hard time you have such so many stories so much to your history.

599
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick one of them. My guess is it's around something around that invalidating experience and I'm a bad boy I'm wrong. My guess is that's probably where the work will be done, but this is

600
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of of your, your, your memory challenge. It makes it a little difficult, but I'm trying

601
01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.290
Jay: My just

602
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:16.740
Jay: I try to, I try to remember what grade, I was in, but a lot. I mean, I was locked up a lot. So I was doing a lot of my schoolwork there. So some of the years just, you know, I might have thought I was in seventh grade, really. I was in eighth grade because I did the whole summer in jail.

603
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, we're, we're getting close. I think we're getting close. I think we're honing in because these are big.

604
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when the message from the outside world is I'm always wrong. And I'm not seeing and I'm not believed

605
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting we're getting into a really important piece that can follow you for the rest of your life, it'll just keep happening over and over and over. So I think we're getting close.

606
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

607
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.560
Jay: And we're doing is that it

608
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you don't with me.

609
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay see

610
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.920
