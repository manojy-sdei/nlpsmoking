00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.800
Supposed to be Angelina

2
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.430
Alicia Noedel: She's running late. Hi, how are you today.

3
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent, thanks for being flexible. Sometimes, this will work in your favor to sometime, you're going to be on some drama will be like

4
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.980
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it worked out because, uh, like I said, My, my, my boyfriend goes to work, you know, at like one o'clock, so it's perfect.

5
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.790
Oh,

6
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, cool. Um, let's prop me up somewhere, but so pile of books or nightstand bookcase somewhere where you don't have to actually be holding the device.

7
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.650
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

8
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time, no rush. While you're doing that all open up a note.

9
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.090
Okay.

10
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.240
Alicia Noedel: Let's see.

11
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.250
Alicia Noedel: Camera sideways. Okay.

12
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.200
Alicia Noedel: Looks like

13
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that's great.

14
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.840
Okay.

15
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is

16
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just our first time meeting. That's not the psychosocial

17
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.580
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I think so.

18
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. So we get to slow

19
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.120
Down.

20
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.060
Very cool.

21
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's just start from the outside in. Let's just do a check in with is your environment that you're in right now is it pretty chill, or is there like chaos and uncertainty like really close in your life.

22
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.150
Alicia Noedel: Oh no, everything is pretty stable right now. Nice.

23
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.540
Alicia Noedel: Nice convenient. Yeah.

24
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you were you the unstable one in the storyline.

25
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.540
No.

26
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.420
Alicia Noedel: Completely

27
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.440
Okay.

28
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In the past, what felt like it was like chaotic and uncertain in the past.

29
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.800
Alicia Noedel: I didn't have a lot of stability as a childhood. There wasn't a lot of structure.

30
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.010
Alicia Noedel: My parents weren't really involved in school stuff.

31
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:24.000
Alicia Noedel: I got myself ready and I did a lot of independent things for myself as a child. So I didn't really have a schedule a routine, anything like that.

32
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.530
Alicia Noedel: I mean things pretty hard so

33
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychology offers a word for that.

34
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're just talking. So I don't know if it applies, but

35
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called parental education. It's where we as parents put undue burden on a kid emotionally to like start talking about like I might talk about my my marriage or

36
00:07:51.570 --> 00:08:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: my sex life or like like totally inappropriate like you shouldn't be telling me this, you know, we put that burden on our kids and they have to bathe themselves. They have to cook for other children and

37
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That can carry on.

38
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Without generations. Yeah. And, but it can also linger where it never gets repaired and you're stuck in a position of still taking care of a parent, emotionally, even though maybe you're not doing it.

39
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're smiling, like, yes, it's true.

40
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.640
Alicia Noedel: Yeah I that's been my whole. My parents used to

41
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:41.580
Alicia Noedel: Like my dad and my mom both used to talk to me about things that, you know, now would be considered crazy to tell a child, you know, like, um, they would tell me about like

42
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:55.920
Alicia Noedel: All of the abuse that they suffered as kids and like really horrible things that happened to them. And ever since a young age. My dad. Basically, I was like his counselor.

43
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.300
Yeah, so that's problematic, right there. Yeah.

44
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, let me just get because the more I get to know you. I'll be able to sort of say, okay, I can rely on this piece of stability. I don't have to check in on this domain, very often. So the person that you're with right now. I'm trying to remember is this a fiance.

45
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.570
Alicia Noedel: Yes, we're engaged.

46
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: His family history. Um, did he get enough love and attention is there abuse history in his family of origin.

47
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:35.580
Alicia Noedel: Um, he didn't have any kind of physical abuse or drug abuse with his parents or anything.

48
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:47.520
Alicia Noedel: But they had like more of a psychological warfare household to where his mother was manipulative and she would

49
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:55.440
Alicia Noedel: Just do things to manipulate the whole house, apparently, and

50
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.390
Alicia Noedel: Just

51
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:16.530
Alicia Noedel: Like doing horrible things like making him feel self conscious about himself and his way and then like putting locks on the fridge and the cabinets and just like really you know that he left. He got kicked out his mother kicked him out when he was about 13 or 14 years old.

52
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a baby. What is that

53
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:29.430
Alicia Noedel: And he's been on his own, you know, couch surfing since pretty much since we met, and then we met and we, you know, did it together.

54
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.650
Yep. Okay.

55
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Gives me some context of maybe down the line when I maybe start to hear about some

56
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Disagreements that you to have all kind of have that history in the back of my mind that you both have been burdened, way, way, way, way, way too early with responsibilities.

57
00:10:50.790 --> 00:11:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have a chance to sort of incrementally, you know, be a little defiant and to, you know, break the rules a little bit here and there. You know how we're supposed to it 13 and 12 and 16 and then

58
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, can't do that. Okay, fine, but we get to slowly learn individuation we get to test out our, our problem solving skills and

59
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You and You both were throwdown it way too fast.

60
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:30.840
Alicia Noedel: Well, I had to like I honestly had to learn myself how to be a normal person, because I never ever had a normal life ever as a child. It was not normal.

61
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So one of the first things and then make this may feel like it's coming out of nowhere but i i say no no time to waste. I like you guys to have this

62
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill immediately. So I, I just, I want to teach you something that if you already know it, then we'll review it. But if you don't know it.

63
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty handy to have

64
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've changed what I'm calling it I was calling it a box breathing before and

65
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.840
Alicia Noedel: I've heard of it before but

66
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

67
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's diet dramatic reading

68
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I would like to do with you.

69
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I'm going to talk about the science, a talk about the Vegas nerve and then I want to show you how to do it and it will do it together.

70
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But we'll do it together by bringing up will make it real time really see you know if it works. Okay, so we'll do that.

71
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is yours forever. It doesn't require insurance doesn't require anybody to be there to tell you how to do it. It's yours forever.

72
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's great to teach your own children. It's great to teach your sweethearts, it's great to practice if we already have.

73
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a meditative practice or a prayer or we have something where we're already doing this spiritual cognitive piece and now it can be also doing this somatic body work.

74
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's super handy to have and it's good as a sort of a baseline meditative practice, but it's really good for when we're like freaked out.

75
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.600
Alicia Noedel: Okay, yeah.

76
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to talk to you about the science of it first. And that's what's really cool because in a lot of psychology

77
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like, well, do I have to believe in this nonsense. For it to work and the fun fact about what I'm talking about now is you don't have to believe it. You can think. It's who we are.

78
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll still work. So since it's biology. You know what I mean.

79
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Not all it's not all in your head.

80
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm going to teach today and I'm calling it belly breathing, because it's the one part about this this belly of yours, that's going to go for like that.

81
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can't compromise, you've got to be able to have that part happen. I'm going to tell you about

82
00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, sort of mindfully breathing and having it go in top of the long and down to the bottom. And I'll talk about that the account needs to be for count. Inhale, and I'll go into all of that. But honestly, if you forget all of that.

83
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine, you do the belly breath part as long as the belly is expanding and it's super uncomfortable to do if you're not used to it. It feels really weird because over the years. I mean, we were babies we did and you can picture your little baby knows little belly goes like this.

84
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.590
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

85
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, so cute. Oh, I just love it. You

86
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.580
Alicia Noedel: Know, oh my god.

87
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.240
Alicia Noedel: Oh my god.

88
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We stopped doing that we stopped maybe for vanity. I don't even know why we stopped doing it. I gotta figure that out. Maybe I could include that in a little spiel.

89
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.090
But

90
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We stopped and now we do the short little tight breaths up here and we see our we see our shoulders move, you can tell when someone's taking a breath.

91
00:14:50.340 --> 00:15:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're going to do today is different. This is going back to that intuitive for us that as an infant, we had and we knew. Everything's fine. I'm busy. Just doing my breathing thing. Everything's good.

92
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go back to that and it's going to help us self regulate. So the science behind it is this in our body. We have what's called a Vegas nerve.

93
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It, it's called the wandering nerve for a reason. It attaches to all kinds of stuff all over the place. Just to our eyes to our facial muscles to this little your bone sunny that attached at larynx pairings to our heart to our lungs to our stomach spleen kidney, all that good stuff.

94
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but the diaphragm right kind of cuts the body in half.

95
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: becomes relevant when we start talking about doing this belly breath. So the mechanism of action is this when you breathe in the top of the long, all the way down to the bottom, it pushes that diaphragm down

96
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and smashes the organs down below it. Well, what's neat is that nerve is wrapped around all those organs that are down on the bottom.

97
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it pushes on them and activates a signal and the signal comes from the bottom, way down there and it goes up to the brain and the message that it sends is

98
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, we must be okay because Look at us. We're doing this kind of belly breathing business. And I sure know that we couldn't do it.

99
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:32.820
Right.

100
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in complete contradiction to our perceived thought of threat. So we're doing this belly breathing. Right, right.

101
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So the message that goes up to the brain is oh, we're fine. This body is fine because Look at us. We're doing this big belly breathing business.

102
00:16:50.100 --> 00:17:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no way we'd be doing. And if there really was someone holding a knife in the room. There's no way we would be breathing like this. So who's right. Is it this perceived threat up here or is it this

103
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This body but you keep doing the breathing and the message keeps going up to the thought of perceived threat or maybe it's a memory. Maybe it's unconscious, whatever, but it's sending it up and it keeps sending it up and it's like

104
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I guess we're fine. I guess we get to have relaxed muscles. I guess we get to have the return of the blood for the large muscle groups to the different parts of the brain.

105
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's biology, that is the parasympathetic nervous system counter balancing the sympathetic nervous system, which she recognizes the fight or flight up here, right. That's the book.

106
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a threat response. And we're going to immediately. We're going to protect our body. I think it's the same thing that happens when someone insults us or starts to look like they're abandoning us. It's the same perceived threat. It's danger.

107
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it doesn't mean that someone's wielding a knife. It can be rejection or abandonment can feel just as terrifying. Okay.

108
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the perceived threat, but when you do this activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. I'm doing this little hand motion because it's like a break.

109
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It puts a break on this activation. It says we're okay. Look at us for breathing. Breathing like this and it sends a signal over and over world. Okay.

110
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's other ways to do that break. And that's actually through social medicine Nestor, you and I, talking and looking at each other really registering really subtle little changes in effect and listening to prosody of tone, but I'll talk about that another time. So,

111
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You've heard about the biology of it. It's a full belly smooches that diaphragm down and then those organs at the bottom go, Oh, we're good.

112
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're good. Okay. Okay. Can we can relax our body now. So that's biology now.

113
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Adding pieces of fidelity to it and fidelity has to do with in here. I'm going to teach you. So right way to do it.

114
00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And you're going to want to follow the rules and you're going to try really hard. That would be you trying to follow the practice with fidelity right to do it. Just the way you're being instructed and I encourage you to do it because some other cool things are about to happen.

115
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But the truth is to forget on it.

116
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter. As long as you get that little belly expanding. Okay.

117
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's both cool things happen when you do it with fidelity and it's also don't get too hung up on being perfect. Okay.

118
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but first I want you to see if you can have an experiential in vivo benefit from it. So just now.

119
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You touched just for a moment on some of your history, you had an image, maybe of

120
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe being told that stuff that somewhere you kind of knew why am I hearing all this stuff for my dad. This seems like it belongs with someone else. I don't know what to do it all the stuff on her sleeve cross all your problems.

121
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it was that one. Or maybe you had just now right having to take care of yourself. Get ready for school and all that.

122
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:21.660
Alicia Noedel: Anytime we talk about anything like that. It's kind of like, not just a memory. It actually feels like I'm being transported back into that exact moment and I can see through my eyes at that age, what's going on around me like it's so vivid

123
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll put a pin in teaching you the belly breathing for a second and just telling you what I think is going on right there.

124
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, back to science, but it's neuroscience, so

125
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Our hippocampus is the one that stores all our, our memories. It chooses massive capacity chicks holds all kinds of cool stuff in it. Right.

126
00:20:50.010 --> 00:21:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you weren't even thinking about these things until I pulled it out of you. And I said, let's talk about them, you're like I was fine until I talked to this lady and I got to think about a dog on it right but they were they're

127
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.010
Alicia Noedel: Great.

128
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: They were there, what we did was we brought it up the elevator into working memory, we can only have in working memory, a couple sentences worth maybe of information. It can be information about an emotion. It can be an actual image like you could picture your little self being there.

129
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you got some pictures, but it sounds like you've also got an emotional experience of it too that's connected to it.

130
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it feels as if it's happening now.

131
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that I'm about to explain as far as what neuroscience has taught me this is what we, we can see what we can see about the HIPAA campuses. At the time of when those incidents happen to you.

132
00:21:47.040 --> 00:22:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body was flooding with cortisol, which is the stress response and we need them. We're only supposed to have it in short verse we go we slay the bear. So we're on the hero. Can we drive at home.

133
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not it's a mess.

134
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I did all the hard work. I killed a. You got it. So, um, but it's only supposed to be out for a little bit, super important to have. It's fantastic, but the hippocampus is covered

135
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: With cortisol receptors.

136
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, like why, like, Hmm, I don't know why that one but it messes with our memory. So let's say you're just flooded with all the time stress response that hippocampus is covered with those receptors. It's corrupting the memories.

137
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And one really important way that it messes with the memory, he doesn't get a proper timestamp.

138
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It was supposed to be set in 1990. It was supposed to be set in 1980 and hold your so but

139
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't get stamped

140
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So every time we pull up into working memory or we're triggered by a site by a smell my a sound bite by a statement, we're reliving it in the moment is if it's happening right now. All right. Does that make sense.

141
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's neat that we can name the science that's going on. It can feel empowering and hopefully it can give some hope.

142
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That if we know how it's occurring. We can undo it and maybe we can have that memory stay in the past that we can have some distance from it. We can chit chat about it but it stays over here and we aren't

143
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: wiped out by it and hijacked by the intensity of reflecting on that memory. So a lot of other things are happening. But the big piece about what you just said is it feels like it's right now that made me think maybe I could talk to you a little bit about that part.

144
00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so some of the work that I'll invite you to be doing with the is

145
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking that memory up and I'll say, Okay, I want you to hold the WORST piece of that. You don't even have to tell me what it is you just pull it up. Of course, you can if you want to but you pull it up and you'll be reprocessing that memory.

146
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be doing some kind of fun and cool techniques to reprocess it so that your relationship with that neural network with where that little those neurons. Got all wrapped up in that memory, right.

147
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They change. Maybe they have new positive imagery connected to them, maybe in here.

148
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In the presence of someone over time you'll learn to trust me, and the social medicine will be at work, you will be experiencing it but without the helplessness.

149
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be experiencing it with someone who's here for you. And every time we pull up a memory. We're changing it. You just changed it just now.

150
00:24:52.440 --> 00:25:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Really in a very, very small way, what we monitor we modify. So when we're monitoring that we pull it up like, oh, it's like up

151
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We're modifying it even the slightest little bit. And that's exciting. That's optimistic to think, okay, I can do this. I won't always be flooded with all the intensity of my past intruding into my present

152
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You with me so far.

153
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:34.680
Alicia Noedel: Yeah yeah cuz there's some things that, like, I still, you know, if I talk about or think about it, you know, it gets me a little emotional and then there's other things that I feel like I've kind of like dealt with to where they don't affect me as much

154
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool.

155
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to

156
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The belly breathing purchase a second

157
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Pop quiz.

158
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Another test.

159
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If you haven't, remember one thing about the belly breathing. What's the one thing can't compromise on, we've got to do this one piece.

160
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.640
Alicia Noedel: You have to do the belly breathing.

161
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.150
Alicia Noedel: Right.

162
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:11.040
Alicia Noedel: You don't remember. Yeah, the science behind it, or how long for

163
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.180
Hmm.

164
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I'm going to, I'm going to teach it to you. We're going to do it together.

165
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do it right now. I'm just going to be teaching it. But if you want to go for it.

166
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.540
Alicia Noedel: You. I've been kind of like doing it this whole time. I don't like seeing if I can

167
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.230
Do

168
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Yeah. So first, exactly. We'll start with the hardest part because I'm from that camp. Let's get the hard part done first hardest part is getting these hands that are on my stomach to move and not my shoulders.

169
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've already been doing it right. So as I inhale through my nose and I'm aware that this, this is going to be expanding like a balloon. It's going to push out

170
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And my hands are going to come out on the inhale.

171
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But look, my shoulder, stay for I was

172
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I'm

173
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: City. Can you feel the difference. It's inhaling and that air is pushing the air into the balloon. Can you feel that

174
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

175
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've already done the hardest part.

176
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me give the full instructions. So it's going to be like this. And again, over time, you can do it however you want to.

177
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But the basic instruction is this, we're going to mindfully. The breathing in through the nose paying attention to the cool air the warm air every little bit we can to get in this moment grounded in our body.

178
00:27:54.330 --> 00:28:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to feel it coming in cool warm, whatever. It's going to go in and I'm gonna feel that that belly expand. I'm going to be doing that for four seconds, so it'd be like this.

179
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'm going to hold the breath for 4321 and

180
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Then hold the breath for four seconds.

181
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't do it. That's fine. Again, doesn't really matter. And then, of course, we'll go back to the inhale and holes, you'll see me doing this when we're actually doing it together. I'll hold 321

182
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do my extra little longer than I can. Anything else, kinda like Nextel nice and long.

183
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But my holding out only really, I only really want to do it for like two seconds. But while I'm teaching it. We'll do it. We'll do it the right way.

184
00:28:47.880 --> 00:29:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to find your own groove that works for you. So the inhale through the nose for for hold your breath for for the exhale for four seconds. Hold that breath out for four seconds. Then inhale through the nose and expanding the belly.

185
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do it together and

186
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He can turn. It's a lovely ceiling. I think it's fantastic event, maybe needs a little cleaning, but

187
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I just clean my in the bathroom. So now I'm thinking about things.

188
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I want to see more of your body and less of your home.

189
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

190
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can see a little bit of the of the sort of that lower part maybe moving here and there, hope.

191
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, we're gonna

192
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ready. You're going to do this nice autumn exhale just better

193
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.570
Yeah, totally.

194
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

195
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I can hear when that exhales out and then we can kind of against just do a really obvious exhale

196
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.830
Exhale, all the air.

197
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and Now inhale through the nose.

198
00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale out.

199
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: NICE IF I CAN ALL yourself. Good, good, good. Hold 321 inhale belly.

200
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Good hold 321 push all out.

201
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale through the nose. There we go. There it is good and hold 321 exhale out.

202
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice BlackBerry. Get rid of all that air all that get rid of it good and hold 321 inhale.

203
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring their into their belly.

204
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good, good. Hold 321 as hell it out.

205
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 inhale.

206
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale

207
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale through the nose.

208
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold good 321 exhale it all out. And I'm going to stop talking and you're going to keep the county inside your head.

209
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.080
Good.

210
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to count quietly on your own. Keep doing it. But this time on your own without my help.

211
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to notice internally what's going on. What is your mind to. What is your body do, what are you noticing.

212
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.030
Alicia Noedel: Oh stillness.

213
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:40.650
Alicia Noedel: Right.

214
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.470
Alicia Noedel: Kind of like euphoria euphoric in a way

215
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.590
Alicia Noedel: My body feels relax.

216
00:32:52.470 --> 00:33:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's science, you could have fun in the beginning, this is a bunch of yoga nonsense and I don't want, I came here for some cognitive behavioral work and this woman's off her rocker

217
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I hey I'm ready to hear it. I'm ready to hear it because this is stuff that right in formal training, they don't train this when you go to school, my own talk about this stuff.

218
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But there was a real limitation to what was happening with my client population because most of you guys are so much trauma. History

219
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only developmental trauma, which is what you were just talking about. But on top of that, there's shock trauma those big T traumas ones were were assaulted or we get in car accidents, too. So there's like so much to carry this particular technique.

220
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Tells the body you're in a relaxed body. You are not in danger.

221
00:33:53.370 --> 00:34:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain and one that got activated that little bit of memory that came up was saying yes you are, you're, you're, you're in danger, danger, danger.

222
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to worry. We need to worry about the future. We got to think about the past. And what about now. Now isn't so great. Let's look at our heart, our heart is racing or or we're reading really fast and people identify as having a panic attack like that's how they'll say it.

223
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this does is it does a lot of cool things. It regulates

224
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body gets it all nice and calm and that blood gets to go up here. Now it gets to go to the prefrontal cortex where before it was in large muscle groups. It was in the size

225
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it gets to go to the fingertips. Now they're not cold and numb anymore. We can. We've got blended our toes, and it's also making its way up here where we need it to remember other cool things like

226
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Planning and thinking, Hmm, this really isn't as bad as I thought a second ago, actually. No, I'm fine. We want access to the cool things. Maybe you're going to learn in here, you might have

227
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Some new techniques that you learn in or personally or you might have a mantra that you really, really fall in love with and you'll be able to remember it.

228
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to need time to remember it, because the speed with which that body responds right gets you activated it moves lightning speed long before it gets up here and you can remember some cool stuff. So we need time that breath gives you the time you need

229
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's probably going to come before everything if you can remember that one thing all the other stuff will come in, you'll remember them will come online or frontal lobe will come online where Migdal a habit hijacking us before. Okay.

230
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yay.

231
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and look what you did. You've got to feel calm, even though just seconds ago minutes go

232
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There was all that remembering this other stuff.

233
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. If you forget

234
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to check on your baby or anything.

235
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.560
Alicia Noedel: I need to get my phone charger real quick.

236
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.280
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, cuz my phone just said it was dying. So I gotta hurry.

237
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.790
Alicia Noedel: Maybe can you bring me my charger.

238
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.710
Alicia Noedel: The last one.

239
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.610
Alicia Noedel: I don't know if you heard me.

240
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I heard you just great wish I were there and manatee. I got a nice long one.

241
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that long though.

242
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.160
Alicia Noedel: From Florida. DO YOU MAKE NEW TO NEW MEXICO might be a little too short.

243
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a high demand that got you might be asking, just a little too much.

244
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:53.910
Alicia Noedel: I'm sure itself.

245
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.620
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

246
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.660
Alicia Noedel: Ah, sorry. Good.

247
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, hey, you have no idea. I get concussions. I would say about three times a day, you're going to drop me on my head. You are gonna you're gonna like not keep me charged, you can do all kinds of things.

248
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.610
Today,

249
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.190
I don't take it personally.

250
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

251
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

252
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: He's learned something really important you've learned

253
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body's hopefully get this, that it's on your side.

254
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body was on your side, your mind was on your side when it got activated got anxious got nervous and it notice that something was often wrong and scary and bad it was on your side then to protect you. It also has it's a self healing system.

255
00:37:49.620 --> 00:38:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what we're tapping into right now. Okay. And also we can also, this was a bottom up activity, which means we're working at the body and we're telling the brain. Hey, I've got something to contribute here. It's not just you. So you think it's always about you. What about us. Right.

256
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, I have a space or buying takes up at this part, it's all, it's all, it's all about you. Okay, well we acknowledged the rest of our body has some wisdom to

257
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But the other thing we can do is we can do top down. So with with this ability we get to maybe have a positive self talk or reframe, we might say our mantra.

258
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get to one that works for you and it's different for everyone.

259
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a common theme that often happens with people with we take a layer off we dig a little deeper. Take another layer off. Take another layer. Let's get to the real truth of it, so I won't be surprised if it's very similar to what a lot of people come to

260
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can answer this question.

261
00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What is true about you that you were born with that has nothing to do with your performance has nothing to do with whether you made breakfast made money went to school got up at all slept in has nothing to do with performance. What is true about you.

262
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.240
Alicia Noedel: I'm still a person

263
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, I'm a person.

264
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.240
Alicia Noedel: Nobody's perfect. Everybody

265
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.410
Alicia Noedel: Has their days.

266
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Person. So you went the opposite would be

267
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.530
Alicia Noedel: I'm not a robot.

268
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay, so I'm, I'm a human.

269
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But is there anything

270
00:39:50.070 --> 00:40:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's a touch more spirituality to touch more that you're not just not a robot. You're also a huge or anything that we can add to that. I'm a person. So I am

271
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm born with this. I was born. See if you can finish that sentence. I was born, despite how people treated you. That's very different

272
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.060
Alicia Noedel: And how you very loving okay very loving. Yeah.

273
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I am loving

274
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.600
Alicia Noedel: Empathetic yeah

275
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We want it short and sweet. So I like the I like the I'm loving, is it also true.

276
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Because loving is a verb outward. Right. It's like I'm loving this person I am pathetic. I care about this other it's other it's this verb outward

277
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you also born lovable.

278
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.690
Alicia Noedel: I don't. I mean, I think so.

279
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.430
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

280
00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I only care about what you think. So if it's true, but you're going to know if you say it. So, see what happens and check in with your body to because it might register. This is holy.

281
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Cow like it. So make sure you check in with you okay and see what happens if you say this out loud.

282
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I was born lovable.

283
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And see, see where that lands. When you say that statement out loud. Just give it a try. When you're ready,

284
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.960
Alicia Noedel: I was born lovable.

285
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:31.590
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

286
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That seems true

287
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see the difference between I wasn't treated

288
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: in a loving way.

289
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It doesn't matter.

290
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And not in not in this discussion. I was still born lovable. I am lovable.

291
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

292
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just hold on to that for just a second, because that might be something we could work with in the future in general.

293
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In your day to day life, you're just kind of doing your thing, interacting with people texting calling TV interacting doing once a situation that tends to activate some of those memories that we just, we just kind of pulled up

294
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Remind you of, kind of a crummy start in life, what what triggers that

295
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.530
Alicia Noedel: The winter.

296
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:44.880
Alicia Noedel: The cold. I remember, like, you know, having a jacket. A lot of the times during the winter. I had like really thin little sweater.

297
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.240
Alicia Noedel: And so like the cold always like of the breeze on my face.

298
00:42:48.750 --> 00:43:08.700
Alicia Noedel: So I remember I would take a shower in the morning and walk to school. And by the time I got to school, my hair would be like frozen. Yeah. And so like the wind of like the winter like snow Enos, I can just feel it reminds me of it. I'm looking at my daughter.

299
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.480
Alicia Noedel: And wanting to, you know, give her something better.

300
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.510
Alicia Noedel: And just like remembering things that happened to me and like thinking, you know, I don't want her to go through that. Okay, or whatever, you know,

301
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And almost right now there's is present, the intensity

302
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:29.310
Alicia Noedel: Looks

303
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of its present right now.

304
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.950
Alicia Noedel: And it's very intense for me. Yeah, it is.

305
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is an opportunity

306
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to use a couple of things just first time we're meeting. Okay. That first one doesn't count. That was just a bunch of questions, but this is really the first time you and I are really making contact. Okay.

307
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When you meet those moments, what I invite you to do.

308
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to do the breathing and when you do the breathing include

309
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I am lovable.

310
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I was born this way and see what happens.

311
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And that'll be our first behavior experiment.

312
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to come back and you'll tell me what happened. I have some hypotheses. But we won't really know until you go out into the world and you do it right, I welcome all of it. There's no way to do being a client wrong.

313
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't do your part wrong meaning.

314
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That mantra. I forgot that one or I forgot to do both. La Roche asked me to do this, that's fine too. There's no way you can do what you're doing wrong. It's just impossible. You're just it's impossible.

315
00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It will work in your favor better if you do these little experiments in it will move it along.

316
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But either way, it's still going to inform our next step. If it's forgotten. Okay, let's look at that. Oh, I did it. And it worked. Some of the time. Oh, let's look at that. It's all what's called grist for the mill. It's all interesting and relevant to me.

317
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I got nauseous. I want to know I grind my teeth. I started doing it worse. He started having nightmares. Boy, I started

318
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't have dreams before

319
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Like so irritable.

320
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: With people, whatever it is that comes up. I want to know. It's all interesting and relevant

321
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So no sort of editing there. I'm interested. There's no way

322
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You just can't get it wrong. Okay, the part you could rob yourself of treatment. However, if you try to please me

323
00:45:54.750 --> 00:46:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's that there, which a lot of people do. They're like, I know what she wants to hear my see what she's up to shoot a little angles, try and sneak around

324
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: On my so smart I'm smart to I'll show her all leader to it. If you do that,

325
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting. I'll probably notice it. And that's okay. But you might be robbing yourself of an opportunity of healing. You don't have to look good. Here you can be a mess.

326
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be a hot mess. And I'm going to be here. I'm going to show up and I'm going to do my best to do my job. You don't have to do mine. You just do you okay

327
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I want you to come away from this treatment with all the skills that I have if I could cram them all into 60 minutes I give them to you, but it takes time, and some of them are experiential which means there. But this kind of slow Groove thing that

328
00:46:53.640 --> 00:47:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't. You can't just say here go think this go do this, there lived truth and they'll, they'll take some time.

329
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

330
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little check in here. Um, what was today like for you. What are you going to come away with today that's important for you, even if there was something that that occurred to you or an experience that is important to you.

331
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.530
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I'm for this.

332
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah today.

333
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:29.370
Alicia Noedel: I think that, that'll help a lot with the breathing exercises.

334
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:43.170
Alicia Noedel: Just because I I start to get overwhelmed. Just in everyday life, things like so. I mean, I am willing to try anything to

335
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:48.540
Alicia Noedel: Just kind of not be so scared to live my life.

336
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's right. I mean, I want that for you to be in any given moment to have

337
00:47:55.830 --> 00:48:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Access to all the resources that the rest of us have. I don't want you to be limited.

338
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. And so we're putting two things together, you probably sounds like you probably remember the breathing. That sounds like it the cognitive part if it turns out that I'm

339
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lovable isn't the mantra. That's going to stick for you and pay attention to what is true.

340
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:29.280
Alicia Noedel: Maybe I could play around and think to myself, you know, because it's one of those things where it's like, oh, you know, I've never really thought of that before.

341
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:30.000
You know,

342
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:37.170
Alicia Noedel: I just feel like when you have so many like problems with like people telling you that you know

343
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:59.130
Alicia Noedel: No one loves you, you're this, you're that you know from being an abusive relationship you stop giving yourself compliments and so when someone asks you, what's great about you. It's kind of hard to think about that, you know, so maybe I'll find one that fits better. Yep. Before we talk again.

344
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Oh, I love it. Make it deeply personal and sometimes

345
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.830
Alicia Noedel: We get

346
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we want to go by rejecting this one. Oh, that one stunk Yu Shu food that was pretty close. Hey, that was a new still not quite right. So by process of elimination. So we're starting with I was born lovable that might not be the one where you settle into this notion of I'm. Oh, okay.

347
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This in this moment. So you have a breathing that saying I'm okay. And what I want is also the top the brain going

348
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:39.180
Alicia Noedel: I'm okay, I need a lot more of that.

349
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.380
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. So you've been having a lot of anxiety lately.

350
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to schedule another appointment with you.

351
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:56.940
Okay.

352
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you have anxiety how you identify anxiety. Pay attention to hide. You know, it is my heart's beating

353
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm crying. I have worrying about the future. Look at my mind it's the same science team one over there it is again.

354
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it. I'm interested, bring it in here. You can journal. And if you want to you can always have time in your life, that kind of thing you could send me an email with a whole bunch of thoughts. It's going to inform us and move us along the more I understand what's going on with you.

355
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

356
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We originally had

357
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.100
Time.

358
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.960
Alicia Noedel: You know, there's one for 745 this coming week

359
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

360
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:55.980
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

361
00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When I put that

362
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:05.970
Alicia Noedel: Eight o'clock, what you said to clock in at 730 or 745 I think it might be March nine, go see because I have my little book to

363
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: March 9 is in the morning. Oh my gosh.

364
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.210
Alicia Noedel: We got the right date.

365
00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We totally have it figured out already. Yes, it's next Monday. Oh, that's great because

366
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's real nice quick

367
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:21.690
Alicia Noedel: Turnaround

368
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Will meet and then yes, it's at eight o'clock, which

369
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Means you log in a little bit before

370
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll have this nice long period of time. I have a group at nine someone right before you, but I should be able to have that whole full piece will sit there and we'll take a look at whether you remember to do the the belly breathing.

371
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you were able to come

372
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Up positive mantra for yourself.

373
00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:53.880
Alicia Noedel: Okay affirmation. So yeah, for me.

374
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's gotta be. It's gotta be

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So kind of bring me up to speed. I feel like there's been a fair amount of distance and time somehow from us kind of meeting on a regular basis. So I feel a little bit like that, um,

412
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anything gotten worse better on the family front, has there been more contact with Brother, or father or like

413
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:21.000
Tomas Valdez: No, no, no, I've just been spending a lot of time with my mom since since my grandma passed and she's having a really hard time so I'm just making it a point to go spend time with her and make sure she's not alone.

414
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was her mom. Yeah.

417
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know how close you were to her.

418
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:43.680
Yeah.

419
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:45.570
Tomas Valdez: Homer.

420
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Was she ill over this last bit. And so there's been this awareness.

421
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:55.020
Tomas Valdez: Know, she was, she was old, she was 98 years old.

422
00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there was a right. I'm on more time here, kind of thing.

423
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:06.600
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, he just she's had like a like a stroke, out of nowhere and then it turned into pneumonia.

424
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.480
Tomas Valdez: Don't know much other stuff so

425
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:10.950
Yeah.

426
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:13.290
Tomas Valdez: I don't know.

427
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:20.850
Tomas Valdez: But I was the first time I'd ever seen anybody like watched somebody die like like

428
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:28.260
Tomas Valdez: Watch them like take their like last breaths and everything like that. I was kind of, I wish I wouldn't have. Well, I wish I wouldn't have been there for that.

429
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:29.550
Yeah.

430
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you saw that

431
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:41.580
Tomas Valdez: That's interesting. The whole thing I was if the entire thing. I wouldn't from everybody being hopeful because it was all of her numbers were climbing and the doctor was like oh my god like she's gonna

432
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:51.870
Tomas Valdez: Like it was kind of messed up like the doctors kind of put like a false hope and everybody like Oh, like, it looks like she's gonna pull off a miracle. And then I'm going to none and know

433
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:58.050
Tomas Valdez: It because their numbers were like climbing, like all of a sudden, and like her blood pressure was stabilizing her her

434
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:09.030
Tomas Valdez: Heart rate was climbing like everything stabilizing and then. So I started telling that to my mom, I think that kind of gave her a really false open so she was really lead. Now, it didn't happen you know

435
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're meeting with her like kind of swinging by the House like unannounced or they're scheduled visits. How is it. Oh.

436
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:33.330
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I mean, because I'm since I'm taking Spanish right now and I'm going over there and having her helped me, you know, and even though I can do it myself. But I'm having her just helped me, you know, I mean, just so she can feel

437
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:46.650
Tomas Valdez: Useful, basically, you know, I mean, I thought, that's a big thing with her. She's, she's constantly been busy her entire life. So for her to be stagnant at any point in her life is just the worst thing on earth for her.

438
00:57:47.760 --> 00:58:00.030
Tomas Valdez: Like, I guarantee that's that's half of it with my man, obviously, her mother passing is a huge part of it, but being stagnant for her is. Oh, like that's like earth shattering for my mom.

439
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: To be busy busy busy busy busy.

440
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:13.320
Tomas Valdez: She's been used to taking care of my autistic sister her my entire life. And then she passed, and then I got her from my motorcycle accident.

441
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:28.470
Tomas Valdez: And then, but in but she got sick. And then she got sick because of kidding worried from that so she had to take her to go take care of herself and then take care of my grandma now. And yeah, it's just constantly been her. I don't know.

442
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you tomorrow when you get to spend time with her. How is it feeling for you to be around her just on your side of it.

443
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:39.870
Tomas Valdez: I'm gonna

444
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:51.270
Tomas Valdez: I'm so damn guilty doing this and suck. Like, I went on. But I asked her to print something up for me. And she did. She's been snapping a lot me like since that since I am a passionate Muslim snapping a lot at me.

445
00:58:52.230 --> 00:59:02.550
Tomas Valdez: And I finally, I was just like, stop, stop, snapping at me. I'm like, I'm the old adage, if you're not, if you haven't noticed on the only one that's here for you right now.

446
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:14.250
Tomas Valdez: I'm the only one here, and the only one that cares. Mom, I'm here for. I'm here for you. Like I 100% sympathize for you, but it's not okay for you to yell at me and treat me like this is not okay.

447
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:20.850
Tomas Valdez: I don't, please like quit. Please quit, yo. Yeah, I mean, treat me bad, like I'm here for you. I'm treating nice

448
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:29.610
Tomas Valdez: And she and she apologized. She's like, I know she's like I because she like she walked in the other day, like I was just sit there. Do you have a homework and she walked in the other day.

449
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:37.950
Tomas Valdez: Because they took a little bit longer time to make the pizza that actually offered and stopping you know get pizza whatever for the study for the same time.

450
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:47.010
Tomas Valdez: And it took longer than then, you know, then they then they said, and she walked in, she through the pizza at me like, literally, like through that me

451
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:58.920
Tomas Valdez: And I was like, whoa. I'm like, What the hell, and then so she apologized for that. And then you start yelling at me again. So, yeah. So then I was just then I kind of felt I had to tell her to stop it and I don't know. And I felt really bad about it but

452
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.460
Tomas Valdez: I know what she's going through right now so i don't i don't know i got i don't know if i was in the right for telling her to stop doing that or not.

453
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me

454
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.660
Tomas Valdez: Well, like I felt like

455
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.850
Tomas Valdez: I felt like it insensitive jerk kind of

456
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come at it from a different angle. Okay.

457
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, if you had said it a little differently. Instead of the behavior request up front.

458
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When she tell me if you use the structure of I feel when she tell me

459
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How you were feeling

460
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When she was snapping in you.

461
01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel so pretend I'm her for a second.

462
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:42.840
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

463
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.190
I feel

464
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.350
Tomas Valdez: See if you can identify

465
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: One word see what that one word. If you were forced to pick one.

466
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.080
Tomas Valdez: That's a tough word that's

467
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:56.490
Tomas Valdez: You know it's it's not offended.

468
01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:05.490
Tomas Valdez: But I mean, in a way it is, it's not it's not offend. It's not betrayed, it's, I don't know. This is a hard word to find

469
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Go, nice and slow. We've just eliminated. So there's a bit of like

470
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To it.

471
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:16.800
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, kind of. It's like I'm like i've been i've

472
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.390
Tomas Valdez: Not only been

473
01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying for us.

474
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.200
Tomas Valdez: Since it happened, but I've been I was the only one now.

475
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if you can keep working at feeling words you can get to it.

476
01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:31.620
Tomas Valdez: Okay.

477
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for real amount. So try them on, say, Mom, I feel blank. When you keeps being short tempered with me. So mom I feel blank. When you like

478
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:45.330
Tomas Valdez: Mom, I feel like I don't want to be around you.

479
01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.020
Tomas Valdez: Know,

480
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This is tricky. Yeah, you said like so you know you went into storytelling there so that third word can't be that and it can't be like

481
01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:57.090
Tomas Valdez: Good.

482
01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To great

483
01:01:59.760 --> 01:01:59.910
And

484
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.400
Tomas Valdez: You're again with it. I'm

485
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:14.610
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, like be true betrayed, I guess, I don't know, like not not purchase. Now it's it's not be trail. I don't know what the word is. It's like

486
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:24.150
Tomas Valdez: I don't know what would be the words. It's like I'm I'm here for you but you're yelling at me like you're like what I don't know that word would be

487
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Like tell us. Let's come from a different place.

488
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come at it more from from the body wants you to picture what was going on in the home when she was doing that you were coming there because you kind of

489
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Register. She likes to be helpful. I can, I can review my Spanish. It's like I could be doing both. And you get to be with your mom to you were sacrificing something for her right trying to picture how the body feels even thinking about this.

490
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Here I am trying to be of service you're snapping at me.

491
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:05.460
Sure.

492
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.290
Tomas Valdez: I felt shocked. I feel sad. I felt

493
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:22.380
Tomas Valdez: just dumbfounded curious like I just, I couldn't. I was I was trying to put to get her thought process in my head, and I couldn't do it. No, it was bugging me

494
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so here. Interesting. So here's what we've got, try these on. So it'd be something like, Mom, I'm surprised and sad that you're

495
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of being short with me and impatient or you through that we were better off if you don't even interpret the behavior but you through the pizza me

496
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See if that feels true try it on so fine, mom, what do you say

497
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:54.390
Tomas Valdez: I'm

498
01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:56.370
Tomas Valdez: asking you is

499
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.990
Tomas Valdez: I feel, Oh, I feel

500
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.210
Tomas Valdez: I feel upset that you do the pizza at me and

501
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's be more precise.

502
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.160
Tomas Valdez: I know I'm trying, I'm trying to think of that word I'm trying to

503
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about confused.

504
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.210
Tomas Valdez: Yes, that would be yes. There you go. I'm

505
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:36.240
Tomas Valdez: Trying to do 100% computers. I was done about it exactly dumbfounded. Like I just, I couldn't understand it. My Brother Mike my brain couldn't process what was going on. Right. It's really using me

506
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't match up. I'm doing something nice. I'm getting negative behavior. It's confusing.

507
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.350
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, exactly. Like I my brain couldn't put the two and two together, it's like, wow, I'm like, I'm

508
01:04:46.920 --> 01:05:02.160
Tomas Valdez: Like I'm putting aside my own plans tying everything because I want to go here and try to make help my mom make her feel better and help her feel better, cuz I don't like I don't like for her to feel bad and she is, you know, no.

509
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:02.910
Tomas Valdez: He means he

510
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Asked you to come over to take care of her.

511
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:06.930
Tomas Valdez: Know,

512
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.270
Tomas Valdez: She knows she knows what I'm doing, though she 100% knows what I'm doing.

513
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know that, but she didn't know why she was thinking snippy. How do you know that part.

514
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.700
Tomas Valdez: Well, now she's kind of acknowledged it, I think, and

515
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:35.250
Tomas Valdez: I just I just, I've been around my mom for 37 years I know how I know what my mom likes. You know what I mean, I know that my mom loves be busy. I know I'm on love is being

516
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:44.520
Tomas Valdez: Felt like she's useful and being helpful to the situation, you know, I mean, and that's I know that's what like that's what she feeds off of

517
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:55.650
Tomas Valdez: So I know going in and getting that help from her in Spanish. I know that really helps take her mind off of everything that's all I know. I know for those for those for that hour and a half, two hours that we're working on that.

518
01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:58.980
Tomas Valdez: My grandma is not even in her mind and that makes me feel good.

519
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you didn't feel confident about your interpretation around her short temper.

520
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can analyze that that didn't make any sense.

521
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To you.

522
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.090
Tomas Valdez: Right.

523
01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that because you've never seen your mom be short tempered

524
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:25.020
Tomas Valdez: It's been very rare. Yeah. Like, it's very rare. I've seen my mom short tempered in my life.

525
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:36.900
Tomas Valdez: I shoot shoot like she wasn't this banker. My dad was this banker, you know, I mean, she was like, I like my raise your voice at you at the very worst way to your day get so

526
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So your in your life. There's been like a handful of times. She's been impatient.

527
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:48.720
Tomas Valdez: No, I mean, of course, everybody gets impatient, but it's it's a very uncommon thing for her.

528
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:59.490
Tomas Valdez: She's an extremely patient person right so that's what was really shocking to me is that how patient. I know she has an outpatient I know she can be

529
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:16.110
Tomas Valdez: And that she couldn't have that like it's like she lost patience with me. Like, I tried to help her. And she's like losing patience with me. I'm like, I don't get that like you. You are one was patient person on Earth. And I'm helping you and Lucy Asians. Let me get this

530
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so tell me you were

531
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted. I know it seems really silly how precise I'm getting into this. But what were you doing like right at that moment where she lost it. What were you doing when you said you were helping her like

532
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember what you did. Right before she maybe was snippy

533
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.560
Tomas Valdez: Hey mom was going just greeter was it

534
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And she did what

535
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:49.230
Tomas Valdez: She walked in the in the duck.

536
01:07:50.940 --> 01:08:05.580
Tomas Valdez: Just do the pizza box at me. I'm like, Whoa, shit, am I showing up at me, but like, how come he will kind of me. Like I wouldn't like duck or dodge. But yeah, flew like right in between the laptop and me and landed on the and landed on the on the table. I was like, Whoa, shit.

537
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't want to order the pizza.

538
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:19.020
Tomas Valdez: No, I did. I did. She but she she called she asked me to call to call in. So it would be ready for when she got there.

539
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:34.080
Tomas Valdez: And so I did, I call it, I call them 15 minutes ahead but they must it up and they gave they gave away our pizza to somebody else and then may to the pizzas in front of ours, while she was sitting there waiting and then she kind of just lost her patients, which is good for her.

540
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.990
Tomas Valdez: I mean, obviously I would get upset, too.

541
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:37.620
But

542
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Throwing it someone is really

543
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.630
Over the top

544
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:45.180
Tomas Valdez: Okay, I mean,

545
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:55.320
Tomas Valdez: No, but she even recognize it and this this second time now that yesterday that I went over there, me and I, and when I finally told her you know that, please just stop it.

546
01:08:55.830 --> 01:09:04.290
Tomas Valdez: She's like, You know, I'm sorry. And then she recognized the whole pizza throwing things that, you know, sorry for that I was totally. I'm sorry. Another that

547
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:11.340
Tomas Valdez: She's like, but I'm not being that way with you right now. I'm not being that way with you right now. I'm like, Yes, you are. I'm like,

548
01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:23.040
Tomas Valdez: I would I be saying anything if if you weren't I came over here in peace. I came over here to pick up a piece of paper and believe. And you're sitting here going off on me, like, what's that

549
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:25.260
Tomas Valdez: And

550
01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.650
Tomas Valdez: I'm like, and I like I was like, Mom, like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Like, I understand you're under a lot of stress.

551
01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:38.130
Tomas Valdez: And I totally sympathize with you and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened, obviously, like I feel bad, too.

552
01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:49.530
Tomas Valdez: But that doesn't make it okay for you that way towards me like I'm like, I love you to death. I'm here for you. Obviously I'm obviously here for you. But please don't act that way towards me. That's all I said

553
01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:58.740
Tomas Valdez: That's exactly how I said it. I didn't. But then, and then I came home and I felt like a complete douche bag for even bringing it up like that.

554
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: did when you said it just like that. Did you How did she respond to me just hear what she said.

555
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:22.740
Tomas Valdez: She lost your breath for a second. And that's how I knew that really affected or that and that's what in my heart just my heart just sunk into my stomach and I felt like a piece of junk and I knew that. I knew that Herder not Herbie yeah I'm sorry to Tierra sorry

556
01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:28.620
Tomas Valdez: Um, I noticed that, and I know it hurt or so, it hurt me.

557
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.690
Tomas Valdez: So,

558
01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.110
Tomas Valdez: That sucked. And I came home and I felt really guilty about it.

559
01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.860
Tomas Valdez: Sorry taxing I'm sorry edited a

560
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

561
01:10:46.590 --> 01:11:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going through a once, maybe twice in a lifetime experience right of losing a parent like this. Maybe she hasn't already lost another sort of cared, or this is a really rare exceptional time

562
01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:06.240
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

563
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:18.330
Tomas Valdez: In that yeah and that's why I felt that maybe I was like, damn it, I was like, maybe I was callous about it and not understanding about it as as much as I should have been

564
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what I don't know about you is whether you are familiar with other ways to hold space for someone. So for example, we can use me for

565
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the recipient of a lot of emotions. I am sometimes the recipient of anger.

566
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hold that. And I have to just hold it.

567
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't say, How dare you. I'm here to help you. Right. I

568
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But there that takes a skill.

569
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think we'll keep it out here with me for a second. What do you think that I have that makes it possible for me to hold someone being really like I'm straight up rude to me like I mean you haven't probably seen it too much, but I'm the recipient of it.

570
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I have, do you think that makes it possible for me to

571
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerate it sit with it, not get confused or

572
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.430
Tomas Valdez: Say, stop it. Patience.

573
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.200
I have patience.

574
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.540
Tomas Valdez: Patience and

575
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.780
Tomas Valdez: I don't know, probably feeling that

576
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.960
Tomas Valdez: You don't want to sing to their level maybe

577
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sync to their level. Hmm, okay.

578
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:48.300
All right.

579
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think I believe about myself that makes that possible to remain like this just sort of

580
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Still with my posture open sort of saying, Tell me more. You know that being the posture. What do you think I believe about myself.

581
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.410
Tomas Valdez: You're confident about yourself, probably

582
01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In what I believe what

583
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:17.880
Tomas Valdez: Just that you know I'm

584
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.960
Tomas Valdez: Not everybody's right that I'm

585
01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:25.830
Tomas Valdez: Like

586
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.860
Tomas Valdez: I should I lost my train of thought.

587
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's easy to do. This is pretty complicated, so it will help if you actually look at me. So I want you to look at me. Okay.

588
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's say you were angry and

589
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You needed me to just sort of keep it together over here.

590
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what I need to believe in myself in order to hold space for you.

591
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:59.160
Tomas Valdez: If I was, if I'm angry at you.

592
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I need to do to basically take care of you, but I like the whole space better. I'd rather phrase it like that. What do I need to believe in myself. I know I show up confident

593
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And

594
01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:15.720
Tomas Valdez: Be careful and selective about the words that you use, I guess.

595
01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm

596
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.030
Tomas Valdez: Using word

597
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on about what I believe about me around someone who's being hostile. What do I believe about me.

598
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard some really hard thing to get to

599
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:42.210
Tomas Valdez: Yeah yeah

600
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, watch, watch the opposite.

601
01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:45.210
Tomas Valdez: Let's see.

602
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens when I do this, you know, you need to knock it off and show me some respect. I'm doing nothing but coming in here and being helpful. Stop.

603
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.620
Tomas Valdez: Okay, yeah, it seems, also.

604
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so when someone's hostile. So now watch in that scenario, what do I think

605
01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: About myself right now I am. What do you know that one. So go the opposite and see if we can get there from here.

606
01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:15.870
Tomas Valdez: I'm being abused.

607
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:17.430
Tomas Valdez: Person.

608
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being attacked.

609
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if I'm defensive and I scratched back. I'm saying, step back, no more closer

610
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being attacked. I defend myself and I use words. What am I gonna do can't punch.

611
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So there we go. So now okay we got it I'm

612
01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.020
In danger.

613
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I perceived threat.

614
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, wait. There we go. Now let's walk it backwards. Now, note, my hands are actually open

615
01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't talk like that.

616
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Now go here. Now really, see if you can find it for me to be able to do this to hold space for you if you're impatient irritable hurting sad scared, all of that. What do I need to believe in myself.

617
01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Try looking at me. I know it's hard because you're trying to remember words and stuff but trying to

618
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:30.960
Tomas Valdez: tether back by looking at maybe you that

619
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:41.040
Tomas Valdez: Me that this person's here trying to help me. I don't know, I just, I don't know that I don't like.

620
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, look at me. What do you think I'm thinking right now.

621
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:54.870
Tomas Valdez: I have no idea.

622
01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at me again. Well, what do we know it's not

623
01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:09.240
Tomas Valdez: I'm kind of not understanding. Like what's your, what's your what you mean. Okay.

624
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so just that's why I'm saying for you to look at because this is actually it's not quite the role play it's it's happening right now I'm here and I'm holding space for you right now. I'm holding space for confusion because you're confused. Right.

625
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it look like

626
01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking

627
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what is what's your best guess. What do you think I'm thinking

628
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:40.800
Tomas Valdez: Like really, are you really coming at me like this like now. Like, seriously.

629
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think I'm a little impatient like surprised and impatient, a little

630
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.560
Tomas Valdez: You do. I kind of like, like a little bit maybe by

631
01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:54.390
Like

632
01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.020
Tomas Valdez: Oh,

633
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.290
Tomas Valdez: Shoot. I'm

634
01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.910
Tomas Valdez: So wait, remember you had it before you kind of

635
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.860
Tomas Valdez: Why I'm trying to find the word I'm going crazy.

636
01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay well number. Let's go back to the one you know, you know, right. What if if instead I was saying, You need to stop it. You knew, I'm being attacked. If I was showing up hostile and angry, probably, I'm thinking I'm being attacked. So now, real

637
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:28.260
Tomas Valdez: Quick. What do I

638
01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.150
Tomas Valdez: Like what do I think like she was thinking when I told her that type thing.

639
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That hard, it's just you and I. Right. Although all that work.

640
01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here with me.

641
01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Hey gets really complicated. That's why I'm just saying let's just use me for now. So we know for sure if I'm here going, listen.

642
01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to get it together. I mean, she just say what I need. And no, we're not gonna do any of that and stop it if I do that, you already identified earlier.

643
01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm obviously feeling attacked because I'd be hostile right and I'm thinking I'm in danger, what's the opposite. If my arms are actually like this, and my tone is like this. And I'm holding space for you. What do you think

644
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.390
Tomas Valdez: Of your arms like this and

645
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.260
Tomas Valdez: What I believe about really then

646
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:24.120
Tomas Valdez: Yeah okay they're down like your, your arms are open like that then then and then

647
01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:28.680
Tomas Valdez: What else do you have to say like

648
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sugar should get the hands

649
01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: On. Sure. Yes, you're getting confused with the hands down. That is forget that that's throwing you off. What's the opposite of I'm in

650
01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:40.740
Tomas Valdez: Danger.

651
01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And now look at me me hands are down.

652
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.410
Because you got a little confused.

653
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm safe. That's beautiful. Look at me. My hands are down.

654
01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm saying

655
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:58.470
Tomas Valdez: No, you're fine. You don't look like you don't look offended. You don't look like. Yeah.

656
01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm safe. So what's changed on the outside the environment of pizza throwing and short tempered hasn't changed, but I've changed what I'm thinking.

657
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I've changed. I'm safe.

658
01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff.

659
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not a threat to me.

660
01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I can do.

661
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want that for you to us, the kind of power that comes from realizing that you're safe in any given moment.

662
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to rock your world. When you get it, and you're going to know it in a deep way.

663
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You were safe with your mother to do did not feel that way.

664
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt attacked

665
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And utterly confused about the attack.

666
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.690
Tomas Valdez: No, actually I will use the word betrayed. Actually, I will use that word. That's how that's how I felt.

667
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

668
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.870
Tomas Valdez: That word

669
01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:07.800
Tomas Valdez: Because I've tried so hard and and to be yelled at, like that. It's like

670
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.450
Tomas Valdez: I don't know.

671
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:19.290
Tomas Valdez: Like sad like like sadly betrayed. I guess like not hostile he betrayed, but like sad like that you would do that to me after. Yeah.

672
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you that word. No, no, no, this word. I'm glad you're kind of saying, and again, there is a huge neural network around that word huge stories, lots of them and big ones for you.

673
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.130
Tomas Valdez: Wrong which which word

674
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:41.940
Betrayed

675
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.040
Tomas Valdez: Oh, yeah.

676
01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:45.330
Yeah.

677
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:48.990
Yeah.

678
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one that needs to work in here between you and I. That's the one. When you can loosen that one up and you don't go there.

679
01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're going to get

680
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but that's because it's I think it's just sort of this this space inside of you that

681
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have connections to other positive images other positive and I don't know if it's just truly organic

682
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: When this developed, I don't know, but that word right there. It's amazing. If I pulled out the video. They don't keep them anymore. They used to keep them for a year.

683
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If we pull them out and we ran them through. I bet you'd save betrayed almost every time we really when we get into family stuff when we get to talking that word would get used. That's how frequently, it is weaved in inter personally like the notion of being betrayed again.

684
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to love. Again, you don't wanna it's big.

685
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.000
Tomas Valdez: For you.

686
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:57.930
Tomas Valdez: Or you want to make friends like I'm okay being all by myself because I'm I've been you know I'm saying, like, I felt like that let down and be like, I'm okay. I used to be.

687
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:13.710
Tomas Valdez: extremely depressed about being by myself all the time. But I'm getting to the point that like I'm getting used to being by myself all the time. And I'm. To me, it's almost better than getting hurt again and we're being betrayed again or being stolen from are just some just

688
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:17.280
Tomas Valdez: It's just sucks. Like I just people suck.

689
01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: People they do but they're also generous and kind and affectionate and loving an interested by you, they're interested in you and they can see

690
01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You us humans are a mess. We are

691
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not going to be able to skip over wanting to connect with them you happen to be someone not only are you human and we're wired for those social connections, but you happen to be someone that feels it deeply

692
01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're wanting to turn into a robot is just unreasonable, you cannot do it.

693
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

694
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.820
Tomas Valdez: I know

695
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Better off learning the skills of tolerance for that initial onset of that first zap that happens to you.

696
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That part will probably be there for a long time, but it's what you do with it after the fraction of a second after you think, oh, this could be. It's happening again. It's what you do with it.

697
01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right after that can make the difference of whether you stand there in that same seat stay in a conversation

698
01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And not have later on reflection of man, I wish I hadn't said that

699
01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll make all the difference. The meaning that you make out of that just stress in your body and the thought is happening again. I can't tolerate being hurt. Again, I can't

700
01:24:53.220 --> 01:25:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what we do with that that makes the difference of whether someone sticks around wants to stay here with us, it's going to be about how you manage you

701
01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: In the end, it's going to be something like that.

702
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have every right to feel good and happy in this body to not feel this sense of sadness and confusion and betrayal, you have every right to it only differences. We can't change what people are doing all we can do is change the meaning

703
01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it true that you died from betrayal. Is it true.

704
01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Or was it the meaning that you made out of somebody saying they would do something several people and he didn't do it.

705
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I, we make different meaning of it. It is not pure and simple and absolute fact that you and I will feel the sense of betrayal. The same way I might think

706
01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: He had some home training. He was, he wasn't raised right. Oh, she's a nasty little critter. I don't like why I'm around him all defensive it's sarcastic. I don't like I am around her.

707
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm gonna walk over here. I'm gonna go play with these people because I'm like, Boy, I'm they get my funny jokes. You think I'm charming. I'm going to spend time over there, Pat.

708
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't sit here in hurting hurting hurting hurting pardon pardon pardon. Forget about the betrayal. I don't now.

709
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Plenty of people do it your way. Plenty of people do it my way. And then there's a bajillion other ways to do it. But if you don't like how you're doing it. Let's get in there, make some changes so that you can enjoy your days, enjoy your time with your mom to and not be

710
01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Offended not feel betrayed.

711
01:26:51.690 --> 01:27:04.830
Tomas Valdez: And that was part of what I had told her I was like, I like mom like, I'm coming over here like wanting to talk to you why in the hang out with you, like, like let's not talk to each other. This way, like I don't, I don't know. Yeah.

712
01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

713
01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:11.070
Tomas Valdez: But I'm just trying to figure out how to balance everything in my life. It's just

714
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:12.900
Too much

715
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It can seem like it's complicated. But actually, if you really listen I say a lot of the things the same don't, I don't, I repeat myself a lot. Do you ever noticed that

716
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

717
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:31.710
Tomas Valdez: Because I'm trying to hammer it

718
01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so. So sometimes it's new. Sometimes, though,

719
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.970
Tomas Valdez: I mean, you

720
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:40.080
Tomas Valdez: Know I'm saying, like you just you don't you just rephrase it is what I'm saying.

721
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.070
Tomas Valdez: Okay, yeah. Yeah, no, you drive on the same point. I'm just saying you rephrase it.

722
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:45.300
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I guess.

723
01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So there are some stirred particular things that people do that. Get in their own way and one of a common theme is

724
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They go to this sort of all or nothing thinking and or they use emotional reasoning bullet feeling this way, then it must be true. And it's catastrophic and I've gotta defend myself against it.

725
01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It moves very fast lightning speed and if you can put time in there. You might remember a different way.

726
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me just

727
01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry, kind of just put you on hold for just two seconds.

728
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.450
Orange.

729
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what just happened there was

730
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to keep my eye out. I make sure

731
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an emergency that it's taken care of. So just now. You with me.

732
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel a little insulted right now.

733
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

734
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.030
Tomas Valdez: I'm supposed to be.

735
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it would have been a great opportunity. If you did, because then we could be like, see it's happening now and what are you saying yourself.

736
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's

737
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.230
Tomas Valdez: Figure you're our you have

738
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.450
Tomas Valdez: Your work and you have to do. I mean, I'm, I mean, I understand. I'm, I'm your client, but you're working

739
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.300
Tomas Valdez: okay with it. Mm hmm.

740
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:00.480
That's interesting.

741
01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:04.230
Tomas Valdez: All right person.

742
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You are okay.

743
01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But you could have you know that right

744
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.770
Tomas Valdez: Yeah. But no, I like that doesn't bother. I wouldn't have bad didn't bother me at all and Louise, but

745
01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Experiment didn't work.

746
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.170
Tomas Valdez: Oh,

747
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:33.240
Tomas Valdez: No, I was no not at all. You know, you have. That's like, that's work sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have to take a quick call and I understand how it is. I mean, I know.

748
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.150
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

749
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And what if this was your, your mother doing that to you.

750
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What attention to little differently.

751
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:52.020
Tomas Valdez: Um, no, I would have reacted the same way. Okay.

752
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's really you can, and it's the way

753
01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When people are short tempered to you and they're short with you and that pizza thing was way over the top, obviously.

754
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A switch goes off and whatever tolerance.

755
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like

756
01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone.

757
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:24.000
Tomas Valdez: It's gone. I go, that's when I go from one of my mania, things like I go from yeah

758
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.520
Tomas Valdez: Right. And I'm just

759
01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:30.330
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, and unleash the beast inside

760
01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:32.430
Tomas Valdez: That's what

761
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like for you if you're willing to do the the piece about the I'm safe.

762
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're around people that you actually love when love is on the line.

763
01:31:53.430 --> 01:32:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll be really convenient if you can remember to have the thought when they are rude, they're acting in a confusing way.

764
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Vindictive hostile towards you, it would be convenient if you could remember this, but if all that you can remember to do is to say I'm safe. I'm okay.

765
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: In calm moments, that's fine, but it would be lovely. If over, days, weeks, months, you can get in the habit of remembering that because guess what

766
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You are

767
01:32:32.190 --> 01:32:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Are physically safe it is this perception.

768
01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That this little wire that's going on that this behavior that's happening right now. This pizza throwing the short temper.

769
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: will last forever and

770
01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't exactly know what the catastrophic thought is that you're having um I don't deserve it. I know that's one of them I don't deserve this. Right.

771
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know any more thoughts that that support the I deserve to retaliate right now. Do you know any of the other ones that are

772
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:06.270
Tomas Valdez: Connected to it.

773
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.660
Tomas Valdez: I'm sorry you we cut it. We had a buffering.

774
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't

775
01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

776
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone forever.

777
01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I'm asking you to do is, I'm sorry. It's okay if it's any good all remember it again. So what I'm asking you to do is to say that often put it as a screensaver habit on your alarms have little stickers in different places because you get in the habit of going to that.

778
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Dead. I don't deserve this.

779
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're going to like that, you're going to have more time to think something through

780
01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're gonna like the outcome of an interaction with someone and what I was saying earlier, and I don't know when it, when the buffering happened on the video was to

781
01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Really see if you can say it to yourself when you're around people where there's love on the line, which means there's love their I love them, they love me.

782
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad, mom, brother, that kind of thing.

783
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be more difficult to remember. So doing it in really neutral sort of benign times is also I'm inviting you to do that. See if you can be thinking it I'm safe. I'm okay.

784
01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Get in the practice of remembering it. And I wanted you to put stickies around and I wanted you to put it as a little thing on your phone.

785
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the truth of the matter is, some time.

786
01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of the time. So I mean, you've had some pretty crummy stories and I get that most of the time right now you look around the room. You are safe.

787
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to be so vigilant, it does your body and disservice to have that cortisol running on your Oregon's all the time. Okay. Want that body to have a break.

788
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:24.150
Tomas Valdez: But my body like lives off cortisol. At this point, it feels like

789
01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but it's

790
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:28.650
It.

791
01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.550
Tomas Valdez: Feels cortisol more than it feels go for me or serotonin.

792
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:34.530
Tomas Valdez: It's, it's

793
01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not supposed to be flooding all the time. It's not good for the organs really bad for the hippocampus. We're supposed to have a quick flood of it when you've actually actually had actual

794
01:35:46.440 --> 01:36:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Harm to body right you've had a fairly recently in the last six months it belong to their it floods, your real quick so that you can real quick do self preservation action and then it's supposed to leave you have it running so much

795
01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.890
Tomas Valdez: Having a hard time turning it off.

796
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But the ways to do that. One of them is through the top down, which is what I just told you about, which is a thought changing thinking

797
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one is bottom up, which has to do with that breathing. If you're honest with yourself and honest with me, are you doing it before you make a decision to speak.

798
01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.360
Tomas Valdez: No, I didn't.

799
01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Write

800
01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:41.550
Tomas Valdez: I didn't do it.

801
01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.580
Tomas Valdez: But if you are, whatever. Yeah.

802
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:47.010
Tomas Valdez: If I would have done a would have come out a lot differently.

803
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm saying, and you guys want to why having me doing this when I'm not in stress because you'll remember it easier because now I do it so often.

804
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember to do it when someone snotty with me in the supermarket when someone gives me a hard time in the mall when a family member gives me a hard time I'm going to do that before I speak. I've been doing it all day long. I'm more likely to remember to do it.

805
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right when I need it. And then, yeah, I'll say, I feel, or some other skill that you've learned in here with me. It'll be, oh yeah, I can remember that cool stuff. I can remember it. It's all about being able to remember it.

806
01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I invite you to take it quite seriously when you wake up and you get conscious do the breathing five times a day, six times a day. Don't have to do a lot of cycles of it, but how am I feeling now.

807
01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I had this thought when ugly thought it was a yucky thought and like I thought I want to feel better.

808
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Regulate the body do it again and again and again. The more you practice doing it, the more you'll be able to access it when you really need it when it's go time. Okay.

809
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it seems like a small thing, but

810
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.760
Tomas Valdez: I speak before I asked a lot, and I know I do.

811
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you're saying there's not a lot of time between the stimulus and the response.

812
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.110
Tomas Valdez: There's no time.

813
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:35.310
Tomas Valdez: Like it's almost. I mean there is but it's like I have my filters very tight. It's tiny. But, but

814
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:36.660
Tomas Valdez: I'll use the word tiny

815
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But Tomas I bet if I asked you just about that one story about your mom. I bet she'd been snippy for hours.

816
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:52.740
Tomas Valdez: You think I don't know. She was nice to me on the phone and

817
01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:55.440
Tomas Valdez: When you got something to say just better off.

818
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying

819
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: She hadn't been snippy four minutes at a time.

820
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to back minutes

821
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And this happened, and this happened. She was short.

822
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:20.400
Tomas Valdez: Um, no, I guess not know. She had, she know she has a lot of stuff going on. And she bought it, you know, I mean,

823
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So my question has to do with. Let's just see if that's true. She may have had some signs that she was impatient. Let's just call it that, for now and you tolerated it

824
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And being able to remember your ability to do that because let me tell you why I'm suspecting this because you said, I've had it.

825
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm suspecting it because you were talking about that she'd been doing back to back then and patient with you and then you'd have it.

826
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.970
Tomas Valdez: Well, no, it was just, I mean, it was the P O is the pizza thing and then this thing. It was no it was just me and then

827
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:07.410
Tomas Valdez: And then while we were. And then while we were actually studying she was being really short with me and just like wow, like, wow, like

828
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:14.940
Tomas Valdez: Are just like calm, calm down. Like, I understand you know Spanish. I get that. Like, I'm the one that's trying to learn it like

829
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:27.060
Tomas Valdez: I need like, give me a give me a minute to try to try to learn like I'm not learning anything but you just telling me the answer mom like, I really do need your help. And I want your help and I, I really appreciate you sitting

830
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:32.760
Tomas Valdez: Next to me. Now for me, but let me try to work on this myself and then timing.

831
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:36.600
Tomas Valdez: That's a great that's like I like I like I'm trying, I'm trying so hard to

832
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:51.180
Tomas Valdez: Ever be helpful to let her be helpful to have her, let her feel like I use. I mean like anything like if she wants to take a pair of my jeans to so I'm cool. Take them to you can do that. So you can, you know, so you can be focused on something else like

833
01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:52.890
Tomas Valdez: I don't know.

834
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.390
Tomas Valdez: To help

835
01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:55.860
Well,

836
01:40:56.910 --> 01:41:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just go here. When did that studying, studying Spanish then pizza. Is that correct,

837
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It went

838
01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:13.710
Tomas Valdez: I was already had, I had already gotten her house. I was sitting there, studying and then she just burst in the door and then all hell broke loose.

839
01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:22.860
Tomas Valdez: Because before that everything was fine. We spoke on the phone, she was happy go lucky. Nice. Everything was cool. Oh, yeah. Pick order a pizza, you know,

840
01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:33.000
Tomas Valdez: I'm not gonna eat any but you can you being eat so or something, you know, and I will pick it up everything was fine. So that's why I was so shocked. Yeah, I mean, like, what

841
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It was wondering when pizza studying and then something else. And when did you say stop it.

842
01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:52.380
Tomas Valdez: Oh no, I said, Stop it yesterday. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't tell her to stop it did when she do the pizza at me.

843
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.830
Tomas Valdez: Okay, hold that when she do the peak that you can

844
01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that one. What did you do to put

845
01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Time in between the stimulus which is the pizza throwing and your reaction. What did you do, you did something in there.

846
01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To create time and space between the stimulus and the response I

847
01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:20.670
Tomas Valdez: Got it. I put up my hoodie and I refused to make eye contact.

848
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:28.410
Tomas Valdez: That's what I did. I just put my I just put up my my hoodie and if she walked in the room, I would not look at her. I would just

849
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:37.080
Tomas Valdez: deadlocked on my, on my computer and just and I know she was craving for me to look at her to get that to get some sort of response and I wouldn't give it to her.

850
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:39.210
Tomas Valdez: Okay.

851
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:48.690
Tomas Valdez: So I just kept looking at my computer and I know and i and i know my her looking at me. She can read me so I know she knew what I was doing and thinking

852
01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Brilliant, you know,

853
01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's way down low.

854
01:42:56.790 --> 01:43:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Way down the line. You did something between the stimulus and the response. You did you put you had to literally

855
01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhibit, watch, watch, you inhibited an impulse take pride in that. That's all we need to know. We just need to do that.

856
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I know there was this whole con which is I know she wants I contact, I get the secondary game. But what I'm really interested is this little fraction where you inhibited an impulse that interest me

857
01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:35.880
Tomas Valdez: Is because I I knew she what she's been going through and

858
01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:49.830
Tomas Valdez: You know, stress sucks. And I understand how it feels to be lonely. I, I really understand how it feels to be lonely and I understand. She probably going through that really bad right now. And so I just pop up my hoodie and okay

859
01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She ever really good his mom ever really going to hit you and hurt you.

860
01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:01.710
Tomas Valdez: It's, it's only happened twice in my life over she's at me so

861
01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:04.440
Tomas Valdez: I really yeah so

862
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And if she if she did is she really going to

863
01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.580
Tomas Valdez: And she wouldn't know she wouldn't have me now because I have a TBI.

864
01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:16.620
Tomas Valdez: Right.

865
01:44:17.670 --> 01:44:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So the likelihood that you were in physical danger.

866
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:22.830
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

867
01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Euro, but look how intensely you felt it. You had a perception of threat and we won't even get into the game, which is I'm going to withdraw something that she enjoys that's a different game. I'm just talking about your skill to have been able to inhibit an impulse Bravo. Nicely done.

868
01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:50.130
Tomas Valdez: Wow, just talking about it's making me feel anxiety for some reason why

869
01:44:51.570 --> 01:44:56.190
Tomas Valdez: I'm getting like my chest is feeling heavy and them wait

870
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:59.130
Until us

871
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the breathing right now. And I want you to hold the thought.

872
01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I am safe. I am okay even with this negative memory. I'm okay. I'm safe. Even with this negative memory. This is a crummy memory, I'm safe.

873
01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to sit back to us and freeze let that air into your tummy, you need to, what do you need to do there. What are you doing,

874
01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:34.830
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, there we go.

875
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me go deep into the belly. We're going to call it belly breathing. So there's no room to get it wrong. It's all about getting that Aaron is expanding as a balloon.

876
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get that air into the bottom with along

877
01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to see. Oh, yeah.

878
01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:55.890
I am safe.

879
01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm safe. Even with this negative image.

880
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still okay it's my mind telling me love is on the line.

881
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not I'm safe. That's a perception of threat.

882
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you go to the body and you guys think it stays up there in the brain. You've got to feel the body being calm and relaxed the large muscle groups relaxing and you get there through that breathing.

883
01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So that there is congruency

884
01:46:29.970 --> 01:46:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

885
01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I am safe. After all, and then there's the space of my mom can work through what she's going through. It has nothing to do with you.

886
01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.870
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, and well

887
01:46:49.980 --> 01:47:00.240
Tomas Valdez: Something that's been stressing me out, too, is that my lease is up now in two months and I was really like seriously considering moving back to Phoenix. But now that now that this happened.

888
01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:06.630
Tomas Valdez: I don't know what to do. I don't know. I don't know if it's okay to leave my mom here all this

889
01:47:07.650 --> 01:47:10.560
Tomas Valdez: Like of all times for me to leave now like

890
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the way life, isn't it, it's

891
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:13.680
All

892
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if you knew you could get her contribution to the conversation. What if you could trust what she was saying was the truth.

893
01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:33.810
Tomas Valdez: I wouldn't trust me, I know I if I asked her if I asked her, her opinion on this. I couldn't trust what she would tell me because I know, I know. Whatever. She would tell me it would be

894
01:47:34.410 --> 01:47:41.430
Tomas Valdez: To be to better myself. It wouldn't be to okay what's but what's best for her as well. It would be strictly what's best for Tomas

895
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's amazing. To know that that you have a mother that wants your growth that's, that's beautiful.

896
01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And she also derived on a daily basis, a lot of energy and and

897
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I see from that she likes that feeling of giving she likes that.

898
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.030
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, definitely.

899
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You taught me that in fact you're very confident about it. You wouldn't budge from there, you're like, No, I know my mom 37 years it's been this way. I know it's useful. She likes to help stay busy. That's her deal

900
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:23.730
Tomas Valdez: I've very rarely. Am I, am I live. See, my mom, he a meal.

901
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:39.330
Tomas Valdez: Very rarely extremely like I for Thanksgiving, Christmas. I've never seen my mom need meal ever she won't eat a meal, she will. She's a type that will wait for everybody to serve themselves. He

902
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:41.280
Tomas Valdez: Finish.

903
01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.950
Tomas Valdez: She'll help do the dishes. Eventually, she's that type of person. So it's like

904
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.690
Tomas Valdez: Okay, I know her so well, and she's my best friend. You know what I mean. So

905
01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:58.470
Tomas Valdez: That's why it's like, that's why I'm having a hard time like what do I do with because I I know the best thing for my personal like

906
01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:06.120
Tomas Valdez: Professional Growth would be to move back to Phoenix. I have a lot of job opportunities and and room for growth there but

907
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:18.960
Tomas Valdez: I don't know if I want to men thing is my family is so bad at it it bugs me to leave here. Like, even though like this, places like New Mexico has been horrible. For me, it's got off of for me.

908
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I've been listening to you. It just seems like

909
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:22.590
You should

910
01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You do rob yourself when you decide to do all of this interpretation. A lot of people do this, they say why no because I'm a mind reader. I'm going to not take what someone saying, and instead I'm going to read their mind.

911
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you opt out of that and you say, I'm going to take people at what they do right in front of me.

912
01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say, Mom, I'm conflicted.

913
01:49:50.820 --> 01:50:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to miss you. If I'm away from you. I need connection with family, there's an eye. There's also this other piece of me that I want to move to Arizona and

914
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid I'll miss you too much. But you don't get in her head.

915
01:50:07.710 --> 01:50:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You just on your truth. Maybe we'll do maybe you'll take what she says. I mean, it's not a nice feeling to not be believed, maybe show her that honor and say,

916
01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have this in my head I'm making up in my head that you wouldn't tell me you wanted me to stay if you did. And so I'm going to not go. And I'm going to stay here because I think you want me to mom.

917
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you rather I stayed here and be here for you.

918
01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or are you going to be okay. Are you going to

919
01:50:47.850 --> 01:51:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your friends are you going to, can we stay connected. Can we talk because I need to go to school and get this different job and I don't like it here. You don't trust your mother is going to tell you the truth.

920
01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:09.510
Tomas Valdez: No, I really don't. Not in this case, I don't. Okay, I know.

921
01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:10.650
Tomas Valdez: What my mom.

922
01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand.

923
01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.890
Tomas Valdez: I don't think I don't mean I don't know. I mean, maybe I could be wrong. I could be wrong. Also,

924
01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've never had this moment she's never lost her mother, two months.

925
01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:29.910
Tomas Valdez: Exactly. That's why I don't know how she live. Yeah, that's exactly but

926
01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:34.740
Tomas Valdez: I just stemming from others situations that have happened in life.

927
01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:36.120
Tomas Valdez: That have been big moments.

928
01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning, she puts your well being first

929
01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:51.690
Tomas Valdez: She puts everybody's loving not even her kids, she puts everybody's well being before her.

930
01:51:53.730 --> 01:52:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's gonna do it long after you've run out of jobs, long after you've run out of happiness. So you're not going to change her

931
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.030
Tomas Valdez: Know,

932
01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Her style. So what point is it a few being here, is it that you indeed are going to be the one missing her

933
01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:13.110
Tomas Valdez: Partially yeah

934
01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:23.130
Tomas Valdez: Good max one. I mean, the past five years, I've been she's been my only friend, pretty much, you know, I mean like

935
01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.280
Tomas Valdez: The only per second really good to talk to

936
01:52:28.590 --> 01:52:35.190
Tomas Valdez: My brother is my bike I have, you know, like I told you my brother has been there. My dad has been here. She's been the only person I've had, you know,

937
01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:43.350
Tomas Valdez: If my, you know, I've seen my see my brothers move around and you know they're best friends. They go when they go visit them.

938
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:53.310
Tomas Valdez: You know, wherever they are. I haven't had one of my friends from Phoenix come out here and visit me or, you know, or even offer. Hey, no yo cookie number to come down and say what's up. Let's go do this not you know

939
01:52:53.820 --> 01:53:02.670
Tomas Valdez: And I've gotten to Phoenix, but I haven't had any friends come here and do that for me. So it makes me wonder, do I really have any friends and Phoenix.

940
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:08.250
Tomas Valdez: Or should I maybe I should just stay here. You know, I know I have so much going through my head. It's

941
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a lot at a minimum. How about you stay in your own head. I think that's a reasonable expectation. Your mother is a grown woman.

942
01:53:19.890 --> 01:53:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let her have her own thoughts. Let's be respectful, like it's respectful. But notice how you have your own. I'm not sure. So let's at least just for now just work on your head. Okay.

943
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to do that's worth it. Once you get clear about what you want, right, then we're making a very informed choice.

944
01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, I've been hearing that you don't like this place and I get that. But there's a real draw right now because you see there's

945
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A sort of of tenderness this real sort of soft spot around

946
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: connecting with people and you've gone out and you've tried it and it hasn't worked out. You've gone out and tried it, you know, brother, or this friend you know some things have gone sideways.

947
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you just for now. You say, I want to be near my mom for a while. And until that changes. That's why I'm here.

948
01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be okay.

949
01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.040
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I think so.

950
01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, why not

951
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but if it's I'm staying here sacrificing for you, mom, and you're treating me like this. That's a whole other way of staying. That's a problem.

952
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:53.820
Tomas Valdez: She wouldn't say like, I know, but I know she won't stay like this. I know she will stay like this that's that's that's that's the thing also

953
01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.070
Tomas Valdez: I know, I know. It's this is good. Like, it's like a lot of ages, like the immediate shock.

954
01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So we go if you if that pizza moment could be different if you really do practice the stuff that we did in here today.

955
01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That comes flying at you. Oh, Mom.

956
01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what can I do. So, such a hard day. I know it's frustrating. We have, I know you don't like my hands like this that means something else to you all trying to down but it's holding space for someone

957
01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It means we don't make it about us.

958
01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Her behavior, you know, deep inside and that's what time can give you is the realization that it isn't about

959
01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I already know you're sorry, and she has to, well, we can catch ourselves a little earlier, not have those right where there was no time between stimulus and response and you can get there. I do believe by breathing and remembering

960
01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not an actual danger.

961
01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom, she's going through some shit.

962
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I love her. Anyway, I know I would want this unconditional love.

963
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I can go get Chinese food. If you want, you know, it changes our position, the way we talk or tone of voice, everything changes. If we realize love is not on the line. It's not being removed from you. You're not going to be betrayed.

964
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a perception of threat. You're not in any danger. Breathe. And remember, I'm

965
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm safe.

966
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Practice back to us.

967
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:33.630
Tomas Valdez: Your moments will be

968
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: On your own and you won't be moved around by other people's opinion in their short tempered notice you're going to be more in charge of your behaviors.

969
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:44.790
Tomas Valdez: Very nice.

970
01:56:45.630 --> 01:57:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, I will. I'm not trying to sell you a car without an engine. I really do think this this is key. But it's remembering it. And, you know, remember we said, remember we got behind you did inhibit the impulse you eat, look how much time it takes

971
01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That took seconds, or at least a fraction of a second.

972
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: In that amount of time. Let's say you get all the way that far, you do a passive aggressive behavior, whatever we want to label it all show her it's vindictive right

973
01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter, we can intervene either when we've started to do something kind of kind of retaliatory we can catch ourselves in it.

974
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to hurt her, like, I'm feeling hurt and I catch myself and I do the breathing.

975
01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm perceiving

976
01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That she betrayed. Oh, I hate the trail. Let me get all the way through. Let me see, what is this oil open my eyes. Oh, it's not about me. My mom's hurting, to the point that she's being mean my mom's. I mean, she must be miserable inside you can get there.

977
01:57:55.590 --> 01:58:01.830
Tomas Valdez: And I kind of did breathe and relax and do that, like, well, and I just I just kept on doing my homework and just kind of just

978
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:14.580
Tomas Valdez: Okay, and then she I think then kind of like realized what was you know that what she did was she had died and she came up to me and we've always been the type to bury the hatchet very fast after any argument we that we've ever had.

979
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

980
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:30.750
Tomas Valdez: I like very fast and she came to me and she like she asked me like some like random BS question because she knew that I would respond. And I did. And then that was over, I put my head down and it was back. Fine. It was back to how we were yeah so

981
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:34.440
Tomas Valdez: You inhibited. Yeah, yeah.

982
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it. So we need to capitalize on that.

983
01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:39.510
Tomas Valdez: A bit more often.

984
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can remember you had to remember there was a lot of pieces of that ahead, remember I had a hood back there. I mean, you have to remember they might seem silly, but those are fractions of a second, that that's all you need.

985
01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You reach that note. Wait. Oh.

986
01:58:54.180 --> 01:59:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do some stretching. Now, I won't retaliate. It won't be passive aggressive. I'm not gonna try and move her across the chest table and not gonna help. I'm just going to remember. What's that thing when said to thank

987
01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I

988
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:24.930
Tomas Valdez: My initial thought to do was f this I'm putting my my computer. My backpack. I'm going home and I'm doing this shit on my, on my own. And then what it was where it was like a split second of that and then another split second. It was no

989
01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Then you've got it. That's all you need. Tomorrow, so have faith you have it still indeed to inhibit you have it there. It's just being able to as soon as we can try and remember these other pieces.

990
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so that you can enjoy moments because they also could have been a really bonding moment with your mom and it could have been something slightly different. But now,

991
01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It got a little, a little sideways, not too, too bad, but because you guys know how to repair quickly are in the habit of that.

992
01:59:56.610 --> 02:00:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But this has a bigger impact this has to do with your ability to regulate Tomas and it means that if the more time you can create right. The more you can inhibit

993
02:00:08.670 --> 02:00:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you can think through, is this going to work in her personally with this person, this person and I think you want people in your life, but they're, they're not worse. And I'm not there to see what's happening. So

994
02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: One. Just wondering if maybe we make that little tweak right there. I don't know what the next sentence could have been any given interaction with brother with father had there been time. I am not there to see, but I am curious.

995
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:40.290
Tomas Valdez: I think things will be a lot different.

996
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.920
Tomas Valdez: things a lot different.

997
02:00:47.310 --> 02:01:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see if we can get there more of those. Oh, screw these people and off. You want to go, but then it's like you did inhibit your first impulse and that's great news. That means you can't

998
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:12.630
Tomas Valdez: Cuz I remember thinking, I'm like, if I do that, it's going to hurt her even more like she she's already hurt. She's already down like this would be like kicking her while she's down. That's not okay.

999
02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:19.680
Tomas Valdez: Okay, that's always been a big thing in my life. I don't believe in kicking the person when they're down. It really bothers me to see

1000
02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That that you have the capability to to have empathy, even in that moment you were able to switch the storyline and see the world from her perspective, just enough to not quit. He still went on.

1001
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't quite have the other piece, which might be later on. Hey mom.

1002
02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You okay

1003
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're acting so different right now so out of character. How can I be here.

1004
02:01:51.120 --> 02:02:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it feels good, because that's probably if you had access to those kind of words, you would have done it. But don't get there, we need time. That's what inhibiting that initial impulse. Will do. He'll be able to get there, you know,

1005
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:11.910
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I'm trying. It's

1006
02:02:12.930 --> 02:02:20.130
Tomas Valdez: No, I didn't really I've been never realized that I've been doing this for so for such a long time, like I've been, I think, I don't know.

1007
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:25.950
Tomas Valdez: That mean. I mean, I know I've been doing this since my accident, but I don't know maybe I've been doing this since Before my accident, you know, it'd be like

1008
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.630
Tomas Valdez: Oh,

1009
02:02:28.050 --> 02:02:34.050
Tomas Valdez: If you ever go I really need to sit and think things through and stop and think before I talk

1010
02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm yeah you never know maybe right that that repair that happens so quickly with your mom. It might happen even faster.

1011
02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because watch it could have been right then. Oh, Mom, what's going on.

1012
02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's so fresh. Want to have some control in a moment when we have none.

1013
02:02:54.930 --> 02:03:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I get that. What can I do, do you want distraction, should we focus on Spanish shavers and Chinese food should what should, how can I help do want to just, you know, you'll have that to give you won't perceive what's going on as a threat.

1014
02:03:13.650 --> 02:03:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It seems oversimplified to mosque, but your world will change if the world is not a dangerous place to you.

1015
02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to get it. I know this has to do with the inner personal just stick to that incident on the on the freeway and in this guy with the shooting thing won't go there.

1016
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with interpersonal

1017
02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1018
02:03:43.770 --> 02:03:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's get our appointments out here and figure out a time for us to meet

1019
02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:48.630
Tomas Valdez: Again, all right.

1020
02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you're exercising.

1021
02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great news too by the

1022
02:03:58.170 --> 02:03:58.470
Way.

1023
02:04:04.290 --> 02:04:05.730
Yeah. Finally, again,

1024
02:04:07.710 --> 02:04:12.090
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, the last time you like to gather pens helped me a lot with this, but

1025
02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:19.530
Tomas Valdez: I was. I didn't want to say the group, obviously, but it kind of its kind of made me like emotionally dead, is that normal

1026
02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling kind of but you say that

1027
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:29.670
Tomas Valdez: Like I like I like I'm like I'm not happy. I'm not sad. I'm just there. You know, I mean, it was weird.

1028
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Tomas. Listen, let's say, just for a second. And this was dipping into a whole other big conversation so

1029
02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:38.610
Tomas Valdez: I don't really want to type that right

1030
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but I just want to say this, if it's true that either organically or

1031
02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe there was

1032
02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe this bipolar thing is really real. Let's say it is. That's what everybody says they miss the high

1033
02:04:56.190 --> 02:05:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, even though it created chaos, they miss that intensity. Everyone says it I know like I like this medicine. I don't feel as good. Well, but it meant you were gambling all your money and you're getting in fights and you lost your department, you're getting

1034
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're like, but I miss it. So just, I wanted to quickly normalize it. Um, it's just familiar. You're just used to this super, super high thing. So it's both.

1035
02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so many things. I have no idea if that's what

1036
02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We're actually talking

1037
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Idea. But hang on, okay.

1038
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we let's find out who you are. Down the line with with what's a clear away the Suboxone let's clear away, eventually, if you want to not be on the gout pit. Let's clear it all away.

1039
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see who you are because it's really hard to give a proper diagnosis. When you have chemicals going on. Okay, let's see if you like.

1040
02:05:56.010 --> 02:06:06.840
Tomas Valdez: I love, I love myself when I'm not, I don't have chemicals in my body. I love how I feel. I love my life like and then I always screw it up because I'm like, Oh, I can do a little bit of this and I'll be fine. And then it turns into hell.

1041
02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you notice what today was about today was about. I'm learning the skill of inhibiting and impulse

1042
02:06:15.810 --> 02:06:16.440
Tomas Valdez: It's really

1043
02:06:16.590 --> 02:06:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Valuable. A lot of my folks kind of identify with attention deficit hyperactivity, it's the same thing. It's you get to you still get to enjoy the same stuff. It's just you're including more information, more reflection more possible scenarios of consequence get to still have fun.

1044
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just less regret.

1045
02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:38.580
Tomas Valdez: Okay.

1046
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1047
02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:43.710
Tomas Valdez: All right, look so good plan.

1048
02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, that sounds cool, doesn't it.

1049
02:06:46.110 --> 02:06:46.560
Yeah.

1050
02:06:47.970 --> 02:06:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I always want the that fun parts got us started, stay there and I and out here as a consumer of your aspect you have quite a range.

1051
02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't feel it but out here, happy, smiling and crying and really having so much anger. So as a consumer of you, it's, it's pretty intense. But you don't feel it that way.

1052
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1053
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're used to this really why

1054
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But even this what this feels like this to you, but in here, right. I see. I see a lot just happened. If you were to watch this video, like let's say next week. You say, I want to see and you can watch. And you can say, Holy shit.

1055
02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's me.

1056
02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I've seen people like that. And then I don't know what you'll say, yeah, that would be the experiment.

1057
02:07:53.820 --> 02:08:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just it's something we could play with I've done that with a few people. We've looked at the video because they don't aren't aware of a certain speech pattern or some kind of tone. We've been able to use the convenience of the video to review. So maybe we'll do it.

1058
02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:06.120
Tomas Valdez: Who knows, and see if you're up for it.

1059
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, let's pick

1060
02:08:08.190 --> 02:08:08.370
Up.

1061
02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

1062
02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:18.630
Tomas Valdez: And we we had talked about trying the

1063
02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:26.190
Tomas Valdez: EDM or EDM or EMR art. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that we have done it yet. So I don't know, maybe slightly

1064
02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Darker so

1065
02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: First of all, how's your stomach feeling

1066
02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:35.850
Tomas Valdez: Fine. I know. Yeah. We fired

1067
02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. I am Dr. It's called

1069
02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:49.410

1070
02:09:03.930 --> 02:09:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me just get a picture of some things I want to see what some possibilities are what time do you go to the gym on Saturdays and Sundays. Let me just hear what your days are for that.

1071
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:20.310
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, that's just whenever I can. I can be completely open for that. Okay.

1072
02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.570
And

1073
02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You, your stomach starts to settle by what time

1074
02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:31.800
Tomas Valdez: What's a

1075
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to tell. There's no real

1076
02:09:33.330 --> 02:09:36.210
Tomas Valdez: Pattern. There is no I yeah like normally like

1077
02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:38.010
Tomas Valdez: 1130 ish

1078
02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:53.970
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, like it was, it was really hard for me this morning, but I just kind of just Delve it okay I did. I don't know. I don't know. I can't. Yeah, I kinda like I had like wake up early. I get a little bit extra early to yeah I try to deal with everything and just Yeah it sucks.

1083
02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:23.970

1084
02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:29.670
Tomas Valdez: Like golf my energy off that and maybe that's why a lot of people have shied away from me.

1085
02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I've replaced words like that that make me laugh. Instead of it sucks.
