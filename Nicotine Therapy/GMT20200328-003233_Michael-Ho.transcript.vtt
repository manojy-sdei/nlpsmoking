Geanie polo: No, not yet. So

71
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.640
Michael Hoefer: So you want to get you want to one of the reasons to get help, is to try to prevent some of

72
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.500
Geanie polo: These things from yes i want to prevent it for it gets wurster I mean I'm aware.

73
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.340
Geanie polo: Of what it can cause and

74
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.930
Geanie polo: The bad stuff. So I'm trying to get help, you know, while I can. Okay.

75
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.700
Michael Hoefer: And how much

76
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.770
Michael Hoefer: How much heroin are using and how much are you spending on it. Would you say on average.

77
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.300
Geanie polo: It varies. Um,

78
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.610
Geanie polo: I can spend like 40 or $100 a day.

79
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:44.460
Geanie polo: Just depending sometimes I'll smoke, like a lot. And sometimes I won't smoke too much.

80
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:53.310
Geanie polo: Just like there's not a certain amount of exactly measurement of how much. I'll take every day.

81
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.830
Geanie polo: So it's a range. Yeah.

82
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.670
Michael Hoefer: How do you, how do you support your habit. How are you able to get money for your habit.

83
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.550
Geanie polo: I mean I have work and stuff that I do so.

84
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.310
Michael Hoefer: What kind of work do you do

85
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.100
Geanie polo: housecleaning okay

86
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.940
Geanie polo: Yeah, just like something I do on the side.

87
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.770
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever been in any type of substance use treatment and the past

88
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.410
Michael Hoefer: You know, have you ever taken Suboxone or methadone in the past.

89
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:39.300
Geanie polo: Well, that's why I wanted to try like staying on it, but I did try it before it was like a like a strip

90
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:49.890
Geanie polo: A friend of mine, like she just like cut me a piece of it and told me like to put it underneath my mouth and Uh huh. That was like five months ago and I didn't have

91
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.250
Geanie polo: Any you know of my medication. You know, like care when I call it my medication.

92
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.980
Geanie polo: And I didn't have any and I couldn't get any for a couple days and I she gave me some of that ended it helped. Okay.

93
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.450
Michael Hoefer: Great. And so when you took it just that one time it was helpful for you.

94
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.340
Geanie polo: Yeah, it was, it was helpful.

95
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.750
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever taken liquid methadone, like from a clinic or

96
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.690
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever taken now tracks own or the vivid trial shot, which is once a month shot. No.

97
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.480
Geanie polo: No, I heard about it. Yeah.

98
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.940
Michael Hoefer: That's what did you

99
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.950
Michael Hoefer: Do you have any questions about Suboxone vs at all or

100
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.050
Geanie polo: No. Yes. No, it is different.

101
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.470
Michael Hoefer: Yeah so Suboxone is which is the one you've tried is like a

102
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.450
Michael Hoefer: It's still it is a type of opiate but it's a pretty, it's a unique opiate it's like very, very safe and it's

103
00:10:49.260 --> 00:11:00.900
Michael Hoefer: The nice thing about it is that can prevent you know cravings withdrawal and if you were to use heroin or anything like belson blocks it so you don't feel it and then you then most people will say that was a waste of money. I'm not going to do that again.

104
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:11.010
Michael Hoefer: And then, and it's also Suboxone is kind of on it's almost impossible to overdose on and most people who take it, just say I feel normal. I don't feel like

105
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:25.200
Michael Hoefer: I'm on anything. And so that's the box own contrast to that is now Trex own which can be given it a shot. Once a month and that medication is not an opiate and it just sits on opiate receptors and blocks them kind of like a shield

106
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:32.820
Michael Hoefer: And the good thing about that is you can't, you know, overdose on it. You don't get high off of it. You don't go to withdraw. If you stop it.

107
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:41.430
Michael Hoefer: And and the bad thing about it is it you have to be basically opiate free for about seven to 10 days before you start it.

108
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.700
Michael Hoefer: Because if you get it too early. It can make me

109
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:55.050
Michael Hoefer: And the other thing is, it doesn't help with pain like physical pain and it also people if you don't stay on it if you stop taking the shot.

110
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:03.630
Michael Hoefer: There's no withdrawal and you kind of, you can people who relapse can be very sensitive to opiates. So you have to be very careful. Yeah.

111
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.150
Geanie polo: Okay. Um, I think I want to do to suboptimal Suboxone

112
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.980
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and

113
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.710
Geanie polo: Um, maybe later.

114
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.470
Geanie polo: I don't know if I can

115
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:27.060
Geanie polo: Would you suggest, like the shot or like what does Suboxone did that just helped me get off and, like, how long is the process like those are my questions.

116
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.070
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, sure. So, um,

117
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.210
Michael Hoefer: So yeah, I think, starting with the Suboxone is a good

118
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:43.560
Michael Hoefer: Is a good strategy and down the line once you come off the Suboxone, you can always transition to the patrol for some additional benefit you know

119
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:56.520
Michael Hoefer: And I think that tends to work well for most people, especially if you're currently using heroin and you, you go into withdrawal Suboxone it's just kind of easier to start and people tend to do better.

120
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:04.590
Michael Hoefer: And really have all the, you know, there's three options available for opiate addiction. But Viva trawl maybe only about 5% of patients.

121
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:12.870
Michael Hoefer: Really should go that route and motion either do Suboxone or methadone and I think for what you're talking about Suboxone is a good place to start. So I agree.

122
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.110
Geanie polo: Some, some action is the better one.

123
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:23.580
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, I think, for what we're talking about. That would be the best option for you once. What I'm done, getting your own history and stuff like that. I can

124
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.730
Michael Hoefer: write you a prescription for it tonight that all send electronically so you can get it started. And we'll talk about how to do that.

125
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:40.020
Michael Hoefer: And then the recommendations are and it's up to you whether you follow them or not. But really, the research shows you know you've been opiate using opiates for a few years and that you know that's

126
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:50.490
Michael Hoefer: an opiate addiction is a serious addiction. And so what the research shows is that most people do better if they get on Suboxone and stay on it for about a year, while they do other sorts of

127
00:13:50.970 --> 00:14:01.410
Michael Hoefer: group therapy changing their lives in positive ways really building like a healthy lifestyle and then at that point when they try to come off the Suboxone they're much more successful.

128
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:09.000
Michael Hoefer: So that would be my recommendation. And of course, it's up to you whether you end up following that or not. But that's what we find is most helpful for people

129
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.830
Geanie polo: Okay, yeah.

130
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.840
Michael Hoefer: The Suboxone is a very useful tool and very helpful, but

131
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.480
Geanie polo: That helped me like sleep.

132
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:32.400
Michael Hoefer: Yes. Yeah, it helps people, it will help it typically helps people sleep and also typically helps people with mood and it also has a little bit of a pain benefit, along with it so it can help in multiple different ways.

133
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:38.490
Geanie polo: Like am I allowed to like to like take anything else for like sleeping or relax with that or no.

134
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:48.060
Michael Hoefer: You can, yes. Especially, we recommend things that are not the only thing that is somewhat risky mix with Suboxone are benzodiazepines.

135
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:58.260
Michael Hoefer: So things like Xanax Valium. Those things really the only way you can overdose on Suboxone is if you take a bunch of Suboxone and then take a bunch of benzodiazepines with it.

136
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:10.380
Michael Hoefer: So if you were to take sleep medications we would recommend that it be things that are not benzodiazepines. So those are things like transit own Murtaza pain Benadryl you know sleep medications that are more common, what

137
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.810
Geanie polo: Do you, what would you recommend to prescribe me for like taking with that but at night, I have

138
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.260
Geanie polo: The hardest time sleeping and my body aches like

139
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.030
Geanie polo: Like as backup.

140
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.060
Geanie polo: What would you recommend that I can take

141
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:43.020
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so I could I could give you a few tablets of either transit or Murtaza pain. I think that for most people, once they get stabilized and Suboxone especially if you're having trouble sleeping, and also backaches and stuff like that. That sounds to me, kind of like withdrawal related

142
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:52.110
Michael Hoefer: And once the box on gets in your system and the withdrawal is taken care of. So you don't experience that anymore because the medication is so long acting people don't have withdrawal symptoms.

143
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.860
Michael Hoefer: And usually that resolves on its own. And you don't need other medications.

144
00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:04.230
Michael Hoefer: But if you did something for the first few nights I would give you something like as a painter transit on which are very safe and you could take it to try to help get some sleep because

145
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.060
Michael Hoefer: If you're not sleeping everything

146
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.330
Michael Hoefer: In the

147
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.910
Michael Hoefer: World is much worse, you know,

148
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.950
Geanie polo: Yeah yeah

149
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:22.020
Michael Hoefer: If it's okay, I'll just transition and ask you a little bit about any psychiatric history. Do you have a history of depression or anxiety or any other psychiatric issues.

150
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.910
Geanie polo: No, I'm just like, like

151
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.530
Geanie polo: Sometimes I'll get like anxiety. But that's only if I'm like really stressed out, or like

152
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.240
Geanie polo: I'm

153
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:41.010
Geanie polo: Like just really thinking a lot and just really super stressed out.

154
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.910
Geanie polo: I'll get anxiety, but I mean I can control it.

155
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.020
Michael Hoefer: Do you think it's more anxiety than other people feel

156
00:16:50.580 --> 00:17:05.400
Geanie polo: No, I think everyone has a little bit of anxiety, you know, um, you know, especially like after you know stressed out or you know overthinking and stuff like everyone's like that. So I don't think that I have a problem.

157
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.840
Michael Hoefer: With having. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist or a therapist before in your life or counselor for anything.

158
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:21.540
Michael Hoefer: No. Okay. Have you ever put been put on any psychiatric medications in the past like antidepressants and I anxiety meds.

Michael Hoefer: Okay, how much do you smoke.

177
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.380
Geanie polo: Like maybe

178
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.350
Geanie polo: 77 or eight cigarettes a day.

179
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.050
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And how do you feel about your smoking.

180
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.790
Geanie polo: Um, I really would like to quit. Okay.

181
00:18:48.690 --> 00:19:02.910
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Great. Well, that's something we can certainly try to help you with in our program and what we usually do is focus on starting with the Suboxone but down the line. We can we can talk to you more about that and see how we can help if that's something you're interested in

182
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.420
Geanie polo: Can you repeat that I didn't hear the last part.

183
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:18.780
Michael Hoefer: Oh, sure. I just said that. I'm glad to hear that you're interested in quitting. And that's something we can help you with. And we usually do that, you know, as we start with the Suboxone and then we work on that, you know, in a few weeks or so. Okay.

184
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.990
Geanie polo: Okay, so for now I'm doing just

185
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.260
Michael Hoefer: Sort of harsh on first.

186
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.740
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

187
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.090
Geanie polo: Because it's a big strip

188
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.900
Geanie polo: Or the pill.

189
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.110
Michael Hoefer: We could do either. I don't know if you have a preference.

190
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.370
Geanie polo: What, like what is the difference of them.

191
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:46.890
Michael Hoefer: So they're the strip tends to dissolve a little quicker and and sometimes some people feel like it's

192
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:59.790
Michael Hoefer: Stronger. The downside is depending on your insurance, it can sometimes be a little more expensive, but it's not like neither are super expensive because they're both kind of covered as essential medications.

193
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.190
Geanie polo: Okay. And would you be able to do. Like, I know there's a four milligram and eight. Can you do the eight

194
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.800
Michael Hoefer: Yes, we will do the eight milligrams

195
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.090
Geanie polo: Yeah, okay. Yeah.

196
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:09.780
Sure.

197
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.560
Geanie polo: And then, how long is this supply for

198
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:22.440
Michael Hoefer: So I can give you a seven day supply once we're done today. And then you'll get connected with a continuity therapist and doctor

199
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:33.690
Michael Hoefer: And you'll be meeting and kind of groups going forward. And then they can give you the based on your group attendance and how the, you know, your drug screens look and how you're doing and treatment they can give you more and more supplies.

200
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.880
Geanie polo: Okay, so you can only do a week right now. Okay. Yeah.

201
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:48.990
Michael Hoefer: I just have a couple more questions. I need to ask you to finish up the intake. The next one is anybody in your family with the history of psychiatric issues that you know

202
00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:53.340
Michael Hoefer: No. No. Okay. Where were you born and where did you grow up.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.970
Geanie polo: I was born in San Francisco. And I grew up pretty much in California.

204
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.840

205
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.750

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.280
Geanie polo: Um no I just like maybe like like reading and writing

214
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.780
Geanie polo: Wasn't very as like hard for me.

215
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:53.970
Michael Hoefer: It was difficult. Okay. Yeah. And after finishing school, you mentioned doing work as housecleaning. Have you done any other types of trades or work that you

216
00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.450
Michael Hoefer: Typically do. Okay. And have you have any children. And have you ever been married

217
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:06.960
Michael Hoefer: No. Okay, no children and haven't been married. Okay. And do you, where do you live, currently

218
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.580
Geanie polo: And Stockton.

219
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.030
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And do you have an apartment or a house or

220
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.090
Geanie polo: It's like a duplex house. Okay.

221
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.950
Michael Hoefer: And do you live with anybody.

222
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.420
Geanie polo: Know i just i have friend staying with me right now.

223
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.410
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. But it's, it's your place in your life.

224
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.730
Geanie polo: Yeah, please.

225
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.180
Okay.

226
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.080
Geanie polo: Oh my gosh.

227
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.520
Michael Hoefer: I still there. Hey,

228
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.160
Michael Hoefer: Call no problem.

229
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:45.810
Michael Hoefer: And those are the main questions. I need to ask you, are there any questions you have for me or anything else. You feel like I didn't ask you that was important for us to know right now.

230
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:52.170
Geanie polo: I'm now so like if I do the other meetings and stuff are those like virtual as well.

231
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.380
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, everything is virtual and everything's via zoom

232
00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:10.710
Michael Hoefer: And what it would be. Is there be, like, usually there's a group of maybe six to eight other people who are on Suboxone and you know and dealing with similar issues and there's a therapist and a doctor and it usually meets weekly and kind of we work on things together that way.

233
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.600
Michael Hoefer: And then every once in a while. There's labs, just to check that you're doing. OK.

234
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:26.100
Michael Hoefer: And then, and then also in the group. There's a lot of stuff about like coping skills and stuff because the Suboxone is a really useful tool, but also like

235
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:33.570
Michael Hoefer: It also works best if you're doing other things in your life like behavioral and therapeutic strategies because addiction, you know, has all sorts of effects, you know,

236
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.810
Michael Hoefer: And that's how people usually get get better.

237
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.980
Geanie polo: Yeah. And then one day send

238
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:54.330
Geanie polo: Like the prescription to the pharmacy that I've requested, is it going to have my someone wanted to people upfront told me that all my insurance information will be like on their ready because I lost my card.

239
00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:00.450
Geanie polo: Know like what the insurance number and all that, beyond like can you guys sent that as well.

240
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:11.550
Michael Hoefer: I, yeah, I can, I can check here to see if it's already on there. And also, I can message or care coordinator to see if that's an issue. So do you have, what type of insurance do you have

241
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:18.390
Geanie polo: Medical are like of the San Joaquin okay and they said it covered it covers

242
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:25.860
Michael Hoefer: Yes, it does. Yeah. And you're gonna you want it to go to the Walgreens on 1830 West 11th STREET.

243
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.960
Geanie polo: Yes. Okay.

244
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.650
Geanie polo: I want to make sure that they have like my information like my insurance information that you guys have

245
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.320
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Yes, I can.

246
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:46.710
Michael Hoefer: I will basically I'll contact or if it's not already on here. Then I'll contact her care coordinator, make sure that it gets in there.

247
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.800
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, because I'm seeing it in my computer, but they'll also make I'll check my character to make sure that you know the

248
00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.800
Michael Hoefer: Pharmacy has you set it up correctly.

249
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.930
Geanie polo: Okay. Um, I have one more question. I might take like motion with the

250
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.690
Geanie polo: Strips.

251
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.030
Michael Hoefer: Yes, you are.

252
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.010
Michael Hoefer: What, what type of we're kind of pain bothers you, the most

253
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:25.860
Geanie polo: Like my legs like I like the pain in my legs like it just like it's so unbearable like like just sit like in hot water like in the bathtub and stuff. I'll try.

254
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:41.100
Geanie polo: A whole bunch of stuff. And it's just like I'm constantly like tossing and turning, like I can't sleep from the pain and then if I do fall asleep. I just like I'm jumping back up out of my sleep. It's like, I don't know how to explain. Gotcha.

255
00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.360
Michael Hoefer: And this. Have you ever had any like trauma to your legs or

256
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.320
Geanie polo: No.

257
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.920
Michael Hoefer: Is it is this, do you think is this associated with the withdrawal symptoms or

258
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.400
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

259
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:56.010
Geanie polo: Yes, I'm doing drugs. It's like my whole body will hurt, but I would feel it more in my legs.

260
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:05.640
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Okay, so yeah, so you can take motion with this and will also monitor it, and pretty soon within a couple days you'll kind of see

261
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:19.410
Michael Hoefer: If with this, if it's really withdrawal related the Suboxone should take care of it within a day or two, and it should stop. And then if you're still having it afterwards we can you know you can consult with one of our physicians and think about what, what else might be going on.

262
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:27.930
Michael Hoefer: The thing that the only thing that's important for you and taking this medication and sounds like you already know it is that you want. You need to be in

263
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:40.080
Michael Hoefer: Moderate withdrawal before you start taking it. So I'm going to put in the prescription. Now you go pick it up, but just make sure it sounds like the last time you had any heroin was two days ago. Is that correct, yeah.

264
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:48.150
Michael Hoefer: So if you start, make sure you don't take any heroin before you start taking it and start off with taking a half of film at a time.

265
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.120
Geanie polo: Long. Is it like every

266
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.540
Geanie polo: A half like every couple hours, everyone.

267
00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:08.760
Michael Hoefer: Great, so great question. So you start off with taking a half film and you can take a half film every, you know, a couple hours until you feel good. Okay, and you can take up to 16 milligrams in the first 24 hours. Okay.

268
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:15.600
Michael Hoefer: But if you feel fine after eight or after 12 just stop there, because that's good less medication. Okay.

269
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.110
Michael Hoefer: And then you just calculate whatever amount you took

270
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:29.790
Michael Hoefer: In the first 24 hours, whether it was 1612 eight whatever it was just calculate that up and then on day two. You just take that in the morning, and that's your dose going forward. Okay.

271
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.540
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and try to take it each morning

272
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.890
Geanie polo: The full dose.

273
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.360
Geanie polo: As the best. And how long does it

274
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:44.520
Geanie polo: Like actually take to detox to stuff like out of my system like if I just don't want to take anything at all anymore.

275
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.170
Michael Hoefer: How long does it take for Suboxone to get out of your system.

276
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.660
Michael Hoefer: Though you have like a lot

277
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.520
Geanie polo: To help to heroin. Get out.

278
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:54.210
Geanie polo: Yeah.

279
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.700
Michael Hoefer: So if you start seeing you start taking

280
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:05.460
Michael Hoefer: Okay, great question. So if you start taking Suboxone today the heroin will likely be fully out of your system within five to seven days. Okay.

281
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:17.160
Michael Hoefer: And then if you start if you start taking the Suboxone the Suboxone usually takes fully out of your system. It takes about a week or two to do it. But the thing that you should know is that

282
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:29.100
Michael Hoefer: People who try to detox with Suboxone like go from heroin addiction just takes a box on for a few weeks and stop 90% of those people relapse to heroin use within a year.

283
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:40.950
Michael Hoefer: The, the rates of relapse that going back to how nice are very, very high. If you don't get the proper treatment and that in our, you know, in the medical treatment and what the research clearly shows is

284
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.330
Michael Hoefer: The thing we talked about later maybe for a year, at least a year on the medication.

285
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:53.370
Michael Hoefer: Doing the groups doing the work getting helping you figure out whatever it was that got you addicted and learning coping skills.

286
00:28:53.670 --> 00:29:00.210
Michael Hoefer: You know what's beneath the addiction and how do we learn, you know, healthy living skills and coping skills to deal without heroin.

287
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.450
Michael Hoefer: And if you don't do that. There's like I said 97% of people are right back to using heroin within a year.

288
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:20.040
Michael Hoefer: And so it's really the recommendation is if you can do it. Now you're young, you can really if you do the work. Now you can really save yourself from having to do this again in the future and potentially even be in this cycle for longer in your life.

289
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:29.430
Michael Hoefer: So I'd really, you know, that's my recommendation. And of course, it's going to be up to you to decide, you know what you do. But that's, I think it's important for you to know that information.

290
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.460
Geanie polo: Okay, okay.

291
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:39.630
Michael Hoefer: All right. These are all really good questions. Any you have any more questions for me anything else.

292
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.640
Geanie polo: Be helpful. I think that's it.

293
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:53.520
Michael Hoefer: For now. Okay, great. So we'll start off with the Suboxone and the motion. And then the question is, did you want me to prescribe you a couple of pills like sleeping pills in case you need them or

294
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.690
Geanie polo: Yeah, can you please

295
00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:01.440
