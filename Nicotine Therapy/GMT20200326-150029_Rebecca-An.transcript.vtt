Jessica Freeman: Okay, so I had group last night.

21
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:58.590
Jessica Freeman: I like Dr element. He's cool. Dominique is a bit like pull out your yoga mat and rub your booty Buddha belly did a little too far for me, which is, and I'll engage, you know, I'll do what y'all asked me to do done it before.

22
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.180
Jessica Freeman: But there's this one.

23
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:25.230
Jessica Freeman: Patient in my group. It's like he just monopolizes the entire thing talking about nothing. You know, that's your element, and I don't have child care, by the way, Dr. Allen and Dominique, they try to be gracious, of course, and they they try to

24
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.160
Jessica Freeman: They try to put put a limit on what he does.

25
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.060
Jessica Freeman: I'm telling you he monopolizes the entire effing session and it gets old. It get I mean I'm over it. Like, I don't want to hear spoken voice over again.

26
00:02:40.680 --> 00:03:01.770
Jessica Freeman: So I'll allow and if I can switch groups I sent him an email. I mean, my schedules wide open and it would be cool to be. I mean, I know that the goal is for everybody to be in group with your same therapist, you know, I like you. You're pretty cool. It'd be cool if I could be

27
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.850
Jessica Freeman: So I put in the request.

28
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I was gonna say is you responded yet.

29
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.680
Jessica Freeman: No, I just didn't this morning.

30
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.030
Okay.

31
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

32
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.110
Jessica Freeman: After last night's show

33
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

34
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:31.800
Jessica Freeman: It was really like last night's group was awful. There were too many people in it like the whole medical management part first took like half the session.

35
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.580
Jessica Freeman: And then they showed a video on the

36
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:48.570
Jessica Freeman: Okay, and it was that or like a song sung by acquire and I'm like, I mean, in my check and I said hey you know

37
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.920
Jessica Freeman: Not great here. Like, I think a little bit more processing during group would be helpful for me. I mean, that's kind of the point, right. I don't want to acquire I'm up to date on

38
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.780
Jessica Freeman: And then Dominique like she just disappeared, like she wasn't there for half the meeting. I think it was probably a technical issue.

39
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:18.810
Jessica Freeman: And then Dr. Solomon had a Friday group patient drop in as a makeup session and like he went to a breakout group to talk to her about like getting her prescription sorted out.

40
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:31.530
Jessica Freeman: Find by Dominique gone on. So it's just like the animals are out of the fucking page right so it's just the patients in there with no facilitator and then Dr. Ali.

41
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:46.980
Jessica Freeman: phoned in a prescription for this other patient this Friday drop in patient and like phone call was live by total HIPAA violation. I'm sure he didn't realize it and I send them like a chat. You know, I don't know if y'all read

42
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:57.300
Jessica Freeman: Both her phone call is live right now like we are all sitting here listening to you call the pharmacy. I didn't get a response and then

43
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:11.310
Jessica Freeman: I went to go put my kid to bed. I sent a chat to everybody that says I'm putting my kid to bed. I'll be right back. I don't know if anybody read it but put my kid to bed and I come back and like I've been removed from the meeting. I'm like,

44
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.650
Jessica Freeman: You kick me out.

45
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.750
Jessica Freeman: But then I sent Dr element and email last night. And I'm like, Why do you kick me out. And he's like, oh no, the meeting and did while you were gone. Okay.

46
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.290
Jessica Freeman: I'm not having any of this like count against me. I was there, you know, I'm here, I'm early

47
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.760
Jessica Freeman: I engage. I do what I can. Can you hear me okay

48
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can hear you.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:45.090
Jessica Freeman: Okay, I just got a little pop up that said your internet connection is unstable, which is you have to turn Wi Fi off on some devices.

50
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.300
Jessica Freeman: I have to save this first

51
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.640
Jessica Freeman: Tax

52
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.720
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.470
Jessica Freeman: Maybe that'll help

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.760
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, that was some more environment for you. Good morning. How

Jessica Freeman: I can't get on by a thread here, man.

60
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's getting kind of monotonous, isn't it.

61
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.850
Jessica Freeman: Everybody here just needs so much attention. I'm trying to work from home.

62
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:42.420
Jessica Freeman: Like I'm not having any success working from home, like I got to get away from here to be able to focus on anything, or at least have the kid gone and, you know, my mom is to babysit here and like

63
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.870
Jessica Freeman: Take him just take them in three hours if you just take him then, if you're here all day, you know,

67
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.140
Jessica Freeman: Give me a break, man.

68
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Far away from you to

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.450
Jessica Freeman: 10 minutes

71
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:38.700
Jessica Freeman: Here today, but I haven't heard any like text notifications that she's on her way or trying to sort it out. I gave her the day off yesterday. I'm like, you don't have to come over, you have to watch him. But then on Thursday, you've got to take them weeks. And she said, Okay.

72
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All. Is there any way when she wants to watch him there that you can go to her house.

73
00:07:51.420 --> 00:08:01.680
Jessica Freeman: Well, um, I mean, I guess. But like all the I brought the monitor. Like I brought all the computer stuff from the office here. So it's all in my bedroom.

74
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

75
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you go in your room.

76
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do your work and let your mom stay out in the living room with a baby.

77
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:26.280
Jessica Freeman: Yes, I do. But then he comes and bangs on the door and turn it in. And I'm like, I don't you watch like the whole point is to watch him.

78
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:37.500
Jessica Freeman: And then she you know she's sitting at the dining room table with her laptop. Like I could do that, you know, I don't need you to come over and work on your laptop. I need you to come over, engage an invasion, my kid.

79
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:44.670
Jessica Freeman: You know, but what am I going to do Beggars can't be choosers right can't look a gift horse in the mouth.

80
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.320
Jessica Freeman: I can

81
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.780
Jessica Freeman: Come up with several other cliches.

82
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:49.860
Yeah.

83
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

84
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you engaging in online meetings.

85
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.420
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, during at least one a day, sometimes more. Come on. Come here.

86
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's that working out.

87
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.330
Jessica Freeman: It's

88
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.640
Jessica Freeman: It's okay. I followed your

89
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.020
Jessica Freeman: Be quiet.

90
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:26.430
Jessica Freeman: I'm sharing my video raising my hand I'm sharing and participating doing everything he said, and

91
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:35.520
Jessica Freeman: You know, I did put out some calls to a couple of recovery houses, but I really didn't receive much response. So I'm just

92
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:51.000
Jessica Freeman: The ones from Indianapolis. I feel like other than my handful of friends there, you know, which I don't know what meetings are going to, I just go to the ones from Indianapolis, because I know people

93
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.600
Jessica Freeman: But I don't know, I feel like I'm invisible.

94
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:05.700
Jessica Freeman: And then like the ones to like the all inclusive, open your recovery meetings like hundreds of people in their

95
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.550
Jessica Freeman: ally in person. Yeah.

96
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.280
Jessica Freeman: But I did make a friend.

97
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:27.630
Jessica Freeman: On an online meeting and this girl Gabriella sent me her phone number and I texted her we had been texting. So I have someone that's checking in on me and getting to know her, and talking. So that's good.

98
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is good progress. Yeah. Does she live in your area.

99
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.510
Jessica Freeman: No, I don't know where she lives is on them eastern time she sent me a text message of

100
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.920
Jessica Freeman: So I'm like, no, don't do that.

101
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:56.910
Jessica Freeman: So I said, I set some boundaries. I was like, unless it's an emergency and you're like variety is being threatened right now try to keep it between 10am your time and then let

102
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.840
Jessica Freeman: Me.

103
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.340
Jessica Freeman: She was like,

104
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.830
Jessica Freeman: I'm like, do I manage it all set some boundaries error.

105
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.670
Yeah.

106
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's

107
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

108
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.820
Jessica Freeman: It's why

109
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's progress.

110
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay. No.

111
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, tell me how your works going

112
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.170
Jessica Freeman: It's really frustrating.

113
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.850
Jessica Freeman: Like in order to put together like like to use the creativity and, you know, write and

114
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.740
Jessica Freeman: Produce content. You know, like infographics and

115
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:47.280
Jessica Freeman: You know, like white papers and you know content, I need to be able to focus and I can't focus here.

116
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:57.750
Jessica Freeman: I just can't. I almost want to be like, hey, can you give me, you know, whenever we go back to the office. I'm there. But like, this ain't working

117
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:08.970
Jessica Freeman: It's just not. I can't work from home with my little dog who wants to go UT every 10 minutes and my little boy who requires so much attention.

118
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:19.350
Jessica Freeman: Like. He's so mad at me right now. He's been trying to like Waller on me and Russell all morning. And I'm like, No, baby. I gotta do this, I gotta do that and he's he's pow right now so

119
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.220
Jessica Freeman: I'm not as much fun as I usually am.

120
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.840
Jessica Freeman: Kind of pitching today.

121
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, it's all right. Totally good.

122
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Idea when you're going to be able to go back to the office.

123
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.600
Jessica Freeman: Whenever the stay at home thing is done, apparently, real estate is essential.

124
00:12:49.710 --> 00:13:03.510
Jessica Freeman: So, and their booming. I mean, they got all kinds of work like they're selling houses. Every day they had 11 offers on one property in one day, like there's a lot happening in real estate right now.

125
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.910
Jessica Freeman: And that's great but

126
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am just having a

127
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.090
Jessica Freeman: Tough time working from home.

128
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable. Definitely. When you are in a house.

129
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 seven with no reprieve

130
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.800
Jessica Freeman: Toil know three days.

131
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it does kind of where on. Yeah.

132
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense. I

133
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:40.290
Jessica Freeman: Feel like I'm not getting enough done in any capacity, like I should be doing key in your hands out of your pants I should be doing.

134
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.670
Jessica Freeman: Like more engaging of my son. You know, like educational shit he doesn't care. He's not going to pay attention to you learning

135
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:55.950
Jessica Freeman: I did order a water table and it should be here on April 1 because he loves water weather's nice or it's getting nicer. It's not

136
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:07.920
Jessica Freeman: Great right now, warm, it's overcast, which is rare for Albuquerque. Anyway, I got a water table, it should be here soon. And he'll love that like pill spend hours out there making a mess.

137
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.660
Jessica Freeman: On the board, which is fine.

138
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.390
Jessica Freeman: I got him some Plato.

139
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.750
Jessica Freeman: But I mean I feel like I should be doing more

140
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:24.960
Jessica Freeman: And then with work. I should definitely be doing more. I mean, the house I have plenty of time to clean the house, house is a mess. I'm

141
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.140
Jessica Freeman: My definition of a mess.

142
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.030
Jessica Freeman: Which

143
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.560
Jessica Freeman: Is better than a lot of people, but what are you gonna do

144
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you able

145
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.820

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, the systems, not portable as I was going to say when your mom comes to watch your son. Are you able to leave the house. You can go sit in like Starbucks parking lot. You don't have to go out and engage with anybody, but connect with their Wi Fi and be able to just get some peace.

148
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.750
Jessica Freeman: Nah man, all the stuff on that first of all the computers not portable, like you said, and also

149
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:27.270
Jessica Freeman: There's a lot of, you know, private information on the computer and it's like enormous so I wouldn't be able to sit in the car wouldn't be able to go into Starbucks. My only, the only time I get to focus on work is when he goes to my moms like he they took him or

150
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.840
Jessica Freeman: I got five solid hours of work in on Sunday, which was great.

151
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.710
Jessica Freeman: Should be back. Um,

152
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.740

155
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What they say

156
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:25.710
Jessica Freeman: Was that it was fine. I don't care. This is a weird situation I'm new. They haven't even had an opportunity to train me like I'm

157
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.570
Jessica Freeman: On an island.

158
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

159
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely don't like it.

160
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.950
Jessica Freeman: I don't like it at all.

161
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you FaceTime in your friends from Indiana Indianapolis.

162
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:54.870
Jessica Freeman: And I'm texting texting. Some no real FaceTime, although I will say that my brother who lives in Portugal hosted a, like a family's zoom meeting and there were like nine of my cousins and aunts and uncles and

163
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.400
Jessica Freeman: He had

164
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.590
Jessica Freeman: A rush

165
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.150
Jessica Freeman: Quiet, honey. My God.

166
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.700
Jessica Freeman: Can you hear him.

167
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:06.510
Yeah.

168
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay.

169
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.170
Jessica Freeman: Sweetie pie singing his little love songs over there.

170
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:21.030
Jessica Freeman: And he's cost me a fortune with them like iPad games. Every 10 minutes. He's like,

171
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.030
Jessica Freeman: Well isn't saying like, look what

172
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.200
Jessica Freeman: He can't talk but

173
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:26.760
Jessica Freeman: I want this, I want this.

174
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.300
Jessica Freeman: No, no new games, no new game.

175
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.040
Jessica Freeman: Spending like

176
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.410
Jessica Freeman: $25 on new games every day.

177
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.830
Game.

178
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.980
Jessica Freeman: Doesn't even play with the ones he has

179
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of like the look of them. Hmm.

180
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.020
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, also with this whole like stimulus thing.

181
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:55.680
Jessica Freeman: I'm trying to make sure that the IRS has the information that they need so that I can get

182
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.750
Jessica Freeman: Our stimulus money as my old accountant screwed up.

183
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.400
Jessica Freeman: And I had to file an amended return. And then last year was key and dad's year

184
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.330
Jessica Freeman: To claim them and now I have a court order this as I can and for 2019 and every year from now on.

185
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:25.020
Jessica Freeman: So that's actually what I was doing when you call me. I got my custody order and I printed it highlighted the parts that were important about the stimulus.

186
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:35.970
Jessica Freeman: And then Bob. My mom's husband is checking to make sure they have my credit address. And I don't think they had my checking account information. Since my old account is a dumb ass.

187
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.670
Jessica Freeman: So I gotta figure out

188
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:49.500
Jessica Freeman: How to Make sure they have all the current information. I mean, if they mail it they mail it. I just need to make sure they have the right address. And if they're not giving any child credit Collin.

189
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.850
Jessica Freeman: No, no child credit to that mother.

190
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he claimed him last year.

191
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:06.270
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, we had a custody order in place and then when I moved and I took advantage of the opportunity

192
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:17.070
Jessica Freeman: And I got everything I wanted, including a name change so kid's name will no longer be hyphenated with his dad's last name can be a freeman

193
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.920
Jessica Freeman: I just got the order like the signed executed order recently.

194
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:35.070
Jessica Freeman: So I got to do all this stuff with the Social Security office and get him a new birth certificate and all that stuff. And it's just like with everything that's going on right now. It's very low priority. I'm just going to wait until

195
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.680
Jessica Freeman: Anyway,

196
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're gonna have like

197
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You said you're gonna wait until that's all I heard

198
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.690
Jessica Freeman: YOU FOR A MINUTE. WAIT UNTIL things kind of settled down

199
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.460
Jessica Freeman: I mean I have to go.

200
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:03.870
Jessica Freeman: Into the Department of Health, the Department of Health is busy right now so I kind of want to let things settle down.

201
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:17.520
Jessica Freeman: With the coronavirus before I try to initiate that, you know, that's my part. That's my small part of helping is to not have super make superfluous requests when they're bigger priorities.

202
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That even a DMV isn't

203
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In full operational.

204
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, at all. I know.

Good job.

228
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.010
Jessica Freeman: That's a big deal for him.

229
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's okay.

230
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:19.470
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and he usually waves backwards. But then if you wave backwards at him, he'll away forwards.

231
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's funny.

232
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.260
Jessica Freeman: You know, he's not receiving any services.

233
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.860
Jessica Freeman: So we're having some behavioral regression, you know,

234
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.140
Jessica Freeman: We've gone way backwards with food, just in a couple of weeks.

235
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.770
Jessica Freeman: He's not getting speech. He's not getting OT. He's not getting ABA. He's not getting shit.

236
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.850
Jessica Freeman: And I wouldn't swear. Except he doesn't repeat anything so

237
00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:04.320
Jessica Freeman: You know, once he starts talking with if he ever started shocking because there's a chance that he might not talk like that i they told me to prepare myself that he'd be never talk

238
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:12.210
Jessica Freeman: And like I see mobs of autistic kids on my groups on Facebook and you know their kids are 13 and still don't talk and

239
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.540
Jessica Freeman: We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

240
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:17.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

241
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.050
Jessica Freeman: This early intervention stuff is super important and you're not getting anything

242
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until how long

243
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's on a waiting list right

244
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:34.440
Jessica Freeman: Well, until school real and and I don't know if this is going to make the waitlist for ABA longer

245
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:46.260
Jessica Freeman: Since everybody's out right now I don't know because they have to staff, they have to make sure they have staff for each and every student or patient, I guess, because it is medical

246
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.060
Jessica Freeman: And

247
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.460
Jessica Freeman: I just, I don't know how long it's gonna last, I don't know what it's going to impact, but I do know this kid needs services and he's not getting them.

248
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:08.760
Jessica Freeman: And there's really not much I can do. I'm like, you know, looked around, but I'm sorry but like special needs people are the ones that are getting the short end of the stick on this. There's really

249
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:18.720
Jessica Freeman: What are you going to do nothing we can't do. He needs in person therapy and until the social distancing can be relaxed and he can go back to school.

250
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.600
Jessica Freeman: just is what it is.

251
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's tough. And it sucks, right. These are the things that's out of our control.

252
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just gotta kind of do

253
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The best that you can do, you know,

254
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.130
Jessica Freeman: You just need some attention.

255
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.300
Jessica Freeman: He's nice.

256
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's a cutie pie.

257
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:35.340
Jessica Freeman: Thank you. He really gonna lie, adorable needs a haircut. But those are torture and when i doing those right now so

258
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.540
Is he getting

259
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is he getting out at all to be

260
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:52.860
Jessica Freeman: Well, I can't take him for a walk and run away. I can't put them on a leash. He's too big for a stroller. So we play in the backyard.

261
00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:12.150
Jessica Freeman: Nana just opened up the pool at her house. It's a heated pool. So we haven't had an opportunity to take advantage of that yet, but he loves water. So we're gonna we're going to use that pool. It's not exactly a gorgeous day right now, but soon enough soon enough.

262
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Soon enough as right

263
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.490
Jessica Freeman: Whole lot so it's snow yesterday in Indianapolis.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow. Yeah.

265
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:34.050
Jessica Freeman: I think I saw somebody on Facebook him. I don't know. It might have been a memory but you know how you go through your Facebook like on this day all the memories and so many, so many are like me being pissed off because of the weather like

266
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.890
Jessica Freeman: So many

267
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.390
Jessica Freeman: Over the years,

268
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not funny.

269
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:48.510
Jessica Freeman: I've been. I mean, I've been trying to get out of Indianapolis forever. And finally, when I accepted that I was like never going to leave is when I finally got an opportunity to leave.

270
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how it works on surrender and here you go.

295
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.220
Jessica Freeman: Done that.

296
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:30.360
Yeah.

297
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.070
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. No.

298
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:44.010
Jessica Freeman: I'm supposed to like to maybe start my own meeting I did look into that. I just didn't get much response. So I'm thinking that once this is all over

299
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:49.950
Jessica Freeman: That I might just start going to some of the meetings that they have at the recovery houses, you know, they have

300
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.870
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, is that recovery houses.

301
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.530
Jessica Freeman: Every day.

302
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:59.190
Jessica Freeman: So maybe just do that. That way I can meet some people that really need what I have to offer.

303
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good idea.

304
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.850
Jessica Freeman: Thanks, of course, to a disease free

305
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This coronas yes

306
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.050

307
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree.

308
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much.

309
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:26.700
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I heard from Dr element. He says, Man, Mr talky talky is gonna be moving this week and may not be in the group anymore.

310
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.370
Jessica Freeman: And you have a Friday 1:30pm group.

311
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.250
Jessica Freeman: But there's some he said there's a similar situation with the person dominating the conversation.

312
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.640
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

313
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.970
Jessica Freeman: Look, I mean, I understand. I know those types. I used to be that type

314
00:29:52.020 --> 00:30:09.810
Jessica Freeman: Um, so I get where they're coming from. But I don't know, I just wish that I wish that the facilitators of the group would do a little more to let everyone have a chance and not not allow him to just go on and on and on.

315
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.200
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think that he can be handled.

316
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.560
Jessica Freeman: But it's not my place to do that.

317
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:17.820
Right.

318
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:33.030
Jessica Freeman: I just got a text from mom, she says, hey, I did not realize that we were going to have workman here at the house at 2pm I should probably watch key in at your house. Let me know what you think.

319
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.490
Jessica Freeman: There goes my

320
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.400
Jessica Freeman: I don't say anything.

321
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.780
Jessica Freeman: I don't respond to anything until I'm calm.

322
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:52.950
Good.

323
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

324
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.590
Jessica Freeman: I learned that early on, you know, when you pop off at the mouth.

325
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.470
Jessica Freeman: And I feel like that's what I've done my whole life is just

326
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.590
Jessica Freeman: So I don't do that.

327
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.200
Jessica Freeman: I hit the pause button.

328
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really good.

329
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes that's really needed. Yeah.

331
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about after the workers leave

332
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.190
Jessica Freeman: Well, yes.

333
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:51.540
Jessica Freeman: She said the workers are coming over at 2pm. Well, why don't you take him like now it you know

334
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:59.880
Jessica Freeman: quality time with him. Maybe I'll suggest that, but obviously that's not what she wants.

335
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.460
Jessica Freeman: She wants to watch him here.

336
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.320
Jessica Freeman: That's what she wants.

337
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.980
Jessica Freeman: She needs help.

338
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

339
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think it'd be a good suggestion.

340
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.470

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just really voice that you need this time.

342
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alone.

343
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

344
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.460
Jessica Freeman: You know, I've talked to her about it over and over again, mom. My mom.

345
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:38.010
Jessica Freeman: I recognize that she has difficulty maintaining boundaries, like other like respecting other people's boundaries.

346
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.960
Jessica Freeman: And I've had to

347
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:50.070
Jessica Freeman: Maintain them, you know, in opposition to her many, many times. So, but I know how to be gentle.

Jessica Freeman: You know, it used to take me

351
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:06.900
Jessica Freeman: Hours sometimes days times weeks. I mean, I used to be so mad for so long, you know, can you hear me.

363
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.890

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was trying to think of other avenues that you're able to get some seclusion time

378
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.160
Jessica Freeman: I thought maybe

379
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:14.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nobody was going in the office, but one person demand the phones that it'd be a perfect time for you to be able to go in. Sit your

409
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:26.160
Jessica Freeman: He has an OT swing. You know, like it's a big round swing that just kind of goes in all directions. And so, you know, that's another reason we could take him. He needs that he needs that and stuff and I you know only so much I can do here. I don't have a million and a half dollar mansion.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got any good to just sit and what is you know you you have that mindset where you want to be someplace else and then you're not present, where you're at. And so it's about saying, I know that I have these things I need to do.

452
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm going to do them, but right now this is where I'm leaving.

453
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

454
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:24.870
Jessica Freeman: Can go out back, but we can't go for a why okay yet, honey. We'll go, we'll go soon.

455
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

456
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.500
Jessica Freeman: They both

457
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have a lot of attention.

458
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, I bet I'm sure you're the only person you know your mom comes over, you don't have a whole lot of, you know, they don't have a whole lot of interaction but you, you know,

459
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.380
Jessica Freeman: Uh huh.

460
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.910
Jessica Freeman: She just read my message.

461
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:56.100
Jessica Freeman: I've got to run some errands today, I gotta go to the store and I don't take I'm not taking him. I don't take him out.

462
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:01.590
Jessica Freeman: On Air and I don't want him expose anything because he gets sick really easily.

463
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.490
Jessica Freeman: He's had chronic ear infections and

464
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.530
Jessica Freeman: He said tubes, put in his ears. One of them has like he's outgrown it

465
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.120
Jessica Freeman: Maybe the other one. And he just it's been, I don't know, a couple months.

466
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.080
Jessica Freeman: Since they were checked, but

467
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.880
Jessica Freeman: I just don't want to expose them to anything.

468
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.520
Jessica Freeman: You're right. So be present. Okay, so

469
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.270
Jessica Freeman: You know what I should do is like

470
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:43.050
Jessica Freeman: Right now out a schedule for the day. You know, like every day like these, because I know like there are things that I need to do every day. And so maybe making a schedule will make it

471
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.640
Jessica Freeman: Will help me to focus on what I'm doing.

472
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.130
Jessica Freeman: When I'm doing it, you know.

473
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:50.580
Right.

474
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.190
Jessica Freeman: I'm kind of structure. I need, I need that like I need structure that's why going to work is good for me.

475
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:10.620
Jessica Freeman: When I LIVED IN THE RECOVERY HOUSE, YOU KNOW, I had to structure things and that's what got me back on track. And I like to have a structured routine.

476
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.090
Jessica Freeman: Life and this is really out of whack right now.

477
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is

478
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And knowing that and accepting the fact that it's really basically out of your control right now and just working within the boundaries that you have right

479
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being being present when you're, you know, with the baby and

480
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, pulling yourself out of being present when you're focusing on something else that makes sense.

481
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.200
Jessica Freeman: Yes.

482
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you can't live in, you know, if you keep your mind in the I should be doing this, I should be doing that I should be doing this and

483
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're staying, you know, in a place that is going to get you nowhere.

484
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got to peer out of that and say, you know, this is where I am right now. These are the things I'd like to accomplish today.

485
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But be okay you know don't attach yourself to the outcome if you're not able to get all of them completed, you know,

486
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:15.930
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

487
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like being okay with that, you know,

488
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things come up all the time. And you know how we think that they should turn out it could turn out completely opposite be completely out of our control.

489
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.590
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, like

490
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.270
Jessica Freeman: Today he was supposed to be gone.

491
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:43.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just kind of taking what you got. And working with it. You know, like you do in in every other area, you know, you can't let what's going on.

492
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: affect you. You've got to keep feeding you know your positivity. You've got to keep feeding you know your recovery. You've got to take care of you. You know what I mean. And I can tell you know that

493
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The last 12 days are wearing on you. Yeah, I see it.

494
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:03.960
Jessica Freeman: There.

495
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet, being able to go to the grocery store today just getting out and getting away and breathing.

496
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It in time for you.

497
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go into the grocery store slowly.

498
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

499
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.490
Yeah.

500
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.360
Jessica Freeman: Wish I could go get my nails done.

501
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.660
Jessica Freeman: Or closed.

502
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know, isn't that crazy

503
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would, you would think that's a, that's a nice, but

504
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:35.490
Jessica Freeman: It is

505
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.010
Jessica Freeman: What happens when you're, you know, you're acrylic

506
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.420
Jessica Freeman: Needs a repair.

507
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

508
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.680
Jessica Freeman: Careful, careful

509
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.510
Jessica Freeman: He's in my room.

510
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember that it was supposed to be 14 days and you're on day 12

511
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.160
This is true.

512
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:14.940
Jessica Freeman: And 15 days to slow spread and, you know, I've been keeping up on stuff I'm keeping an eye on the numbers and Indiana.

513
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:37.020
Jessica Freeman: And the numbers in New Mexico, we're doing really well here like we just had 100 positives as of today, just had one death as of yesterday. So you Mexico is like 40 s down the list as far as numbers Indiana is higher.

514
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.570
Jessica Freeman: You know they've got

515
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.520
Jessica Freeman: Significantly more positives and more deaths.

516
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.370
Jessica Freeman: My son, my, you know, nearly 17 year old. And just a couple of days have a sanity.

517
00:47:52.560 --> 00:48:00.420
Jessica Freeman: He lives in Indiana and actually mom and I had an awesome idea, a few days ago this was before some more of the restrictions were put down, but we're like,

518
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:12.090
Jessica Freeman: We should get him out here, you know, he's not in school, he can just use your school work online, you know, let's go here because he would be such a big help, and it would be so amazing to spend some time with them, you know,

519
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.870
Jessica Freeman: But his dad is the, you know,

520
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:18.930
Jessica Freeman: It's them.

521
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.700
Jessica Freeman: So that's not happening.

522
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.500
Jessica Freeman: If you're going

523
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.610
Jessica Freeman: On yeah

524
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you ask

525
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.990
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, we asked. Yeah, and then

526
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.560
Jessica Freeman: And then his dad.

527
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.530
Jessica Freeman: Ignore the request for 48 hours.

528
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.200
Jessica Freeman: And come here.

529
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:54.450
Jessica Freeman: Then when he did get back. Well, I was all vague and, you know, lots of ocean.

530
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.570
Jessica Freeman: Come sit down and put your shoes on.

531
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.610
Jessica Freeman: Right there.

532
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:05.910
Okay.

533
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:14.070
Jessica Freeman: I did get my hopes up there for a few minutes and I shouldn't have, because I know better.

534
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He gave a bunch of excuses why it couldn't happen.

535
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:29.040
Jessica Freeman: Well, they're moving to Texas right I already told you about the, you know, the fact that I don't want my son switching high schools and moving to Texas right before you're here.

536
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah.

537
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:37.950
Jessica Freeman: But his dad is going to do, you know. He's the master of the universe, do whatever he wants. You know,

538
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.050
Jessica Freeman: As long as it's best for Scott. It's what's best for everything right.

539
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:44.610
Jessica Freeman: But

540
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:46.800
He

541
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:53.880
Jessica Freeman: They're moving to Texas. And so now everything is up in the air like oh are we going to move early. Are we going to move late

542
00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:07.920
Jessica Freeman: They were supposed to move in June and now Brendan. My son is like Dad told a cert packing. We don't know, blah, blah, blah. So his dad is using this move to Texas as an excuse to keep Brendan under complete lock and key.

543
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.490
Jessica Freeman: Right here. Let me get your jacket.

544
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.140
Jessica Freeman: Going

545
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:17.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The moving early

546
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:31.380
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. You won't say maybe they're moving early maybe they're moving in June, maybe they're moving later it's all up in the air so that Scott can just keep a hold of them. All right, I'm just going to get your jacket you stay

547
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.960
Jessica Freeman: awake and Neato neato.

548
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.900
Jessica Freeman: So staying present I can do.

549
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.650
Jessica Freeman: To maybe work on these resentments with Scott, a little bit more

550
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:04.710
Jessica Freeman: Ingrained firing now.

551
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:21.090
Jessica Freeman: Just because I'm you know, it's like, wait, it's, it's an old idea. It's an old mindset that I struggle with, um, you know, if I want something a lot if I really, really want something then. Damn it, I should have it right

552
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.640
Jessica Freeman: And I want it now.

553
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:25.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Haha

554
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know, again, it's about asking the question, and not attaching yourself to the outcome.

555
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:36.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

556
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:37.980
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

557
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of hoping for the best, but

558
00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, expecting the worst.

559
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.820
Jessica Freeman: I got my hopes up.

560
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.110
Jessica Freeman: And I knew I shouldn't have.

561
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.340
Jessica Freeman: But it is what it is you know we're worse off than before.

562
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.850
Jessica Freeman: Any chilly out here. Thank you. No.

563
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:04.830
Thank you.

564
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:24.900
Jessica Freeman: Now something very cool is that the backyard is completely safe. There's a wall around the whole thing. And there's gate that he can't get out of. There's really nothing dangerous out here.

565
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:25.770
Jessica Freeman: I can

566
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:34.770
Jessica Freeman: Let him play in the dirt and I can, you know, stay close by and check in on him often. But I don't have to worry about, which is really nice.

567
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.280
Jessica Freeman: Big platform. It is. It is.

568
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.750
Jessica Freeman: I wish there were more grass and less gravel, but whatever.

569
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's a good place for him to be able to get out some energy

570
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.560
Jessica Freeman: That and trampoline.

571
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.340
Jessica Freeman: But you know, it's like, day after day after day after day.

572
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:06.720
Jessica Freeman: But now it's really nice to have some outside toys so he can like shovel in the dirt and like

573
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:17.550
Jessica Freeman: You know, some other stuff. And we do art projects out there. Also, I've been looking at stuff too. I like you can order a kit of stuff like

574
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.700
Jessica Freeman: Like craft supplies.

575
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:33.750
Jessica Freeman: And I think that might be something good at something, I'll enjoy doing and maybe he enjoys it or not, but at least it's something like get feathers and beads and they'll be different textures.

576
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:40.110
Jessica Freeman: Right now his favorite thing to do is for me to open the peanut butter and for

577
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:49.410
Jessica Freeman: For him to run back and forth to the peanut butter pretend like almost putting his, his little racecars into the jar of peanut butter.

578
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:56.850
Jessica Freeman: And I'm like, you know, every time he gets close. I'm like, no, but he loves messing with the peanut butter.

579
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's funny.

580
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:01.680
Yeah.

581
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's

582
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.450
Jessica Freeman: One of a kind, that's for sure.

583
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what do you mean to

584
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me what you're going to do to help

585
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With your store craziness this week.

586
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.850
Jessica Freeman: Well, I'm gonna go to the grocery store today.

587
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.910
Jessica Freeman: You know what before. And second, I see for your opinion.

588
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.690
Sure.

589
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:34.410
Jessica Freeman: Is it a terrible idea to tell my new employer that working from home is not working for me.

590
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that when you're being up front and you're being true to you.

591
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing horrible about that.

592
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.170
Jessica Freeman: I mean I'm trying really hard.

593
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.230
Jessica Freeman: It's just, it doesn't work. I can barely get this hour with you. You know, like

594
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.830
Yeah.

595
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So maybe you know maybe it's a good idea that you

596
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let them know that

597
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

598
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and I mean I've discussed it with

599
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.510
Jessica Freeman: You know, two of the people on the team just not not the bosses.

600
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:36.210
Jessica Freeman: So, um, yeah, I think, I think I may have to do that because it'll take a lot of pressure off of me. I know I'll feel better if I don't have to worry about making sure I get four hours of working every day.

601
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:43.560
Jessica Freeman: And can I want to, but anyway. Okay, so

602
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:54.390
Jessica Freeman: To answer your question. You said, What am I going to do, I'm going to go to the grocery store. Today I'm going to enjoy being out of the house. I'm going to

603
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.820
Jessica Freeman: I mean, like, I've talked to my mom 500 times about the fact that she needs to like take him.

604
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.400
Hey,

605
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:14.880
Jessica Freeman: Boy Hey you.

606
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.940
Jessica Freeman: Know, sorry.

607
00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.000
Jessica Freeman: No iPad in the dirt.

608
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:35.220
Jessica Freeman: Um, I guess me. I don't know. So maybe I need to accept the fact that she's just going to watch him here and that are you going to break. Maybe I just need to accept that.

609
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:42.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And work within the boundaries that you're given to the best of your ability, you know,

610
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When she comes over there, you can always go take a hot bath, a long shower and

611
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can go to your room.

612
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Except that the baby's gonna you know be knocking on the door, be prepared for that. Right. You're a boss, you know, in Gmail, let them know about your struggles, so that you're 100% transparent.

613
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And write down a schedule.

614
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: daily schedule.

615
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.110
Jessica Freeman: I don't want to get your

616
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:32.790
Jessica Freeman: Ear lady.

617
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:43.680
Jessica Freeman: Right.

618
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.360
Jessica Freeman: Did I miss anything.

619
00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Continue reaching out and go into your meetings and talking to your new sober friend.

620
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:03.990
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

621
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:08.340
Jessica Freeman: And

622
00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:19.950
Jessica Freeman: Find other ways of self care like

623
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:35.190
Jessica Freeman: Maybe you know one of the things that drives me nuts. Is that like this dangerous word I should I should like my house should be cleaner, like I should have stuff organized because here I am, I'm at home all the time. All this stuff should be getting done.

624
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:44.040
Jessica Freeman: So maybe I put that into my schedule. Maybe I give myself an hour a day to like unpack and organize and

625
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:51.510
Jessica Freeman: Then I will be so hard on myself about it because I'll make some some slow progress.

626
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a great idea.

627
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you think about your show to

628
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about how

629
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much you actually need the sugar.

630
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How real important. Is it

631
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:24.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you gonna have a party at your house is are you going to have a bunch of people over there. Is it going to be inspected. What is the big need

632
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To accomplish these things, you know, all of these things in one day.

633
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:36.750
Jessica Freeman: Or, you know, even over the course of many days I've been here for 12 days.

634
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.590
Jessica Freeman: And it's trashed, you know,

635
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.720
Jessica Freeman: Look at all the cars.

636
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:45.270
Jessica Freeman: And then

637
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:47.790
Jessica Freeman: I had to check on the kids.

638
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:52.590
Jessica Freeman: Okay, I can do all this, I have a good list. I feel good about it.

639
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

640
00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.080
Jessica Freeman: Thank you. I know I was kind of a Debbie Downer today.

641
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nope. It happens. I mean, this is a time right now. You know what I mean, and realizing and understanding that, you know, working from home doesn't work for some people and

642
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:18.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you just kind of need to own it and realize that

643
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.080
Jessica Freeman: Who knows how long was last

644
01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:39.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Night. There's no time limit. And, you know, time limit is

645
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On you. Right. You're the only one that's putting this on you. So you've got to kind of break that way. It's okay. It's okay.

646
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's gonna happen, get them done a little bit at a time. You know what I mean, don't stress about it. Don't you know

647
01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't think that you're not doing everything that you should be doing.

648
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because if you think about what you are doing, you're still doing a lot

649
01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For that

650
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.870
Jessica Freeman: I agree.

651
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you stay in when really, when you stay in the worst because you stay out of, out of the items right

652
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's in the negativity and out of the box.

664
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.220
Jessica Freeman: And how many people are escaping right now with like alcohol and drugs right now like

665
01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:51.120
Jessica Freeman: That's what I would be doing. I would spend every dime that I had on all the drugs and all the alcohol and then that's all I would be doing is to get through the time just to pass the time.

666
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.680
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but I don't live like that anymore. So
