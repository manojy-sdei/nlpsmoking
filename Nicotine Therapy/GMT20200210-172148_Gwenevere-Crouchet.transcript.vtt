00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.450
Hello.

3
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh soundtrack can't hear you. Yet we're waiting for sound to come on

4
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Online.

5
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.270
Can't hear you just yet, test, test, test, hmm.

6
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.050
Jaime44: I still can't hear you.

7
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, what does that say something

8
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.570
Jaime44: Okay. Can you hear me now.

9
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it now. Okay.

10
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have like this huge deductible. Is that what the hang up is

11
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone.

12
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I think that's fine. I don't think the docs going to have any problem with that.

13
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because you you are you're tapering you're working the stuff you and I are doing. I'm not, I'm not concerned, are you concerned about it.

14
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.490
Jaime44: No, I think it'll be fine. Yeah, I figured. At this point, I think it is any before

15
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.000
Jaime44: Different. But I think at this point I'm okay.

16
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get into a note here for us.

17
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe even change. I've got it. There's two different databases. I want to change the frequency of of groups to

18
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.070
Okay.

19
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.950
Jaime44: Thank you.

20
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.060
Thank you.

21
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.070
Jaime44: Thank you.

22
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Can on the dock only wears white. I don't know if you've ever noticed that. And I was like, That's annoying. It's annoying and now I'm like

23
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I haven't noticed, and I were in a lot too.

24
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it goes with everything. And I'm not hung up on you know what after April or May or whatever. I'm not hung up on that etiquette thing so

25
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.090
Jaime44: Oh, they're white after Labor Day thing.

26
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Every day that's

27
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want

28
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Florida, who cares.

29
00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:07.770
Jaime44: Okay, funny that you mentioned that because last year at the end of the year during labor day whenever Labor Day is last year I had, I bought some really cute white capris and so I Googled it likes and you when do not wear white and it said that that's kind of a

30
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.380
Jaime44: Fashion fad of the past so that more people are starting to wear white so

31
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I think if that's if that's my biggest fo pop

32
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be just fine. I have so many bigger issues than that.

33
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Let me get in here for us. We got a note. Alright. So where am I finding you. What are you in Denver.

34
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.250
Yes.

35
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you could

36
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe find an actual address. I always need to know for safety kind of where exactly you are in case there's an emergency if you can read that.

37
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.330
Jaime44: Oh, the address here at the hotel.

38
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.750
Jaime44: Yeah, it is 1975

39
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.440
Jaime44: South Colorado Boulevard.

40
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.080
Jaime44: It's called the lucky into in Denver Cherry Creek.

41
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.700
dokey. Actually, we're doing

42
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.330
Our time today.

43
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.050
Alright.

44
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So how's your sleep. How's your energy level. How's your mood, Ben.

45
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.350
Jaime44: Well today I'm exhausted, because I worked all night long. I saw them going to sleep. Yes.

46
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.750
Jaime44: Hey,

47
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.740
Jaime44: I had to retrain the night auditor here and then we finally had a security companies start last night. And so I kind of

48
00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.120
Jaime44: The security guards there. It's really hard to find a good security guard when it's a graveyard shift.

49
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.250
Jaime44: Oh, all they want to do a sleep.

50
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.460
Jaime44: They want to get paid to sleep.

51
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:15.720
Jaime44: Last night I went and changed out of my work clothes and went and sat down in the lobby and jeans and a hoodie and waited for the security guy to come in.

52
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:24.150
Jaime44: I was just sitting there hanging out in the lobby and he walked in, he introduces himself grabs a radio walk back out to his car and flips the feedback.

53
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I get

54
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.690
Jaime44: To go to sleep, just

55
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:38.850
Jaime44: Like then didn't miss a beat. I WAS JUST BAFFLED I've never seen it happen so fast. Normally, it takes them a couple hours or mid shift, you can catch him sleeping, but

56
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What did you do

57
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.200
Jaime44: I went on there, knocked on his window.

58
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:53.520
Jaime44: And I said, I'm the General Manager. Um, and I don't appreciate you sleeping when I'm paying you to watch my property right now.

59
00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.510
Jaime44: So I did email his boss and let them know that he, I don't want that guy on this post so

60
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: did he end up getting up and walking around at least

61
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.930
Jaime44: He did. He kept saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

62
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.340
Uh huh.

63
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.580
Yeah.

64
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.050
Jaime44: Yeah.

65
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.850
Jaime44: Things things here have been good.

66
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.910
Jaime44: They're stabilizing

67
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me see what what in what, how many milligrams you that now are you at the 10

68
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.900
Jaime44: Yes.

69
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Any sort of withdrawal going on.

70
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.030
Jaime44: No. Nope. We're doing pretty good.

71
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to wait another week. What do you want to do.

72
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.430
Jaime44: Yeah.

73
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.320
Jaime44: Okay, so okay well

74
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's talk about the sessions for just a second, so I can get myself oriented. If we're meeting now. Yeah.

75
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need medication or you're all set up.

76
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.570
Jaime44: You know, I need medication today.

77
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.990
Jaime44: If I'm not going to group tomorrow.

78
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But how would you get it. How would you get it, you

79
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.480
Jaime44: Want that I emailed Dr. Gabriel and member of you and I talked about those last last time and

80
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:32.310
Jaime44: You were saying it wasn't good for her license and so I emailed her and gave her a heads up about what was going to happen where I was going to be at this day.

81
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:49.230
Jaime44: And he said that she would go ahead and she said she understood you off, but she said that Glenn are very is correct. But if she does it. Once in a while. It's not going to throw any red flags. So okay, so you said to just make sure I get her the pharmacy address and stuff today. Okay.

82
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you'll email for that.

83
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.130
Jaime44: Yeah. All right, let me just

84
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Some basically we'll go

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Next group will be February 18

86
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you think you'll be back in town, then

87
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.730
Jaime44: I'm not going to be back until the 21st. That sounds familiar.

88
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, but you'll still attend on the 18th

89
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.540
Yes.

90
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And let me just get out of here, go over to slack messaged her

91
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.720
There it is. Alright, cool.

92
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.230
Jamie

93
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.420
Is

94
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.150
Need

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To next Tuesday.

96
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I will say, Keep an eye out in your email.

97
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: For

98
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Our pharmacy in pharmacy. I'm just gonna say it up.

99
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.090
Jaime44: Yeah, I'm sending that to her right now as you were typing.

100
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:15.810
OK.

101
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. Also, I'm going to mention

102
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say due to

103
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Insurance.

104
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: She will be attending

105
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This week,

106
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Every other week.

107
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go in here.

108
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.000
Jaime44: Well,

109
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to see where we left off.

110
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We did some work in developing the anchor room. It looks like.

111
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Hi.

112
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.960
Jaime44: It really helps to

113
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.030
Jaime44: Like visualize those things I didn't really realize it be

114
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:35.280
Jaime44: I didn't really realize it until like this last week when I felt like I was using it more like the whole watch it, you know, visualizing you know what you need to put away visualizing it put going downstream and that kind of stuff. It's just crazy how your mind works like that.

115
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it you think it'd be hokey, and then it wouldn't work. Um,

116
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.650
Jaime44: Yeah.

117
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But the very thoughts that are upsetting us because they're attached to this big amygdala emotional reaction.

118
00:12:51.210 --> 00:13:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if we have this other thought it's not attached to a big negative emotion, maybe even a positive one of anticipation of positive outcome. And we can change how we feel pretty neat.

119
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.680
Jaime44: Right, yeah. And when we worked on the

120
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.810
Jaime44: Um, you know, in the anchor room when it was, I don't

121
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.150
Jaime44: Know what I pictured my dad just acknowledging me being molested

122
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.840
Jaime44: Many times I thought about that. This week, and it just

123
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.950
Jaime44: I don't know. I just don't have that ache anymore, you know,

124
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something just

125
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.650
Weird

126
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.610
Jaime44: Feels good.

127
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so it's almost like just the way you just send it. Um, it seemed a little bit less intense like just even being able to say it.

128
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and that's that's what this. That's what this CMDR is is for as well, which is

129
00:13:47.610 --> 00:14:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To sort of desensitize the this experience. And then, you know, open up this network and have more positive thoughts around a particular image of history, but I've been doing this one long before we were doing the FDR stuff this. I love this is one of my go tues

130
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.080
The Sanger

131
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.780
Jaime44: Interesting. I like it.

132
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, have you used it for, let's say coming across a decision that you need to make and going there, visually, like let's say

133
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's coming out. Maybe you're going to be talking with your mom or something. But it typically sort of summon up some negative feelings. You can go and imagine that you're solving the problem or working through it in that space. Some people use it literally as a coping skill.

134
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Like okay, I need to do some breath work. I'm going to picture myself I'm doing my breathing in this in this safe the safe room.

135
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's my question. Oh, I have a decision between this and this and what do I need, what am I resources.

136
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, they kind of do all that decision making in there. So it's not impulsive and it's something that they're going to feel really good about the decision that they make.

137
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:17.040
Jaime44: No, I didn't. I guess I didn't, I'm not really sure why, but I didn't really think about using it like that and light hearted situations like that.

138
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.300
Jaime44: But i mean i i'm very I'm struggling

139
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:30.510
Jaime44: Trying to figure out where to go with my promotion. I don't know where to you know what city to apply what state to apply what to do so.

140
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Good idea. What a what a published dilemma, though.

141
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.570
Right.

142
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So what about are you including maybe some of what your, your son wants to are you leaving him there with people is coming with you what to plan.

143
00:15:51.060 --> 00:16:01.890
Jaime44: He's coming with me. Definitely it's. There's just, there's good and bad things like it's it's definitely going to be difficult to move further away from Greg.

144
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:18.930
Jaime44: And just difficult to start all over. You know, in general, in a different city where you don't know anybody and but at the same time, you know, I'm being promoted to General Manager. This is what I've been fighting to do for so long.

145
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you know what, it also makes me think about not that this would make a difference for you but bright hearts treatment isn't in every state.

146
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

147
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:37.560
Jaime44: And that's important as well. I mean, I, this is a good program. I like this program. So I definitely want to stick with it.

148
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When I when I looked on their website. I look I'll see a state like like Denver. I know they don't have it in Colorado and

149
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I know they want to, but the meaning. So, yeah.

150
00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:07.800
Jaime44: I'll look into that. And so actually, it's, I'm glad you brought that up. That's a good starting point. Because, I mean, this right here. I feel like is is truly my lifeline. At this point in my life, I need this. So,

151
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.950
Jaime44: That's very important. I need to look that up.

152
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might. It might just be a tipping point, it might not be the central decision maker, but it might tip the scale, one way or another.

153
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.280
Jaime44: You know,

154
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I know they have. I know it's Tennessee. Let me just see.

155
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.160
Jaime44: What about Texas, you know, they're in Texas. That's a good question. I'm going

156
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To pull up the website here.

157
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.320
Okay.

158
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.650
We got to change the logo or no.

159
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:40.710
Texas.

160
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:56.340
I'm too deep into the portal and this one. I don't have a gentleman home at home a home.

161
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have a couple of states what I'll do. I'm not seeing

162
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What I wanted right away and I don't want to waste any more of your time on that. I'm going to just send a message to this gal.

163
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's kind of assigned to me to help. Um, what are some of the states, you'd like you're considering

164
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:50.730
Jaime44: So it would be pretty much the surrounding surrounding states like Nevada, Arizona, Texas.

165
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.400
Okay.

166
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.670
Jaime44: I kind of want to stay around

167
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.170
Jaime44: Okay.

168
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I said, do we have services in two we have

169
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right heart health services in Texas about Arizona, Colorado.

170
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

171
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.650
Thank you.

172
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.940
Jaime44: You guys aren't in Colorado.

173
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No kidding. But, but it's

174
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's phrases that you, you know, you just wouldn't guess, like, well, maybe they started to have some clinicians there and they they fell away or a particular doctor that they're trying to get on boarded

175
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The something with their licensing went sideways with the insurance. I mean, it's so complicated.

176
00:19:52.320 --> 00:20:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing to do with it. I found getting my license media conveniently forgotten. But finding getting my new mexico license was was pretty easy. I think it's because Florida is pretty strict so I have a difficult one to get. So then other states are like, well,

177
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just kind of grandfather and

178
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There wasn't there wasn't too much to do. I didn't think so. Anyway,

179
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:24.300
Jaime44: So if you want to practice in each state, you have to get a license for every state they practice. Yeah.

180
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know, right, because each state has their own laws.

181
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.640
Yeah.

182
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you need to know those those laws. Alright, let's get back into your record here and have you had a chance to sort of

183
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Communicate with mom.

184
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.360
No.

185
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you didn't want to, or that's just the way the week when

186
00:20:54.330 --> 00:21:02.820
Jaime44: I mean, yeah, she was just the farthest thing from my mind is like, I mean, I do think about my mother because I love her, but like as far as working on our issues are kind of

187
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.460
Jaime44: Having like that heart to heart like the conversation that I want to have with her, it just

188
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:10.920
Jaime44: Hasn't

189
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.930
Jaime44: I haven't felt that yeah this this week as just haven't

190
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.710
Jaime44: I've been super busy with work works just been

191
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:33.750
Jaime44: It's just kind of, I feel like it's just crunch time at this point. And I'm trying to get my name out there and do everything I can to be seen.

192
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So you said you do want to have a conversation with your mom, there's something you kind of want to have one like these big one like let's have a

193
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:53.970
Radio

194
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.740
Jaime44: And I think, you know,

195
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.190
Jaime44: I think 50% of the conversation. I want it to be about

196
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:24.210
Jaime44: Things that I feel like like I want her to know that this hurt me. And I want her to know that this was what I wanted, when we, when I grew up, and and and I want that closure to that. And then the other part of me wants to do it because I want her to

197
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.630
Jaime44: I'm hoping that

198
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:37.050
Jaime44: That me going through counseling and that kind of stuff that motivates her to want her to better herself in that way to

199
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:52.110
Jaime44: Like my mom had a very shitty childhood. She did. And she's carried this her whole life. She has she needs to go to counseling. She's got to go to talk to somebody, and I think it's still, it's still affecting her at 56

200
00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:01.800
Jaime44: And I just, I love her and I want her to know that counseling. You're not a weak person for going to counseling, but you need that you need it.

201
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that one is going to be a little harder. Yeah, right, because she's her own person. She, she may be afraid.

202
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.520
No.

203
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.880
Jaime44: Yeah, people are afraid.

204
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:28.440
Jaime44: Just everything my mom's I've never seen a woman so emotionally detach this crazy to me.

205
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.690
All right, let's just come down here.

206
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We have, we are really setup here we've got lots of stuff that distancing metaphor container team got an anchor room put together. We could spend some time doing some some em, Dr. If you'd like, what are you on a tablet laptop. What do you want

207
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.210
Jaime44: On my laptop.

Gwenevere Abriel: So is there is there.

209
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.050
Let's see, how would we get to that network.

210
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I'll do, I'll look at the notes from inside the anchor room work that you did last time, some of the themes that came up where

211
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.760
Me see where it is.

212
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, why was I left alone.

213
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That was something your chair.

214
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to see if there was a any negative thought about

215
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Why was I left alone didn't know and

216
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Jamie. When you think of that.

217
00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That time in your life. Like, why was, you know, why was I left alone and and i don't know what the imagery was for you because you don't have to share it to you these exercises.

218
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the predominant belief about yourself at that time in your life.

219
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.960
Jaime44: I didn't. They didn't matter that nobody cared enough. Yeah.

220
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And just as you said that. Where did that land in your body just now.

221
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In your gut in my chest chess yes yeah that's that's a key spot chest. Yeah, I don't matter. That's a big one. Yeah.

222
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now, how stressed. Are you from them. Let's say zero to

223
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:58.710
Jaime44: 100 I'd say probably three or four, I thought that a little bit, but not I wouldn't say it's too severe, but I did feel that. Okay.

224
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and what age was that image just now.

225
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:09.810
Jaime44: I'm for it was, I had to been four or five real there.

226
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the chest. That's a physical sensation was it tight.

227
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.770
Jaime44: So,

228
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.300
Jaime44: Just at like it. You can go back, take that first party. Okay.

229
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And what what do we label the emotion. You're at about 30 in distress and what emotion. Are you feeling right now.

230
00:26:48.990 --> 00:27:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Might not be a strong, it might, but it's okay why things don't have to be at 100 they can be. But you check in with the body want to go there and say okay well you know what's going on in here with the with the ache and you went from chest to heart ache.

231
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.500
And thought

232
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I thought. Yeah.

233
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we can do a little bit of work with this this morning, if you like.

234
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can think about

235
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can do some some desensitisation with it. Yeah. And what would the, what would be the positive thought that she would have liked to have had with that image.

236
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.560
Jaime44: That I would say that I was protected. Yeah.

237
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.720
Jaime44: I'd say that my parents did care about me.

238
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I am cared for.

239
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And for a moment, sort of be present with this imagery of the team.

240
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your dad and safety with with grey and just how they have that quality about them. You know what I mean. You have that consciousness and your grandma.

241
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As a nurturing figure and you as a mom, your ability to you know be listened to and guide you

242
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And also your ability to you know you deeply know how much you love your son, right, that no matter what, no matter what you love them sort of be present with that.

243
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And then bring also this awareness with your dad, who's not only this protective figure but also he's wise to just be present with that for a moment. You can close your eyes and just just sort of melt with those qualities

244
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: See them interacting. Maybe you're there, maybe, maybe you are those qualities, at times, and other times maybe their bodies in someone else and just sort of get a visual

245
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you have that imagery just kind of scan your body and kind of bring bring awareness from the toes up

246
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Heels and calves and knees.

247
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Thighs

248
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Your seat volans as it meets the support of a chair in this bed.

249
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The back

250
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The hands and ours.

251
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And having it move up.

252
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scanning into the guts, right, the gut and the chest.

253
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention there. That's where there was a register earlier.

254
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: shoulders, neck,

255
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are the john

256
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: cheekbones inside your sockets inside the eyes and

257
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The forehead.

258
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To the top of your head.

259
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get a sense of how you're feeling in your body.

260
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This morning, maybe we can bring in some of the positive thoughts with that imagery and see, see what comes up for you.

261
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're ready, I think we'll, we'll do some of this bilateral

262
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Late back and forth. I think I've got a good study here.

263
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what I want you to do is pull up that most intense negative image.

264
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Perhaps at age four and

265
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Really starting to bring in. Let's see what happens with this bringing in a positive cognition of ultimately

266
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I am protected and I am safe.

267
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, open your eyes.

268
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to bring in the positive cognition.

269
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Tried to hold that WORST piece in this positive cognition, at the same time.

270
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, a nice big belly breath.

271
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

272
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it go

273
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be with that gentle quiet.

274
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

275
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice

276
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.580
Jaime44: Your positive today.

277
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

278
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.060
Jaime44: I feel

279
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:26.370
Jaime44: Like as I'm, I'm, I'm thinking of those moments of being molested, but I'm also

280
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.460
Jaime44: Like I you know I'm picturing

281
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.200
Jaime44: You know,

282
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:38.490
Jaime44: Like my dad and Greg. And my grandma there and it just feels safer. Okay.

283
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.340

Jaime44: It almost

320
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:54.270
Jaime44: Like not as clear, I guess, I guess. Seems a little bit more distant. It's really weird.

321
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So we're going to go with that. I like that. Let's do that. It's Justin.

Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it go

330
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: turning inward to the body to the mind.

331
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: changes and shifts that you observe

332
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

333
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:38.670
Jaime44: Feel like the first thing that comes to mind is just lighter lighter lighter

334
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And that that imagery from the past.

335
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:57.840
Jaime44: It's really weird, but I really like it's almost like there's an echo in my imagery like it feels distant. I don't know how to explain that.

336
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a great way

337
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There's almost like this sound barrier, there's this distance almost the sound represented with that distance in an echo

338
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.610
Jaime44: No. Okay.

339
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's um we got a little bit of a late start, so let's process a little bit what you noticed about today, what was important for you.

340
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.540
Jaime44: Just the feeling of

341
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:49.080
Jaime44: Like putting my 18 bear with me. Just how much it makes me feel safe and I didn't really realize how how much

342
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.960
Jaime44: I needed to feel safe.

343
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:57.360
Jaime44: Oh yeah, I didn't realize that that was what I wanted.

344
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:04.380
Jaime44: As much as what I'm telling you, like, I feel like I said that to 1000 times this session.

345
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but that's that's what the unmet need was and it sounds like you're able to feel it now and now

346
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.210
Definitely

347
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're getting some distance

348
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That imagery that was the past

349
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you can be present in this body and pick do a little scan just sort of be aware

350
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How you know when you if you were to check. Okay. Well, is that true, what is my body is it on the same page with my mind seemed like everything's on the same page with relaxed body relaxed mind I'm safe. This seemed like everybody's on the same page.

351
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you're communicators your chest.

352
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.150

Jaime44: feels happy.

357
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And where do you remember even having I don't matter. Come in, or is it kind of part of the past as well.

358
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:25.980
Jaime44: Yeah, I don't know, and even

359
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not even nearby. Okay.

370
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:33.780
