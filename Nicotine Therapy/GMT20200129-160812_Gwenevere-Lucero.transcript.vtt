00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.130
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

17
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

18
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what you've been doing

19
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That sort of demonstrates this sort of commitment to

20
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Really really protecting your recovery really protecting your boundaries assertiveness, like, tell me what's what you're working hard at

21
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.310
Michelle Lucero: Um,

22
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.450
Michelle Lucero: I'm just, I'm trying to

23
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.300
Michelle Lucero: Stay positive, because I've had a lot of negative go on lately. Just trying to stay positive and

24
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.550
Michelle Lucero: Keep my mind from wondering

25
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.280
Okay.

26
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

27
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So, how bad is it getting when you say laundry.

28
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.330
How about

29
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.830
Michelle Lucero: Just like reminiscing on how I used to know myself to

30
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.570
Michelle Lucero: Everything and I'm not done with anything.

31
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so something's big is going on. Michelle something. You're right. You're right. You're romanticizing it. This is a risky.

32
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a risk factor right here. You're spending time literally spending seconds and minutes when you're in that network of thinking

33
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It becomes so much more likely that you're going to take action on it. And yes, you're focusing on some positive stuff and I get that. But, Michelle. What is happening, what is going on.

34
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.950
Michelle Lucero: It's just a lot of stuff at home just Anthony mainly and stuff with the family.

35
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.040
Michelle Lucero: And then he has been

36
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.820
Michelle Lucero: Still talking to other girls and he didn't come home Friday night.

37
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.530
Michelle Lucero: And then he was gone all Saturday his phone was off.

38
00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:05.100
Michelle Lucero: Um, and I get worried because the vehicle. He's in is registered under my name. It's my old truck. So when he bought me this car. He was supposed to put the truck under his name.

39
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:19.620
Michelle Lucero: But he never did. So it's still under my name and I'm afraid that like he's gonna wreck or something and be drinking and it'll be on me because it's my vehicle. It's my insurance.

40
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:29.670
Michelle Lucero: So I'm worried about that and he thinks because I call him to wonder, like, where's the truck. Where are you that I'm

41
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:38.520
Michelle Lucero: Wondering where he's at. I mean, I could care less. Honestly, where he's at or who is with, I just want to make sure that

42
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.160
Michelle Lucero: I'm not going to get in trouble for something stupid, he did because it's happened before.

43
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.700
Michelle Lucero: him drink. Yeah.

44
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony's going to do, Anthony.

45
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:59.370
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I know that. And it doesn't. I mean, it bothers me because he's not man enough to just be honest and tell me what's going on, but

46
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you if you're really being honest about you don't care about the girls because you did start with that still talking to girls. If that's true, if that's a separate issue and that one's not as exciting.

47
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: As as being able to reasonably predict that you have this variable. This possibility that he

48
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You may incur, you know, a change in insurance rates.

49
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I mean, he's still. Yeah. So what can you do you're waiting for him to do it. Just let that go. Let's say you're responsible for fixing what's going on with the registration and all of that. What can you do

50
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.070
Michelle Lucero: What is he. Oh, I've already thought about it on my next paycheck, which is on the seventh. I'm gonna

51
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.570
Michelle Lucero: Get the title will see that's the thing. I don't even have the title. He has the title.

52
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys live in the same house. I don't understand what you mean by the title. Tell me what

53
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.410
Michelle Lucero: I don't, I looked for it everywhere.

54
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.760
Michelle Lucero: I've looked for it everywhere, unless it's in the truck. It's not in the house like everywhere. We put important papers.

55
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:19.860
Michelle Lucero: I can't find it, but I told him when I get paid. I will switch the truck over to your name, just so I don't have to be bothered with it. I don't care if I have to be

56
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:30.090
Michelle Lucero: Like, it'll be like $65 to get it switch from my name to his and then I'm dropping the insurance. I already dropped the insurance have been dropped for

57
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.360
Michelle Lucero: Two to two days now.

58
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so talk about the title for a second, you're able to say that I'm going to switch it. So how can. Why not say

59
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I've looked for the title in our files. Is it in the glove box.

60
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.560
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I

61
00:07:51.090 --> 00:08:01.080
Michelle Lucero: He says he doesn't know where it's at. But I, I know he knows where it's at. And I think he thinks I'm just going to take it away from him and take the truck, because the cars already under my name.

62
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:16.110
Michelle Lucero: So he can't say he bought it for me. While he did, but it's already in my name is so it doesn't matter, but I think he thinks I'm just going to take the title and leave with the truck and the car, which I don't want the truck anymore. He's a

63
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.410
Really

64
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you be believed, you know him.

65
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:33.720
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I told him, Give me the title and I'll sign it over to you, then it's not mine, then it'll be yours because your names on it last. And that's what matters.

66
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And he doesn't believe you. So again, what

67
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.470
Michelle Lucero: When, when you get your next day off, which is not till I don't know next Monday. I think

68
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.290
Michelle Lucero: He said, Well, look for it. And we'll do that and I'm gonna look for it. If not, I'm going to file for a loss title into it myself.

69
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

70
00:08:53.550 --> 00:09:00.450
Michelle Lucero: My name and like I'm I just don't want to be bothered with it anymore. I cannot sleep.

71
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:11.430
Michelle Lucero: When he doesn't come home and I'm thinking, like, Oh my God, did he get into a car accident. Did he kill somebody in the truck and it's under my name like

72
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:22.980
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, legally if I'll be able if I'll be held accountable for that. It's in my name, or like anything but it bothers me because I'm on probation and I don't need

73
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.800
Michelle Lucero: Anything else

74
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To add this to things that you can investigate why don't you call your insurance carrier

75
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you ask them.

76
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.350
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, why

77
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.220
Michelle Lucero: can ensure maybe hypothetically.

78
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.480
You can say

79
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I have on the registered owner of this vehicle. And I'm just curious if people use my vehicle.

80
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens right yeah the legal implications.

81
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to other people in your life about that because you might actually be missing some some information. Yeah.

82
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that are not the registered owner can can drive cars mean that's very common. We lend people cars or they're in our family and they drive the car. It just needs to be registered

83
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.330
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, that's different.

84
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, there might be something in insurance where whether he's covered or he's not that might be something else. Those are kind of separate

85
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:35.910
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

86
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think what you need is information to help asleep, you already have. I can clearly hear you're really clear of what you want to do, but the part which part of it makes you reminisce which piece of it makes you start to go to wanting to escape.

87
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.470
Michelle Lucero: I'm just the anxiety of it.

88
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.010
Michelle Lucero: If I like when it used to happen. Back in the day when I lived at my house.

89
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:15.690
Michelle Lucero: I would just get a high and I had to go right to sleep, not worry about anything. I wouldn't bother you, and calling them all night wondering where is that

90
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:30.450
Michelle Lucero: I would just go to sleep and just numb it all and not worry till the morning and then when the morning came, I'd get even higher, just to go through my day without talking to him or knowing what was going on. Yeah.

91
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it, yeah.

92
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.480
Michelle Lucero: Like, oh my god, I really

93
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.990
Michelle Lucero: I tried to numb it out like by myself without anything just tried to think of other things.

94
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.300
Michelle Lucero: And it's so hard to just get my mind off of it. The

95
00:11:51.330 --> 00:12:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem with that registration back then was still there. It didn't go away. You still had to face it.

96
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You have problems in the family in the residence, you've got things that will not get better when you're high

97
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No one's going to come in.

98
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: No one.

99
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But you

100
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You are doing it. You're just not familiar and really habituated yet to seeing you're taking care of what needs to get taken care of. You're doing it.

101
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's hard, and your mind invites you right the addict says, Come on over here. You don't have to worry about these problems. Now once you feel good. Now, but you Michelle, as an adult, you know those problems won't go way you will wake up in that same home that same man.

102
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you start doing what you've been doing

103
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're in your own solution when you're feeling brave you're working on communication with yourself with others when you're assertive when you're putting money aside when you are taking responsibility for your own life, your life will change.

104
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It will it is changing. There's no way you could have said, I'm going to have the money to go do this and this and this and this. You are sharp minded, you know exactly what needs to be done. I challenged you just now and you know exactly what's going on.

105
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You are a very bright woman.

106
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say, no one's going to come in and rescue. What does that make you feel

107
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.270
Michelle Lucero: It reminds me that. Yeah, that's true. And

108
00:13:52.290 --> 00:14:02.940
Michelle Lucero: I still. Most of the time I do wait for someone to give me the answers or someone to give me a solution when I know the solution. I just don't trust myself to act on it.

109
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.560
Michelle Lucero: Like all the time. I do that, I double. I like to second guess myself where I have to ask for

110
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.020
Michelle Lucero: Someone to agree with me for me to know it's okay, or that it's a good idea.

111
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:25.470
Michelle Lucero: But lately. Instead of feeling like, oh, I need to know myself to not feel this. I just keep remembering

112
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.570
Michelle Lucero: Like in a year from now, where I'm going to be where I want to be.

113
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear about that. Let's go there. I want to hear what you're envisioning

114
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.750
Michelle Lucero: So I want to start saving money starting last paycheck.

115
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.400
Michelle Lucero: Or you're ready me saved.

116
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:51.630
Michelle Lucero: And I'm going to apply for housing. I don't know if I could get it but I'm gonna try because no one like I left.

117
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.990
Michelle Lucero: on good terms with my housing.

118
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:09.540
Michelle Lucero: So I think I could get back into housing and I'm just going to do that. That's all I'm going to be focused on is getting my own place saving money like Anthony doesn't know that

119
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.460
Michelle Lucero: He doesn't know when I have money or if I have money or where I have my money.

120
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:25.710
Michelle Lucero: I don't even keep my bank card in my purse. I keep it in my car with the doors locked all the time because I'm afraid like he's gonna find it or call my card and see

121
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:40.170
Michelle Lucero: How much is one there. But yeah, I just, I keep thinking about that and I know it will happen. I've done it before and just knowing that makes me feel better and that makes me

122
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:54.060
Michelle Lucero: Think Like okay, you don't want to go mess up now, because that won't be a possibility, you won't be able to go and do that if you go and get high and get thrown in jail, get more charges and like

123
00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.360
Michelle Lucero: It's not worth it to me. So that's what I've been doing instead of wanting to know

124
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You should be with your son in this new home. What do you get to do what's your morning going to be like, What's the, what's the Saturday morning going to be like if you're in your own place with your son.

125
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:25.890
Michelle Lucero: Getting up whenever we wake up and making breakfast, getting ready and going to the park or going to play basketball, or baseball or shoot his bow and arrows.

126
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.920
Michelle Lucero: What is quality time with him. I mean, I do that now. But it'll

127
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:43.770
Michelle Lucero: It'll be so much better if it's just him and I, we won't have to deal with any anything in the morning, you can just wake up and have a great day.

128
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what will be present in that home that you're going to create with what are the feelings.

129
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.660
Michelle Lucero: What is the fullness and happiness and love.

130
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.820
Michelle Lucero: Calmness

131
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.030
Michelle Lucero: Anxiety.

132
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.190
Michelle Lucero: No anger.

133
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:18.780
Michelle Lucero: Like laughter. Like, if we can even laugh and our house now like Anthony get so mad when we laugh because he always things were laughing at him and probably we are but

134
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:33.510
Michelle Lucero: Like yeah, me and Stefan have to go to my room to laugh or to watch movies that are funny like under the hate happiness. I swear, I think, you know, you just can't stand to see anybody happy.

135
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture what movie right just just really get into. So then you've had this nice breakfast to you exercise you had this day where you went out.

136
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had this playfulness that really light hearted experience and maybe even being able to see

137
00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son. What about it. What about if he was upset. Can you picture being able to see him upset about something and being able to be his mother be present for him. This is a different way to be you've been so preoccupied surviving

138
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't have to just survive. You can thrive and your son can thrive. Can you picture what you will be able to do as a parent for him that you can't do right now. What do you envision

139
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.300
Michelle Lucero: I'm

140
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.210
Michelle Lucero: Just

141
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:46.260
Michelle Lucero: Be positive with him. Show him positivity and positive things. I mean, I do that now. But it would mean so much more. If I could show him what I mean like

142
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:58.620
Michelle Lucero: You know, like, see how miserable. We were living at the trailer and I got is that are there, and I can't wait to say that again, wait to show him.

143
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.530
Michelle Lucero: That I'm always going to be there. Get him out of

144
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.370
Michelle Lucero: You know, try to make his life better.

145
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see if you can refine this one. I can't wait to show him what is it that you want to show him what's going to really help them.

146
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.820
Michelle Lucero: Just to be out of all that negativity, just to be

147
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.170
Michelle Lucero: Able to be happy and feel loved.

148
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.850
Michelle Lucero: And not to me so angry over time.

149
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:48.480
Michelle Lucero: I mean like when Anthony's when Anthony is gone, I am happy because I'm not having to deal with stress. But then I have added stress because I'm worried about the truck and

150
00:19:49.710 --> 00:20:02.730
Michelle Lucero: I mean, most of the time if Anthony's like Oh, I'm going to be home late. I'm like, Yes. Like, I literally get a happy knowing he's not going to be there and that all have more time to, you know, not have to deal with him.

151
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.000
Michelle Lucero: And my son feels the same way.

152
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: For

153
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I want you to stay in this space of

154
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: countering

155
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The addiction voice of romanticizing

156
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Substance use with how important

157
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son's well being, is

158
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to stay in conversation right but those two voices.

159
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that addiction says sounds so great.

160
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.250
Michelle Lucero: Just not being here mentally

161
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay hold on to that. Now, are you back from the perspective of loving mother. What do you say to do. You don't have to be here. You see back to that.

162
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.340
Michelle Lucero: You need to be here because you have a 13 year old that needs you.

163
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I have

164
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.090
Michelle Lucero: I mean, I have. Yeah.

165
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's just, it's more impactful. If you say so. Say it again slow way down. Close your eyes and go inside that truth. I have a 13 year old.

166
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:32.580
Michelle Lucero: That 13 year old that needs me to be here. So I can't know myself and not be here.

167
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I've known myself before. And what happened to my 13 year old.

168
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.320
Michelle Lucero: He got neglected.

169
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Really make that addict hear

170
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Your roar really hear it needs to fax it up.

171
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.060
Yeah.

172
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.570
Michelle Lucero: I just

173
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.100
Michelle Lucero: In the past, I know that I've numbed myself to the point to where

174
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.220
Michelle Lucero: He would talk to me and nothing, he would say, would register with me.

175
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.640
Michelle Lucero: And he'd walk away upset, knowing that I didn't hear a word he just said.

176
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.960
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

177
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And you've not called him. You've disappeared.

178
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.120
Yeah.

179
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:31.260
Michelle Lucero: Do you and I kills me. It gives me the worst guilt. I'm just remembering what I've done.

180
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So guilt is action actionable sit with responsibility that you can do it differently. That's the only thing that gets addressed if it's not, then it's shame.

181
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where addictions, like, yeah, you are a real shit you're always going to be a shit. You're a terrible mother, come over here. You don't have to feel if you go that deep

182
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Into shame it will get you. But if you sit with it gives me guilt. I feel responsible. I'm taking action to do it differently.

183
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you sit here and all you do is label yourself anything negative that's going to make the attic likud's chopped and chops and say yes. Oh, keep it up, keep saying negative things about yourself.

184
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But you stop and you say no I deviated from my core values on going to do it differently. I am doing it differently. I'm going to stay focus just today on the things I need to do show that's all you need to do. I am not kidding.

185
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Today you show up for work each minute you enjoy who you all your life being smiley and you like being positive, then go for it.

186
00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're home. If the timings. Right. You want to nose around in the truck and you want to look for it. One last time for that title. Great. You're already saving money you're already putting action, you've already made the decision.

187
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing it.

188
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done it before.

189
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Guilt is supposed to be there to remind us of what's important to us.

190
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame.

191
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame doesn't do that.

192
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is intolerable and it says that you're a bad person and escape becomes the next logical conclusion.

193
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You say it's the worst guilt is it

194
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:39.990
Michelle Lucero: A live

195
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.640
Michelle Lucero: It kills me just thinking about it and

196
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.850
Michelle Lucero: All the times that he needed me that I was there, but not mentally there.

197
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.020
Michelle Lucero: And I, I wasn't even there for myself.

198
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: No you weren't

199
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's guilt. Michelle, you know how we know out here is we say I see how its impacted other people

200
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame impacts you and destroys you

201
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can sit with how you have affected others.

202
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do this. You can take ownership for it. But if you say back to me. Right. It's the worst. I can't do it. I can't feel this

203
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict is. Gotcha. It's like, yeah, you won't be able to stand out much longer. Come on over here, baby. You'll feel good.

204
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son.

205
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son was affected by that you abandoned you

206
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got what it takes. Michelle, all it is. You forgot but but look what you've put together, you're still working.

207
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still doing it. You're getting up and you're going, that's all. This takes

208
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to save you've applied before you don't have to get ahead of it and say, oh, it's going to be so hard, whatever, whatever. No, it's just the next right thing that's right in front of you.

209
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't dip into shame. Can't do it.

210
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You are a good mom a good person.

211
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So make the decisions that are consistent with that from today forward. That's it. That's the only thing you have control over. I can promise you that.

212
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to say internally that can push the voice of addiction away.

213
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.430
Michelle Lucero: I

214
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.860
Michelle Lucero: That it will it also impacts and I'll soon be added here.

215
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.360
Michelle Lucero: And I won't have to deal with it much longer.

216
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This feeling will pass

217
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I will soon be out of here.

218
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about how it's important to you to be there for you.

219
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about

220
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.190
Michelle Lucero: I just gotta remember how independent I was

221
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:44.670
Michelle Lucero: Because it gets scary to think like, oh my god, I'm going to be out there doing it on my own. Again, but then I also have to remember how good it feels when you pay your own bills.

222
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:58.800
Michelle Lucero: And your rents paid and your bills are paid and you have extra money to go buy ice cream with the kids and just how good it feels to live a normal life without being high

223
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:11.010
Michelle Lucero: And being genuinely happy, not because you're high and it makes you happy, but just being genuinely happy with myself and

224
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:20.190
Michelle Lucero: My kids and giving myself credit or you know what I've done, and how far I've

225
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, we're going to do a little see if you're up to it. It's been a while since I've used these little emojis.

226
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the little you get my. Do you have a phone that will receive like a little animation.

227
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, let's, let's do it. Let's create one where we'll pick a little guy that you like little character.

228
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be a face to, you know, I don't know if you have a little Avatar, but this is, this is what I would like you to do.

229
00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: First let's pick, pick a critter see which one you like. We can either do Avatar, it's you.

230
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we pick one. That's you.

231
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Or we can do an animal, and it's going to be talking to you. You're going to hear your own voice. I'm going to record you in here.

232
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to actually have you recorded voice, the one that's going to be telling addiction to back the F off.

233
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.720
Michelle Lucero: The little, the little mouse.

234
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Likes the mouse that's going to be coming up with six or all of them. Make sure this is the one. Well, first of all, what do you picture the addiction images. What's that voice.

235
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.360
Michelle Lucero: The addiction voice.

236
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.640
It's ugly.

237
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want. Maybe something beautiful right so let's keep looking to the mouse. I got a little octopus little cow looks like a giraffe shark.

238
00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: L.

239
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: A bowl of bore Gabor monkey.

240
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.230
Robot.

241
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:00.780
Dog.

242
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Alien

243
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.820
Michelle Lucero: Hope.

244
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.040
Michelle Lucero: Panda.

245
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's rehearse, go go inside, get real clear

246
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to use the direct

247
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're going to use a use statement, it's going to be something like you need to stop lying to me that you're a waste of my time you're all about short term gain you don't care about my health, you don't care about my son. You don't care if he is neglected.

248
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's call him a name, forget it. You see what I'm trying to say, I want you to say.

249
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That record it. I'm going to record it for you. And I'm going to send you that little tiny little movie and that voice will be right there. When you start that romanticizing you're going to hear this.

250
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's practice, what do you want to say to the ugly addiction voice you want put some benefits, put some heat

251
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.130
Michelle Lucero: You need to stop trying to make me fall

252
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.300
Okay, yeah.

253
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

254
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.570
Michelle Lucero: Because I'm

255
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.460
Michelle Lucero: Because I'm

256
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.650
Michelle Lucero: Stronger

257
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you got a question in there.

258
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just talking about your reasons earlier.

259
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to it.

260
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.650
Michelle Lucero: Because I'm strong enough to be independent and

261
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.370
Michelle Lucero: I'm worth it. And my kids are worth it.

262
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it again. You need to stop trying to make me fall. Do it again.

263
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:15.000
Michelle Lucero: You need to stop trying to make me fall because I'm stronger than I was before. And I'm worth it. And my kids are working

264
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it again.

265
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But we're independent in there. Again, I think that's going to be important.

266
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:21.570
Okay.

267
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:36.480
Michelle Lucero: You need us. You need to stop trying to make me fall because I'm independent and I'm stronger than I was before. And I'm worth it. And my kids are worth it.

268
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Okay, we're going to do it again and this time I'm going to make this little emoji guy work.

269
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.140
You ready. Yep.

270
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.270
Now,

271
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:11.850
Michelle Lucero: You need to stop trying to make me fall because I'm independent and I'm stronger than I was before. And I'm worth it. And my kids are worth it.

272
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.480
We play that one.

273
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Independence and I'm stronger than I was before. And I'm worth it. And my kids are worth it.

274
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to snap you out of it. You need something else.

275
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I just sent it to you. Now the beginning right there's a little bit of us kind of talking, but then it kicks into gear.

276
00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.520
Michelle.

277
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.240
You get that this brain.

278
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.940
Michelle Lucero: When you say reminiscing

279
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: When you spend time

280
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally

281
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That information is stored in a particular network of the brain. It's a muscle, right, I mean you can picture. It's just a blob up there right

282
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's stored information. And when you monitor. In other words, when you're in that network of information you are reinforcing it

283
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not. When you spend time there.

284
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to get out of it as quick as you possibly can.

285
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into

286
00:34:50.280 --> 00:35:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantasy. I'm going to have the color walls. I want. I'm going to have the food I want. I'm going to have all the right go in there.

287
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The network that you are monitoring, you are modifying if you spend time in this other one that we just talked about on purpose and fights like you've never fought before fight that other network, you will be building it.

288
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It will see more realistic and

289
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Happen.

290
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Time and that other one

291
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.110
Michelle Lucero: Forcing

292
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That ugliness.

293
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are just neurological facts.

294
00:35:47.700 --> 00:36:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a metaphor. Right. And we were looking at each other. Maybe it feels like this, like, you know, you don't think that it's an actual Oregon that's working right now. I know how to put this sentence together because it's stored information and my all my parts of my brain are working

295
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can decide to focus elsewhere. When you indulge in that what I call you call it reminiscing right i was like this and then

296
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're making that a reality or literally thinking about something.

297
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And reinforcing it and it seems like a solution, but you've got to immediately.

298
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Not spend one more thought invested in that network, not one more thought because you're reinforcing it every time you spend time in there.

299
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We want it.

300
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.130
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

301
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When we don't visit a network, naturally, what happens is pruning, it starts, because if we don't visit something. Think about stuff you learn when you're a junior high, please. I don't remember anything. Okay.

302
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I should have visited a little more often right world history. I don't know, but I

303
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If I kept revisiting it

304
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have remembered it.

305
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And I revisit psychological theory little pieces of it that I don't are gone.

306
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll probably if I review article. Oh snap. That's right. I remember learning that. Oh, it was a cool little widget thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to start using it, but I've got to say the words.

307
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to revisit that information or it will go away. It will prune. So the positive part about this addiction network is if you stop visiting it

308
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It will start

309
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To d compensate and there will be less networks you keep going to it, you're reinforcing it

310
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just science no metaphor in there.

311
00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but it feels like it because we're like the social creatures and it's hard to imagine that science is happening, like right now like right now.

312
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it feels more spiritual right because fear doesn't feel like a science experiment. It's in the body, it's like all this tension everywhere.

313
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:16.410
Yeah.

314
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your biology. Your neurobiology.

315
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's make it work for you.

316
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your conviction level right now about just all you have to do is the next right thing

317
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:39.330
That's it.

318
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how much you've saved.

319
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.030
Michelle Lucero: Oh, I'm $125 just

320
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:59.760
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I was going for 100 but yesterday I looked and I still have like

321
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.430
Michelle Lucero: After because you could like separate money and put it in and savings.

322
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:11.850
Michelle Lucero: On the day so I had 100 but yesterday I still had $85

323
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:30.390
Michelle Lucero: Like, just to for gas and cigarettes or whatever I need for until I get me to cancel the seven and I was like, I can, I can work with with just I'm 65 so I put 25 back in the evening.

324
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So I saved $125 yeah

325
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real. That wasn't possible if you hadn't done this simple

326
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Or login experience protecting asleep, not picking fights not focusing on the cleanliness of a house.

327
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to yourself overwhelmed.

328
00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: With this projection into the future that you can't handle this registration issue. Nope.

329
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You just have a plan and you do the plan.

330
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: adding to it.

331
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How likely is it that you're going to revisit

332
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This internal argument back its internal

333
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.330
Michelle Lucero: Probably once I get home.

334
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.840
Michelle Lucero: And have to deal with Anthony

335
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:38.880
Michelle Lucero: But yeah, like it. It comes often it won't bother me while I'm at work and it doesn't bother me well.

336
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.770
Michelle Lucero: I'm alone. It only bothers me whenever

337
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.110
Michelle Lucero: I'm around down the knee.

338
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.850
Michelle Lucero: Or having to deal with vs from him.

339
00:40:52.290 --> 00:41:11.070
Michelle Lucero: But I just, I honestly right away, the first thought that go the second thought that goes into my mind after wanting to be numb is Joe and me sitting in that jail cell and how miserable. I was, and like all never all never put myself there again.

340
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. Well, that's a motivator. That's a it's an extra motivator, but we'll take it.

341
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.080
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

342
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be miserable very, very prevalent. So when you look at him, and you look at Anthony and he continues to do his thing. He's not going to

343
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.110
Michelle Lucero: Change.

344
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: On or off with the assumption. He's not going to

345
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:34.350
Change.

346
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta hold on to yourself, Michelle. Yeah, watch the video before you walk in the house.

347
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, listen to it as you're driving home and get yourself prepared. He's going to be full of nonsense just figure out what you need to do.

348
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And go do it.

349
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's meet again, when are we going to meet again.

350
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.430
Michelle Lucero: Next Wednesday, same time

351
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You need an order for medicine. Yes. Okay. I'll text, the doctor right now.

352
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.440
Michelle Lucero: Okay, thank you. I'll see you Tuesday at seven.

353
00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If you go to you. Bye.

Michelle Lucero: Bye.
