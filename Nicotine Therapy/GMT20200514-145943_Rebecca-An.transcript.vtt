Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Morning.

2
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.640
Jessica Freeman: How's it going,

3
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's it going over you.

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.130
Jessica Freeman: Know,

5
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know. Tell me.

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.980
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I'm doing the best I can.

7
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:48.660
Jessica Freeman: And you know i mean i don't i'm not i don't have a master's in special education. I'm not a behavioral analysis or analyst like

8
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.120
Jessica Freeman: I'm doing the best I can.

9
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.610
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, he went and spent the night at my mom's house last Thursday, and that was nice.

10
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.720
Jessica Freeman: But, you know, like, all I can do is

11
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
Jessica Freeman: You know, get a little bit of rest.

12
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.150
Jessica Freeman: So I can get anything done.

13
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.680
Jessica Freeman: You know, take a shower and like just lay down and just enjoy the laying down undisturbed.

14
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what you did.

15
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.860
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mean, if I had more time without him, then I would get my rest and then I would

16
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.290
Jessica Freeman: You know, get some things done, but

17
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.280
Jessica Freeman: The list that we talked about. I put that into action and it was going really well there for a minute.

18
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:59.190
Jessica Freeman: But then he got really sick. And then for like two straight weeks, he was so high maintenance just unbelievably high maintenance round the clock for like two weeks. And by the way, we ended up going to the ER.

19
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.510
Jessica Freeman: That day couple weeks ago, where is last time I saw you. I think three weeks, maybe I think we was too.

20
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.400
Jessica Freeman: Um,

21
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, we will have them.

22
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.180
Jessica Freeman: And the fever. They said they attributed the fever to fighting off.

23
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:37.920
Jessica Freeman: An infection. Now it could be the ear infection that he had or could be a virus. It could be anything there like just let that play out because it did break the fever did break. But he was still screaming because when I had to go you know his feet were cramping from dehydration. So

24
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.530
Jessica Freeman: I did, I

25
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.760
Jessica Freeman: Like a

26
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.760
Jessica Freeman: Medical syringe and I was trying to give him.

27
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:59.490
Jessica Freeman: Like Pedialyte and I got, I got a little bit in him and he was feeling pretty good about it. And then he started throwing up and you know he was throwing up file and it was like green. And I'm like, Okay, we're going to the ER right now.

28
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:13.860
Jessica Freeman: So that was like dehydration. So they said that you know what they gave me an opportunity to do to get him feeling better with less drastic measures and

29
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:24.120
Jessica Freeman: He said, You have one hour to get 20 medical syringes, full of 18 milliliters nope 15 milliliters each

30
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:41.910
Jessica Freeman: So 2015 milliliter syringes into his mouth and swallowed of a combination of Pedialyte Gatorade water and apple juice and he bought me every step of the way. But I got it, I got it in him in that hour

31
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.920
Jessica Freeman: He doesn't even know how lucky is because the next thing they were going to do was

32
00:03:47.580 --> 00:04:02.310
Jessica Freeman: You know, use a catheter and like an IV and monitors urine and keep them overnight, maybe even admit him so I'm not worried about the bills because like we got Medicaid and his Medicaid is federal so I'm not worried about that.

33
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.840
Jessica Freeman: I didn't want to have to put him through that, if I could avoid it. So,

34
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.950
Yeah.

35
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.240
Jessica Freeman: To get that done. Come on, keto God

36
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.950
Jessica Freeman: So he's still was kind of crappy for the next few days.

37
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:35.730
Jessica Freeman: But then he finally got back to normal, like the past three or four days he's been just really good a lot more low maintenance a lot more like himself, you know, real sweet and wants to play independently.

38
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.070
Jessica Freeman: Real active, you know,

39
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.510
Jessica Freeman: So he knows

40
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

41
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I can't even imagine.

42
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's got to be tough.

43
00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:04.230
Jessica Freeman: But you know, I just put my head down and power through the whole situation and just did what needed to be done and it's not good. When you act aired around your kids, you know, like I had to just

44
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:22.830
Jessica Freeman: You know, be the calm and steadying force and you know I know he was scared because everybody's hospitals wearing masks. You know, it's a real a weird situation. So I just tried to make him as comfortable as I could. And he did really well really proud of them.

45
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that is just insane and I can't even imagine going into the emergency room right now for an adult, but for a kid, you know,

46
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.090
Jessica Freeman: Fortunately, I have

47
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:52.890
Jessica Freeman: A Children's Hospital at you and him and they have like you can either when you go to the Children's Hospital. They can either take you to like the children's urgent care or they can take your current emergency room. So we went to the emergency room and

48
00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.470
Jessica Freeman: I have to say the staff was great, like we had a positive experience at what for what it is you know

49
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's good.

50
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

51
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.830
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

52
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.540
But it was struggling

53
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.540
Jessica Freeman: I'm just glad it's over. I'm glad he's back to normal. I'm glad I don't have medical bills.

54
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame you at all.

55
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what you've been doing

56
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.750
Jessica Freeman: I'm trying to maintain my sanity.

57
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you.

58
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.210
Jessica Freeman: I don't really have any baby mommy.

59
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.860
Jessica Freeman: Do you want to say hi to my friends say

60
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.420
Hi.

61
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.010
Jessica Freeman: He said,

62
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.360
He actually

63
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.570
Jessica Freeman: Very good.

64
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.520
Jessica Freeman: Mommy, so proud of you.

65
00:06:51.630 --> 00:07:01.200
Jessica Freeman: And was question. Oh, yeah. Okay. So maintaining my salary. All right, I go to bed, nice and early I get as much sleep as I can. As soon as he's down I'm down.

66
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.330
Jessica Freeman: Hey, go, you know, my mom. She's somewhat helpful. She'll come over here if I need to like run errands.

67
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:19.710
Jessica Freeman: Or yesterday I had kids, maybe the day before yesterday before his kindergarten IEP progression meeting.

68
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:30.570
Jessica Freeman: Turns out that his school, the new school, not the charter school but like the public elementary school that I put him in because they have stuff going on right now and the charter school

69
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.890
Jessica Freeman: They have an excellent program. I don't think he's ready for kindergarten, but they have actually, you know,

70
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.840
Jessica Freeman: Three different programs. They've got like general ed which he's not on and then they have general ed with like special ed support.

71
00:07:49.260 --> 00:08:01.470
Jessica Freeman: And then they have a special ed class or kindergarten. So, um, he's going to go into special ed kindergarten class and they work on social communication stuff and they use pecs boards and

72
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:12.600
Jessica Freeman: They're going to work on some sign language with him because he's he's just more into that than he's been with anything else as far as methods of communication. So,

73
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:25.470
Jessica Freeman: I'm learning some and he's learning some and we're practicing it and he has preschool every day for half an hour and he has speech twice a week for half an hour. It's hard to keep them engaged.

74
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:33.630
Jessica Freeman: It's really hard and they don't see learning anything but I'm doing everything I can to to keep them engaged with it.

75
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.030
Jessica Freeman: And generate right bring pops.

76
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.620
Jessica Freeman: So I can get him to sit on my lap with the ring pop

77
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:49.770
Jessica Freeman: Hey, can you please let me do this for a little bit. Can you go play. Can you please go play front of it. So when we can talk to your friend.

78
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.510
Jessica Freeman: Thank you so much, you such a sweet boy. All right, go play baby, let's get you plugged in over here.

79
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.640
Jessica Freeman: Sorry. He's very affectionate

80
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. I guess we

81
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.080
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's

82
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.830
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, come here.

83
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.670
Jessica Freeman: Go play for a little bit and then Mommy will

84
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.090
Jessica Freeman: Wrestle, are you all around.

85
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:36.810
Jessica Freeman: His new thing is he wants me to grab him by the hand and foot and like swinging back and forth and then ultimately like toss him onto the couch or the bed or whatever, which is fun and I he's having a blast with it, but it's physically exhausting.

86
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It has to be

87
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holy cow.

88
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.590
Jessica Freeman: He's just getting so big you know

89
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's almost big as you all

90
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.110
Jessica Freeman: Right.

91
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:04.680
Jessica Freeman: I talked to his dad. And I'm like, Are you just out of curiosity, like I really don't care what the answer is. But

92
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:12.570
Jessica Freeman: Are you planning on, you know, trying to move out here to Albuquerque. And he's like, Yeah, yeah, totally.

93
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:21.990
Jessica Freeman: Which is what he said about moving to Indianapolis for, like, I don't know, three years, so I'm not really holding my breath.

94
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where does he live

95
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.420
Jessica Freeman: Michigan.

96
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

97
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How did you and him connect up if he was in one state you are in the other.

98
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:57.120
Jessica Freeman: He know he lives in Indianapolis and that's how we met. And then when when he stole King from me when I had to go to the recovery house and do all that stuff and he took him to Michigan and he never left. Now I had in. Let's see.

99
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:09.030
Jessica Freeman: late June of 2017 and I was supposed to have him for like a week like Fourth of July week and then I supposed to send him back to Michigan.

100
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:32.100
Jessica Freeman: But then when I got him, I was like, Oh, you're malnourished and you have like serious diaper rash, you know. So I called the daycare up in Michigan where he'd been attending and I talked to the teachers I got enough information and documentation to never send him back to Michigan.

101
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:33.870
Jessica Freeman: And

102
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.250
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Since then, Colin has not been able to have kin.

103
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:48.690
Jessica Freeman: Like on his own, without his, his mother or his grandmother or his, you know, somebody has to be with him while he has key.

104
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.060
Jessica Freeman: Because I don't trust him.

105
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.540
Jessica Freeman: Right happened to many times too many times.

106
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just doesn't take care of them. He doesn't know how to

107
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.220
Jessica Freeman: He's just looking lazy, you know, I'll just let

108
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:15.750
Jessica Freeman: Me tell him, buddy. He let him sit in a dirty diaper and, you know, given given sure instead of dinner, you know,

109
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

110
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.670
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, he's just lazy.

111
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is crazy.

112
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.560
Jessica Freeman: Well he's 12 years younger than I am.

113
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:30.840
Jessica Freeman: Shame on me.

114
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do

115
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.280
Jessica Freeman: I turn 40

116
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.450
Jessica Freeman: When we met. He was like he had just turned 22 and I was like 34

117
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.240
Jessica Freeman: And it was never meant to be what it is you know

118
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:57.150
Jessica Freeman: I thought, I thought I didn't want to have any more kids and if any, anything like that happened, then you know I would.

119
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.590
Jessica Freeman: Terminate that, but then when it happened.

120
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:08.190
Jessica Freeman: You know, I've been pregnant twice in my life, and both those times. I didn't particularly want to have a baby.

121
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.680
Jessica Freeman: But I couldn't bring myself.

122
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:20.040
Jessica Freeman: To do that, right, and no judgment on anybody else but for me I just couldn't couldn't

123
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.370
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, they've both been the biggest gifts my entire life.

124
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pretty amazing.

125
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.740
Jessica Freeman: Although I wish I'd done a better job with the first one, but

126
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:45.840
Jessica Freeman: You know, I don't, I'm not going to live in regret about it. You know, I can't change it and Brendan and I are good, like we're really good and

127
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.790
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, he's moving to Texas Memorial Day weekend.

128
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On two weeks.

129
00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:13.920
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so once he gets all settled there he's going to come and visit mom and I out here in Albuquerque. And I'm hoping he'll Scott says he can stay for two weeks and man, my mom was like, how about a month. So we'll see how it turned out. But I cannot wait to see him.

130
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't blame you.

131
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's got to be exciting. Is he excited

132
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.530
Jessica Freeman: He's resigned to it. He's like, okay, this is what's going to happen. So

133
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:35.880
Jessica Freeman: We fight it with with Scott. That's kind of how it is like he's a dictator when you put it down on something you can see why we're not married anymore. Okay.

134
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.410
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, doesn't work.

135
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:48.480
Jessica Freeman: But Brandon is his son and like you know Scott controls the purse strings and he's a megalomaniac he going, I don't know.

136
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.620
Jessica Freeman: Some kind of ego. He's all the fucking maniacs all about

137
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.630
Jessica Freeman: That yeah he's

138
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.890
Jessica Freeman: Serious control freak.

139
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's almost a narcissist.

140
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.010
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, a narcissist with OCD.

141
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god. So tell me, what about your listing and what you're doing.

142
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.440
Jessica Freeman: Sure, let us look

143
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:29.790
Jessica Freeman: I have like a to do list. And I've gotten I got several things on it done before. Everything went to hell.

144
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.630
Jessica Freeman: And now I'm just he's only been back to normal for like three or four days.

145
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.010
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so

146
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.810
Jessica Freeman: See

147
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.200
Jessica Freeman: Definitely staying connected. I've been talking to a lot of my friends from Indianapolis.

148
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.590
Jessica Freeman: And I killed it with mother say gifs killed it.

149
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

150
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.640
Jessica Freeman: Do

151
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What they say when they got your gifts.

152
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.770
Jessica Freeman: And we'll actually

153
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.890
Jessica Freeman: Here's the problem with that. I got it in advance, like well in advance. I ordered it on April 15

154
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.730
Jessica Freeman: And then I shipped it well in advance, but I knew I know the post office. So I just waited and then I put postage stamps on it.

155
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:27.420
Jessica Freeman: So the first day returned it and said, insufficient postage. So I put some more postage on it and then they returned it the day before Mother's Day I get it back in the mailbox.

156
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:35.730
Jessica Freeman: And it says that, because there's postage stamps on it and it's like over recorders inch thick or whatever, like it's a security risk.

157
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:44.250
Jessica Freeman: So I told them about it and I was like, dude, I tried like this was supposed to be there well in advance. Mother's Day, but the post office.

158
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:55.080
Jessica Freeman: I guess I guess I learned a valuable lesson. Like, if it's a package take you to the post office. I didn't want to go to the post office. I never will want to go to the post office.

159
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.960
Jessica Freeman: To ship anything ever again.

160
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:11.340
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, so I went on Tuesday morning and got the packages out and I provided tracking numbers to both of them, and it should be there by Saturday but mom. My mom was really happy with her.

161
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:20.910
Jessica Freeman: Cards and gifts and her birthday was yesterday and I got her a nice birthday gift as well. And we had Steak and potatoes for dinner, and had a really nice night together.

162
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.790
Jessica Freeman: So it was good and then today.

163
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:39.300
Jessica Freeman: I am hosting a zoom room for all long distance people such as myself that are not able to attend my mama's 90th birthday party in Indianapolis and they're having a drive thru party.

164
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:48.060
Jessica Freeman: But this is for people that can't drive through and they just want to drop in. So I'm hosting a two hour zoom room doctrine from one to three my time.

165
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.710
Jessica Freeman: Wow. Yeah.

166
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.740
Excited about

167
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.500
Jessica Freeman: Sure.

168
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:06.270
Jessica Freeman: I mean, it might be not there. It depends on who shows up. But if people show up and it's people i like i wouldn't be nice otherwise.

169
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:12.690
Jessica Freeman: I can just turn off my video and my, you know, mute myself and I don't have to engage with that if I don't want to

170
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:13.770
Write

171
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:25.350
Jessica Freeman: Oh, that's funny. Yeah, that's what's so great. That's what's so great about this is because you you know you can turn off your video and you don't have to engage. They're not like

172
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your face, you know,

173
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:33.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get run to the opposite side of the room to get away from people, you just turn off your video.

174
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.650
Jessica Freeman: Have you used Google meets

175
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:48.960
Jessica Freeman: Well, they're using it for all of his school stuff right now and I would like to say it sucks you don't have nearly as many options.

176
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.980
Jessica Freeman: It's difficult.

177
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.080
Jessica Freeman: That we're making it work. And then my brother, my fucking brother.

178
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:16.410
Jessica Freeman: And he set up. He's having a Sunday salon. Okay, which is like he sent this event invite out on Facebook. So all of his international people because he's he's Mr international he's lived

179
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:31.290
Jessica Freeman: In Japan and Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates and Malaysia and every fucking place he lived there or Hawaii whatever he's Mr world traveler so

180
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:43.920
Jessica Freeman: He's having this event for everybody that he knows all over the world to come and share thoughts and ideas and posts and videos and podcasts and

181
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:57.450
Jessica Freeman: I don't have fucking room in my brain for that shit. I don't. I just can't put all of my resources are going to him that that again. This little guy. My dog. He has needs as well.

182
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:13.860
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, so I I wait until the last possible minute and then I to respond. And then I I clicked can't go not even 10 minutes later this fucker is calling me from Portugal to ask me why I can't go.

183
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:30.180
Jessica Freeman: And unlike I just don't feel like I have anything to contribute. And he said, I think he went off on like a 20 minute diatribe about insecurity. I was like, okay, you know, and he won't let me get a word in edgewise. So I just have to sit there and listen to them.

184
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:42.030
Jessica Freeman: So finally, there's breaking the conversation. I'm like, that's, that's not necessarily my issue. It's just, I just don't have any resources to put into this. No.

185
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.260
Jessica Freeman: And he's like, well, just your presence is a contribution.

186
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:56.640
Jessica Freeman: Whatever. He's trying to be nice, all of a sudden when still though still he does these he's all about himself. He only thinks about himself.

187
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:07.410
Jessica Freeman: Isn't he cannot see past the end of his own nose and he's he's trying to be like like nice, but it's disingenuous. Okay, I can see right through that shit.

188
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:17.070
Jessica Freeman: And I just don't want it. I just don't want to engage, but I also don't want to have a negative relationship with him because he's really emotional and who knows what he's going to do

189
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:28.470
Jessica Freeman: You know, with what he'll say to people, or how he'll treat me. I don't have time for the conflict. I have absolutely no inclination to get involved with any of that.

190
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.670
So,

191
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.750
Jessica Freeman: I think I explained it diplomatically.

192
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.820
Jessica Freeman: And I'll try to drop into the thing but I make no promises.

193
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you guys had a close relationship or have you guys had a strained relationship.

194
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:54.900
Jessica Freeman: Well, we were very close when we were growing up, and in my like late teens.

195
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.150
Jessica Freeman: You know,

196
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:08.610
Jessica Freeman: We live together. You know, we were roommates. So we were really close. And then when I met Brendan's dad.

197
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.930
Jessica Freeman: We just kind of went

198
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:22.890
Jessica Freeman: In opposite ways he couldn't stand Scott and he didn't, you know, it just wasn't a good mix. Because Scott is like

199
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:36.960
Jessica Freeman: An ignorant white trash, you know, and then Adam is Mr world traveler intellectual PhD. They just to just, they just do not mix well and

200
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:45.060
Jessica Freeman: So then, Adam moved to Japan. And I was like,

201
00:22:46.680 --> 00:23:00.660
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think he left to right after my wedding. Yeah, so he moved to Japan, and he's never moved back, you know, to the United States other than he lived in Hawaii for like six months with my cousin, Jason.

202
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:11.280
Jessica Freeman: And when he has visited through throughout the years I've been dealing with the progression of my disease, you know,

203
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:25.170
Jessica Freeman: And things between us have been seriously explosive like every time he would come back, my life would implode and I would get arrested or

204
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:42.180
Jessica Freeman: You know, go to rehab or whatever it, it always like things would be okay and then Adam would visit and then my life would fall to shit every time. So this past visit, you know, I'm sober and sober for a minute and

205
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.910
Jessica Freeman: He he he was, he it was from my mom's wedding. So he was here.

206
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:58.350
Jessica Freeman: We went to Albuquerque. We spent a week in Albuquerque. And then we went to Indianapolis and then he was there for like a month and then he traveled to New York and some other places.

207
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:19.170
Jessica Freeman: And then, you know, to, to live. So this past time was like the opposite because he is drinking too much and engaging in you know alcoholic and addict Vader and you know I can't identify him like that he has to identify for himself.

208
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.060
Jessica Freeman: So it was just really like polar opposite of everything that we've

209
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:36.450
Jessica Freeman: Done before that I had, I had my shit together and I held it together. My life is good. It's been stable for a while, and he just didn't really fit into that, you know,

210
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.970
Jessica Freeman: Like he's all over the place. He's, he's a fucking roller coaster.

211
00:24:43.260 --> 00:25:01.590
Jessica Freeman: And he thinks he's right about everything, and he thinks he's the smartest person in the world, and he's Mr world traveler. So, you know, he's just so fucking arrogant. So I practice a lot of tolerance and a lot of holding my tongue and just trying to be

212
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:10.950
Jessica Freeman: You know, positive and supporting and accepting but without approving. You know, I don't know.

213
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.570
Jessica Freeman: I just didn't engage with him.

214
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:35.460
Jessica Freeman: And then he left. And it's been pretty much the same way. Now for the visits like as far as all the visits that Adam has made to the US in past 20 years it was the best one that we've had in 20 years guarantee, but it still wasn't good.

215
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.570
Jessica Freeman: He's on he's on a different track.

216
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.960
Jessica Freeman: And you see the path of

217
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Destruction that's coming

218
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:56.490
Jessica Freeman: I do. I also think that this newfound interest in you know really personally connecting with everybody. I think it's bullshit.

219
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.780
Jessica Freeman: I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. But there's just holes in everything that he says

220
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.040
Right.

221
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:07.800
Jessica Freeman: I know what

222
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.400
He's doing

223
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's he doing

224
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.860
Jessica Freeman: My mom is now married to a very wealthy man.

225
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.450
Jessica Freeman: And Adam has always been about the money.

226
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.290
Jessica Freeman: So, I mean, he he's got an agenda. He's always got an agenda.

227
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

228
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.970
Wow.

229
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.380
Jessica Freeman: That's heavy, it's heavy stuff.

230
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, feels really heavy.

231
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

232
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:54.180
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and it has been for years. The only thing that's changed now as opposed to all the horrible years is that I've got my shit together now. And I don't have to

233
00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:02.910
Jessica Freeman: It doesn't have to like upset me and blow my lid and you know I don't, I'm not upset about it. It makes me sad, but

234
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.510
Jessica Freeman: It's not impacting my world, you know,

235
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.150
Jessica Freeman: Gotta be alive. I'm happy with my life.

236
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and how's the relationship between him and your mom.

237
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.550
Jessica Freeman: Company complicated

238
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.580
Jessica Freeman: He can get your hands out of your pants, please. Thank you.

239
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.860
Jessica Freeman: Boys.

240
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:40.290
Jessica Freeman: It's been strained for a really long time. Adam has been really aggressive and

241
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:50.280
Jessica Freeman: He just really pushes his opinions and like I'm never coming back to the US and mom's a liar and he's been saying this stuff for years and years and years.

242
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:59.850
Jessica Freeman: And all he does is like he pushes her to find out her financial records. This is what he wants. He's like, I want to help you so that we can invest and blah, blah, blah.

243
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:12.480
Jessica Freeman: But you have to, you know, show me the truth, mom. And if you don't, you're a liar. So that's what's been like, up until she married, Bob. That's how he's they've been estranged like he he's gone for

244
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:25.050
Jessica Freeman: Very long periods of time without having any interaction with my mom so she marries Bob and now he's trying to ingratiate himself with mom and Bob

245
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.540
Jessica Freeman: And I don't know, I just feel like it's false. Oh hang on one second.

246
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.560
Jessica Freeman: I've been sharing a meeting on Wednesdays.

247
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.120
Jessica Freeman: No, honey. Not yet. Mommy has mommy's busy. Okay.

248
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.810
Jessica Freeman: All right, go play honey mom is busy right now.

249
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.500
Jessica Freeman: So I was doing like back to my list.

250
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

251
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.530
Jessica Freeman: I was doing like I've been doing Monday through Friday daily meetings and

252
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:44.550
Jessica Freeman: More music less TV as pretty good about that for a minute. But now I started watching Westworld so I'm kind of addicted.

253
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:57.510
Jessica Freeman: And then on my on this list was make a to do list and I'm on my second version of my to do list because my first version had so much stuff crossed off.

254
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:13.080
Jessica Freeman: And I didn't have much room on the page. So I just copied over the things that weren't done and added some new things and I have a nice list and I am making progress. Not as much progress as I would like. But, um, you know, some progress.

255
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah so well. Some is better than none. Right.

256
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.770
Yeah.

257
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:29.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know you've got your hands full. You've got this baby that needs mama. You know, so do what you can. When you can just kind of how it works. You know, yeah.

258
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so how has your, you said that your mom and had your baby for 24 hours. So you got some rest.

259
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's already

260
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.130
Jessica Freeman: She said,

261
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.300
Jessica Freeman: Well 3pm. And then I got him back at 11am

262
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, not even 24

263
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:57.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what you've been doing for yourself care. How has that been as far as taking care of yourself and meeting your needs and

264
00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: While I'm going to just

265
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.060
Jessica Freeman: Admit. It's been a really rough few weeks.

266
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.570
Jessica Freeman: And it things are just now getting to the point where

267
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:15.480
Jessica Freeman: You know, back to back to normal, where he will play independently and you know will place together and but just not

268
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:25.830
Jessica Freeman: Constantly you know he doesn't need my constant attention. So things are just now getting back to that place and this morning I placed an order for

269
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.010
Jessica Freeman: Some new a literature.

270
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:49.590
Jessica Freeman: Right as a sponsor like I had given a bunch of stuff away. So I just wanted to replace my literature on the patio furniture is amazing. And I'm gonna get a grill. I was just talking to Bob about that last night. So I'm about to buy a grill.

271
00:31:50.820 --> 00:32:08.220
Jessica Freeman: And I've been thinking that I don't want to go back to this job where I'm taking an unpaid leave of absence. I think that because I'm in the best financial place I've been in maybe in my whole life. Um,

272
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.960
Jessica Freeman: I think I might want to go back to school.

273
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:25.680
Jessica Freeman: And and clean up my credit and make myself more employable or maybe a business owner. Yeah, but I gotta get my credit and clean up so that I can

274
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:35.040
Jessica Freeman: I need a business loan, I need to be able to get a business loan or if I need to finance getting my teeth fixed, you know, then

275
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.820
Jessica Freeman: I can you know

276
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:49.140
Jessica Freeman: Have a lot of different options. Once I take care of that. And I haven't even done anything with the last job that I got. It's like $5,342 and it's just sitting like

277
00:32:49.890 --> 00:33:07.410
Jessica Freeman: On the kitchen overpass counter thing between the kitchen and the dining room just sitting there because I don't want to do anything with it until it has a purpose. And I don't want to decide on that purpose. Like, like that. I really want to be sure about what I'm going to do with it.

278
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.430
Jessica Freeman: Right. Oh.

279
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:17.280
Jessica Freeman: Um, I know this doesn't really count as self care. But to me, it kind of does because it's something I'm doing for myself.

280
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.480
Jessica Freeman: So I'm thinking about

281
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.020
Jessica Freeman: Some continuing education.

282
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What would you go back to school for

283
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.000
Jessica Freeman: Well, at my last job in Indianapolis. I loved it so much.

284
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.170
Jessica Freeman: I would like to dive deeper into

285
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.470
Jessica Freeman: I'm

286
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.620
Jessica Freeman: Coding and

287
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.880
Jessica Freeman: Web development.

288
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.590
Jessica Freeman: And

289
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:59.730
Jessica Freeman: Possibly like work for the get HubSpot certified or Salesforce Salesforce certified and maybe be able to work remotely.

290
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.090
Jessica Freeman: From one of those CRM.

291
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:07.740
Jessica Freeman: until I'm ready to do something on on my own.

292
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.670
Jessica Freeman: I really like working in a CRM. I love that like the coding aspect and

293
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.620
Jessica Freeman: Development it's it's really, really interesting and

294
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.170
Jessica Freeman: That's what I want to do.

295
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

296
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That sounds awesome.

297
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So have you been looking into what that would entail, if you were to

298
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.230
Ask

299
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:42.090
Jessica Freeman: And I'm I mean I'm still in research mode. I've gathered some information. And I'm going to gather some more.

300
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.050
And

301
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.620
Jessica Freeman: And discuss it with Bob

302
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:56.310
Jessica Freeman: And mom and I don't know. I'm gonna make I'll make a decision. Soon I just want to make sure I have all all the information

303
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, gather the facts first

304
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.800
Yeah.

305
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love that isn't, it isn't it great when you're able to just evaluate it and work on changing the things that you want to change for your future.

306
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

307
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:19.800
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I've never been in the situation. I've always been like broke his buck.

308
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.120
Jessica Freeman: You know, just barely scraping by but but I get $783 a

309
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:42.120
Jessica Freeman: Month SSI that covers my rent and my car payment that I paid to mom and Bob I have over $600 of food stamps because of Hova they put all this money in

310
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:50.760
Jessica Freeman: Like 300 bucks a month, you know, you just keep pouring it in and it's just me, you know, and him so

311
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.220
Jessica Freeman: that'll last us a while.

312
00:35:54.450 --> 00:36:01.890
Jessica Freeman: So I'm really not putting out much money. I don't have to like fill my gas tank. I just did the other day for the first time in like two months.

313
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably why gas prices down where you're at.

314
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.290
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, they are.

315
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isn't that crazy. It's like, all of a sudden, nobody can leave and drive around and you know gas prices shoot down and then whenever society completely opens up there, it's going to shoot through the roof.

316
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

317
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:32.760
Jessica Freeman: You know, well hopefully they're playing it smart about that. I thought I heard something where they're like stockpiling. I don't know.

318
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:46.560
Jessica Freeman: I have stopped watching the news entirely and I'll look on look stuff up. Like if I want to know, like, Okay, well, what is our governor have to say about this issue, then I'll look it up.

319
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.990
Jessica Freeman: I'm not watching the news anymore.

320
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't watch it either.

321
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have no control.

322
00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There, you know, the little place that that I used to live in Oregon.

323
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:22.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a tourist area. So it's on the coast and last weekend 700 people from Portland came up to the coast and tried to do their stay and do their vacation and they were sent away, they could run a motel room. They couldn't. Everything was closed like it was like it's been right.

324
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

325
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It upset a bunch of people. So they're the Saturday, they are taking about 2000 people from Portland going back to the coast and holding a rally.

326
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, demanding that they open the ghost right

327
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:47.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so what I thought was funny. Was that the city council members decided in retaliation of this rally.

328
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're going to close all the bathrooms.

329
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.700
Jessica Freeman: All the what

330
00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The bathroom. Yes, all the public bathroom. So I thought I, in my mind, what I'm thinking is, that's not going to work. You're gonna have people. You know what I mean.

331
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.260
Jessica Freeman: We still have to use the restroom. So maybe the rally people should just bring in porta potties or something.

332
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just thought, God, where do you, where do people come up with these since. Let's just close the bottom so that they can you know order to me in protest and pee and poop all over the beach and oh

333
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.120
Jessica Freeman: My god. It's ridiculous.

334
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just thought that was just chaotic like

335
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who thought of that. And you know what I mean. And who

336
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: These people agreed to this. Yeah, it's blows my mind, you know,

337
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Yeah, that sounds

338
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sounds like a great idea because it's all going to go so great. And, you know, people are going to be calm about it and

339
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I can't

340
00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go to the restroom. You know, it's a two hour drive just to the coast. I can't go to the restroom. When I get he just blows me away. It's like, that's kind of

341
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, these are the answers that you know these people are coming up with to solve these issues that are coming up and they just make

342
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No sense

343
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.130
No.

344
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:40.230
Jessica Freeman: And now there's like this big debate Dr Faust, she is saying like, don't let the kids go back to school in the fall. Now I I generally lean towards Dr our cheese advice, but on this one, like we need to figure out a way to safely get our children back in school. Yes, cannot continue

345
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it doesn't make sense. And you'll hear depending on who you listen to and what you listen

346
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To because there's been other people that have said kids shouldn't have never been taken out of school.

347
00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you know there's no reason for it and you know they should still be in school right now and we're hindering our children with their education by trying to do it this way. And you know, it's, I think, depending on who you listen to, you're going to get all sides of it and

348
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.680
Jessica Freeman: You know none of all I know is what I believe.

349
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:20.340
Jessica Freeman: And I said, we need to put measures into place. Okay, and get the kids back to school.

350
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally agree with you, because they are not

351
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not helping them in any way.

352
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and then let's push them through to next year when they haven't learned what they need to learn in this is

353
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they can get farther back later on down the road.

354
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.300
Jessica Freeman: All of a sudden, yes.

355
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's crazy. Our kids are all going to fail. And it's like, it's because they don't know the material, you know,

356
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Still got to keep up on that stuff, cuz those state, you know, testing, they need to happen, you know,

357
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it just is a chaotic mess. And I think they're going to band aid things

358
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

359
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:02.520
Well,

360
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.350
Jessica Freeman: I hope so. I don't know. I don't feel like

361
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:16.770
Jessica Freeman: Like we should totally reopen, but I do think that there are some some vital things that we can't. There's just not sustainable. The way that it is

362
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.000
Yeah.

363
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.970
Jessica Freeman: I don't know I I despise President Trump I call him President Dushku

364
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.890
Jessica Freeman: I despised him.

365
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.850
Jessica Freeman: Before, and now I despise him even more.

366
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:38.520
Jessica Freeman: And I'm actually like preparing myself mentally and emotionally for him. Like for him to get reelected. Like, it's probably going to happen because Biden's not going to win.

367
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:47.730
Jessica Freeman: And we only have two choices. So I'm pretty pissed about that. I think our politics, like the whole system is bullshit like we need more options. This is crap.

368
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'm sure I'm not the

369
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:58.470
Jessica Freeman: First person in history to to feel that way. And last year was the same thing. I mean, I voted for Hillary, but I know a lot of people wouldn't. We just don't have a good Democratic candidate.

370
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.190
Jessica Freeman: And so he's gonna win. And then there's going to be another four years.

371
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.060
Jessica Freeman: And I hate him and I hate him him so much.

372
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.770
Jessica Freeman: He's with he's a cotton candy haired nitwit

373
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:18.960
Jessica Freeman: I got really strong feelings like I actually stopped dating a guy because I found out that he voted for Trump.

374
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.890
Jessica Freeman: And most of my family in Indiana or republican

375
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

376
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.950
Jessica Freeman: So we don't talk politics are either

377
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.610
Jessica Freeman: They can all they want, and I'll go outside and take a break.

378
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame him politics is not the subject to be on for anybody.

379
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like that with my father.

380
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To he believes in Trump and he's 100% for him. But if you don't believe in Trump and it's like, don't talk to him. And so it's like

381
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just not even getting engaged in any kind of warfare conversation with them.

382
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have your beliefs. I have mine. And that's perfectly okay yeah I'll leave it alone. So let's get back to your list.

383
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.830
Jessica Freeman: And that was the end of the list, but I can get my to do list.

384
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:12.150
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

385
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:41.160
Jessica Freeman: I'm going on year I got a call a couple of places that have charged my checking account in error. It's like three of those.

386
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.650
Jessica Freeman: Who will finish that one.

387
00:43:48.870 --> 00:44:03.930
Jessica Freeman: I'm like, halfway through cleaning the master bathroom. I got like toilet part done, but I didn't do the counters or anything yet so halfway through. Oh, I took a keto to the vet and I got his medication refills.

388
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.000
Jessica Freeman: And

389
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:07.650
Jessica Freeman: I bought

390
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:23.220
Jessica Freeman: I bought a filing cabinet and like all this stuff to organize my paperwork. So I have like our folders and hanging folders and labels and a label maker which mom gave me that like second here and

391
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:38.460
Jessica Freeman: I'm ready to organize my paperwork ready. Okay, yeah, which I kind of did like a preliminary sort through and an all I had was hanging file folders. I was like, this isn't gonna work. I need subcategories so

392
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.940
Jessica Freeman: So I got all this stuff and I'm ready to do that.

393
00:44:47.100 --> 00:45:03.930
Jessica Freeman: I'm going to go through my Spotify playlist. I actually started this one, you know, going along with the more music less TV before key and got sick and it was fine, because I hadn't hadn't gone through Spotify like since my older sons 10th birthday. Okay.

394
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:14.880
Jessica Freeman: I guess a long time. So I was listening to all the playlist that I made in like 2013 2014 and I'm like oh my god you know

395
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.550
Jessica Freeman: Flashback

396
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not

397
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.790
Jessica Freeman: The same person anymore. Like, not even

398
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: listen to songs that you used to listen to you and think, why did I ever like this.

399
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.550
Jessica Freeman: Yes, ma'am. That's exactly what happened.

400
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.380
Jessica Freeman: Like the whole dubstep era.

401
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:53.880
Jessica Freeman: But then I also like while I was doing this I threw my I through Brendan, a huge birthday party for his 10th. I had like bunch of inflatables like a bounce house and obstacle course I had big sumo suit so the kids can wrestle with the Sumo suit.

402
00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:14.610
Jessica Freeman: And some others that I can't remember like there were like three or four enormous inflatables, and then I made a I made a Spotify playlist just his party like and there was a bunch of 10 year olds and like most of the music on that playlist that I made was so inappropriate. Like, I shouldn't

403
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.840
Jessica Freeman: Play 10 year old birthday party. What was I thinking

404
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.220
Jessica Freeman: I was thinking on drugs.

405
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there it is.

406
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.150
Jessica Freeman: That they all had a blast. I will say that the party was a huge success.

407
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This music

408
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:46.320
Jessica Freeman: Oh no, they loved it. They were all like standing up on tables dancing together. I got, I got some good video of

409

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you did it like a trooper. That's another thing. You know what I mean. You didn't relapse. You didn't you just, you know, kept your eye on the prize and and push through the whole thing, you know.

554
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:53.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is pretty amazing, too. Because if anybody, anybody else, you know, would have had to have gone through what you went through with the baby. The last couple weeks.

555
00:59:53.970 --> 01:00:02.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would have been a disaster for relapse. You know, those are these are stressors that you know we struggle with handling sometimes, you know,

556
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do we do it.

557
01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.440
Jessica Freeman: I'm not gonna say that. I didn't think about it.

558
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:09.510
Jessica Freeman: Because I definitely had some thoughts.

559
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.930
Jessica Freeman: But I'm into action.

560
01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, it's the action that

561
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Matters. You know, there's those thoughts are always going to be there when things when you're happier when you're sad or life stressful or life's happy, they're always going to be there. But what you can do that, you know,

562
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you didn't act on those on those thoughts and that's the most important thing

563
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.670
Jessica Freeman: And try to talk to support if people

564
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.840
Jessica Freeman: So, you know, kind of tell on myself.

565
01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.250
Jessica Freeman: So that

566
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.750
Jessica Freeman: And then usually once it comes out of my mouth. It's like lost its power.

567
01:00:47.160 --> 01:01:01.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah because secrets. Keep us sick. That's how our disease grows. If we keep the secrets and don't tell anybody about them. That's a cocktail for him to get in there and grab a hold of it and expanded in our head. Well, no one has no you know

568
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.800
Jessica Freeman: It's like, oh, I've been there many times

569
01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:13.260
Jessica Freeman: I just, I don't want to do what I have right now. You know, I don't want to lose the game.

570
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've gained a lot. That's for sure.

571
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're well on your way and to have the life you've always deserved, you know,

572
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.270
Jessica Freeman: Thank you.

573
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.220
Pretty amazing.

574
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you have a list.

575
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.570
I do

576
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so good.

577
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:50.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'll be curious to see what you find out about furthering your education and that you follow through with the three self care things that you put on your list.

578
01:01:51.990 --> 01:02:00.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And whether or not you'll be able to find services for him in the community. I hope that you can because that gives you a little bit more time for you to be able to complete

579
01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The tasks that you have on your list right

580
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.310
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

581
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wish the

582
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:21.570
Jessica Freeman: Community had like a voice with all these decisions that they're making with about education. I feel like the special needs community isn't isn't really being considered, you know,

583
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:34.650
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I might. I might look into that because I'm part of a couple of moms groups on Facebook like locally and see if anybody else feels the same way that I do and see what can we can do about it.

584
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome.

585
