1
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.830
Magan: On Sundays and Mondays.

2
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Sundays and Mondays.

3
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to review. If you want to attend a group I have 9am on a Monday and I have 1pm on a Monday.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.500
Magan: Probably 1pm would probably be better.

5
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

6
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then on the day that you decided to go to group whenever that is we won't do individual therapy. Right. And then on the days that you're not we can maybe create individual therapy time on a Monday.

7
00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:07.590
Magan: Yeah, or like I can still meet with you in the morning like this just long as I'm not mandated that call me problem that I have run into is getting Mandy and I always going to happen to work and they'll just say hey, Megan, you're mandated there's nobody answering their phones.

8
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I think what's interesting is if we do it on a Monday. Then there's all these days of the week to make up to create time this weekend stuff is is not forever. This is sort of a rare thing for me.

9
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.350
Magan: Oh, I understand.

10
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm saying. It gives you more of an opportunity, create time as a backup like okay well you know maybe it'll be on call or something.

11
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean like I may have someone in they aren't able to show up. I could text you and hey, you're free. And it could work. It could do it a little bit free and loose.

12
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.560
Magan: Yeah.

13
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're, you know, I hear you. I, I know that's a challenge.

14
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's just take it one week at a time. Let's see what what you get as far as your schedule.

15
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.530
Magan: All right. Well, one thing I did want to ask, okay, so I I was under the impression

16
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.130
Magan: Because of what I was told.

17
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:22.230
Magan: By right heart health admissions and but by Dr. Rob real I guess she told admissions. This may pass it along to me is that the minimum requirements is from me that she wanted was that I see her once a month, I go to group once a month, and I see you once a month.

18
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.630
Magan: Okay and and that's what I was advised and

19
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.120
Magan: So,

20
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.770
Magan: Well, and very bare minimum that

21
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.500
Magan: You're breaking up. Sorry. Can you hear me now.

22
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This is important. Megan. Take your time.

23
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.750
Magan: Go there.

24
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you the connection scare me or no, no, I really can't hear you right now. So go inside get comfy. Let's get get you

25
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: telling me what you

26
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to do and then

27
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know, let's let's not

28
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.180
Magan: Have okay

29
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to miss anything. You're saying

30
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.650
Magan: Cuz I'm, I'm sorry, I'm pulling up to the house. I'm almost there. I have like less than 40 seconds.

31
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just pulling up a note, putting the right time on it, etc. So

32
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.580
No worries.

33
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.680
Magan: Okay.

34
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.330
Magan: Okay.

35
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So today is actually a treatment never knew we wanted to take a

36
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.740
Look,

37
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, there's a lot to do in a short amount of time.

38
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.640
Magan: Yeah.

39
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.590
Magan: Okay. All right. I am pulling into the driveway.

40
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.170
Magan: Sorry. Okay, so

41
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember something what you're describing

42
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.040
And

43
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look through the working group on January 20 so

44
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What do you want to

45
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.610
Will say

46
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Worry

47
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.680
Magan: Let's see where it lands close to that.

48
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be like February 24 if you wanted you could make that a group day and I could write a little note that that would be your group day

49
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:16.350
Magan: Yeah. Um, so I get paid. Again, I got, I get paid on the seventh and then I get paid again on the

50
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.490
Magan: I get paid on the seventh and I get paid again on the 21st. So 24th would be perfect.

51
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll go

52
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, do you want to do the one o'clock, three o'clock here. So Megan.

53
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.220
All right.

54
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever.

55
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, is

56
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: In a cave whatever's going on with medication, it's only going to be once a month, so

57
00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:07.890
Magan: Okay, so that's the problem that I'm running into so I don't know why. Dr. Well first, Dr Arielle understandably, she was withholding my medication and only

58
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:24.450
Magan: Only giving me a prescription for every day. Well, first it was like every 10 days then it was like for three days and then it was every day because my urine. When I went to Presbyterian

59
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:32.910
Magan: They don't have any record of the lab that I did. So I was like, Oh, great. So I had to go back and I went back to the labs.

60
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:46.410
Magan: And to quest. This time I actually went to quest to make sure that I went to the correct lab place and I got a urine test on when I went to the lab place.

61
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:56.430
Magan: They said I asked them specifically, is there any blood work or is it just urine and they said, It's just you're in, and I had to pay $200 for a copay

62
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:07.020
Magan: And it was really, really expensive. And that's not even including the CO pays that I have for the doctor for

63
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:18.510
Magan: You and for group. So it's a lot of money. So I sent a message to Roger rail yesterday, asking her for a month prescription

64
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:28.110
Magan: And she responded with a red shoe. A month prescription. But if you miss another appointment, we're going back 10 days. And I'm also ready for 3.5

65
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:41.010
Magan: I which point I became very upset because, number one, she didn't even ask me how I felt about it. She didn't even ask me like, hey, Megan. How do you feel about tapering down she decided for me.

66
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:49.590
Magan: And I thought, you know, hey, don't I have to say in my own healthcare. Just, just wondering, okay, so

67
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You do and

68
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.900
Magan: When

69
00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: They're on January 20 did you find yourself making sure you communicate your goal around that.

70
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So might be the challenge, right, because

71
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.710
Magan: Google

72
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:17.250
Magan: Have trouble sometimes. Right. Well, I hate group, as you know, but on January 20 I got like a spur of the moment sign in and I was already 30 minutes late for that class. If you remember,

73
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:28.740
Magan: Yeah, are logged in late because admissions asked me because I asked for a refill. And they were like, is there any way that you could log into group right now. And it wasn't my usual group time

74
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:41.880
Magan: So I logged into that group and I did what they asked me to do. But everything was really spur of the moment short handed notice and I wasn't prepared at all.

75
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:51.660
Magan: But I did get a prescription. After that, but only for a few days because Dr. Real wanted me to get we get my blood, urine test them.

76
00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:05.280
Magan: So I did go do what she asked me to do. And I reminded her of that in the message like hey I did everything that you asked me to do. Why is it that you're using my medication that's like punishment.

77
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.860
Magan: And that's what it felt like it felt like she was using it as leverage to get me to do what she wants me to do and how she wants me to do it.

78
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That does make sense and let me know if you take this might be useful information. It is the only leverage that this abuse treatment program has

79
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.010
Magan: They don't have. I understand.

80
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But they don't. But it's used. Let me, let me show you something. This might be helpful.

81
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.840
Magan: But I did everything that she asked me to do. And that's what I was upset.

82
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:47.130
Magan: Because I did everything that she asked me do you I've been attending therapy. I've been attending group. I've been attending appointments with her.

83
00:09:47.460 --> 00:10:00.570
Magan: I went and did my bloodwork Presbyterian last. It has no track of it. So I had to go back and do a urine with quest lab and pay $200 copay for that I did absolutely everything she asked me to do.

84
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:10.890
Magan: And I still got treated that way. That's what I understand that's only leverage you guys have in order to make things happen for us and vice versa. It's

85
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:26.640
Magan: It's kind of like your own insurance and I totally get that, um, but what but what I was upset about is that I did everything I was supposed to do. And I still got that from her. And because I missed yesterday because I got Mandy.

86
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

87
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling like you're being treated differently than other clients. Is that what I'm hearing

88
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.570
Magan: No, it's not that I'm being treated differently. I don't feel that I don't know how other clients are being treated

89
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, well that's

90
00:10:47.310 --> 00:11:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Something there's there's different stuff. There's how this feels right, it feels like punishment feels punitive and that's real. Right. You see, you're doing what you're supposed to do. And then there's this confusing punishment that's being experienced that, that's one piece.

91
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:15.930
Magan: Well, yeah. Because it felt like, where's this coming from because I did everything she asked, so if I did everything that she required of me.

92
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:30.240
Magan: And and I can't control I explained this to her when I started the program. I am a director my schedule is demanding and if I get mandated. I have no choice. I have to stay there or I lose my job. I can't just walk out on my job.

93
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:42.150
Magan: And that is literally the only thing that gets in my way, at any time, even when I'm really tired. I'll still log on with you, like when I'm exhausted and all I want to do sleep.

94
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know if this is going to help. So for some people just seeing it in writing already existing it can lift a little bit of the punitive nature. So, this is this is bright heart health portal, I, I don't know.

95
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.860
Magan: Whether you I've read this.

96
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So, yeah.

97
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: They talked down here about

98
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: non compliance. So let's say you don't do what your agreement has to do with attending individual therapy.

99
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you attend it you miss them. You do no show because you have this particular work environment, but the the no show still exists. The reason

100
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You might say is this immovable force, you might say, well, I'm not willing to lose my job in order to miss this. But it's still real there still is the event of a missed appointment is still occurring.

101
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.760
Magan: It's just you feel helpless to do anything about it.

102
00:12:43.020 --> 00:13:01.350
Magan: Well yeah and and so I called well Venus messaged me and asked me if I could attend and I told her no. And so when I called my heart health disease because my medication. Instead, I did everything right. I didn't just like no call no show I explained I hey I can't, I can't go.

103
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:07.140
Magan: I tried to do everything the way that we're supposed to do it and

104
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.660
Magan: I get

105
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, remember this is your time. So let's, let's just my recommendation is first to look at this. So let's just look at this together.

106
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is across the board, discuss the problem with the patient, reduce the prescription quantity to seven days or less, these are these are sort of how bright heart health can trying to bring people

107
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So that they're taking their medication as directed and talk therapy is medication as well. So that is a treatment that's recommended. So you've got this then increased frequency of drug screens. That's another one.

108
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: They have this I have yet to be able to get a care navigator to do it. They count.

109
00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The strokes.

110
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought so it's very close case management kind of task and I've never been able to accomplish that possible dose adjustment for opioid use. So I just wanted you to see it in writing. So maybe it could. I don't know, logically, a little bit of feeling quite as punitive so personal.

111
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase counseling sessions attendance at weekly support groups discontinued treatment. So your you know your your situation. Right.

112
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It asks for accommodation. It says, I don't want to be held accountable quite the same, because I have this particular requirement of my job, which is, I don't have a choice. I have to stay right

113
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:57.600
Magan: No, that wasn't that wasn't the reason. So when I came back into the program I they told me how we would be able to move forward and the one month.

114
00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:06.150
Magan: Is what they told me and I've been actually doing more than that. I've been doing, but seeing you more than that.

115
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:20.100
Magan: I'm making sure that I'm seeing you more than that because I know that it's necessary. I know that it's needed, and I know I need it and I feel better when I do see you. But to say that I'm non compliant, it's not it's not completely accurate.

116
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But the whole you got to just hold the space for this, had it not the ability for me today or another weekend to have created time, there would have been missed appointments and no ability to follow up that week. This is just

117
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The those, those are facts like typically I don't see people on weekends. So that's why I'm recommending that we have this bit of buffer throughout the week but just just this is really tricky. Megan, I don't like this space of being this compliance regulator here. It's really uncomfortable.

118
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.660
Magan: Against I think pumping for me.

119
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it may get in the way a little bit. So, um, let's just bring it way down. And let's just let's just look at this for a second.

120
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And this for some for some people, has registered for them.

121
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can hold on to to just hearing what I'm saying for one human being to another, from one working woman to another, from one professional to another, right. Just hold on to that you didn't do anything wrong.

122
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't go there, don't let yourself go there and just see if you can hold on to your therapist earns her living by seeing clients. She couldn't earn her living for that hour

123
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. Just hold that for just 20 seconds.

124
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all.

125
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were able to continue earning your living right I'm not pulling you away from work you you're continuing to do it.

126
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I i I'm I'm creating time for people that have their kids like the their their their kids arms get broken up into job. I mean, you know, I mean you get mandated. There are certain things in life. We're human.

127
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we have we have lives we have complex unpredictable things that happen. We have to accommodate each other. We have to write. And that's what we're doing. And we've been doing. And I think it's been working

128
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I've, I've been able to say, Okay, this is a constraint with Megan's work life. She really likes this job. It's not going anywhere, she's fighting hard for it, she's going through huge efforts to

129
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To see herself in this new sort of empowered way and you're doing amazing things with your life right now. So it isn't just one thing. It's this context of all this progress that you're making right either. You're not just this. I didn't make it to therapy. It's not just that is it.

130
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

131
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, much more than that.

132
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people may get it is for some people it's really registering. It doesn't matter how this other human being. Right.

133
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I, you know, work it out. Therapists work it out program that's your issue. You know what I'm saying. For some people, that is the case, but you're really good at communicating with me and letting me know, hey, I can't make it a mandated

134
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:43.890
Magan: Okay, well, it's not that it's not that I don't care about you not getting paid for an hour. I absolutely do care. And that does register with me. It absolutely does register with me.

135
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.400
Magan: But I care so much about everybody else all the time when when Dr. Gabriel spoke to me that way.

136
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.710
Magan: So she's are you

137
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:56.220
Magan: How

138
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.360
Magan: He taught me.

139
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.810
Magan: She actually taught like in in message.

140
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I get an

141
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.450
Answer.

142
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:05.850
Magan: It.

143
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, is that this text.

144
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.150
Magan: And typically, I would just say,

145
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.580
Magan: Okay, whatever you want.

146
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

147
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.300
Magan: And that's, and I'm not okay with that anymore.

148
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So is this the sum total of the. Is this like a copy paste thing, this thing is that, um, this one I will give you a month's worth. Is this her

149
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

150
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.720
Magan: I can, I can read everything before that, too. I tried to screenshot it

151
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:47.640
Magan: To send to you. Exactly. So you. I don't know how much is sent to you, but

152
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.900
Magan: It was

153
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.190
Magan: Remember that

154
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Megan. This is your time. So let's go another level underneath content.

155
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an opportunity to sort of use this skill of

156
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going through her own storyline. She's not a therapist. She's not your therapist anyway.

157
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But she has her own storyline. Okay. It does not have to affect what you do and you're fighting

158
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: For your. I don't want to please Dr. Aubrey oh I want to maintain my own self. I want to stand up for what I think is right, you know, isn't that what you're doing, like you're saying that I don't just want to say yes. I don't want to say yes to something that's not my yes that which

159
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.330
Magan: Is that's that's what's going on and

160
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.550
Magan: She I just I need her to hear me, and she doesn't hear me.

161
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's the one that's the one right there. It's the need to hear

162
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Which would you rather have this person. Okay, again,

163
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not developing additional rapport with her. You don't really enjoy kind of hanging out and group and that whole dynamic between you two just never really got completely full circle there.

164
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: She's a temporary blip on your radar. She is not an intimate part of your life, but she does have power.

165
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.990
Magan: Yes.

166
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.720
Magan: It was powers Alderson

167
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is the theme someone with authority or you may have given away some of that power to this to whoever, whether it's, you know, someone at work or some person coworker or husband or a someone right and said,

168
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you've been using it for years. Yes. Okay. Your final well repress my needs, wants, and preferences, because you have this authority over me. Right. That's a big piece of the work that you and I are doing and you're playing it out in this classroom at work.

169
00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying to someone that has power over you know you're doing it. You're doing it here and bright heart right, cool. Um, I got you. I can kind of guess what's going on.

170
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And and we're talking about it right now and I'm so proud of you for coming here because you could have run away and said, Fuck it.

171
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't. And you're brave, for being here. Okay, really brave.

172
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That is her stuff.

173
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's her stuff and your part is

174
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding onto yourself in the presence of someone else's stuff even when it looks like they're threatening you know something comfortable for you some predictability some change and expectation. You keep holding on. You don't have to go to

175
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's the predominant thought about who you are right now in what's going on with Dr. Ivan. What does this say about you. What do you believe about yourself right now.

176
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:03.900
Magan: Well, this is actually something I that came up in my head last night. It's really weird that you asked that because I'm like

177
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.860
Magan: This is an issue for me because

178
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.370
Magan: I noticed that I'm getting angry.

179
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:26.250
Magan: And letting up, but like, it's not just with Dr brielle it's with Sydney. It's with Andrew it's with every single person who Fox with me.

180
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

181
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:38.160
Magan: And it's anger and I was, I was thinking about last night, like why am I just automatically linked anger. Now instead of

182
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:52.440
Magan: The usual oh past passes walk all over me. I'll do whatever you want. Megan So I don't want to be one extreme, or the other.

183
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.500
Magan: I don't, I really don't. But

184
00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:04.590
Magan: The only way that I ever learned how to defend myself where I can guarantee, someone will leave me the fuck alone is if I get angry.

185
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But she but notice this is leave me the fuck alone would be I'm walking off the job, leave me the fuck alone would be vibrate heart.

186
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That isn't actually what you want, what you want. I think is access to modulated something to modulate between Sia.

187
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm protecting myself. You're, you still want this resource. She wants your job you want access to program, right, you still want access to it, but the skill you have the one you remember that was effective was

188
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right that mustering up of really sort of rage and anger and and this enough is enough. And

189
00:24:47.370 --> 00:25:08.100
Magan: Yeah, and I went through that in my when I was 19 till I became a mommy. There was a really big stage. Well, not even 19 was a little bit younger actually 16 1516 till till I became a mom and it was when Scott was no longer touching me or doing things that he was doing to me.

190
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.130
Magan: I saw him once again when I was 19 and you know that's a whole different story, but

191
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:24.360
Magan: I was angry very, very angry and I'm just reminded of that again because

192
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.610
Magan: My anger really simmered down and it just

193
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.240
Magan: Turned into something else.

194
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.140
Magan: But during that period of time there was

195
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.800
Anger.

196
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.680
Magan: Every, every response, let me

197
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check on timeline on that one more time anger was between when and when would you say 16 and

198
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.960
Magan: 16 and 21

199
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To 21

200
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.510
Magan: Or 16 and 2116 to 21

201
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There was anger.

202
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:14.640
Magan: There was anger is my formidable response. My first response was anger and violence. Actually, I got into a lot of fistfights I got into I got arrested I you know there was so many things that happened to me during that period of time, but I do remember anger.

203
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So in between there is

204
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

205
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This modulated assertiveness, which is not, it's not righteousness. It's not I'm right, they're wrong. I'm I have, I have to be the good one here, they have to be the villain and that being the opposite. Okay, now I can justify all of this stuff in, in sort of this

206
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: World where there isn't toxic, you know, just catastrophic violence and abuse and all that you're creating just sort of this day to day you know in your work environment, yours is pretty yucky at work. I mean, they

207
00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: These large organizations can get pretty toxic. I gotta tell you, but, and you know that. But in general, it doesn't have to be quite that extreme.

208
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

209
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do is is just going back maybe kind of putting on

210
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Today on this piece about sort of preparation for the SDR and sort of do a little bit around a sort of like finding a comfort level around assertive versus

211
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right indignation right just feeling like how could you help. What is it, remember that one. How good is it me is this is following me. What is it about me that that people treat me like this. What is it, what is it,

212
00:27:44.580 --> 00:28:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's how do I hold on to myself, How do I, how does Megan, hold on to herself in her preference not take on the label of someone else's treatment. So we'll take Dr rails treating you in a particular way, or her reasons.

213
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You maintain yourself without having to go to anger, you just stick with what you want. You heard it a particular way.

214
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say to yourself.

215
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the part that I want to hear from you. What is it about you. What do you believe in yourself.

216
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That gives you the ability to speak your mind.

217
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And be heard. What's the belief about us, you know that you're capable of doing that.

218
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:41.790
Magan: I think the general belief is that I know that I deserve better. For myself, I

219
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, deserves a tricky word. I know it. I'm really focused on linguistics this morning but remember that words represent a lot of symbolism and they they can actually kind of get it though.

220
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:57.570
It.

221
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Was different want I want better deserve will will send you in a into the sort of righteousness and then and then you might have to say, well, who doesn't deserve better.

222
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it about you. Right.

223
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.720
Magan: Why are you so special.

224
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you are.

225
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But so she so is he. So are we. But I want better so so let's just see, I want you to to envision right now.

226
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What does the way let's say you correspondent with Dr. Real. What does that say about your beliefs about yourself just slow way down and really think about that question.

227
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.160
Magan: Like, why did I feel the need to respond to her that way.

228
00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This is very much about the belief about yourself. This is getting at a very core operating system here. So go nice and slow. If you want late you can lay it on me and describe what you think the belief about myself would be

229
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:22.560
Magan: No, no, I'm just trying to form it into words like what I'm trying to get to what you're wanting or what your ass. I'm trying to get the core of what you're saying.

230
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes to I

231
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.780
Magan: Want a light bulb will come on, as soon as I figure it out.

232
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.480
Magan: usually does. Oh.

233
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a way. And what you can do is you can so picture just go nice and slow. So I'm going to give you a little structure, but first picture it picture the text. So you right you you weren't able to attend an appointment. Just walk it through.

234
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:46.740
Magan: Oh,

235
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you're walking it through. Oh, I

236
00:30:50.880 --> 00:31:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't decide right I have this this job and it pulled me in and then right you're reaching out, I'm assuming to right heart. Hey, I need my medication and you receive this message back

237
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And go into how you felt the emotion you felt

238
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.860
Magan: Well, unless

239
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.910
Magan: We all know the circumstances of everything, read the message back and you felt

240
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.480
Magan: I felt attacked

241
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.680
Okay, there we go.

242
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, hold on a little longer there for a second. I felt attacked so

243
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you feeling

244
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:49.560
Afraid.

245
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.260
Magan: I was not in any physical

246
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, you're working the therapy angle there. I see it.

247
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So cute.

248
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I

249
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't gonna go there.

250
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Procedure. There is a perceived

251
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:18.570
Magan: I think there was a form of fear there a form of fear isn't I'm not ready to taper. I'm not high

252
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold on. Don't go anywhere. Just hold on to it.

253
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, I am afraid, Dr. Gabrielle is asking me to taper and I'm not ready. What's the fear. I'm afraid of what

254
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.390
Magan: I'm afraid of pain afraid of pain.

255
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.180
Magan: The pain. Okay.

256
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how you went from which is a typical phenomenon for people

257
00:32:50.580 --> 00:33:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Being afraid is oftentimes intolerable. Right. And so you can find that energy can find that in the anger. So if instead. And actually, let's get to that piece in a second. I'd rather get to the to the I am first so you can see. She's attacking you register.

258
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably briefly some fear. I'm not ready. But that doesn't get said I'm not ready. That doesn't quite get said you went to arguing points.

259
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:20.850
Magan: About not

260
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Set up treatment. Right. You went to logic and trying to sort of make your point and be correct. And it's hard to sort of stay right in there and

261
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were afraid.

262
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.080
Magan: I think there was a full moon fair in there. Yeah, we did.

263
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It if I'm being attacked.

264
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm perceiving danger the emotion is fear. Right.

265
00:33:48.060 --> 00:34:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that. Now, this is the part that's hard to get to. So, picture it there's this there's this right perceived threat out here, someone's going to take my medicine away at a rate. I'm not ready to look at this this pain. I'm afraid of the pain.

266
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's happening this this storylines happening out here, you're feeling this fear and what does it say about your belief in yourself. So hold on Hold up and try and finish the sentence. I am so picture it in picture Megan. She's afraid.

267
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the pain someone's trying to take it away from her. And so, Take Away this, medicine, trying to take it away.

268
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief of value during this event.

269
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A belief about yourself and you'll know it through. I am. Take your time. It's a hard thing to get to

270
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not afraid to use very often is, uh,

271
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.610
Huh.

272
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like

273
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To be thinking about who you are. Instead of, I'm an addict.

274
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture the same

275
00:35:46.380 --> 00:36:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we want an AM I am something else, not what I'm not, I saw a picture it again. Just see see if there's any flexibility in that network. So here's this person. She's got her agenda, she may have her reasons they may, to some degree, remain unknown.

276
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to come off.

277
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The buprenorphine at the rate. That's right, that that piece. I don't want to. I'm afraid.

278
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying to yourself, I'm an addict, but in that moment.

279
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to believe about yourself.

280
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.960
Magan: I would like to believe that

281
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.450
Magan: I'm doing great. I've been

282
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.030
Magan: Dropped from 30 milligrams to four.

283
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.290
That's amazing.

284
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.400
Magan: I am

285
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.710
Magan: Anything from anybody else.

286
00:36:53.910 --> 00:37:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, in the absence of meeting. So notice, I'm going to really focus on language. It's really important that we say it enough or I'm not in need of anybody anything else. So, in the absence of meeting the I am what I am. What

287
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.210
Magan: Normal

288
00:37:43.710 --> 00:38:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come up with some words about that are normal. Let's see if we can get even tighter on that one normal. Give me some adjectives for normal what are normal people do when people are running a story and it's annoying and irritating and they're just being a hose.

289
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.880
Magan: I don't know.

290
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we're working so hard at this

291
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.090
Magan: I am

292
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.470
Magan: calm, collected

293
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

294
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it again.

295
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy. Okay, so hold on picture somebody who's calm, collected and happy and they run into someone whose power tripping and punishing them right there, they're leveraging their power over them.

296
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.380
Magan: Mm hmm.

297
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this normal calm, collected happy person. Think about themselves in that moment.

298
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.430
Magan: I'm good, I'm good.

299
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:07.590
Magan: I'm just gonna go ahead and walk away from this move on. I don't, I don't need anything from you.

300
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the one where relieved. Now you don't have the anger, but that's familiar for you. Remember you don't want to lose this resource. This

301
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.150
Magan: I'm going to one extreme, or the other.

302
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.290
Magan: Like I usually do.

303
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It like this. I'm good. But you that that's what you end up doing is you leave the resource. So in this scenario, the normal calm, collected

304
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Person that says, I'm good.

305
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm if I believe about myself. I'm good. And I can still hear someone in their story. They're just like, Well, I'm going to do this and

306
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to you're going to taper right and you're going to and you need to do this and they're they're leveraging their power. Right. And I can hear it. I know I'm good. I know I'm reasonable. I know I'm

307
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.000
Rational

308
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What else am I

309
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.230
Magan: Patient patient. Okay.

310
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If I have to stay and continue in this relationship with this resource be at work.

311
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.670
Magan: Or understanding. Understanding. Okay. Right.

312
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.260
Magan: I am

313
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.450
Magan: I have to stay

314
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to need in order to stay and not walk away in this metaphor. And it's actually kind of real right

315
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.770
Back.

316
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so if I am then see if you can finish it with I am

317
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.130
Magan: I am expected and respected. Okay.

318
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.700
Magan: I'm respect respected I'm heard. Okay.

319
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I am trying to corral you into in somewhere.

320
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, get it yourself. You know, it's nice

321
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So let's, let's see if we can go the opposite. So an addict needs.

322
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.380
Magan: reshare

323
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.130
Magan: Needs.

324
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Other it needs this other stuff. And what the opposite is I'm assuming it's normal. That's the word you kind of came up with. Right. And I call it the authentic self. You're not the attics, that's right, running, you know, most people it's a it's a lie or kind of

325
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a game in some way. It's not the real core truth. So if it's just you.

326
00:41:52.530 --> 00:42:00.150
Magan: Addict because the addict is it doesn't matter if it's an orphan. It doesn't matter if it's

327
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.500
Magan: If it's even the need to be heard.

328
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:21.360
Magan: Of an addictive personality. So I'm I even get addicted to either be passive and accepting less or I get addicted to anger and responding and anger.

329
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.290
Magan: Because it's all that I know.

330
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.250
Magan: And so the addict.

331
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.520
Magan: Man.

332
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.850
Is the addict.

333
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.730
Magan: To find

334
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.410
Magan: whatever it needs to survive. Okay. And if

335
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.720
Magan: It doesn't have to find

336
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.370
Else.

337
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're left with you the authentic self.

338
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you have

339
00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.230
Magan: What do you

340
00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you left with

341
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In the face of the world going on about

342
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Its itself. Sometimes it's a

343
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Good thing to be around. Sometimes, the world is unpleasant.

344
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.350
Magan: I'm vulnerable.

345
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: As an

346
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.110
Magan: Even as the normal

347
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

348
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

349
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.290
Magan: Want them. How can I be vulnerable. If I'm wrong, I get what you mean.

350
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we are right, we are but it's

351
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead, it's

352
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can pay attention to what I want in this moment.

353
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.440
Magan: And the word I'm trying to be there for myself.

354
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's getting somewhere. There's a particular word I keep trying to coax you and trying to get you to, but you're not getting there, and I

355
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine this green line all the way back.

356
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine, and we'll play it out over here is I'm you.

357
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.600
Magan: And my

358
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.770
Magan: My new book.

359
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Myself in this text.

360
00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I am here for myself.

361
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am capable

362
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I am here and capable of handling whatever happens, I can handle this, the addict doesn't believe

363
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It can, it has to have this medicine. And so there's, there is a perceived threat. You're going to take this away, but the authentic self knows at its core.

364
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, at your core and we couldn't quite get there today there's features, right, if I'm capable, guess how I'm feeling patient

365
00:44:53.310 --> 00:45:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess how I look calm, guess how I text chill. I'm assertive, because guess what my operating belief about myself as I'm able bodied, I can handle whatever I hear it is am

366
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.630
Magan: not feasible. Oh.

367
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:16.080
Magan: I didn't get there.

368
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's okay we got pretty far you can see features of it you know person. There's some vague understanding a normal person might be calm, they might have been patient, they might have stayed happy, right.

369
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But what registered for you. Was that threat that drug might get taken away and right and so then there's all this anger. Don't right and we weren't even we didn't even get to say like in this text, it wasn't I I'm afraid I'm not ready taper.

370
00:45:52.080 --> 00:46:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There was, you know, you guys said rap and you didn't keep, you know, we're, we didn't keep our commitment. I'm just

371
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: embodying me because I'm here, I'm representing right heart health. I don't have much choice on that. So we didn't keep our part of the bargain which completely obfuscates the ability to even be talking about your fear that it's scary for you and

372
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not suggesting a new way of having communicated with Dr. Real. I'm not trying to say that

373
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: As we are at the top of the hour. I'm going to say that this stuff that you were doing right on this text.

374
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

375
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Safer in zoom. It's safer. It's respectful to you to respect the fact that this fear, it's it's it's every day for me, it's like, that's what I was going on for everybody. Everybody's afraid.

376
00:46:48.900 --> 00:47:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is not like some big like of course. Yes. And we want to talk about it and be gentle and really make sure we've got what preparation, we get behind reinforcement of progress that you made.

377
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we can get behind resources, but it is deserving of more time and attention then then what a text can do

378
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So coming all

379
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Three all the way back is if there is any kind of invitation for like a behavioral change, it would be if you want to, if you can catch it quick enough because it's hard to catch it. Because right anger will serve you and

380
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so if but if you can catch it. If you catch a long text. Let's say we're trying to justify something you may say,

381
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't get it done in a text might say, I'd like to schedule a time to talk with you know you, Dr. A real are you and and whenever you're when would be a good time to talk about this misunderstanding right now.

382
00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to get, you're not going to get the same response.

383
00:47:55.230 --> 00:48:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're going to get from me, you're, you know, you're going to get story, you're going to get defensiveness, you're going to get stuff from this person, but this is kind of convenient in a way because

384
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the way work is to. That's the way a husband can be. That's the way like a family member, one that doesn't

385
00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

386
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, making it about you that right that's what a therapist is supposed to be focused on you right not making it about about our stuff so

387
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That part could feel a little if if you can catch it soon enough. Hey, I'm really inclined to really explain what happened, but I'd like to meet in person to do it. I'd rather do it you know in in tele health on on conference.

388
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.720
Magan: You can read tone.

389
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.980
Magan: And facial expression and

390
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

391
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.010
Magan: or is that wrong.

392
00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: No, um, my, my, my wanting to protect you, is coming out right now so I'm what

393
00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm noticing.

394
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I have, I have a lot of insight.

395
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.400
Magan: No, it's okay, I understand. I really do.

396
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you, right, I can see that happening out here unfortunately or fortunately, so part of me wants to protect you and make sure that you as much as you can just invite me to be there.

397
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:48.570
Magan: If you can't quit. No, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. Because it's never really worked out petroleum Dr. Aubrey also perhaps it would be best to have a third person there to help mitigate feelings, emotions, respect all of it, everything

398
00:49:48.990 --> 00:50:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I see myself as wanting to be there to remind you, you're enough right to get you there so that you can have access to the things you were able to talk about, well, this, this is

399
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking. Yeah, this is really what's going on. For me, I want

400
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid I'm afraid of tapering right now. Can we talk about how to do this a little slower kind of work with whenever you're around this or

401
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, let's just review again let's review again because it looks like we have a disconnect around appointments. Let's review them again. But Megan, you

402
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to do that. If you believe you're enough. You're not going to question your own memory. You did look memories not perfect, we're all kind of, it's just not it but

403
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We can all say, Okay, let's just, this one's let's just write it down. It's going to sit here in this treatment plan section. This is the frequency. This is how often hey is it in. We have this

404
00:50:49.590 --> 00:51:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Program called pulse is it in there where it's only once a month, like let's make sure that there's actually you know the the records reflects this agreement, but if you if you stay in yourself and not leave you and not make it about

405
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Her hurting you. Her disrespecting if you stop that part. And you say,

406
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I choose not to interpret that I just did. That's her

407
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about what you want. You want predictability you want. Here's the agreement, this is what I want. And yes, I'm am scared those events happening to and and maybe on the register on the radar is, you know, let's talk a little bit about what

408
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tapering over the next six months or a year would look like. Even if it means it changes, but let's at least start to talk about it. That could be on the radar.

409
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference, you're going to be able to do those things.

410
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're not in perceived threat. I did end up going there tonight.

411
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.320
Magan: It's okay.

412
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.600
Magan: You're right, though, you're right.

413
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm enough

414
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.480
Magan: Enough. I am enough

415
00:51:54.510 --> 00:52:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I can speak my truth. I can do it without having to Puff it up to this big super right this anger rage level.

416
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want is reasonable. This is reasonable.

417
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.540
Magan: And there's

418
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of practice because you right you've had these you're either doormat, or you're, you're, you're right. Throwing blows like it's these real large

419
00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.260
Magan: Extreme honor the other. Yeah.

420
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.290
Magan: That's not healthy.

421
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And there isn't.

422
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There is this other way to be

423
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.280
Magan: And I want to be there. So, and

424
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.320
Magan: Next,

425
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:44.100
Magan: I get paid on the seven. Okay. Um, I don't know. I get off at seven and I'm hoping that I can meet you Friday morning because I get paid.

426
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'll do is I have already got it written down in here.

427
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.120
Magan: Okay. Any right

428
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:55.200
Yeah.

429
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, gotcha down today.

430
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I may just put somebody there as a as an on call. Just in case you can't make it.

431
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.850
Magan: Okay. Okay, that's fair.

432
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:14.130
Magan: But I get paid that day so I really would like to end.

433
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe right let this stuff get in there and and marinate and see what what you come up with

434
00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're not due until 24th for group. Now, do you have enough data to the 24th.

435
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:40.530
Magan: I don't know, I haven't gotten picked it up yet because it at the pharmacy was closed when everything was done. So I haven't. I don't know exactly what I got or

436
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.690
Magan: What it was, if it was changed or what, but I'll pick it up at 11

437
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just touch base with me really calculate how many, how many days you have enough through and then

438
00:53:54.090 --> 00:54:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just messaged the doc and I'll say this is this is the agreement it. Are you okay with it. You know, I could have her here, but I think she's probably sleeping. So, you know, are you okay with this. Can this be something we can all move forward on and we'll just take it from there.

439
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:16.080
Magan: Okay. If not, I can try to talk to right heart and see if I can come to

440
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.170
Magan: Wait, we have the 24th. Okay.

Magan: I am enough

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.790
Magan: I am enough today.

445
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:30.930
My

446
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend Rhonda Rhonda, I see you. Do you see me.

447
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:42.960
Rhonda Towne: Morning.

448
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you at your house you

449
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.830
Rhonda Towne: At your house I yeah I'm at home. Hold on. Hey,

450
00:54:53.700 --> 00:55:01.140
Rhonda Towne: Well, you can use my tablet. I'm using my tablets. I don't know why. Oh, video. There it is. There it is. Okay, they're

451
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. Alright, cool. So let me open up a note here a little late started I had someone I saw earlier, and the whole just the day got got ahead of me and I'm so sorry I was late.

452
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:19.080
Rhonda Towne: So I kind of figured that and I thought I'd just let you I text you and let you know it was very helpful. So I knew you were there.

453
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I saw you trying to log in. I just needed to take some time to close it up. All right.

454
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:26.970
Let's see.

455
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I know you were going to go see gynecologist tell me what the status is there.

456
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:59.430
Rhonda Towne: And it's basically a whole repeat what I had to do in Tempe ultrasound biopsy or to go inside and take like a chunk of a piece of your uterus to make sure you're not cancerous or anything like that. That's the part I'm dreading it hurts. But yeah.

457
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:20.850
Rhonda Towne: You guys yeah you bleed afterwards because they go in there and they take some of your, your, some parts of you inside like they yank it out. Yes. Yeah. So I'm like, Okay. But yeah, they're not. Um, yeah, I gotta do the ultrasound and then

458
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:27.690
Rhonda Towne: I guess go from there. I was just giving them my rundown. I gave them my doctor's records from Tempe, so

459
00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:33.960
Rhonda Towne: Nice. Yeah, I was like I already went through all this. But I guess, I guess.

460
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have liked him to have been able to use this other records. Maybe there's a time limit on how long they can reference a biopsy tissue or something, you know, I mean, like, maybe they

461
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.820
Rhonda Towne: Have things changed.

462
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.240
Rhonda Towne: I think

463
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.200
Rhonda Towne: Like five years ago or so, my back. Yeah.

464
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you could imagine that new tissue growth could happen and then there'd be a lot of change in five years, I would think.

465
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:05.850
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, because the last time I cycled oh my god it was, it was pretty bad. It was really

466
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:13.560
Rhonda Towne: It was I hadn't cycle like that in a long time. It was like bloody bloody. It was just bad.

467
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.330
Rhonda Towne: So yeah, that's what kind of freaked me out a little

468
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you tell the providers. Hey, listen, I, I, I just tend to bleed a lot when these interventions happen and are they listening to you when you tell people, these

469
00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:35.400
Rhonda Towne: Yeah why. Yeah. That's why I asked them to make the appointment. Can you put me in like cancel somebody cancels, could you just put me in

470
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.430
Rhonda Towne: So yeah, um,

471
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:47.670
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, that that's what happened that day. And so I have to my ultrasound is coming up two Saturdays from now.

472
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.310
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

473
00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:55.080
Rhonda Towne: Because those are usually my days off. So, yeah.

474
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.710
Rhonda Towne: I'm surprised they did on a Saturday. I was like, whoa.

475
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So two Saturdays from now. Let me just see something if today is the first, it would be the 15th like not next not next one, but the following would be

476
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.930
15th.

477
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:19.080
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, it's the week after. Not this week is the 15th. Yeah. Okay so 215 ultrasound.

478
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:27.210
Rhonda Towne: Of course, they always do the ultrasound. They never tell you what they find but yeah

479
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.850
Rhonda Towne: At the wait for the doctor on that one.

480
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:39.150
Rhonda Towne: And then I had to do blood work just to make sure that I wasn't anemic, and all that but i i know i'm anemic. I mean,

481
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.750
Rhonda Towne: That's probably why my head's always hurting

482
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just see what we got here we've got

483
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When you

484
00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are interacting with Randy when you're interacting with people at work. Are you noticing any increase in

485
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: assertive communication needs, wants, preferences.

486
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:14.820
Rhonda Towne: Um, I had a few times, put my foot down, like when somebody asked me to do something.

487
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: At work, or with Randy.

488
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.780
Rhonda Towne: Work our

489
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:31.590
Rhonda Towne: Um, there's this girl there i don't know i. Her name is Bella, nobody really likes her, but just because she's real bossy, and I did not realize

490
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.790
Rhonda Towne: How bosses. She was that day until I worked with her and she would

491
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:50.040
Rhonda Towne: She wouldn't even ask. You know what I mean, like, can you do this or do this. She just she's just like go you can when you're down, go over there and make bags and I'm like, no, if you want us to get along. You're gonna that's what the you're gonna have to not tell me what to do.

492
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.410
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, not telling me what little girl.

493
00:59:54.360 --> 01:00:02.820
Rhonda Towne: And that's what she stopped. She stopped from then on, I think a lot of people know that about me as when once I put my foot down, they don't

494
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:13.890
Rhonda Towne: They stop because I'm not really. I mean, usually I'm pretty I do what I'm told. But other. Now, if somebody tells me, especially somebody young like that.

495
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:15.660
Rhonda Towne: Just like no

496
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: She thing.

497
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:32.010
Rhonda Towne: I would say she's like 28 or something. I mean, yeah, we, we talked a few ties. But I mean, that doesn't give her the right to tell me what to do without, you know, asking, Is your

498
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Style. Can I hear how you said it one more time.

499
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:43.020
Rhonda Towne: I said if you want us. I was like, no, no. I said, No, no, no. If you want us to get along. Do not tell me what to do.

500
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you add a little girl part

501
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.990
Rhonda Towne: I think, I think I did. If I remember correctly, and from then on, she just

502
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:58.650
Rhonda Towne: She just stopped, she just didn't nothing. I didn't. I never heard anything from her good

503
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What about with Randy.

504
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: About it home person you care about it can really change.

505
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.970
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I don't really

506
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the dog walking and things like that you were surprised to find out that you know he was doing it when you when you spoke with

507
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Him. He has not been coming up anymore.

508
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:33.060
Rhonda Towne: I didn't know lately. I mean, I talked to him, but I don't really ask him to do anything because he's always coming home late after me, or any leaves before me. So I don't really ask him for much the only thing that

509
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:42.720
Rhonda Towne: I asked him not to do was he likes those, those can chickens those, like, you know, like tuna to see, but their

510
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:52.830
Rhonda Towne: Chicken. I hate that. Now it's just stinks. Okay. And I told him one day, I was like, they could you not pour that down the sink the juice.

511
01:01:53.880 --> 01:02:05.220
Rhonda Towne: And I think it makes it smell or something. I said afterwards. I usually have to put in lemon juice or something. But I'm always, I have to clean up after you and I really don't want to do that every day.

512
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:06.480
What did he say

513
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:14.130
Rhonda Towne: He's okay. I guess I'll just dump in the trash. And I'm like, well, if it leaks in the trash. Then you're cleaning the trash can.

514
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:15.690
Rhonda Towne: Okay.

515
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So what else then we came after that.

516
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:27.720
Rhonda Towne: I think he dumps it in a sandwich bag and make sure it's not. There's no holes in there or something, I don't know what he does, but I haven't seen it in the sink.

517
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:38.910
Rhonda Towne: Or I have it smelt in the trash can, I think, because he knows my nose is really sensitive. I can smell everything. And I'm like, it's not clean it freaks me out.

518
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.590
Rhonda Towne: Okay, okay.

519
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How unique that request for something that it's not hurting you. It's just a preference, isn't it.

520
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, only unique is that of you to be able to ask him to do something that you basically would prefer how unique is this

521
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.260
Rhonda Towne: I mean, it's a it's nice, in a way, I mean, I appreciate that.

522
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:11.430
Rhonda Towne: As if he asked me have anything. I usually do it you know little things like Babe, when he texted me. He'll be like, babe, can you call me and I'm like,

523
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:19.710
Rhonda Towne: Why can't you just call me instead of text me. I'm the one who has to call him, but I just like, Okay, fine, whatever maybe things I'm busy or whatever.

524
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you flipped it right you see him being able to ask you to do things. You can see it this way.

525
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:28.950
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

526
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like that about yourself that you're able to

527
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask for what you want. Do you like that at all. You

528
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:47.100
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I feel more grown up this time in this relationship than I did in my marriage with the kids dead.

529
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:58.350
Rhonda Towne: Because it was it was a lot different with though, and I, I didn't really ask for anything. And it was always his way. It was always what he wanted.

530
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can can kind of see why I emphasize this in your

531
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:05.730
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

532
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, because over years and years of not feeling like one has a right to to get their needs, wants, and preferences, it can build up over years.

533
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah.

534
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then here comes this escape idea now escape seems that much more appealing.

535
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where hills can seem appealing. So the more you're in your life and you can see, day after day, I have a right to kind of just like everybody else does.

536
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To ask sometimes, the answer's no, that's true, but

537
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.570
Rhonda Towne: At least you

538
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing that you have the ability to speak your mind can really help in this long term recovery process.

539
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:55.500
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, like I said a few times I've been surprised. I was like, and I didn't know who was asked. Nice. Yeah.

540
01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:05.280
Rhonda Towne: And but yeah like at work that it has helped me so I was, I was really surprised that day when when she said that

541
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about this one I want more insight into tapering and the emotional part, tell me how you're putting the connection where you may have insight into

542
01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Tapering my impact me emotionally here or sort of that that insight. Do you have any new insight into that.

543
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:35.880
Rhonda Towne: I don't know when when I was before I when I years ago when I did try to get off the meds.

544
01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:49.860
Rhonda Towne: When I would try to taper or try to come off the meds. I know I would kind of just go in and depression phase, like I would just kind of feel down, like it was weird.

545
01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.580
Rhonda Towne: I didn't know what time

546
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.760
Rhonda Towne: You know what I mean, that went hand in hand.

547
01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you also see that you did it abruptly right

548
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:02.790
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

549
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing that. Look how long this is taking now you've had a lot of medical condition come up so that Dr Arielle you can hear right you can you compare your tapering progress to other people in group. Do you see the PDF down and you maybe had long periods of time where it stopped.

550
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a pause so

551
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see that the treatment protocol is very individualized. And I think I heard you in group recently say you were interested in tapering

552
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about your, your belief about whether you think you could do this a little differently this time, or maybe something about some confidence or tell me about your willingness to taper right now.

553
01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:59.940
Rhonda Towne: I think just number one is just not always having to remember my meds.

554
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so are you saying my motivation is I don't want to have to remember my minutes

555
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:21.810
Rhonda Towne: I mean just that's the main one always having to worry about running out or something like always having to worry about Tuesday mornings and group or just yeah it's just always something. I mean, it's just, okay,

556
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting annoying.

557
01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:25.320
Rhonda Towne: Yes, yes.

558
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. And in a way that's kind of good.

559
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right. This isn't intended to be a forever thing. This is supposed to be right to mitigate withdrawal while you're slowly tapering down so that you can have your life.

560
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your meeting it with regular

561
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's you're getting the right health care, you're exercising eating right, your relationships are improving. You have improved coping skills you're going out into the world and maybe you need ibuprofen.

562
01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you need Tylenol. God forbid something happened. You have to go to an emergency room, you're going to have access to being able to use pain medicine, just like everybody else's

563
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A little different because now you need to be mindful and communicate with a doctor, I do have this history of chemical dependence. I need as little of this pain medicine prescribed to me as possible.

564
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right, is difference that's probably going to be with you right forever. Like, that's part of your history.

565
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:41.820
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I know. That's, yeah. Yeah, I know when I talked to some friends of mine that are on the Suboxone program, they do. There's here in town. And I asked them if they do therapy or anything like that. And they always say no.

566
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:56.190
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, and there are the same dose that for years, three a day. And I'm like, Are you ever going to go down. Are you ever gonna stop.

567
01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a unique program Rhonda.

568
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The philosophy around medicated assisted therapy.

569
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes from a methadone model, which was kind of forever, right, they, what they did is they took the buprenorphine and they kind of paralleled it to to methadone and that's originally I think how programs were approaching it.

570
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know to what degree my influence has had on on how things are done here, but

571
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be a drug dealer.

572
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.410
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

573
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I right i mean

574
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want to do is help people add self confidence. I want people to add

575
01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication skills. I want them to reconnect with their passion. I want people to

576
01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To discover that they can emotionally self regulate with right the the breathing with mindfulness practices. Maybe people get re engaged to to their spiritual beliefs, whatever it is.

577
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I want people to have things added to their life as they start to taper down. They're increasing their self confidence that they can do their life without a mood altering substance.

578
01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That they yeah they you can meet your pain.

579
01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.140
Rhonda Towne: Without

580
01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This catastrophic terrifying thing. I won't be able to handle my pain or, you know, I won't be able to you or this this belief that it'll be this horrible withdrawal experience. It's not. It's going to be incremental. So you're right. This is a unique program. It's true.

581
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, most people I would say that I'm treating I may have one person.

582
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We're tapering just may not be a possibility, even though this person keeps trying to do it.

583
01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, like we're pushing back to stay on it, versus the other way around.

584
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty wire rare client, but I hear you. So you're irritated with the inconvenience and that seems to be motivating you I want to taper.

585
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.900
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

586
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's great. I think it's great. So in a way, the 7am the inconvenience of this stupid group right dog on it.

587
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is motivating.

588
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:27.000
Rhonda Towne: That, I think, yeah.

589
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's just fine.

590
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're going to get to see you can do it. So, so far, tell me about the last straw. What, how are you feeling you went down. Was it a whole milligram

591
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:45.120
Rhonda Towne: Yeah. Well, I didn't have my meds from Monday night to Thursday. Remember

592
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:59.610
Rhonda Towne: Me and I was feeling really oh my god I'm starting to feel crappy like the yawning eyes are watery a hadn't gotten the jitters yet. Thank God. But I was just starting to get the little things.

593
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I don't understand. You know, you missed i think i think you missed a group. But why, why not go into virtual clinic or get on the phone with the 800 number and and say um can I be bridge to another appointment so that you would have medicine between or did you do that.

594
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:26.850
Rhonda Towne: Thank you that I talked to Paul or somebody and they said they call

595
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.650
Rhonda Towne: Doc, Dr. Don and I never I kept checking Walgreens, and nothing

596
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.230
Rhonda Towne: Okay, I didn't know

597
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You call once

598
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:56.460
Rhonda Towne: And that was because of my stinking you a I've been waiting for my you a cup. Nothing came here and then the girl that we checked in at virtual clinic was always threatening me every time that if I hadn't done my UAE she wouldn't let me in. So

599
01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. They sound a little bit like separate issues just this one though maybe what was needed. So you didn't have monday through thursday was another call like. In other words, this is without assertive part might have been necessary well

600
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:14.430
Rhonda Towne: He said he'd call me back.

601
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I was waiting on that. But he didn't.

602
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Get

603
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:18.930
Rhonda Towne: That one.

604
01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well then right then you decided I got to deal with the misery for a few days. But you did have a choice. You could have, like, hey, hey, hey. No, this is no joke. My doctor doesn't want me without medication.

605
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand. I may need to be bridged because I missed Tuesday, but please. I need, I need something to get me through to my next appointment.

606
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What can we do here and then proactive. You have a right to do that, it fell through.

607
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Your case fell through the cracks. It landed here, it doesn't. I don't know, because I can't see. I don't know that it made it all the way to dr up real because I would think she would have written something for you.

608
01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.960
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just didn't want to bother her. I figured a letter.

609
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that

610
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That, that means that you've now had a negative experience withdrawal and you may have in your head. It's going to be like that.

611
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not. I don't want you to be without medicine. I mean, it would be convenient for you, if you, you know, go to the schedule appointment, but you still have a right to push

612
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to worry about her being upset irritated annoying. That's her problem, yours is to make sure that you get bridge to the next appointment. You could write say hey you know I'm going to try to schedule something with when or hey, when's the next group they do offer

613
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: There are other evening groups in sort of a pinch. Okay. You could do that so

614
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.620
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I asked him if there are other groups that Tuesday or something that Tuesday. And he said, No, I don't think there is. And I said, Okay, well,

615
01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday. There's, I don't have any but other people do.

616
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but notice how your reasoning was I didn't want to irritate I didn't want to inconvenience Dr out real. That sounds like it's not the core of it. She's, she's an adult, she can take care of herself, you need to

617
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: He calling keep making clear hey I need medication to get me to my next service and when can I that next service be don't put yourself through that again.

618
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:35.670
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just, I was just like, knowledge, so I guess I'll wait till Thursday. So I just left alone.

619
01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a really long time.

620
01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:38.880
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

621
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.520
Rhonda Towne: I just kept myself busy with work.

622
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So the reality is, what, how many milligrams, are you taking a day.

623
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.760
Rhonda Towne: And I'm doing to 13 now.

624
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that for two days. Friday and

625
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:55.830
And today. Yeah.

626
01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

627
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.810
Rhonda Towne: I had

628
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.800
Rhonda Towne: A whole milligram from the Tuesday, the ones I didn't get so yeah

629
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:10.560
Friday and today. Sorry. OK.

630
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so I'm sure that feel a lot better because you're gone days without it.

631
01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And so 13. See if you can hang on to that dose so that you can sort of have that and be your new normal than pick up maybe a taper in a week or two, if you're ready.

632
01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:32.700
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, okay.

633
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:41.760
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just, I was just waiting. I was like, Okay, I'll just wait but

634
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see, that's, that's what we were talking about earlier. That's about asserting your needs and your want

635
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:54.780
Rhonda Towne: I wasn't even thinking I was just like, maybe I'll just, I'll just wait. I was more curious.

636
01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:09.360
Rhonda Towne: Because I have. I haven't taper. I haven't been I haven't withdrawn pumps a box and yeah and I was more curious like what am I going to start feeling and the part that scared me again. The most was the jittery part I think that does that for a lot of people

637
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.040
Rhonda Towne: Is it

638
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: One day you stop taking it, you realize how kind of irrational. That is no one says stop taking it for days. Nobody goes 13 milligrams and cold turkey is it that's a painful thing to do.

639
01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:26.100
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

640
01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We were curious about that that self sabotage. What I would add one milligram at a time, please. Yes, people in here, Miss groups sleep in don't want to go.

641
01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they get called into work or a kid gets hurt and they have to go to urgent care or you get sick and you have to life happens. I get that. But stay

642
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In it for yourself, reach out and say, this happened.

643
01:17:52.350 --> 01:18:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: My bad. What's Next please. Bridge me from here to here, I will call back two or three more times until my pharmacy has it plenty of people are doing that rotted so I'm really sort of getting very animated right now to let you know.

644
01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people are doing this. You have a right to do the same thing.

645
01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't put yourself in those days and cold turkey doing it.

646
01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.490
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I would just

647
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for that Ron if you wanted to cold turkey. You don't need you don't need us for that.

648
01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.170
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I don't know. I'm so miserable. Oh my god. Okay.

649
01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Then don't put yourself through that again.

650
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.070
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, okay.

651
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any way that you can just throwing it out there. Tell your job, I need this other schedule and then attend a 9am Monday or a 1pm Monday or Thursday 11am or Friday 12pm can you push the schedule issue so that it meets your needs a little bit differently.

652
01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:56.550
Rhonda Towne: Right at 12pm

653
01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:57.570
Yes.

654
01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:09.030
Rhonda Towne: Um, I was. It was so weird. I was getting three days off per week, which was fine with me. And now I got my schedule and

655
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:18.420
Rhonda Towne: I only have two days off, but those days I'm working. Oh my god, it's just it's horrible. It's one mile

656
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Run it. This money is not to keep a roof over your head. So what I don't understand is

657
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a job that was thrown in your lap it made sense for you to pay down these medical bills which a big part of them, they're not they're not your medical bills but you're going to put yourself through this torture for what

658
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:46.020
Rhonda Towne: I that's the one thing I don't understand. Um,

659
01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:53.190
Rhonda Towne: I told my boss. Brandi that I wanted a part time schedule.

660
01:19:53.940 --> 01:20:05.880
Rhonda Towne: Oh, great. She does it for a week or two and then she forgets. And then she puts it back on full schedule. And then I have to tell her. Again, I'm supposed to be on a part time schedule.

661
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.470
Rhonda Towne: And again,

662
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what Rhonda. She's not someone who is going to respect that. What if it means

663
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you're worth it. What if it turns out your time is so important that your recovery is so important to getting this done, getting done with this poll treatment thing right is so important.

664
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That you keep going to her and you go to her each week, even though the schedule hasn't come out. Hey, Sarah. Just a little reminder on keep me on a part time schedule. Nothing's changed there. Okay. Have a good weekend.

665
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, just a reminder, Santa. You see, it's not mean I'm doing it proactively I'm saying, hey, just keep me there.

666
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:49.620
Rhonda Towne: Are times. Yeah.

667
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it but you put yourself at the bottom.

668
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:56.010
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just

669
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.980
Rhonda Towne: I didn't know I was

670
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:03.600
Rhonda Towne: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO MY NEXT kettle just so depressing.

671
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.900
Rhonda Towne: So I guess I I'm I know I'm gonna have to go back and tell her again.

672
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:15.060
Rhonda Towne: I don't know how many times. I'm going to tell her she sees me almost every day.

673
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.320
Rhonda Towne: I be

674
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't seem to either she can't or she won't. So you say you're the invitation here is this job is either worth it. It's helping them I've paid down these huge bills are coming down. They have been

675
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the cost right is lower than the benefit, but the cost is you're going to have to keep reminding this little lady every week. So what it's inconvenient, but it might mean that you have time for yourself.

676
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're important, your time is important.

677
01:21:51.750 --> 01:22:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Confrontation for most people is so uncomfortable that they put themselves. They'll but you might be doing it now sacrificing yourself because confrontation is so unpleasant. Is that what's happening.

678
01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:11.790
Rhonda Towne: I think again in the back of my mind, that's what I'm going through. I mean, I don't want to deal with it. Just because I don't

679
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:24.750
Rhonda Towne: Mature majority time. I don't want to hear it, like, she'll come up with some excuse, like, oh, what's your name left or this person's calling in, or like even this past the last week.

680
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:36.150
Rhonda Towne: My days off this yesterday. Yeah, yesterday she kept see me to come in and I'm like, No, my kids have dental appointment I that's why I put it on the schedule that I was off.

681
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So Rhonda. Notice that you'll do it for your children that's not that's not uncommon.

682
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice you can set that boundary for your children, but you won't do it. Watch. There's no difference. Let's say you decide Friday. Friday. No, that's my time. Watch. If that was your kids medical appointment, you wouldn't have budget.

683
01:22:58.530 --> 01:22:59.040
Rhonda Towne: So, yeah.

684
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Put yourself as an equal at least okay your appointments or chest is important.

685
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I have an appointment I SO IT'S SARAH. It's I've already set my week up this way, Sarah. It sounds like you'll have to reach out to other people to solve this scheduling issue. I'm going to stick with our agreement. This one, this is working for me. You see that

686
01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's her. She's The Boss. That's for her to work it out. She, she she doesn't understand

687
01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And honestly, Rhonda. What's the worst thing that can happen if you end up losing this job because you can't take it anymore. Or she says, Well, fine. If you can't work full time, then you need to go really you don't think you could get this one landed in your lap.

688
01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:47.640
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

689
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you know you could go get another another J. O. B. Of course you can.

690
01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.310
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

691
01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that, though, or is that just me.

692
01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:58.620
Rhonda Towne: I just, um, I think.

693
01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:09.060
Rhonda Towne: I just went through the hassle of thinking, I don't want to look for another job and just that's just what's all going through my mind to that same time like

694
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's just talk about whether you even need it.

695
01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:19.410
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, but I if I stay home and do nothing. I mean it.

696
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But you wouldn't you be going to school, you'd be doing, you'd be going back to school.

697
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:36.480
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, and then I'd be like, I would just have a little more time on my hands and then you start to wonder, like, I don't know. I don't think that's good. That's why I tried to keep my keep myself busy all this time.

698
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Rhonda, you're missing out on some things. And that has to do with you learning. See how you're still sort of scared to be alone and bored.

699
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting

700
01:24:48.840 --> 01:25:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: These years of working together. I don't know that you have built that because, again, you've been on such high doses. We don't see each other regularly, you're missing out on learned opportunities that you can do your life you are enough

701
01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't know that she won't test it out.

702
01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And so guess what this life where you're left alone to your own devices continues to be a threat to you.

703
01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's scary. And now, guess what, now you're not going to assert yourself with your job. You're going to stay in a job where you're just like up and now watch what happened. So I'm not going to be assertive and now I have days I'm going without my Suboxone

704
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you, you might even eventually say bravehearts not working for me. I mean, it could get that bad. It's all connected.

705
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:45.930
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

706
01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you supposed to look at a life with with let's say if you decide down the line to be completely off of the buprenorphine. How can you look to the future and say to yourself, Well,

707
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I've been able to do it. I am down to three milligrams two milligrams one milligram. And you know what I've had five hours where I'm sitting here by myself and I didn't even think about pills. I was sewing.

708
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I got into this other hobby. I was registered for class I was doing some reading. I was enjoying my own company. I've worked through

709
01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Trauma I've worked through things but you and I have not done a lot of work that we could do.

710
01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: My fear is

711
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't make these changes. Now as you taper down. I think you might scare yourself.

712
01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.390
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I think that may happen.

713
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're already saying to me, I don't want to be left alone with myself, aren't you, isn't that what you're telling me.

714
01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:01.350
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I don't know what that much turns on.

715
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do it in smaller doses, you work right part time and we test it.

716
01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Will Rhonda sleep in, or will she get up and do some selling. Will she go to volunteer work will she registered for a class will she read books that prepare her for whatever well she take that time to follow up with medical appointments. What will she do

717
01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, she meet with me on a regular basis and start to do some work that may be underlying what's going on.

718
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are literally taking your best interest to do

719
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.770
Rhonda Towne: Because I know that

720
01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:51.300
Rhonda Towne: Well, my days off or mostly I only do is sleep mean my dogs because the other days is just work.

721
01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.300
Rhonda Towne: That's all I can do.

722
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't sound like a happy life is that happy.

723
01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:07.890
Rhonda Towne: No, I die, I mean I have to basically have to cut my sleeping time and have to go spend time with my kids. So, yeah.

724
01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You literally have a goal here it says live a full life are you taking strides to doing that.

725
01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:17.970
Rhonda Towne: No.

726
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we're right where we started. We gotta get into it. We got to make some substantial this this boss, you've got she doesn't love you. You don't love her.

727
01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: She's paying your bills, she's not the one that's going to be there through thick and thin your family is you are going to be there for you. That's where the investment needs to go right

728
01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:42.720
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

729
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.280
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I think I I'm gonna have to tell her that

730
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:59.520
Rhonda Towne: Either probably bad gotten a part time or I'm gone, I'm I can't look. Look what you said, look,

731
01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What you said on on January 10 we were talking about Randy.

732
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It was I, if I told him I want to go back to school, he will say, yeah, go back to school.

733
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I want the crap off of us want to go back to school and not worry about it. And I'm assuming that's medical debt.

734
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, how much do you have left.

735
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:33.510
Rhonda Towne: I haven't counted it up yet altogether. I just been paying what was on the fridge. I have to look at it, to get the exact number.

736
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like to actually look at it and and just kind of say, am I worth it is my recovery worth it is my being healthy and available for my kids. What about life satisfaction for you.

737
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have this you can be in school.

738
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're in a different kind of relationship where you're starting to assert yourself. You're still in this program.

739
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I can meet regularly. We could be kind of working even more on sort of resolving underlying sort of the impact of your trauma history going back to school. Why don't we find out if you can do it.

740
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:14.040
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

741
01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: They can, you're amazing at managing your time. You're really good at it.

742
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:25.740
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I'm gonna have to find out, financially, what is going to cause

743
01:30:26.670 --> 01:30:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And take in information Rhonda.

744
01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When Randy if Randy says to you, you don't need to be working, we're fine. Let it in. Do you see what I'm saying.

745
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let it in and I'm not, I have no idea. I'm not in your life. I it with the real. I have no idea what's what the facts are. Sometimes we do have kind of have to work.

746
01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you have to work full time do you have to sacrifice.

747
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:57.630
A life worth living.

748
01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:06.270
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I, I would have to think about that one.

749
01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And talk with him.

750
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.000
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I'm gonna have to do that.

751
01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:14.580
Rhonda Towne: I'm

752
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:22.530
Rhonda Towne: I don't know. I know he's going through some things with his dad his step mom too. So yeah, I've had to tell him.

753
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I be support. How can I help you through this journey.

754
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:36.450
Rhonda Towne: I think it's just a matter of him. I'm waiting for him to say something.

755
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:39.900
Rhonda Towne: He hasn't really

756
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:49.440
Rhonda Towne: Because the other day, I asked him, I was like, Well, I'm here. If you ever want to talk and he's just not ready right now. Okay.

757
01:31:49.650 --> 01:32:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You would like that to when you're ready to talk to you. You've got this nice pace, where you don't want to be pushed either. So you've been there and when he if he wants to talk, you can talk

758
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:07.950
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, so that's what I told him. And he said, Yeah, I'm just not ready right now just it's just

759
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:10.080
Rhonda Towne: Whatever, he's going through

760
01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.660
Rhonda Towne: He hasn't told me anything yet.

761
01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But what do you want to do about your group schedule. What do you want to do. What do you suggest

762
01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:23.640
Rhonda Towne: I think that's the only one that I know I can make as a

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.980
Rhonda Towne: 7am

764

Gwenevere Abriel: clue what you want.

777
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important you keep forgetting about that this life can't just be about waking up grinding it out and not having a fulfilled life.

778
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:46.440
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just

779
01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:51.450
Rhonda Towne: I didn't. It was fun. When I first started working there. Now it's just like

780
01:33:52.530 --> 01:33:55.320
Rhonda Towne: Constant. Constant going

781
01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be fun. Again, if it was part time

782
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:00.330
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, that's what I want. It was just

783
01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be no job, or maybe you're real clear with this woman right. Nice. You can say it in a nice polite way and it could be you continue to bring this debt down, you're going

784
01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: On a part time job, but it might mean that you have to remind her because she is who she is. It might be the Jeff to keep reminding her. But if you've already

785
01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Fact that you may end up losing this job, then there's no downside. If you've already faced it and said, bad be inconvenient, but I've got it do what I got to have some life.

786
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right work life balance.

787
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it, give it a consideration i mean it's it's a big decision, but

788
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You just start seeming like

789
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There's balance.

790
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:55.680
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I know. I don't balance it out. I just I just dread it sometimes

791
01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it possible that you might end up walking office job because it's so yucky.

792
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.080
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I thought about it a few times.

793
01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, so if you've already looked at that, then there's no downside. You might as well ask for part time because you've already faced the worst thing which is not having the job. So you might as well.

794
01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Say hey let's let's just ask for what you want. So what if you lose job you've already faced it in your mind.

795
01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:24.750
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

796
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She's, she's just look that's her problem to work out the fact that people quit. That's a bosses problem that's not your problem. You've already said this is what you're capable of doing.

797
01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your schedule already talked with her. I mean, she didn't say, okay, well then you can't work here. If you can't work full time. She didn't say that to you. Correct.

798
01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:44.970
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

799
01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there you go. That's it.

800
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:59.400
Rhonda Towne: I know I just I just always think, how many times I had to remind her that I'm part time I'm and I've been doing this.

801
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Assume every week and all this. You're putting yourself through service every week. Look at me. How many times do I have to review with people.

802
01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's your appointment or I do this and this. If I had in my mind I shouldn't have to do it. I would get myself for us. I've learned. This is just this is the reality of things.

803
01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, he her limitations don't notice right this is should be this way. Now, this woman. It's convenient for her that you'll just go ahead and you'll suck it up and you'll take these days it's convenient for her.

804
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about your life.

805
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.390
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just

806
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.380
Rhonda Towne: I know you don't like the confrontation. Believe me, I know.

807
01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a lot for you to even ask about the stinky chicken can

808
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.240
Yeah.

809
01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:51.210
Rhonda Towne: That's

810
01:36:53.160 --> 01:37:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: easier it'll get easier. This is a low low level threat. This is not someone you love.

811
01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a job you are a smart, capable woman, you could get a job somewhere else. Worst case.

812
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're recording

813
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your recovery in jeopardy. I don't want you missing. Missing you know groups and missing medication and
