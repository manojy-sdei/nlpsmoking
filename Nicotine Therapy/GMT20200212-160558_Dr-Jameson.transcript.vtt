00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.960
Dr Jameson: That looks better.

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.060
iPad: That much better.

23
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.810
iPad: So many so we didn't know what to send of all the stuff because there's like literally hundreds of tests that Stanford did while I was

24
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.320
Dr Jameson: There.

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah so sick. I was

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.500
iPad: Just

27
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.190
Dr Jameson: I saw

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.300
Dr Jameson: Looking through some of the labs that that there's a little bit of

29
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.010
iPad: Just your analysis.

30
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.940
iPad: Okay, which we just found out. Just now you needed. Okay.

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.140
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I don't think they scan.

32
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.820
Dr Jameson: That. And yet, but that's okay. Um, so yeah. Usually we do a set of labs that includes like hepatitis and screen.

33
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.170
iPad: Yeah.

34
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.980
Dr Jameson: So, so, um, they should

35
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.640
iPad: Be able to manage. Can I got the whole

36
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.910
iPad: Sudan injection, because I'm in school. Well, I just graduated my neck last degree in forensic psychology, but

37
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.660
That's all.

38
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

39
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.470
Dr Jameson: Without the hepatitis B. Yeah.

40
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.290
iPad: Okay home allow you in unless you have like the vaccine all these shows. Oh my gosh.

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.100
iPad: Yeah, people

42
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:50.580
Dr Jameson: So, um, well, let's start from the beginning and then what we can do is like there's a list of labs that we usually have so I see liver tests and I see a blood count already and you'll send that it's a user, we usually do a urine test and then a urine drug screen.

43
00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.210
Dr Jameson: And then there's hepatitis A, well, yeah. A, B, and C and then an HIV and civil assessed just screens. Basically, and

44
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.050
Dr Jameson: You know,

45
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.200
iPad: I thought that was rather than 16 here.

46
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.250
Dr Jameson: We are well and, you know, unfortunately, actually, there's been a huge comeback. It's, it's the right, the right, the rates have been rising

47
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.610
iPad: Lately, in the last few years, and children on

48
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.260
Dr Jameson: Well, I think it's, um, well we digress, there's, I think there's a few different factors to that one of what

49
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.800
iPad: Sorry.

50
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.460
Dr Jameson: This know there's they have you heard, I don't know if you've heard of. Sorry, let me just shut the door. My dogs are making a lot of noise. Sorry.

51
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.920
iPad: Dogs, we get along. No problem.

52
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.850
Dr Jameson: Okay.

53
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um, it obviously depends on what sort of

54
00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:03.060
Dr Jameson: Method. You people are administering themselves medic this these drugs. Right. So obviously there's potential risk for blood. Blood Borne things if people are sharing needles.

55
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.410
Dr Jameson: But anyway, we, we do a screen for just general

56
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:17.700
Dr Jameson: STDs. I don't know why we do the syphilis, to be honest. But there are raising raising rates. I've seen a few cases of it not here, but in practice in the last few years. It's kind of anyway.

57
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.810
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so let's let's get, um,

58
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.300
Dr Jameson: So you were in the hospital which and that's that's who referred you to us so well first of all, can you just confirm your name, date of birth,

59
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.830
iPad: Did you say something because it got really silent.

60
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.800
Dr Jameson: Oh, I said, can you confirm your name and birthday.

61
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.420
iPad: Oh, Tanya Morgan 831 62

62
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.670
Dr Jameson: And you're in California. Yeah.

63
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.090
iPad: Awesome. And I have a horse voice right now. So if it cracks out

64
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.990
Dr Jameson: You don't hear me all right.

65
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.560
iPad: Let me know.

66
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.350
Dr Jameson: I will. Okay, so, um,

67
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.580
Dr Jameson: So what brought you what got you into the hospital.

68
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.150
iPad: My husband found me unresponsive. It turned out I had acute liver failure.

69
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:20.970
iPad: And so the rest. Well, they didn't know it at the moment that they rushed me to Dominican they diagnosed me with that and then they rushed me over to Stanford. They thought I had Tylenol toxicity, but I'm allergic to Tylenol. So, um, what we thought we figured out was probably

70
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:33.720
iPad: Kind of a long history. I just had a radical hysterectomy for cancer, and they had me on a pump, you know, right out of recovery.

71
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:44.760
iPad: For dialogue which I had been on for chronic pain and I didn't, you know, I thought it was a lot along acting drug apparently it's a short acting drug

72
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:56.880
iPad: I should have done my research, but you know, you just don't think about you think the doctor knows what they're doing and they do I great doctors at my city of hope. But anyway, so

73
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:06.360
iPad: The pain dumped in me the whole thing and they had to resuscitate me

74
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.980
iPad: So there wasn't any for

75
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.960
iPad: Narcan right yeah

76
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.220
iPad: So it was an overdose. Yeah, so there was a big toxicity already

77
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:33.450
iPad: In my my body and I told them I don't ever want to be on dialogue it again. So I was switched to oxy. This is not, can I don't pronounce right oxy cotton go down, go down. Oh, don't either two different ones because I just didn't get into the opiates. I was like,

78
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.020
iPad: Well, I did pharmacology was for all the psychology drugs.

79
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think oxy content is like two words together like oxy code on continuous

80
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.250
iPad: So long ago thing that's special

81
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.270
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's

82
00:06:48.600 --> 00:07:00.990
Dr Jameson: oxy content is a long acting allegedly if it's taken away. It's designed to be taking it is a long acting version of oxycodone actually code on is the actual ingredients in

83
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.660
Percocet and

84
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:15.540
iPad: Yeah, I think there may be another thing. So yeah, they switched me to oxy codeine not con, but when we were talking at Stanford. I was we were all talking about like the different ones.

85
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:30.060
iPad: And also they heard the two words. And I was like, I forgot to ask, you know, because I do say um and so anyway they switched me am I looking at this correctly to you because I feel if I staring down at you but

86
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.900
Dr Jameson: That's okay, you

87
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:40.020
iPad: Don't. That's fine. That's fine. Let me see if I can make this bigger because making me crazy. Ah, much better. You can still see me correctly.

88
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.580
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I can say

89
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.170
iPad: Okay, I don't really use my iPad for this FaceTime is on my phone with my friends.

90
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.860
So,

91
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.130
iPad: Okay, so anyway, um,

92
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.550
iPad: They switched me to Oxycodone and 30 milligram and

93
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.940
iPad: That was back in May or June and um

94
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:15.750
iPad: There was no conversation about long acting short acting. I just assumed it was the same as allotted, you know,

95
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.350
iPad: Anyway, I was signed six pills a day. Sometimes they took it. Sometimes I didn't

96
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:35.670
iPad: Sometimes I may have taken eight pills instead of six. Sometimes they took none. You know, it just depend on like because I have two broken necks broken back

97
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.910
iPad: I've had for bilateral carpal tunnel. So I'm not trying to make you sympathetic. I'm just telling you what

98
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.460
Dr Jameson: Goes on the night I was gonna ask you anyway.

99
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.980
iPad: I'm TMJ badly.

100
00:08:48.450 --> 00:09:07.590
iPad: Three cancer survivor. I've been through 68 surgeries in the past 10 years and I have massive neuropathy through my body on top of me. Told you half of what I you know my breasts are gone, and it just goes on, you know, so the pain is tremendous. But I always tried to block it.

101
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:20.910
iPad: But there comes down when I can't. Anyway, so my body must have built up a toxicity. And so when I was taking in. They thought I had Tylenol toxicity, because where do you get like you liver failure.

102
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:34.470
iPad: And I'm allergic to time I can't take it. I told you that just a little while ago. So I'm we're when we all discussed it the pain doctor who referred me to you guys this pain psychiatrist.

103
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:51.900
iPad: And Dr. lady who was my main doctors Stanford and we figured out that it was a build up of all the medication Lyrica Cymbalta the oxy can't

104
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.550
iPad: Code own. Yep.

105
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:02.280
iPad: The diet allotted originally they had me on fentanyl which I talked about this off. And I said, No way. If this all for me.

106
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:15.510
iPad: I don't drink, smoke. I never drink, smoke hundreds. I don't do recreational anything I'm opposed to marijuana for me. I don't believe it's bad for cancer patients, but I just

107
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.760
iPad: Because some square nerd.

108
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:31.650
iPad: And so for me it was hard enough, like my mom had to talk me into taking medication for the pain. She said, You just take it when you need to take it. They're giving it to you. I go, but mom.

109
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:42.300
iPad: I can't like the first five days I function. Well, unlike fully energetic and then after that, all you want to do is lay in my bed.

110
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:56.040
iPad: You know, and I'm getting kind of the broad picture. So you can see where we came to at the meeting at Stanford. What we have many meetings three. Um, so I was like

111
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:06.510
iPad: This medication was like a death sentence to me in hope and I'm gonna cry about it because what they gave me at Stanford was big.

112
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:21.150
iPad: I not heard ever. Um, I don't know any doctor, I asked another doctor yesterday. Never heard of it before, like I didn't either.

113
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:31.920
iPad: You know, I had to take year pharmacology, not much, you know, amount of pharmacists whatever forensic psychologist, you know, I mean, I should know these things. Why don't I do this.

114
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.700
Dr Jameson: So what I

115
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.390

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:45.000
iPad: What did they give you a Stanford, they haven't given me anything yet, but they they were talking about. I can't even pronounce it. Bless your stuff.

121
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:13.560
iPad: I said I don't talk to anybody about it, but literally two classes and I literally just graduated, like, a week ago.

122
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:28.620
iPad: I was so excited. I was like, I can't believe I did it because two classes shy of that final degree. I was so tired and so sick from this medication that I was like, I don't care.

123
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:40.050
iPad: I mean, I used to do things of my friends all the time. I used to swim and run. And, you know, even with all my pain. You know, I still did all these things.

124
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:50.220
iPad: Well, I don't do that anymore. I mean, my haircut and here's past my hips always donate my hair locks of love. I'm going to do it somewhere else. But, um,

125
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:59.010
iPad: I don't have my hair cut in a year because takes energy and yes okay I've been through two major surgeries one dumped me.

126
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:07.740
iPad: But that's mommy excuse to not go get my haircut. You know what I mean, that's what this medication did to me and then I talked to him ready because

127
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:26.700
iPad: This was my final option right. I didn't know any other difference. And I was every, every month. I tried to get off my did but then the pain on a mountain so much pain that I just, I haven't slept in four days because I don't sleep. Anyway, I have a hard time but

128
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.220
iPad: The pain is just so tremendous. I can't write down. You know, it's like

129
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:46.590
iPad: You know, and so, um, you know, yesterday was at the hospital. My modus of operating is to walk around and cheer up other patients, you know, the nurses thought it was great.

130
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:55.470
iPad: I thought I was just spreading love to people that needed love you know that we're in so much pain so much worse off than me.

131
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:08.400
iPad: You know, and so I did. I walked around and Nancy and Susan Jeff and, you know, and I talked to them and I'm a Christian. So I didn't push my religion on them. I just said I would pray for them.

132
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:16.140
iPad: And that was how I got through my day, you know, and I would say, oh, like my fashion statement, you know, the hospital.

133
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:27.930
iPad: And they said, Mike accessory bowl and they make people laugh. That's what I do to make my heart feel. Yeah, yeah, to go and so

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:43.860
iPad: And so when the doctor came in, Dr. B came in and he explained the medicine and now it works versus opiates with the neurons and the opiate receptors and how the morphine, which similar to morphine and

135
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.620
iPad: Dialogue and

136
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:58.830
iPad: OxyContin and all the opiate drugs, how they put down this line of stuff and can build up your system and overdose you but this other stuff.

137
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:13.140
iPad: It doesn't make you want to just lay in bed all year long. You know, it doesn't make you want to just say, you know, this is all there is, what is there. There's nothing, there's nothing because I have a light. I mean,

138
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:24.120

iPad: That's not my profession. I mean, he goes, Yes, it is illegal. Well, that's not what I mean. I mean, that wasn't really a, I don't know how to explain it or it's it's not a gift. It's just something that

150
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:49.230
iPad: And my heart for hope. And I knew I had to write this for him and his family, whether or not the Grand Ole Opry wanted me to publish it and but whether or not

151
00:17:50.580 --> 00:18:00.480
iPad: I did anything. It was their book but when these medications took over 2014 I didn't do it. I couldn't do it. And I haven't done it.

152
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:19.200
iPad: Yet, yeah. When the doctor told me medication fact like my vote to actually not be a failure and the guilt would do what I promised, because I do what I promise it'll just say I'm gonna do something and take a cavalierly

153
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:28.290
iPad: Tell you, I'm crying right now, of course, we had a failure because they feel when he was alive.

154
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:38.670
iPad: And partially because I might be able to do this now and I might give it to his family. If there's hope.

155
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:49.140
iPad: They don't talk to anybody about it is it's too painful for me to say it. I feel somebody I love. So what

156
00:18:50.550 --> 00:19:14.850
iPad: That's a long time over the years is, you know, it's been 2014 six but it's been 11 years that more than 11 years. I started interviewing 2006 when he asked me was, we just got off tour from Belgium, Belgium and I was just, I mean the honor of that to replace their life in your hands.

157
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:28.980
iPad: But then take that honor and destroy it. And I just write it, because these destroy lives drugs destroyed lives and I knew that I grew up with that I grew up in a drug infested know

158
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:35.610
iPad: When I looked at them and I said, you guys are crazy. I will never be like you. And look, I am like

159
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:44.010
iPad: Well, not quite do what they did, but I felt somebody that was, I know you didn't have it. Nobody's

160
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.950
iPad: looking down at me and saying you didn't do what you promised well

161
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.020
Dr Jameson: Not. Yes. How about that.

162
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.020
Dr Jameson: Okay, let me back. But no, I think this is

163
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.980
Dr Jameson: It's all important and I hear a lot of pain and that we we do need to help you.

164
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:14.610
Dr Jameson: You know release some of that because carrying a lot of guilt and other negative emotions around doesn't generally

165
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:23.370
Dr Jameson: promote healing and grow others. So, but, so it's all very understandable and and and

166
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.590
Dr Jameson: Admirable, really, I think,

167
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.940
Dr Jameson: It sounds like you're on.

168
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.570
iPad: The summary people who have a way worse than me and my being.

169
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.710
iPad: And that's

170
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.350
Dr Jameson: Why, I mean, it's good to keep that kind of

171
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.430
Dr Jameson: Attitude because then

172
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:43.530
Dr Jameson: You, you have some gratitude for what you do have. And anyway, if you're always woe is me. Then you tend to be kind of stuck so

173
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.100
iPad: I think the model was me. Yeah. Nobody would

174
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.810

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.700
Dr Jameson: Sometimes you need a little meantime to right

177
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.350
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so let me. Sorry, I just let me back up.

178
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.860

iPad: I was a size two with 36 double J us. Wow. And I was born that way. It wasn't something I stuffed in whatever those things are called and they hadn't quite discovered that my neck was broken, but the pain was tremendous.

183
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.030
Dr Jameson: And how did that happen.

184
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:45.330
iPad: Because when I was hit by a woman that was under insured. She was 17 she was going 75 miles an hour, and she wasn't paying attention.

185
00:21:46.380 --> 00:22:00.960
iPad: And, um, I flew. I mean, it was bad, but there was so much drama everywhere else. But I guess they didn't pay attention. You know, I, my nose smashed into my face.

186
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.120
Dr Jameson: Or you are a pedestrian and you were hit

187
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.810
iPad: No, no.

188
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.210
iPad: No.

189
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.060
iPad: No, I was in my card debts.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.140

193
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:47.610
iPad: She shoved me into the car in front of me, and he got a broken, hand, shoulder wrist and leg and the person he got crushed into broke his collarbone his knee and fractured his, his Tibia. So that tells you the impact. Now, it was my bad. And that's when you go out and I had a brand new car.

194
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.380
Dr Jameson: So you drove several vertebrae in your neck and in your lower back and

195
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.710
iPad: I have a full battle back to one to see to

196
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.340
Wow.

197
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:05.730
iPad: And I have what's called a movable living disk. It's not literally living, they call it a movable will my doctor called Little

199
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.610

200
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.330
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we can

201
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.660
iPad: Get into it. Yeah, so that was

202
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:33.990
Dr Jameson: Saying that was, that was the start of when the pain issues because after this

203
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:43.620
iPad: No, I got neck issues have always been an issue when I have scoliosis, but I didn't find that out until I was an adult.

204
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:56.550
iPad: And I always wonder why my back hurts so much, but as a little girl, we were pretty massively well up pretty. We were very massively abuse and

205
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.140
iPad: One of my mom's boyfriends and the house.

206
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.000
iPad: What we. It's called a double check.

207
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:20.820
iPad: And what he did is he walked up behind me and I was eight years old and this guy is now serving double murder sentence. It says, what kind of guy is in Pelican Bay. These are the people I was very good and

208
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.700
iPad: His name is Tom steams

209
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:35.400
iPad: Anyway, he he picked me up and he threw me down on the cement and my neck pop and him and my brother wouldn't allow me to call my mom.

210
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:44.790
iPad: I would race one phone. This is back when the phones you pick up one phone can't use the other. Mm hmm. You know, both have to be down

211
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:53.460
iPad: So I would race to one because my neck was stuck sideways and I was in a lot of pain. So that was the beginning of neck problems.

212
00:24:54.030 --> 00:25:00.960
iPad: And then when I went to foster care. Um, I slept on a bed that was like this with three other people

213
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:09.810
iPad: So like we would sleep on the ledges and in the middle and try and switch around. So with the scoliosis, and the bad back and then

214
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:24.900
iPad: I had to support myself because I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to pay rent and I was 10 years old and I didn't know what I was going to do. You know, I had to pay $100 a month. Let's food and so

215
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.830
iPad: I I played any instrument that could be put in my hand. I just

216
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:41.400
iPad: Have that capability. I was blessed with it. So there was an old guitar in the house that I had three rusty strings.

217
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.700
iPad: And I figured out how to play some chords and I went to a neighbor. And I said, I need to do a gig, because I have to make sleep.

218
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:57.930
iPad: So I clean houses and I know babysat and I gig, but my hands because my family, all the females and my family have carpal tunnel.

219
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:07.890
iPad: And by 12 I was diagnosed with a lot of time on my word speak white races. So pain is always been part of my life, which is probably why I could block it so well.

220
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:23.640
iPad: But there comes a point where I can't. And that's when I break down and I usually hide, you know, unlike go away. Don't talk to me. I get really grumpy. You know, I go hide.

221
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:34.920
iPad: It when as a kid I go hide in the closet, usually because it was a safer place and everybody through their stuff in there and nobody knew so I couldn't get beat up or

222
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:52.560
iPad: A rate. I don't care what they say. Children are raped, they call adults being raped it called sovereign being less know it's the same thing. It's rate call what it is, so that the children get some credit, you know, so the pain I dealt with.

223
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.210
iPad: You know,

224
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:09.960
iPad: I can't say more than that, you know, I'm blessed. I'm alive, you know, and I came out. You wouldn't think I have a good attitude, but they do nothing. Yeah, I don't tell people, all this stuff. I guess my background.

225
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.500
iPad: Let me throw up on you. So you can just walk

226
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:24.810
iPad: Us like very, very, very best friends, which I know some of it, but I just don't think it's necessary. I'm talking to you as a doctor. So, yeah.

227
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.360
Dr Jameson: Well, I think it is definitely

228
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.320
Dr Jameson: still relevant.

229
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.110
Dr Jameson: I mean it's well it's relevant. I mean, these are

230
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.560
Dr Jameson: There's a lot of emotional emotional pain is

231
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.380
Dr Jameson: Yeah, emotional pain causes physical pain and

232
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:45.630
Dr Jameson: I need to escape, and there's, there's, there's, it's all right. It is all tied together, unfortunately.

233
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.370
iPad: That sounds, that sounds

234
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.690
iPad: Unimaginable well I can

235
00:27:48.690 --> 00:28:00.900
iPad: Tell you, I got drunk one time in my life when I was 18 because I don't drink and my bosses took me and my other co worker to please call the brilliant venture belted where we live.

236
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:11.670
iPad: And took us out to dinner to celebrate that we have done so well that will work. And I'd never heard of the Daiquiri. And I said, Well, what is that they said I was just a Slurpee, don't worry.

237
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:24.840
iPad: Well, I never drove by that but I still like, I don't see the point in it. It's nasty days it's expensive. You wake up with a hangover.

238
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.570
iPad: Then you look at the bill and you throw up again. What

239
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.840
iPad: You know, go have fun run on you know go laugh with your friends. I

240
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.650
iPad: Don't see the point.

241
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:52.350
iPad: Is. Plus, I've lost like my sister, a bunch of people drunk drivers nine people total. So, and not one accident, you know, it's like, amazing. So I'm a big advocate for if you're going to drink in your keys period, you have

242
00:28:53.370 --> 00:29:02.820
iPad: Column the services go to a motel. But you call me because I will come get you. And if I'm there, I'm taking the keys because the one time I was drunk.

243
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:11.160
iPad: Besides all the deaths was one is a team was that time and I called my boyfriend and I said, something's wrong. I can't see the stairs and

244
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:18.060
iPad: They're all he goes, where are you, I go, I told him, and he goes, What's wrong with you know i don't know something's wrong.

245
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:27.780
iPad: Because they didn't tell me I didn't know you know I, I'd seen that growing up, but that wasn't mean I haven't drunk anything I had a Slurpee.

246
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:42.420
iPad: You know, Peach daiquiri, yeah. So he walked it off with me and I went through crying because my friend Kelly was dying amount Rex yet to laughing because the sun is rising, we're swimming in the ocean.

247
00:29:42.810 --> 00:30:01.920
iPad: I mean, you know, and I went okay on top of the expense the throwing up the people go through, you have to deal with this emotional roller coaster. Like I have enough personalities. I don't need more. So that was. That's what I didn't just see it I physically experienced it. And I went

248
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:10.200
iPad: So I have been drunk once in my life very honest about that. I don't even know if my husband knows that I never thought about something.

249
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.080
iPad: I'm just filling up all over you.

250
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.360
Dr Jameson: So I want to

251
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.680
Dr Jameson: This is, again, this all needs to be

252
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:28.800
Dr Jameson: Worked out but the on the medical side of things. So you've been on are you taking any medications right now.

253
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.520
iPad: Lyrica

254
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:42.420
iPad: I was taking Cymbalta but they told me at Stanford, because I was like Cymbalta does nothing for me, why am I ingesting something that does nothing for me.

255
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:51.900
iPad: And they said, you don't have to, like, I don't. I thought it was like a combination of. I know it's an antidepressant, which doesn't do that to me.

256
00:30:52.590 --> 00:31:02.460
iPad: But it's supposed to work with nerve pain. I thought it worked in conjunction with lyric. I mean, I should have. It is my fault for non for me, myself better with. I was just dealing with way too much stuff.

257
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.980
iPad: To look up medication was not my

258
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.650
Dr Jameson: Important do know what does it take

259
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:14.880
iPad: I think it's three times a day. Hundred and 50 milligrams, but I could be wrong.

260
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.920
iPad: So I want to be exact. This is my medicine case.

261
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:27.630
iPad: I'm okay. And I don't really take it like it's prescribed like

262
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:50.220
iPad: Again, I don't want to ingest things that are. You don't have to, you know, and I've really bad neuropathy, but I find the two of these works better than three.

I i

265
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.600
Dr Jameson: Would think if you just let your doctor whoever's prescribing it. No, they would say, Okay, take it twice a day.

276
00:32:54.210 --> 00:33:03.990
iPad: No, I just take it like I had a sour stomach last night because I stopped taking the obedience seven days ago and usually

277
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.960

iPad: So I'll go 1020 days without it, because I just don't like it. I don't like it. The way it makes me go down and you know all that stuff. But then the pain builds up so great. And then, you know, I realized just dropping it like that is dangerous.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.070
iPad: But I didn't care anymore. I just wanted to like

280

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:50.670

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:48.630
iPad: Infection check me for everything. Yeah. But I, again, I had all those stupid shots. I'm glad I had him because people here at the school.

388
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.510
iPad: It was a whole series.

389
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.510
Dr Jameson: I know for sure habitat be there's a Hepatitis B vaccine that you take through there's three doses that's i'm sure what you had

391
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.390

392
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.490
Dr Jameson: But there's always

393
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.810
A vaccine now.

394
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.150
Dr Jameson: But not have to see.

395
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.900
iPad: I just know I had a series of shots I have take over six months.

396
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.910
Dr Jameson: That's happened is one. Okay.

397
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.010
iPad: And hate needles. Oh.

398
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.520
Dr Jameson: And you don't have any got. Did you ever do you ever gallbladder still

399
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.360
iPad: Yes.

400
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.850
iPad: Well, they didn't do things don't happen but they

401
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:30.660
iPad: Didn't because

402
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:39.030
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, so, I mean, I don't know, did anybody say anything about you maybe being a really slow metabolism of these of these opiates.

403
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.770
iPad: No, but I do have a slow metabolism and nobody said anything about that so

404
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:56.550
Dr Jameson: I'm just wondering how all these metabolites would be building up and then it sounds like it's a very delayed withdrawal, in a way, like most people start to feel withdrawal, even in 24 hours. They're already

405
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.960
Dr Jameson: Really under their skin. Yeah.

406
00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

407
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:02.640
iPad: With opiates. I know with alcohol because my brother's an alcoholic.

408
00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:13.140
iPad: But I don't, I don't know, I've never detox somebody on opiates. So yeah. Hmm. Well, maybe I

409
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:25.440
iPad: They never talked about it. Yeah, they talked about so many great things. So, but I didn't. That was not one of them. They were all

410
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.010
iPad: There was too much stuff.

411
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.830
iPad: Yeah, and I'm sure you're going to go

412
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.210
iPad: Out to speak to somebody about

413
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.550
Dr Jameson: Yes, you may have been a little bit

414
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:48.120
Dr Jameson: You know, confused too. If your metabolism. If byproducts. We're building up and stuff. You know what I mean. So some of what they told you might be a little fuzzy at this point anyway.

415
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.790
iPad: I'm pretty sick so

416
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.980
Dr Jameson: What sort of what sort of drug

417
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:54.090
iPad: Was

418
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.420
Dr Jameson: Where your parents, you said you grew up in a household with

419
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.770
iPad: Oh, oh my gosh, okay so

420
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:11.340
iPad: Where they, you name it. It was there LSD, Marijuana, Cocaine cocaine was the biggest one. I mean it was just eight on the table.

421
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.920
Dr Jameson: Okay. Are your parents still living or you don't know or

422
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:20.130
iPad: And this was only my birth, mom, my dad, his dad, he just died last year of cancer at 99

423
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:33.180
iPad: Yeah, my, my dad is like 35 years older than my mom and I am now very good friends with my mother, she did all her drugs because

424
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:44.220
iPad: She I tested her with Robert Myers test. She definitely is a psychopath. And I knew that you know her way of coping.

425
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.900
iPad: To deal with the things that are brain was the drugs and when I explained to her. Her personality type

426
00:45:52.650 --> 00:46:07.560
iPad: You know, a couple years ago, I was afraid because I'd never done it before. And I figured she was probably going to chop my head off. And she said she gave me my last confirmation, which I already knew from the tests, but, um, she said.

427
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:14.910
iPad: You know, when I was two years old. My dad had a gun and I thought it would be fun to kill somebody.

428
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:25.740
iPad: I still have guns and I wonder about it, but I wouldn't ever do it because she's aged out. You know what I mean, she's at the point where she wants to

429
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:37.620
iPad: Simulate with society, and she you know they either in the den jail or they want to suddenly she's one of the few that's assimilate and then

430
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:37.740
They

431
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.820
Dr Jameson: Were opiates.

432
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah, this wire. Yeah, right.

433
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.840
iPad: No Alcohol op

434
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.430
iPad: Yeah, alcohol.

435
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.900
iPad: I don't even know the opiates were like really a big thing.

436
00:46:53.160 --> 00:47:05.280
iPad: Where they get some vs pain LSD, Marijuana. Yeah, that there was a Coke deal that went bad. Paul got his head blown off on our courts seven. It's awful.

437
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:19.110
iPad: That I say that so cavalierly but it's just because you have two legs. Yeah, who was just one of the family, friends, and he was a Coke dealer and they had a big fight and

438
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:28.830
iPad: Somebody blew his head off. I don't know who it was because I wasn't outside, but the bloody brains were everywhere. When I walked out. Wow. The cops came and, you know,

439
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.280
iPad: That's when foster care was really implemented.

440
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.480
iPad: But I'm not saying foster care was much better.

441
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:38.520
Dr Jameson: Not doesn't sound like it. Okay.

442
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:39.720
iPad: So,

443
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:48.420
Dr Jameson: Um, so it sounds like you've already had a pretty good explanation, maybe better than I can give about how the buprenorphine works. It sounds like it was pretty detailed

444
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:58.350
Dr Jameson: And it was a pain specialist. That was the so yeah I'm a, I'm a family practice doc by training and then you get you do a little extra training in the buprenorphine but not extensive like that. So anyway,

445
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:11.460
Dr Jameson: But it does it occupies the same receptors as opiates do but some of them more strongly than or more selectively than others, and it turns on some of them, and then some of them, it blocks.

446
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:20.730
Dr Jameson: And it's been it's a designer drug basically because it's meant to it's designed to block the ones that make you stop breathing and

447
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.240
iPad: Make you

448
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.290
Kind of euphoric.

449
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.870
Dr Jameson: And then after you

450
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and then it

451
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.880
iPad: It my pharma is allowed to do what they do is amazing.

452
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.980
Dr Jameson: Well, yeah, that's a whole other story, but then

453
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:46.950
Dr Jameson: It just like it activates the ones that have to do with the physical withdrawal symptoms and somewhat for pain there. It has some pain relieving benefit qualities to it's

454
00:48:47.520 --> 00:49:01.470
Dr Jameson: Different, in a way, I guess it's it's a anyway. But we do see patients that find that it works quite well for for for their pain. Pain is also I mean sounds like you have clearly lots of different

455
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.740
Dr Jameson: Sources of pain, but

456
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.020
Dr Jameson: One of the symptoms of opiate withdrawal is also increased pain.

457
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.880
iPad: So social emotional when I'm finding is I'm more emotional. Mm hmm.

458
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.870
iPad: That's good, yeah know there's. I mean, there's a depression.

459
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:23.850
Dr Jameson: That comes with it has to do with kind of sort of used up all the dopamine and your body isn't

460
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.700
iPad: Needs, it needs research on was not happy, but it changes your neurons. Did you know that

461
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:42.090
Dr Jameson: Yes, it changes were Florida and I was going to say, like, there's more and more research about chronic use of opiates actually worsens paint and it creates it alters the pain pathways and it creates new anyway it's it's

462
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.940
iPad: They're not and we didn't discuss it at Stanford. I just knew

463
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.010
iPad: Yeah, so, so

464
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:55.830
Dr Jameson: Normally when we start the Suboxone we were well when we start the Suboxone it's just the brand name for buprenorphine.

465
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:10.410
Dr Jameson: We need you to already be in withdrawal because it's such a strong, it has a very strong, we call it affinity to the receptor, it will actually push off anything that's currently on there, but then

466
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.130
iPad: Yeah, he says.

467
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.340
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so you have to, I mean, normally a few

468
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:19.530
Dr Jameson: 24 hours is enough time in your case, I'm just from the things you're describing

469
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.820
iPad: That you like

470
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.590
Dr Jameson: No, I think.

471
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:32.880
Dr Jameson: I'm, I'm actually even though it's been so long since you've taken and I'm still a little bit worried because this just sounds like you have a little bit of a unique

472
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:42.870
Dr Jameson: I'm wondering if you're somebody that since they say you built up all these metabolites. I'm just wondering if if you kind of break things down more slowly than than most people do.

473
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:52.620
Dr Jameson: So you are always just taking the pills like the way they were designed to be taken. Right. You weren't crushing

474
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.630
iPad: Or, well, sometimes they overtook

475
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.890
iPad: Me like you did today. I took a crush.

476
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.470
Dr Jameson: You didn't crushing snort things or

477
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:02.190
iPad: Oh,

478
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.330
Dr Jameson: Gosh, Elton shoot

479
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:11.220
iPad: And then again, and I take things as they are and I don't like needles. They talked about that people like crushing putting a needle.

480
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:14.760
iPad: Yes. Like, it sounds like heroin. Why would they do that.

481
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:17.070
iPad: Well, so

482
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.150
Dr Jameson: In here, when people get

483
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.540
iPad: My house.

484
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.360
Dr Jameson: The same reason people take care of. And I guess.

485
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.360
iPad: Apparently they know i i don't mean

486
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:28.560
iPad: To criticize them. They have hard lives. I understand that. Yeah.

487
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:33.120
iPad: And and make it sound like there's people there.

488
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.700
iPad: So,

489
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:36.180
iPad: It's me.

490
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:44.970
Dr Jameson: I think, in your case, I want to start you at the low dose and then see how it goes and consider, you know, gradually increasing as needed.

491
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:56.520
Dr Jameson: We're, we're going to look to see if we how much pain relief. We can get you with it. It may or may not fully do the job. But at least it should

492
00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:03.030
Dr Jameson: Whatever benefit, it does provide you will be without the sedation and

493
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.360
Dr Jameson: At least for the most part, there are some people say they feel still a little bit groggy, but

494
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:21.030
iPad: I think it's not to the same degree by any means. Yeah, from one of explained to me. It wouldn't be because I'm okay. So T cells are not, you know, those are

495
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:38.820
iPad: It's not the right word. I'm using those of your blood and all that, but we drawing on the board tease when we are talking about it and the T's are like 3456789 for the opiates and they just keep piling up

496
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:47.610
iPad: Whereas only one comes down for sandbox. And I can say some box and the other one. For some reason, when a

497
00:52:48.420 --> 00:53:00.300
iPad: New printer, you can say somebody on. That's why I was using smart, but I always like to use the correct names, but I can mark them. And I'm like, man. Yeah, yeah, it sounds like epinephrine. To me, that's why.

498
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:07.500
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's kind of cool Suboxone is fine. I'm okay. So, um,

499
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:18.270
iPad: So since I'm this is a question. I'm serious about Don't laugh at me since I'm actually coming off the withdrawals, is that bad.

500
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.670
iPad: For starting this

501
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:30.870
Dr Jameson: No, I think we we want. We just want to make sure you're already having withdrawal before we want the receptors to be at least partially empty before we give you the

502
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:37.620
iPad: Okay. Okay, that makes it so I thought maybe you have to be in withdraw when you said that I was like, you have to be

503
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:45.900
Dr Jameson: No, you don't have to be in withdrawal. But you if you've had opiates anytime recently they need to be the level needs to be dropping basically

504
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:54.060
Dr Jameson: And so they did. They explain to you about the the way it melts in your mouth, either a tablet or a film. Oh.

505
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.280
iPad: It's it's subcutaneous

506
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:57.450
Dr Jameson: sublingual

507
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:15.720
iPad: Yeah, sublingual sir. Yeah, I think they said that. But I was so excited to be able to be off those and have some hope again for life that I think they said that my just went up yeah okay whatever what's next.

508
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.830
iPad: Tell me more.

509
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:32.010
Dr Jameson: So, so there's. It comes in a little film and you just said it under your tongue and let it sit there till it fully dissolves and you basically need it to be absorbed through your through your

510
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:33.780
iPad: Calls on your mouth.

511
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.680
iPad: You can, suppose

512
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.510
Dr Jameson: As opposed to swallowing it

513
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.020
Dr Jameson: Goes

514
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:48.720
Dr Jameson: Down in the stomach. It doesn't typically get absorbed. So they like you to not have anything to eat or drink for 10 minutes after you've used you've you've administered it so that you make sure to

515
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.990
Dr Jameson: Try to get as much of it as you can in

516
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.540
Dr Jameson: Four.

517
00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.600
Dr Jameson: Diversion avoidance purposes, meaning like people either

518
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.490
Dr Jameson: doing those things we just talked about melting and shooting or crushing there you

519
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.480
Dr Jameson: Go and tablets, you

520
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.900
Dr Jameson: It's mixed with Narc can basically

521
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.670
iPad: Which is good.

522
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:30.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah, which is so if somebody tries to do something inappropriate with it enough big they put themselves into withdrawal, basically. So that's a determine the when you're using the medicine, a proper way as design, but the Narc can actually doesn't really get absorbed.

523
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:47.310
Dr Jameson: This way at all. So it kind of just passes through you. Just, just a lot of times people think it's the, it's the Narcan in there that's doing the job and it's not. It's the buprenorphine that's really just in there as a as a deterrent to people misusing the medication.

524
00:55:48.360 --> 00:56:01.830
iPad: I told Dr. B. That would he likes to be called. I said, Why don't you guys like training everybody about this. And of course, then I said, I know why because it's all politics money.

525
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:12.780
Dr Jameson: Well, there's yeah there's no I mean they are training most residents are getting training now and more and more er staffs and and

526
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:20.130
Dr Jameson: Anyway, it's, it's part of it in it, and I loved it too. I got the training and I worked for a place

527
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.000
Dr Jameson: A board of brick and mortar place for some time, but

528
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:33.540
Dr Jameson: There's a lot of DEA regulations about it and that sort of sends this kind of signal to a doctor that's working in their own office like you, you

529
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:41.370
Dr Jameson: You worry that you're doing something you're not supposed to do without realizing it, and they're going to come. It used to be that they would have like spot checks where they'd come in.

530
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:52.110
Dr Jameson: Looking through your all your records once a year or so. And it just created this sort of like, well, I don't want to get hauled away by the DEA because I didn't dot three teams or, you know,

531
00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.450
Dr Jameson: You know, do something in triplicate or

532
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:57.780
Dr Jameson: Something so so there was a lot of like

533
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.020
Dr Jameson: fear about

534
00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.060
iPad: Yeah, I get that.

535
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.200
iPad: Yeah, so the IRS man only works.

536
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.770
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

537
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:09.540
iPad: Well, I've never had IRS audits, but

538
00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:21.060
Dr Jameson: Um, so, um, we're I have to wrap up because I was supposed to be having another patient in a minute. They don't know what people don't always show up, but

539
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.310
Dr Jameson: I'm going to start you on

540
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.840
iPad: A low low used your time at

541
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.410
Dr Jameson: All. No, no, no, no, it's fine, it's, it's complicated. That's fine.

542
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.850
Dr Jameson: So I'm going to send a prescription using the West Side pharmacy. Right.

543
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.370
Dr Jameson: On Mission Street.

544
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:42.750
Dr Jameson: Do you need information. No, I have it. I just want to make sure that was

545
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:44.520
iPad: The right one, I thought. So I thought, I'm

546
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.420
Dr Jameson: Going to send yeah I'm going to send the prescription

547
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:57.600
Dr Jameson: Just the average dose, people tend to be on 16 milligrams a day, they come and eat and they take it usually twice a day.

548
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:00.930
Dr Jameson: I'm going to start you on to

549
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.890
iPad: And have you take it out one doctor said, you start to me once

550
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.890
iPad: Or twice. It doesn't work, you go a little bit of. Yeah.

551
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:19.320
Dr Jameson: So normally we have people take two and then a half an hour to an hour later if they're not feeling and what bunch better they take another one this in my again. This just seems a little bit

552
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.480
Dr Jameson: More I want to go more slowly. So I want to have you just

553
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:30.420
Dr Jameson: Start taking it either once or twice a day. But, you know, just kind of see how you do. Even with one a day.

554
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.850
iPad: Twice a day. Would I cut the thing and have

555
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:49.290
Dr Jameson: No, no, I'm going to send enough for you to have two in the day. And these are two milligram films not eight milligrams, so that it's a lower dose and we'll see how that goes with some of the nausea and the restlessness and pain and sleep.

556
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:57.240
Dr Jameson: A lot of times people feel like hot and cold and they can't sit still, like, anxious, do you have any of that sort of stuff.

557
00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.270
iPad: Oh, I thought you meant on the medication. I'm like, no.

558
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.540
iPad: No, I was getting that I'm

559
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:12.270
iPad: Not it's not anxiety, but where you're getting agitated because made so i and going through his girls, you know, and I was like,

560
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:26.550
iPad: Because I was dependent on it. I am dependent on it because I've been taking it since 14, you know, so my body was like, please just take the pain away. Now you know in my head. Yeah.

561
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:28.410
iPad: And so I was like jiggery

562
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.520
iPad: Yeah, okay.

563
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.760
Dr Jameson: So, so those are some of the things that we'll see

564
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.800
Dr Jameson: We'll see how it goes with with this starting dose.

565
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:40.680
Dr Jameson: I

566
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:48.870
Dr Jameson: Have time on. So did they explain to them how our program works with the weekly group.

567
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:55.200
iPad: That was gonna be my next question. Like, they said, you just call in. If you need somebody. And I'm like, Well, what if I need them every day.

568
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.410
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm

569
00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:07.440
Dr Jameson: So the structure of the program. I don't know why they don't explain this to people before they get to me. So I end up explaining, kind of like nuts and bolts, but anyway.

570
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:17.160
Dr Jameson: We have this initial visit, you're going to meet with a counselor for an initial we call they call it a bio psychosocial which I guess is familiar terminology to you.

571
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:31.230
Dr Jameson: And then they'll set up, they'll make a recommendation about how often I probably I'd say weekly or every other week you'll meet with individual accounts or first. Who knows how long. But sounds like there's quite a bit of material there that might

572
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.720
iPad: Need to be probably isn't right for me. I'm gonna be like, No, no, I mean it.

573
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.080
Dr Jameson: Sounds like

574
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.970
Dr Jameson: You know, very traumatic.

575
01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.710
iPad: Life and and

576
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.890
Dr Jameson: That

577
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.550
iPad: That will lot of people have dramatic lives. I think it's relative

578
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.470
Dr Jameson: Rotor sure

579
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:55.650
Dr Jameson: But in any case, the seven year old is not supposed to know how to how to handle seeing someone's brains blown off on their front porch, for example, and dealing with all the stuff that you did so.

580
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.760
iPad: Because ever dealt with.

581
01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:04.740
Dr Jameson: No. So there's a sounds like quite a bit of work that can probably be done, which is for perfectly fine.

582
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:20.670
Dr Jameson: And then we have a weekly support group recovery skills slash med check visit. So that's run by a calm to we have a counselor and myself, both in attendance and then eight to 10 patients usually

583
01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.370
Dr Jameson: And so that's a who needs a refill. How's it going, kind of thing and then

584
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:37.800
Dr Jameson: For the first 15 minutes or so we check in with everybody. And then, but the counselor sort of runs it from there. And there's different topic of the week. But anyway, people sometimes somebody's going through something and we spend a lot of time.

585
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:45.480
Dr Jameson: Problem solving, and troubleshooting and encouraging and, you know, that kind of stuff. Sometimes it mean it's just different. Every week, but it's meant to be.

586
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:54.450
Dr Jameson: Supportive uplifting community like you know kind of sort of sense. Right, so

587
01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.400
Dr Jameson: Those happen once a week, like I said, they go for an hour.

588
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:06.090
Dr Jameson: So generally, I have most of my, I don't know what your schedule is like these days but

589
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.970
Dr Jameson: I have to try to break them down by state. I think for licensing. But anyway, I have actually my groups are for California on Wednesdays.

590
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:23.250
Dr Jameson: I have a 10:30am or noon. Don't know if even both times.

591
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:30.840
iPad: And 30 I don't like to, like, you know, that's like in the middle of it. Okay, so I have one privacy question. It's really

592
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.850
iPad: At this point,

593
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:52.440
iPad: I can imagine like I used to be recognized in stores and you know everywhere I went and people would like oh JC JC, you know, that kind of thing. And I can't imagine anybody, it's been since 2015 since I've done anything anybody recognizing me and

594
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:54.510
iPad: I just

595
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.000
iPad: What would happen is they find something about my life and then somebody would give it to a reporter and then

596
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.860
Dr Jameson: Yeah, got it.

597
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.480
iPad: So what is

598
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.040
Dr Jameson: How we

599
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.120
iPad: Wait, people

600
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.170
iPad: See us

601
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.250
iPad: Yeah.

Dr Jameson: It is on video. It's on video we we require people. I didn't care today because it's just you so

603
01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.550
iPad: I'll just deal with it, but

604
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:20.850
Dr Jameson: Well, no, we require earbuds so that

605
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.820
Dr Jameson: Other people who might be walking by, I can't hear what someone else is saying.

606
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:34.590
Dr Jameson: You know, for privacy purposes. Um, well, I mean, we're using a different name.

607
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.900
Dr Jameson: And it is is meant to be private. I guess I

608
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.610
Dr Jameson: That's a tough.

609
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.450
iPad: There's gonna be a problem, it has been for years.

610
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.640
iPad: Yeah, I mean, I remember me.

611
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.010
Dr Jameson: If you, you know, that would be you not

612
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.820

615
01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.580
iPad: You know,

616
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.470
Dr Jameson: Or you can use a different name. If you want, but

617
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:04.260
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and then

618
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:10.050
iPad: I guess I'm either stage name is either TJ or JC ready. So yeah, so

619
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.060
Dr Jameson: We can just not mention that, yes, there's a

620
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.910
iPad: And I don't want to take away from the group. Anyway, you know,

621
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.140
iPad: In the 1030

622
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:21.990
Dr Jameson: Group, there is a guy who's in the temporary

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:33.540
Dr Jameson: He works in LA, and he does mix like he has a studio or he does, he mixes. MUSIC He's much he's like 2423 I get the sense he's doing like hip hop and

624
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.470
Dr Jameson: Like that kind of stuff. It doesn't sound like it's

625
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:38.850
iPad: Gonna know me so

626
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:40.170
Dr Jameson: So,

627
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.630
Dr Jameson: That he's in the 1030 group and then noon.

628
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:47.700
iPad: I prefer 1030 again because it doesn't like

629
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:50.760
iPad: Okay, in the middle of the day where then I'm broken and I'm like,

630
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:52.080
Dr Jameson: Okay.

631
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:54.780
iPad: That's okay. And you're not active

632
01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:08.490
Dr Jameson: Ya know that so I'll pencil you in for next Wednesday. But I think we should probably have another at least one more, visit between now and then just sort of do like how's it going and follow ups and

633
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.910
Dr Jameson: You know, see how the doses and

634
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.000
iPad: Make sure there aren't any bright smile when it's bright health right right heart health right heart Dr Jameson, yes.

635
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:32.580
Dr Jameson: So, um, I guess I have I, I see patients. Well, I do groups on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I see patients on Mondays and Thursdays kind of one on one. So,

636
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:36.930
Dr Jameson: We can either have you go over the weekend and

637
01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.000
Dr Jameson: All of that. Sorry.

638
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:46.200
iPad: When you're not impacted because I just graduated. So, and I'm not working yet yeah so

639
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:59.430
Dr Jameson: I guess I was thinking maybe maybe both like see how you go if you start it today. And we can see how you're doing tomorrow and then decide if we want to do anything different with adults or we want to leave a, b and then

640
01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:10.560
Dr Jameson: Leave it kind of Open it, open ended. If you need to touch base on Monday we can sort of decide that as time goes on. I guess I just feel a little bit like waiting till Monday is kind of a long time.

641
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:22.680
iPad: Okay, no, no problem. I'm just trying to put it in the calendar and you're faster than me. Then I can take my hands. So right now what I have is 1030 on the 19th, is that correct

642
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:26.820
iPad: Next Wednesday meeting.

643
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:28.980
Dr Jameson: Yes.

644
01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:34.050
iPad: Okay, so that's what we'll start with then what was the other one. I'm sorry to be so slow.

645
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.140
Dr Jameson: No, I know. I appreciate that you're

646
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.420
Dr Jameson: writing it down. I

647
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.460
Dr Jameson: We have all

648
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:52.890
Dr Jameson: Sorts of it's a wide spectrum, right. Some people are very professional and just kind of got accidentally stuck on so some people have been shooting heroin, since they were

649
01:06:54.180 --> 01:07:02.700
Dr Jameson: And those people tend to have a hard time keeping a schedule because they never learned to be adults. So we're still working. Anyway, so I have a lot of people missing.

650
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.030
Dr Jameson: Appointments and I forgot I was writing it up so

651
01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:08.400
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I appreciate that you're even writing it down as

652
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.210
iPad: Well, I'm, I'm, if I don't, I can't, I can't remember the appointments, I start going

653
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.910
iPad: Yeah, I'm doing this with my, you know,

654
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:18.990
iPad: Yeah, but

655
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:21.450
Dr Jameson: So,

656
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.710
iPad: The next thing is

657
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:25.170
Dr Jameson: So I'm thinking tomorrow.

658
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:27.900
Dr Jameson: Okay 2:30am

659
01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:32.640
Dr Jameson: What you you're more of an early riser or what's your, what do you what

660
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:37.710
iPad: I mean, because my pain so bad. So I'm just whenever

661
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:42.150
Dr Jameson: So I could see you tomorrow.

662
01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:49.410
Dr Jameson: Have someone say I'm on the East Coast. So I have to do the math to I sometimes I messed that up.

663
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.970
iPad: Our schedules, you

664
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:55.650
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I have somebody scheduled at at nine your time tomorrow. So, and

665
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.870
Dr Jameson: So I could either see you at eight.

666
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.240
iPad: Time or my team.

667
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:01.290
Dr Jameson: Know your time either.

668
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.930
iPad: 815 830 sounds good.

669
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:06.150
iPad: If that's okay with you.

670
01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:08.580
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's fine. So let's say 815

671
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.910
iPad: Do I do the same thing I did today.

672
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.680
iPad: So, yeah.

673
01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.020
Dr Jameson: I'm

674
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:24.180
Dr Jameson: Like 810 so sometimes there's a little bit of a delay, like if if there's a group, starting in a minute, and there's

675
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:30.990
Dr Jameson: 10 people checking in, for the group. Sometimes you have to wait so that's that's the reason the the the rationale for the early check in.

676
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:39.330
Dr Jameson: And also, you know, oh, you need a coat. Yeah, there's a copay or I don't know if they as time goes on, you will find there's other there's other

677
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:53.460
Dr Jameson: Check, check list items like have you had your drug screen in the last 30 days have you filled out the survey that you were supposed to fill out every week. Have you know so they they like go through this little list to make sure everything squared away so tomorrow, there won't

678
01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:54.600
Be anything

679
01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:58.410
Dr Jameson: Extra to check really okay um

680
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:09.930
iPad: But so yeah I think eight. So right now I have tomorrow at 810 with you. I have next Wednesday at 1030 with the group.

681
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.910
Dr Jameson: Right, what else you should check in and half an hour early from a group

682
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:15.330
iPad: So,

683
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:16.320
iPad: Maybe just write down

684
01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.150
iPad: Thank you for letting me know that

685
01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:18.900
Dr Jameson: Yeah, money.

686
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:22.980
iPad: It's the calendar change that so that one I should check in at 10 o'clock.

687
01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:24.120
Yeah.

688
01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:30.540
iPad: Okay, so let me change the time hold them. Thank you for letting me know that because I would have messed up.

689
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.310
Dr Jameson: And then you want to have earbuds with you, you're going to need those.

690
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:36.750
iPad: I'll charge money.

691
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.180
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean earphones of some kind. They don't want to be ear buds, but some sort of

692
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.940
iPad: I have here, but because it hit the weight on my head of head.

693
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:48.900
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's too much.

694
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:52.470
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then

695
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:58.170
Dr Jameson: For labs. If you have the hepatitis.

696
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.040
Dr Jameson: lab tests.

697
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:07.530
Dr Jameson: If there's any drug screening that's been done in lately I

698
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:17.490
iPad: Think they did all of that in the one we sent you. But again, there's like a steep steep Steve did it for me because it was my hands, can't do that. It's just too much.

699
01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:25.110
iPad: You know, work with it. You can't do it. So he only sent I think 12 of the 50

700
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.390
iPad: I test that we're

701
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.420
Dr Jameson: All no i think i would i

702
01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:37.410
Dr Jameson: Would it. Part of it is, I just need to review what you've already sent because what I see, so far as like three three things. I don't think they finished.

703
01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:48.360
Dr Jameson: scanning them all in yet so we can hold off on that because it's probably, do you have any kind of discharge paperwork from the hospital.

704
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:55.590
iPad: Steve. Got it. Do you want us to

705
01:10:55.950 --> 01:11:04.170
Dr Jameson: Actually probably what I, what I would probably be more interested than what they give you. Because, which is like these are your medicines and these are your appointments, like they don't usually

706
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:11.670
Dr Jameson: I would be more interested in the like doctors, we call it a discharge summary where they like detail what all happened in the hospitalization.

707
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.380
Dr Jameson: But that would be something that would be like a medical records from the hospital, which may not even be in yet if you just came home yesterday me not being

708
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.240
Dr Jameson: Done and signed off so but

709
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:26.520
Dr Jameson: We can we can put a request in for that as time goes on. I think that would probably be

710
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:36.000
iPad: Okay. Do you want me I'll hold off putting a note to my husband, so that you tell me what we need. So I don't double do every

711
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.750
Dr Jameson: I will

712
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.910
Dr Jameson: I will

713
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.620
Dr Jameson: And request hospital.

714
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.620
iPad: Otherwise, little send a request to them right now.

715
01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.000
Dr Jameson: Charge summary.

716
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.370
iPad: Sleep right now so tired from

717
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:53.040
Stanford.

718
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:55.470
Hospital.

719
01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:02.640
Dr Jameson: And they'll have to have you sign if if they don't already have that on file. I know you've signed but they may need to do a specific one.

720
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:16.830
Dr Jameson: And then anyway. It may be that yeah maybe write that down, actually, because the hospital is going to need you to sign off that you're okay with them, sending it to us. So if you can just say discharge summary.

721
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.240
iPad: Like this.

722
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.730
iPad: And

723
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:29.850
iPad: It probably won't know what we may have that because

724
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:36.630
iPad: Because he had to take time off of work. When I was in the hospital for the whatever they want to call it, um,

725
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:53.190
iPad: She he needed that I remember specifically saying I need the doctor's notes. So we may have that. But I'll look and I'll ask him masculine right now I put Dr discharge summary needed from do you need it from Stanford and American or just Stanford.

726
01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.520
Dr Jameson: I'm

727
01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:07.650
Dr Jameson: Probably. I mean, the more the better for me. I'm happy to have more, no more about your medical stuff than less so.

728
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:15.000
Dr Jameson: Like the Stanford one probably isn't back yet, but the Dominican product probably since they had to do that to transfer you up so

729
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:20.160
iPad: Okay, or down, so Dr discharge summary needed from Stanford and Dominican

730
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.020
iPad: Correct.

731
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:22.800
Yeah.

732
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.970
iPad: Oh, we have a D said. So if we take a picture and send it to the email that we have

733
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:30.750
Yeah.

734
01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:34.530
iPad: Okay, yeah, there we go. Okay.

735
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.120
Dr Jameson: See

736
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.170
Very Organized

737
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.790
iPad: I didn't

738
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:41.940
iPad: Um, I was like disturbance JUST GIVE ME OUT OF HERE. I DON'T CARE, BUT

739
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:44.850
Dr Jameson: I'm

740
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.130
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I sent the prescription. There can be so

741
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:51.330
iPad: Ready. Yeah.

742
01:13:51.390 --> 01:14:00.450
Dr Jameson: Sometimes the pharmacy gets sometimes they don't have it in stock, sometimes your insurance wants us to fill out a prior off.

743
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.200
iPad: Sometime probably need that I'm just warning you ahead. Yeah.

744
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:07.110
iPad: This for anything. I take the walnuts.

745
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:14.220
Dr Jameson: So that can slow things down on a new obtaining the medication.

746
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:29.580
Dr Jameson: So if it turns out you don't even get it by tomorrow. Then there's probably no point in us meeting tomorrow because we won't you won't have had a chance to see how it's working. So just let us know if if if you're not going to have started taking it.

747
01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.220
iPad: yet know how I'm going to let you know.

748
01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:33.150
Well,

749
01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:38.220
Dr Jameson: And we even just sign into the virtual clinic and

750
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.350
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

751
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.590
iPad: And that's generally the way you

752
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:52.740
Dr Jameson: Start yeah that's generally the best way to get have any kind of communication, but also to check in, for whatever appointment, you have

753
01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.410
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean, like,

754
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.090
iPad: I play I had always hoped that it would get to this point so much better.

755
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:06.570
Yeah.

756
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.490
Dr Jameson: Maybe we can. I mean, I feel like we haven't even really gotten through all of your medical history.

757
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:24.480
Dr Jameson: And I want to know more about. I'm not even sure I have all your allergies in here. So maybe we can still meet tomorrow, just to kind of keep keep getting through background a little bit more. I'm

758
01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.050
iPad: Going to send you the LG list because it's on the phone.

759
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.130
Dr Jameson: Okay, sure.

760
01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.270
iPad: That sounds good. One that

761
01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:31.080
Yeah.

762
01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:35.340
iPad: And then

763
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.080
iPad: What did I do miss

764
01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:42.660
Dr Jameson: That's okay, you have a primary or you're going to be moving. So you need a new one, or what

765
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:53.550
iPad: I'm going to need a new one. When I move on, we're moving to Cupertino right now it's Dr Sickles and I she didn't have an appointment. Nobody had an appointment, might the clinic.

766
01:15:54.060 --> 01:16:14.220
iPad: Until next Wednesday. So I'm actually not meeting with my primary I meeting with somebody. I've never met before and they're going to review the labs that I have to have again my liver enzymes. So at that time. If you need additional stuff can you send a request into quest, you know,

767
01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.380
Dr Jameson: What. Yeah, that's how we usually do our initial

768
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.180
Dr Jameson: Labs. Anyway, so yeah.

769
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.850
iPad: Okay. And that way I can do the ones they want plus the ones you want you can get them all at once.

770
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:26.160
iPad: Okay, yeah, that's okay.

771
01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah, they'll probably be kind of an overlap. Anyway, what they want.

772
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.580
iPad: And then we'll take 20 miles.

773
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:40.140
iPad: No, I'm sorry war you out now tell you go see a therapist now.

774
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.890
Dr Jameson: Now, unfortunately.

775
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:46.170
iPad: You

776
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.300
Dr Jameson: Know i mean the the frequency with which it turns out that

777
01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:03.990
Dr Jameson: People dependent on opiates have some sort of history of trauma as a kid or I don't know. It's not uncommon at all. In fact, I've, I've

778
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:16.290
Dr Jameson: Put in a request as we as the company grows to have like breakout groups, specifically for survivors of childhood sexual abuse and just the PTSD, in and of itself.

779
01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:25.710
Dr Jameson: And as we grow. I think we'll probably be able to accommodate that they're looking at hiring someone that does the, I don't know if you've heard of the he

780
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:29.610
Dr Jameson: Asked, yeah. The I movement treatment for PTSD.

781
01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:31.140
iPad: Is not just it's a

782
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.210
Dr Jameson: Real yeah PTS

783
01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:39.480
Dr Jameson: Yes, exactly. So I mean as as we grow, I hope, I hope, will be able to expand some of those

784
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.460
iPad: Are your experience with the end because I've read about it. We studied it, but I've never

785
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah, um,

786
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.910
Dr Jameson: I have not personally, but I've

787
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:55.170
Dr Jameson: I first heard of it, actually, when I worked in an urgent care, years ago, and the, the nurse who was also a for a paramedic and

788
01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:05.910
Dr Jameson: she'd had it done after some bad seeing that she'd been to, and then the radiology tech had witnessed a really bad car accident and she'd had it done and they were telling me about it and

789
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:14.430
Dr Jameson: How active and yeah they both were telling me how how well it worked and and I was like, Oh my God, it sounds like such a hokey thing but

790
01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:29.880
Dr Jameson: They both of them and had it and it had worked and I'm one of my patients currently in one of my groups has been undergoing that therapy locally. So it does sound like it's quite effective for whatever whatever you may know more about it than I do.

791
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:40.920
iPad: Well, the research material sounds very promising on it because, I mean, it affects all the nerves goes through your, you know, your retina. You know what I'm talking about my

792
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:41.640
My browser.

793
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:44.400
iPad: Gets into your neurons and then it

794
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.170
iPad: Works to rewire

795
01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.910
Dr Jameson: Yeah, the hippocampus, which is

796
01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:51.210
Dr Jameson: Man, that where you hold all your emotions and yeah memories.

797
01:18:51.840 --> 01:19:01.350
Dr Jameson: But the way that they make these colleagues of mine explained it was that they it, it sort of re catalogues your memory. So instead of your memory being mixed in with the emotional

798
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:09.330
Dr Jameson: Trigger, you know, content that that it is currently and you still can remember it, but it, it no longer is associated with those

799
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:10.380
iPad: Emotions

800
01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:10.800
Kind of

801
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.720
iPad: Like that. So that's good research girl doesn't put it like that.

802
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.940
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And maybe that's not right.

803
01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.920
Dr Jameson: But that's what that's what the people that

804
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:20.700
iPad: Had done

805
01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:23.430
Dr Jameson: Told me so I don't know, um,

806
01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:36.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we'll, we'll pick up tomorrow, we can talk more about background medical stuff. Hopefully I'll have more laps to look at and possibly the hospital information and then

807
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:43.560
Dr Jameson: How long ago was that dialogue. Did Pete PCA pump malfunction.

808
01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:49.110
iPad: Oh, that was April, May of last year.

809
01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:50.640
Okay.

810
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.970
Dr Jameson: Any other overdoses. Yeah.

811
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.350
Dr Jameson: Any other overdoses.

812
01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:58.620
iPad: Besides that, which is time when I was in the hospital.

813
01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:01.500
iPad: This time now Stanford.

814
01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:03.810
Okay.

815
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:08.550
Dr Jameson: You overdose again.

816
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:18.750
iPad: Yeah, they said it was like a buildup of yeah I mean we looked at the pills. When I came home and I handed them to my husband, and it was almost a full jar.

817
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.450
Dr Jameson: Did you have you resuscitate it like

818
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:25.080
iPad: Where you're not breathing. They use Narcan it worked a

819
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:31.800
iPad: Little bit. But I have bruises on my chest because I wasn't breathing in there. I was foaming at the mouth, I guess.

820
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.720
iPad: Yeah, well, my husband thought I was fine when he came home and then he went to sleep and

821
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.750
iPad: I mean not fine just

822
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:54.690
iPad: I wasn't like enough. I think so. Yeah. So, once he woke up and saw I was foaming at the mouth. He called 911 they came in took me out so

823
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:56.730
iPad: I don't remember that.

824
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:09.570
iPad: I'm not surprised. Thank goodness. Yeah, but I do have bruises on my chest. So I don't know if they'd be suspended or if that was a transportation thing. I couldn't tell you, and he wasn't in the van. So he doesn't know.

825
01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.440
Dr Jameson: Okay, I mean sounds a little

826
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:29.070
iPad: Is doing know at was a Stanford or dinner at Dominican they did give me the allotted and I was like I don't take a lot of don't give me dialogic so and that's last time I had it.

827
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:42.210
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, we'll pick back up tomorrow, I'll see you then. And then hopefully we'll be able to get the paperwork done to get the medication going today.

828
01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:47.310
iPad: I always get all those labs that we sent yesterday and then again.

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:28.470
iPad: Have you lose a little Southern kind of toggle your screen, it should say

01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:29.370
Dr Jameson: Leave meeting.

845
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:35.220
iPad: And renders yeah the other ones in the house. I was like, wait a second. Okay. I feel like I'm hanging up on you. I am

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.950

Dr Jameson: Hello.

848
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:45.630
iPhone: Hello.

849
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.750
Dr Jameson: Hi, my name sector Jameson. Can you hear me okay

850
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.530
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay. Um, how do you say your name.

01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:55.800
iPhone: I prefer to go by Libya, if that's easier for you.

852
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.390
iPhone: Libby. Yeah.

853
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.560
Dr Jameson: Okay, yeah, that's fine. I because I don't want to say it wrong. So

854
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:03.870
iPhone: So,

855
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:05.700
Dr Jameson: Yes, cold calling in. Right.

856
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:06.450
Yeah.

857
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:09.270
iPhone: Okay.

858
01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:13.080
Dr Jameson: And then if you could actually confirm your birth date also

859
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.300
iPhone: June 20 1996

860
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.710
Dr Jameson: And you're in California.

861
01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:18.030
iPhone: Okay.

862
01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:25.020
Dr Jameson: So I don't honestly know if we'll be able to get through everything because I have a group that starts at 130

863
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:33.270
Dr Jameson: So, but we can at least get as far as we can. And maybe pick up again tomorrow if if we have to, but I'll

864
01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.970
Dr Jameson: I'll try to I'll see what we can do. I'll try. I'll

865
01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:37.800
iPhone: Answer for us. Yeah.

866
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.210
Dr Jameson: Um, so, well, first of all, have you been on Suboxone before

867
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:46.800
iPhone: No, I've been on and off opiates for like 10 years

868
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:49.860
iPhone: And I've never been able to like stay off of them.

869
01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:55.560
iPhone: And I'm like, I had a couple of years shrieks and stuff like that. But this last

870
01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:03.000
iPhone: This last time when I relapsed away and pretty heavy where I was taking upwards of like 300 to 500 milligrams of morphine, a day.

871
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.010
iPhone: And

872
01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.340
iPhone: So obviously the withdrawals are really bad.

873
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.940
iPhone: And I can't do it myself this time so

874
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.340
iPhone: I reached out for help.

875
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:19.800
Dr Jameson: Sure. So, um, you're taking pills or and how are you taking them.

876
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:21.600
iPhone: I was just taking notes just

877
01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:26.130
Dr Jameson: And just like the old fashioned swallow it with water kind of way.

878
01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.110
iPhone: Okay, nothing, nothing.

879
01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.680
Dr Jameson: And then have you stopped completely, are you, what have you been, what have you done so far.

880
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.930
iPhone: And a couple of days now.

881
01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.850
iPhone: And are we using when I start withdrawing

882
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:45.810
Dr Jameson: So you kind of were taping tapering a little bit yourself anyway.

883
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:47.730
iPhone: Yeah, I was trying. I did. Okay.

884
01:24:48.090 --> 01:24:56.130
Dr Jameson: So tell me, I know I can probably imagine, but tell me some of the symptoms that that are most troubling with with the other, which are often

885
01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:04.020
iPhone: The ones that have the hardest time with is like the tremors and I got, like, kind of like restless leg syndrome pretty bad.

886
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.920
iPhone: I'm a waitress, so I can't really like be shaking

887
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:10.710
iPhone: And the tables and then

888
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.120
iPhone: I sweat really bad. I get super nauseous.

889
01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:22.290
iPhone: And then like kind of like a, like you're supposed to be like lethargic, but I can't sleep.

890
01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:26.700
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay. Hot and cold to just

891
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.260
iPhone: Yeah yeah yeah

892
01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.450
Dr Jameson: OK, so the pretty standard sadly miserable.

893
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:41.700
Dr Jameson: Combination there. Okay, so. And have you ever. A lot of times people have tried Suboxone on their own and never, never had it. Okay.

894
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:47.610
Dr Jameson: Tell me what you know about it. So I don't go on and on about stuff that you already know.

895
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.560
iPhone: I've actually researched it

896
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:50.400
iPhone: A lot

897
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.260
iPhone: Out of this point.

898
01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.560
iPhone: That I wanted to look you're making the right choice A methadone or Suboxone and I think Suboxone is a better choice of the two

899
01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:04.110
iPhone: And I do know how people who have taken it and been very successful.

900
01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.640
iPhone: With it, and much higher success rates when people I know with methadone. Um so yeah yeah

901
01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:24.300
Dr Jameson: So, so you understand that it basically replaces opiates in your in your receptors of your brain and in the process of doing that. It blocks. Other opiates from being

902
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:32.490
Dr Jameson: Able to get in there. So first of all, that sort of satisfies the physical craving II stuff anyway.

903
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:45.180
Dr Jameson: But it also decreases your desire to use. And if you did take a morphine on top of it, you generally people say they don't, nothing happens.

904
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.160
iPhone: I would like that.

905
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:50.820
Dr Jameson: So it has a much

906
01:26:52.740 --> 01:27:01.320
Dr Jameson: It has a very long half life, meaning it takes. It's a you take it, you get a level in your system. And then I said, gradual drop

907
01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:01.920
iPhone: Your time

908
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:08.520
Dr Jameson: Ever days as opposed to morphine and Oxycodone and other things that people take which

909
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:13.440
Dr Jameson: Well, some of them have long half life like fentanyl has a long half life but

910
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:26.190
Dr Jameson: A lot of those other ones are much shorter. So hours, you know, you take you, which you probably know Allah you use it. And then so many hours later, you're, you're not feeling well again. So this is a much smoother kind of

911
01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:35.790
Dr Jameson: Experience. People say, and then it does not cause, the cause some side effects like constipation sometimes and

912
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:50.610
Dr Jameson: Some sexual side effects. And people sometimes still feel sleepy or but to a far less lower degree, I guess. And then the other opiates. It does not cause respiratory depression. So it's very, it's much safer.

913
01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:52.920
Dr Jameson: And

914
01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:03.420
Dr Jameson: It doesn't really so methadone, people will get some euphoria from still so there's sometimes still a little bit of a high

915
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.430
iPhone: With methadone methadone also has some

916
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:14.220
Dr Jameson: Yeah, some toxic metabolites and you can if you take too much methadone, you can definitely kill yourself so

917
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:23.370
Dr Jameson: That's, yeah. And it it it makes it like if you still use while you're taking methadone, you still get a hot. You know, it doesn't it doesn't

918
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:26.910
Dr Jameson: Block in quite the same way.

919
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:27.600
iPhone: I guess.

920
01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:35.070
Dr Jameson: It's obviously more convenient. You don't have to go to a methadone clinic every day, which is, you know, a

921
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:38.880
Dr Jameson: Big drag after about 1010 that you know that doesn't

922
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:41.070
iPhone: I also live super far away.

923
01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.930
iPhone: Yeah, every quick like I live like on the edge of the Bay Area, you know. Yeah.

924
01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.200
iPhone: Everywhere in the Bay Area. Right.

925
01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.190
Dr Jameson: So yeah, so that's not easy, especially in that area commuting is

926
01:28:54.690 --> 01:29:11.730
Dr Jameson: Not great. And then some people say that you know not everyone that's in a methadone program is really motivated to be sober and there can be some interesting things happening in the waiting room or in the parking lot outside after anyway. Yeah, so you know congregating with

927
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:16.770
Dr Jameson: With a group of people that may or may not all be super, super supportive

928
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:31.410
Dr Jameson: So yeah, so I think this definitely has a lot of them. I think it's a generally. Now, some people are taking fentanyl or heroin and they have such high level Suboxone sometimes it's a hard transition

929
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:43.980
Dr Jameson: Straight from fentanyl in your case even taking pharmaceutical medications you know exactly what it is, but it is which is helpful, because we don't have to worry about the contamination that's happening so much

930
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:56.130
Dr Jameson: But sometimes people have a rough a rough start going from one to the other and sometimes methadone is a good like middle kind of stabilizer and then and then sometimes we transition

931
01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:07.320
Dr Jameson: And that which you probably have researched is is referring to the potential for precipitated withdrawal. Are you familiar with that. Oh.

932
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:11.280
iPhone: Yeah, the withdrawals from Suboxone I pretty from both are pretty terrible.

933
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:17.430
Dr Jameson: Well, the withdrawal from Suboxone is similar to the withdrawal from any opiate it's just it's

934
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:19.950
Dr Jameson: A little slower to start and

935
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:33.180
Dr Jameson: Generally, we're only stopping that if there's some very extenuating circumstance, like we found out that you're selling your pills or your, you know, suddenly incarcerated or something.

936
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.760
Dr Jameson: But otherwise, we tend to if we stop it at all, which is kind of an area of debate, but

937
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.320
iPhone: We

938
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:46.590
Dr Jameson: Gradually gradually gradually gradually taper like by tiny amounts over slow like very long periods of time.

939
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:54.330
Dr Jameson: The precipitated withdrawal is a different that's more about starting Suboxone

940
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:55.380
iPhone: Okay.

941
01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:01.230
Dr Jameson: The magic of this, the box on the buprenorphine is the ingredient. And that is, is a very strong

942
01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:11.010
Dr Jameson: We call it, we have an affinity, but it, it binds to the receptor in an extremely strong way like once it's in there. You can't get it out.

943
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:26.670
Dr Jameson: And it also displaces it's stronger than other opiates. So it actually pushes other ones out. So if you recently used and the levels are still

944
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:28.770
Dr Jameson: Fairly high

945
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:39.090
Dr Jameson: Which may not be anyway. The buprenorphine comes in and then pushes all that out and you suddenly go from here to here and you actually have a

946
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:59.010
Dr Jameson: Bad with like even more sudden and severe withdrawal until things kind of stabilized again, or the buprenorphine starts to wear off. So that is the big really the biggest potential like hiccup with with spots on the solution is to make sure you're feeling

947
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:05.610
Dr Jameson: as sick as you can stand to feel before you start your first dose. So usually

948
01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:13.110
Dr Jameson: It sounds like you're you're getting there anyway. By the time we can organize the prescription and if there's a prior off and all that stuff.

949
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:23.940
Dr Jameson: If it's been 24 hours since you last took anything. Usually it's not a problem. And people just feel better within half an hour to an hour of taking the first dose.

950
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:27.000
iPhone: 48 hour mark ish

951
01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:27.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

952
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:44.100
Dr Jameson: It doesn't seem like it's going to be a problem sometimes again like people that are using stuff from the street think it's heroin. It's really fentanyl and the levels are just so high that you start, you feel sick, but you're really still it's still there.

953
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:47.460
Dr Jameson: So sometimes we get we get surprised, but

954
01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:58.620
Dr Jameson: So just to be on the safe side we we generally start the first dose kind of a half dose and then sort of see, make sure it's not making you feel worse.

955
01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:12.780
Dr Jameson: And then if you're not all but if you're not feeling completely better after an hour, you can take the other half. So, we usually kind of start just, just a little bit under what we think you're going to need to be just to be safe.

956
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:20.730
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that I think it sounds like you have a pretty good understanding. Let me back up just

957
01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.190
iPhone: A minute. We're doing good with time. So,

958
01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:26.970
Dr Jameson: Are you allergic to any medication. No.

959
01:33:27.690 --> 01:33:32.850
iPhone: I have a sensitivity to ibuprofen. It just makes me nauseous. That's about it.

960
01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:35.160
Dr Jameson: And then are you prescribed any

961
01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:38.340
iPhone: Are you taking any other medications by me. Not currently.

962
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.370
Dr Jameson: Birth control.

963
01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:43.110
iPhone: I have an ID.

964
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:48.270
Dr Jameson: And, um,

965
01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.400
Dr Jameson: Any medical

966
01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:51.480
Problems.

967
01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:53.280
iPhone: No.

968
01:33:54.090 --> 01:33:56.130
Dr Jameson: Is it a marina or a skylight. You know,

969
01:33:56.670 --> 01:33:57.210
The Marina

970
01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:03.000
Kind of a medication.

971
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:08.340
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

972
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.620
Dr Jameson: Are you a smoker.

973
01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:14.100
iPhone: Yes, cigarettes.

974
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:17.580
Dr Jameson: You're right. I should have been more so.

975
01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.440
iPhone: I asked that question.

976
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:20.280
Dr Jameson: Thank you.

977
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:21.930
iPhone: I always like to be specific answer.

978
01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:22.500
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

979
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.430
Dr Jameson: How much yeah how I see smoke.

980
01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:29.580
iPhone: Lately, a lot

981
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:33.360
iPhone: Like like more than a pack a day.

982
01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, just be

983
01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:39.450
iPhone: Stressed trying to look at all, sir.

984
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.280
Dr Jameson: And how about alcohol. Oh.

985
01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:43.410
No.

986
01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:47.220
iPhone: Okay, so

987
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.410
Dr Jameson: Like New Year's Eve and a wedding.

988
01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.600
iPhone: Rare. Yeah. That kind of rare and even that it's like a glass of champagne midnight.

989
01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.160
And then

990
01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:06.720
Dr Jameson: Are you in school or working or be so you said your server.

991
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.680
Yeah.

992
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.750
Dr Jameson: How much

993
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.830
Did you finish.

994
01:35:12.150 --> 01:35:15.570
iPhone: I dropped out of community college after

995
01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.020
Okay, so you graduated high school

996
01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:21.960
Dr Jameson: few semesters.

997
01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.800
iPhone: Of college

998
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.100
Dr Jameson: And any, who do you live with.

999
01:35:26.730 --> 01:35:27.390
iPhone: My mom and dad.

1000
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.900
Dr Jameson: Are you in a relationship.

1001
01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:39.360
And not let me do it, obviously.

1002
01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.160
Dr Jameson: Sorry you broke out. So again,

1003
01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:47.190
iPhone: I said, because I can't, like, get my

1004
01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:51.180
iPhone: Stay standing. I don't know. Sorry.

1005
01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:56.880
Dr Jameson: So how long, how long is your relationship. Is it new or long standing or

1006
01:35:59.370 --> 01:36:02.490
iPhone: Six months. It's time we broke up a few years ago.

1007
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:06.180
iPhone: When I was using very heavily

1008
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:15.000
iPhone: Because he doesn't use or anything like that. And I was like having a really hard time and I didn't like tell him anything you're stuck with him out of nowhere.

1009
01:36:16.050 --> 01:36:16.380
iPhone: Okay.

1010
01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.320
Dr Jameson: And so he's not, he's not using

1011
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:24.030
iPhone: At all. Okay, that's good. It is

1012
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:26.820
Dr Jameson: It's harder to quit when you're

1013
01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.220
iPhone: Yeah.

1014
01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:33.780
Dr Jameson: Um, any other medic any other drug use in the past.

1015
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.200
iPhone: Nope, it's always just been opiate. Yes. Okay.

1016
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.000
Dr Jameson: How did that come about.

1017
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.170
iPhone: Well, it's to be honest, it started with my dad had 10 strokes at one time and

1018
01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:50.490
iPhone: He had a brain surgery. And they were just like purpose everywhere.

1019
01:36:51.510 --> 01:37:01.290
iPhone: Because he was taking on such high levels of that. So I started stealing them at that point and then I sort of buying them later on. I still kind of graduated through the pills.

1020
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:04.680
Dr Jameson: So what what was, how old are you,

1021
01:37:06.690 --> 01:37:08.760
iPhone: 1514

1022
01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:10.080
iPhone: Okay.

1023
01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:13.710
Dr Jameson: And then what was the, what was the appeal.

1024
01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:18.630
iPhone: Um, I kind of wanted to feel less

1025
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.730
iPhone: Because there's a lot of a lot of things to be felt during that time, you know,

1026
01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:25.800
iPhone: And

1027
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.510
iPhone: It's kind of just like turned into, like, kind of like a coping mechanism for me.

1028
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.630
Dr Jameson: Generally that's

1029
01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:40.530
Dr Jameson: Being. Yeah. Yeah. No, no you and you and most people. And that's, that's why I'm asking because my

1030
01:37:41.850 --> 01:37:49.740
Dr Jameson: My approach to this we can we can replace the chemical we can sort we can solve that fairly easily with medication, but

1031
01:37:50.760 --> 01:38:04.920
Dr Jameson: Fixing the bigger picture of relearning coping third and learning new coping skills are managing sometimes there's on traumas and things that have really never been dealt with. Because we were numbing ourselves to not think about them.

1032
01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.840
iPhone: Straight up, getting clean. I think I'm ready for it.

1033
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:11.430
Well,

1034
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:29.250
Dr Jameson: I give you a lot of credit. That's an and we don't like ram it down your throat. I mean, you meet with a counselor and gradually as you feel comfortable go, you know, start peeling layers to to get to the, you know, central, central things, but it's not like it's going to be

1035
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:32.820
Dr Jameson: Some sort of lock you in a room and that

1036
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.900
Dr Jameson: Is your dad still living.

1037
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:41.340
iPhone: Yes, surprisingly, that's very good.

1038
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:53.850
Dr Jameson: And then to see have any anybody in a family in him, or anybody else have any substance use triples.

1039
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.200
iPhone: No.

1040
01:38:59.340 --> 01:38:59.910
Dr Jameson: Alcohol you

1041
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:09.090
iPhone: Know, most of my family lives in Ireland, so I honestly don't know them, or like anything about them. Okay, so, um, I can't really answer that one.

1042
01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:09.600
iPhone: Okay.

1043
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.180
Dr Jameson: As far as, you know, and the household. You grew up in there wasn't no okay and

1044
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:18.660
iPhone: Also walked up to like, and again, safe, where I don't have

1045
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.190
Dr Jameson: Well,

1046
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.500
Dr Jameson: So they're aware now I take it.

1047
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.080
iPhone: Yes, my mom. Yeah.

1048
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:28.050
Dr Jameson: Have you had any surgeries.

1049
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:28.800
Nope.

1050
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:31.410
Dr Jameson: And

1051
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.430
Gosh, I've done this in a while. There's a little

1052
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.730
Dr Jameson: There we go. And then we already talked about medical problems that aren't any.

1053
01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.290
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

1054
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.480
Dr Jameson: How tall are you,

1055
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.070
iPhone: Guys.

1056
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:55.260
Dr Jameson: Do you know how much you weigh about

1057
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.570
iPhone: About 125 pounds.

1058
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:01.770
Good.

1059
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.590
Okay.

1060
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.490
Dr Jameson: And

1061
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.780
Dr Jameson: I think that

1062
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:21.150
Dr Jameson: Will be good. So they explained, you're going to get some blood work and well lab work done. There's blood and urine.

1063
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:23.610
iPhone: I didn't know that. Okay.

1064
01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:34.230
Dr Jameson: Okay. Usually that's already been okay so yeah we just do an initial set of like blood count liver tests sort of just basic

1065
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:41.310
Dr Jameson: blood work we screen people that won't really probably be relevant in your face, but since we do have happened to have

1066
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:53.250
Dr Jameson: You know, a higher percentage of patients that have been injecting themselves we screen rapid Titus and HIV and syphilis and that kind of stuff. And then we do a urine talk screen which we expect to be

1067
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:54.480
iPhone: You already

1068
01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:59.070
Dr Jameson: Have some things in there, but it's it's more of a just a baseline.

1069
01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.520
Dr Jameson: So, you know, whatever. It shows it shows it's okay.

1070
01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:11.940
Dr Jameson: They usually set that up with a quest in your area. I'll I guess I'll direct you back to who will be been talking with

1071
01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:15.150
iPhone: Me talking to RJ okay

1072
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.380
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1073
01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:26.340
iPhone: So I will be honest, I took a pot brownie, like, a week ago forgot about that. That's what I forgot about

1074
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:33.300
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, so I'll just have you get back in touch with her and just say, question mark labs.

1075
01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.330
Dr Jameson: Like, what's the point and then

1076
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:44.850
Dr Jameson: I don't know how much they explained, usually people that haven't really gotten much information about this like the structure of how our program works beyond today.

1077
01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:57.750
Dr Jameson: So you obviously we have this initial meeting, like on the medical side will schedule at some point have an initial sort of same thing assessment with a with a counselor.

1078
01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:07.770
Dr Jameson: And then they'll make a recommendation about how often to me going forward individually, it might be every week, every other week or something like that. But, um,

1079
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:16.530
Dr Jameson: They'll take care of that side and then you and I will see each other. Typically weekly in a we might do an extra one between now and then, but

1080
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.090
iPhone: If

1081
01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.640
Dr Jameson: We do groups. So it's like a support group.

1082
01:42:20.670 --> 01:42:21.570
Dr Jameson: Recovery.

1083
01:42:21.630 --> 01:42:31.440
Dr Jameson: Discussion type thing. There's a different counselor usually there and then myself. And so it's a kind of a combination med check refill.

1084
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:49.920
Dr Jameson: Thing, and then the majority of the of the hour is spent talking about triggers or sleep or, I don't know, you know, different subjects for different different weeks and the counselor generally kind of runs that the most of

1085
01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:53.400
Dr Jameson: Its meant, and I think

1086
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:58.620
Dr Jameson: It seems like people find it encouragement you know it's an encouragement and the support and

1087
01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:09.420
Dr Jameson: You know what what what what's going on. How can we help. How's it going, you know, sort of, that kind of thing. So those

1088
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:11.700
Dr Jameson: Groups, I have

1089
01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.200
Dr Jameson: You work.

1090
01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:14.970
Dr Jameson: Evenings probably wouldn't, what's yours.

1091
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.930
iPhone: Yeah yeah

1092
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:19.770
Dr Jameson: So, um, how early do you usually wake up.

1093
01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:24.930
iPhone: Right now my sleep is kind of like erratic.

1094
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:30.810
iPhone: There's some days where like I don't sleep at all. And then other days where I will sleep until like 2pm

1095
01:43:33.570 --> 01:43:37.170
iPhone: But the reason I have to be awake. I like okay

1096
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:41.340
Dr Jameson: Well, like is 1032 early in the morning.

1097
01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.130
iPhone: And then you could probably work and astronaut give

1098
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:46.800
Dr Jameson: Me. The other option is noon. That'd be better.

1099
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:47.880
iPhone: No one works better.

1100
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:51.990
iPhone: Alright Lindy

1101
01:43:54.570 --> 01:43:59.220
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll pin to you. So that's on Wednesdays. Is that OK.

1102
01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:16.830
Dr Jameson: OK, so that you'll have a weekly group every Wednesday. And we asked people to start checking in half an hour before the group. So like if you think 1130 then you know you know by the time everyone gets checked in and sorted out. Then we started around noon.

1103
01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.160
Dr Jameson: The

1104
01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:26.490
Dr Jameson: Only requirements for group are that you have some sort of your phone, your

1105
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:39.330
Dr Jameson: airboat or something for privacy. So if somebody else's your, your mom's walking by in the background, somebody who's sharing something about their whatever doesn't accidentally share that with somebody, not in the group.

1106
01:44:40.770 --> 01:44:50.190
Dr Jameson: And then we asked people not to smoke during group. Some people are either recently quit or ARE TRYING TO SO WASHING somebody smoking doesn't isn't

1107
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.450
Dr Jameson: So that's, that's the rationale for that.

1108
01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.450
Dr Jameson: We are

1109
01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.270
Dr Jameson: Is pretty

1110
01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:11.370
Dr Jameson: Flexible. I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is, for the first few weeks if you're just mostly listening and not saying much that's nobody's going to force you to answer a question if you just

1111
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:14.850
Dr Jameson: I don't have anything to say about that, or I'm not sure, or

1112
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:21.630
Dr Jameson: You ask me another time, you know, you're perfectly. Welcome to sort of path for a while. The only

1113
01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:31.050
Dr Jameson: The only thing I think we we kind of ask people to to answer, which I'm telling you now so you have time to think about it, but hopefully it's not a hard question but

1114
01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:43.290
Dr Jameson: We usually finish each group with a going around the room and saying something we're grateful for. So hopefully that's not too difficult to to manage

1115
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:44.070
iPhone: For the first

1116
01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:44.910
iPhone: Week anyway.

1117
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.300
Dr Jameson: But just for your so you're not completely cut off.

1118
01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:53.010
Dr Jameson: And the counselor that runs that group is named john

1119
01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:54.480
So,

1120
01:45:55.740 --> 01:46:10.230
Dr Jameson: That will be the kind of going forward, you'll have a weekly group and then I don't know what the counseling schedule will be like, but they'll figure that out. So that'll be basically your, your schedule we do monthly drug screens, which

1121
01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:14.820
Dr Jameson: You know this initial one counts is your first one. So then you won't have to do one for another month

1122
01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:15.960
iPhone: But we'll

1123
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:26.520
Dr Jameson: We'll explain more about that as time goes on, but you'll have a monthly drug screen and they send you surveys every week. They're really into data and

1124
01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:30.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and it'll analytics and

1125
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:39.600
Dr Jameson: Stuff. So there's you get them by email, you can if you fill them out when you get the email, then by the time you get to check in. It's done. Checking can take a long

1126
01:46:39.630 --> 01:46:44.310
Dr Jameson: Time because a lot of people haven't filled out their survey. So then they have to go fill out the survey so

1127
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:46.440
iPhone: Like a, like a

1128
01:46:47.010 --> 01:46:47.910
Um,

1129
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:50.490
Dr Jameson: They are big.

1130
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:56.280
Dr Jameson: It's like, how many times did you use this week, how much alcohol.

1131
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.510
iPhone: Smoking and then

1132
01:46:57.810 --> 01:47:06.990
Dr Jameson: They asked you a variety of, like, Are you having, you know, fights with family member, like what's going on in your life. Basically, what are the factors that would make it more likely you would

1133
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:14.700
Dr Jameson: Relapse compared to protective they they called risk and protective factors, but I don't know the name of the exact survey. I think it's

1134
01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:28.710
Dr Jameson: Bam brief addiction monitor or something like that, I think. Anyway, I think it takes 10 or 15 minutes to go through. So you'll, you'll be see you should be seeing email about that once a week.

1135
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.110
Dr Jameson: And then

1136
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:36.750
Dr Jameson: I think that's the mean, those are the biggest sort of

1137
01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:44.160
Dr Jameson: That's all I can think of as a pretty much what we require. I will say, people are sometimes

1138
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:45.930
Dr Jameson: Fearful

1139
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.110
Dr Jameson: We're not a punitive like some programs if you if you have a

1140
01:47:53.370 --> 01:48:03.060
Dr Jameson: Unexpected drug screen results. You're dismissed. We don't generally do that unless we find that you're not taking them up morphine and

1141
01:48:03.450 --> 01:48:16.620
Dr Jameson: Taking other things because that implies you're selling it or something that we don't want you to do. So that's the biggest thing or you would be potentially discharged about if there's any sort of indication that you're diverting as we say.

1142
01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:34.890
Dr Jameson: And then, for me, it's more about. Okay. Well, what happened. Let's talk about it. Let's be honest and open about it and then let's figure out what what we're working on, basically. So just so you're not to say I'm encouraging anything but don't don't

1143
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:40.170
Dr Jameson: I guess you'll get get a sense of that as we go forward, but it's really more about

1144
01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:45.090
Dr Jameson: Moving forward and personal growth and and and it's a journey so

1145
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:52.620
Dr Jameson: As you have already learned it's it's generally like this. It's not a straight line.

1146
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:54.270
Dr Jameson: Straight up usually so

1147
01:48:55.830 --> 01:49:04.080
Dr Jameson: There's that's not necessarily an expectation that we have, although it's great if it does happen, and you've already done some of this. So,

1148
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:05.280
iPhone: Hopefully we're

1149
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:12.120
Dr Jameson: Getting to that next point. So, do you know how that how to take the medicine and with the dissolving in the mouth and all this.

1150
01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:15.930
iPhone: Yeah, my ex boyfriend used to take it. Okay.

1151
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:21.300
Dr Jameson: So, um, let me see what we have for your pharmacy.

1152
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:27.990
iPhone: And I can go to class today to as long as I

1153
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:29.940
iPhone: Have to send them the

1154
01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:33.360
Dr Jameson: Order. So it says there's a Walmart pharmacy. Is that what you're using

1155
01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.320
Yeah.

1156
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.990
Dr Jameson: Okay, um,

1157
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:45.180
Dr Jameson: There's tablets and films. Some people seem to prefer the taste of one or not the other. I don't know. Do

1158
01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:49.260
iPhone: I don't have a preference right now have a preference. I'll let you know.

1159
01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:49.770
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1160
01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.800
Dr Jameson: So we'll start with the films. I think they're

1161
01:49:53.910 --> 01:50:02.550
Dr Jameson: People complain sometimes about the tablets being kinda bulky. So, but then some people complain about the film, they don't like the taste. So I don't know. Well, we'll start with

1162
01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:06.300
Dr Jameson: The film and what I'm gonna

1163
01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:15.570
Dr Jameson: Do so. Most recently, like two weeks ago. How much are you taking in a day.

1164
01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:18.450
iPhone: 500 milligrams. Okay.

1165
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:22.680
Dr Jameson: And then you come come down to button.

1166
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:24.060
iPhone: It's about 300

1167
01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:25.920
Dr Jameson: So I think we

1168
01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:27.930
Dr Jameson: We

1169
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:40.860
Dr Jameson: Were I worked before. We just always started everybody on the 16 like eight Nate and we didn't do this gradual build up thing, and sometimes I still do that.

1170
01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:55.320
Dr Jameson: I sometimes I do like to do the build up thing. But I think, in your case, I think there's little chance that that less than eight, I think it's going to sort of satisfy your, your receptors right now anyway.

1171
01:50:55.770 --> 01:50:56.400
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

1172
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:03.840
Dr Jameson: It's all right. It's it is what it is. Um, so let's just start with eight

1173
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:05.640
Dr Jameson: And

1174
01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:16.320
Dr Jameson: You know, the, the drug is designed to be a once a day medication like take it in the morning or whatever. What at one time, one time a day.

1175
01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:19.740
Dr Jameson: Very few of our patients.

1176
01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:32.460
Dr Jameson: Feel comfortable doing that they seem to like to split the dose. So I don't know if that's just residual addict behavior to be, frankly,

1177
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.340
Dr Jameson: Does it seems like going too long without taking something

1178
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:41.970
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so I just write it twice a day because that's kind of how everybody likes to take it.

1179
01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:48.000
Dr Jameson: Anyway, but you could just take it once a day if you wanted to.

1180
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:54.210
Dr Jameson: take both of them together. I wouldn't at the beginning, though I think splitting it for now is probably better. Okay.

1181
01:51:55.410 --> 01:51:57.150
Dr Jameson: So I'll send a prescription

1182
01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.070
Dr Jameson: And then hopefully we can get the labs done in the next day or two.

1183
01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:11.190
iPhone: Yeah, so if I can't do it today. I can definitely do it tomorrow. Okay. Yeah.

1184
01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:11.970
Dr Jameson: And then

1185
01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:18.810
Dr Jameson: I have availability on Monday.

1186
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:36.390
Dr Jameson: If we if we want. If you feel like you want to touch base before the actual group just since it's brand new. It's I sometimes like to do that just to give you a little bit of one on one time to talk about details of doses and stuff like that.

1187
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.340
iPhone: Okay, so

1188
01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:48.840
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then sometimes we also use like nausea medicine and other other medications for some of the symptoms is that sound.

1189
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:54.630
iPhone: For nasza would definitely okay

1190
01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:56.190
iPhone: Yes.

1191
01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:00.330
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I'll send some know Fran. Have you taken that before.

1192
01:53:01.050 --> 01:53:03.570
Dr Jameson: Yes. Another thing that dissolves under your tongue.

1193
01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll send

1194
01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.250
That

1195
01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:13.830
Okay.

1196
01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:22.170
Dr Jameson: And then hopefully the rest of your symptoms will be improving as we get this going.

1197
01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:33.180
Dr Jameson: Well, I sent the prescription just now. If your insurance which they often do has a prior off.

1198
01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.350
Dr Jameson: To be filled out then that can slow things down slightly.

1199
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:46.500
Dr Jameson: Occasionally the pharmacy is doesn't have it in stock or something and they have to order it. That's for this dose, not that common.

1200
01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.650
Dr Jameson: Every so often we see that

1201
01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:59.550
Dr Jameson: So those you know those could be potentially limitation. Sometimes the pharmacy, has there.

1202
01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:11.520
Dr Jameson: They are, they're not taking any more patients because they get a certain amount of months of the medication and they need to make sure they're going to have enough for everybody that they take. So sometimes they won't take anybody know sometimes we have to try a different pharmacy.

1203
01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:15.330
Dr Jameson: Not so bad in California, but sometimes the pharmacists.

1204
01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:21.600
Dr Jameson: Are like, wait, telemedicine what and then they don't feel comfortable with dispensing so

1205
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:29.730
Dr Jameson: I'm going to send a note to Jake to RJ and I guess or Jamie is another person that is like a care coordinator, they say.

1206
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:34.740
Dr Jameson: About finding a time for you on Monday. Again,

1207

1228
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:11.850
Dr Jameson: I think I'm running out of time to dictates because I have to be in group in a minute. So I will

1229
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:17.070
Sign on a little bit later to do the dictation for these two patients.

1230
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.620
Dr Jameson: They're both opioid use disorder, obviously. So, at least we can

1231
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:25.230
Dr Jameson: And physicals are normal and

1232
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:34.080
You can detail the review of systems that that we did discuss, but I will, I will fill in the blanks.

1233
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.780
Dr Jameson: At a later time. Maybe at the end of one of my groups here. If I have time. Okay, bye.
