5
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.490
Danny Couser: I didn't even know what the heck a narcissist was until she said I was, I kind of looked into

6
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.330
Danny Couser: That said, but I was reading some stuff online. It's like, it's totally fair to it.

7
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.580
It's her

8
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:36.390
Danny Couser: Yeah, it's like it's explained to her like the most like DETAIL, DETAIL possible way. But you know, it's not just one thing that I raised, like, you know,

9
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.260

13
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270
Danny Couser: I can talk for hours about this, but

14
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.070
Danny Couser: This feels like maybe

15
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:36.120
Danny Couser: It's a makeup breakout game with her, but this time might be maybe the time. I don't know. Just don't if this feels like in a bad way.

16
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.440
Shawn Phalen: Have you been through this before.

17
00:02:42.570 --> 00:03:00.810
Danny Couser: Many times account, but I always just had to like Asher get over this morning because I know that will make it, you know, but the thing she's saying this time around, or like, you know, I mean, like, I don't know. But the fact is that texting.

18
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.940
Danny Couser: Really

19
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.640
Danny Couser: Screwed with my head because

20
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.920
He wants to be with her.

21
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.780
Danny Couser: Overall,

22
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.840
Danny Couser: freakin toxic. I mean her dad just passed two weeks ago and she's a tough girl put put that way. I've

23
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.740
Danny Couser: Seen her cheer up a handful of times

24
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.670
Danny Couser: She buries everything. Yeah.

25
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.920
Danny Couser: It's a delay kind of a this lashing out at me because of the dead passing, you know,

26
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.830
Danny Couser: Ever since that happened. It's literally like every single day over anything and everything. I mean, like,

27
00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.450
Danny Couser: Hey, I can. There's so many crazy thing that started the whole flight and day and I can't remember specific one to give example early

28
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.760
Danny Couser: Oh, she thought I was yelling at some girl while I was at work, saying, what's up on me. I guess I get dialed in, and didn't know it.

29
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.690
Danny Couser: And she sat there and listened for a few minutes and what I said is, what's that money to my supervisors.

30
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:34.500
Danny Couser: You know, and she's like, Oh yeah, for sure. You know, it's like you're really gonna lie right to my face. I'm like, I'm not like I swear I honestly shot. I've never in my life.

31
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:51.330
Danny Couser: dyslexic. Any girl I've ever stayed with it. And it's like, I've always been accused in it, though. I don't know why it's just because I wish I knew. So I changed it because it's the most frustrating thing in the world. And some of you won't believe for the life

32
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.590
Shawn Phalen: You know, sometimes it has nothing to do with you and everything to do

33
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.190
Danny Couser: With them.

34
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.110
Shawn Phalen: insecurities around

35
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.360
You know, being in a relationship, fear of being cheated on

36
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.670
You know, so if she is really a Narcissus Narcissus can be difficult to be with

37
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.210
Danny Couser: That never even shift.

38
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.700
Danny Couser: Had a pretty like crazy girlfriend. I graduated high school, you know, right after graduating

39
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.150
Danny Couser: With did that for like a year and a half, two years.

40
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.810
Danny Couser: But she's not even like

41
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.300
Danny Couser: 25% to my current girlfriend extra

42
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.460
Danny Couser: Sugar hundred percent

43
00:05:49.560 --> 00:06:01.530
Danny Couser: I choose your squad mean is Nancy just blow, blow type of like me. She is like always just saying that I gotta try making boundaries.

44
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:21.360
Danny Couser: You know, as a matter what unless you don't plan on ever talking to you. Do not say, you know, this or this or that, you know, Kennan once I said the very next night. That's the first thing she says, and she said it was that conviction and belief, you know, and

45
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.860
Danny Couser: And I like, I can't do much with that.

46
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.580
Danny Couser: But that's a good day.

47
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.020
Danny Couser: You say again, you broke up. I said, I'm stopped.

48
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.230
Danny Couser: Yeah.

49
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.000
Shawn Phalen: And

50
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.030
Shawn Phalen: Does she have a history of

51
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.810
Substance

52
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:14.760
Danny Couser: Neither i know i mean like you never did anything me, Steve smoke pot every now and again you know you know that she's also she's 45 I'm 32 to an age gap. You know, it's kind of big, but I mean, I don't know, just

53
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.310
Danny Couser: Either way,

54
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.170
Danny Couser: I feel like she uses that against me, because the things like freaking out because

55
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:43.710
Danny Couser: Because I didn't show her my bank statement because they could show my temporary card. Same with a different account or whatever. But I had like a week or my first paycheck and such like that. So every guy that that my ex.

56
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:57.690
Danny Couser: Like, what's wrong with you, like, but when you're like you're having a meltdown over that. Like, I can't show it to you deleted the transaction. What do you go out for lunch every day at work. I'm like, well,

57
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:09.240
Danny Couser: Like I have 30 minutes for lunch break. I barely lunch should go in the bathroom before 30 minutes. You know, it's like if you think I'm going all over Dublin and

58
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.520
Danny Couser: So,

59
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.910
Danny Couser: Random commission. I just like I don't even know they kept like what, what the hell.

60
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.050
Danny Couser: Most fires. That's the exact spot.

61
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:42.450
Danny Couser: And it's like, does that whole theatrical crap isn't there, sister, and it's like I said I could just go on and on about entrepreneurship. I don't know what to do because I'm so sick of this and I need to like overalls, and this is like

62
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.070
Shawn Phalen: Is this. Do you feel like this is jeopardizing

63
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.970
Your sobriety.

64
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:58.770
Danny Couser: I mean, honestly, like that's what my mom biggest concern is, but like i think if it was good to have already

65
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.590
Danny Couser: Done that last time ago like really like I don't know at all. It's not a good fit.

66
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:14.370
Danny Couser: Guy. Now when I go get high like screw this all the time. You know, it's like I say, I don't know, I feel like I'm kind of

67
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:25.140
Danny Couser: lucky that I really don't ever think of us are wanting to I got no slight I might just say I really don't like this about that is amazing.

68
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.940
Danny Couser: It's really amazing. It's not. It is

69
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.150
Danny Couser: So,

70
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.570
Danny Couser: It's a

71
00:09:47.580 --> 00:10:01.740
Danny Couser: SEC because you're not a person to realize she's got a real rock screwed up pastors got her own bag. Again, their own baggage like everybody but like I said, I just need the stability part and

72
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:13.950
Danny Couser: She'll admit to her wrong say sorry you know be great for like literally like three or four days. It's like a miracle. I swear to God, it's like

73
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.590
Day.

74
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.660
Danny Couser: Lynch right back at it again.

75
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.500
Shawn Phalen: Um, well, you know, Narcisse have a really hard time staying consistent

76
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:44.340
Danny Couser: And they have a really hard time apologize and NBA being accountable. And usually what they do is they push it all on the person that they're

77
00:10:44.850 --> 00:11:03.420
Danny Couser: Actually, exactly. It's like, and I mean I literally, I mean, she's like doubting myself, but I know hundred percent, no doubt, no that's BS and now you're gonna tell me why can't you just be normal. You always have to go screw everything up and just start something and I'm like, wait, what

78
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:14.130
Danny Couser: Yeah, and I and I'm just saying she always says that kind of stuff. Like when nobody else can hear. Nobody else know that, you know,

79
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:21.990
Danny Couser: But the, the actual crap of, like, oh yeah, just like you going out to lunch every day with your girls. That's why you won't show me your phone at what am I

80
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:34.650
Danny Couser: NEVER ASKED TO SEE MY PHONE, YOU KNOW, SHE IS painting this Picasso painting for whoever's close to here, it's, I mean she did public they gather day in front of the bank. You know, it's just like

81
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:53.970
Danny Couser: It's just like, because it's self paced. I was just like, literally just like puncture as possible and like leg. I'm like, Oh my God, we use like an interesting. Oh my god, you did a pilot. I don't trust it. She's like saying it in front of some guy. What do you want me to call me. I'm like,

82
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:09.480
Danny Couser: I'm like Nikki please wait to knock dish. This is not fun. It's not like you're taking it too far. And it's just like stone wall no getting through to her, like, it's good to see

83
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.780
Danny Couser: You later say no. Totally leveling with whatsoever.

84
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:21.450
Shawn Phalen: So I think you need to really think about

85
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.440
What it is.

86
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.990
Danny Couser: Seeing her and I think you have to really start to

87
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.790
Danny Couser: Evaluate maybe reevaluating

88
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.990
Danny Couser: I'm doing over and over again.

89
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:57.900
Danny Couser: For some stupid, stupid reason I just, I don't know. It just had no idea. Except, like I said, it sounds stupid but like when it's good. It's like phenomenal. But like I said, like maybe a few days, at most, you know, it's like, That's pathetic, you know. Yeah, so

90
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.950
Shawn Phalen: I think you would be well served in

91
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.200
Danny Couser: Doing some self reflecting and looking at

92
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:18.060
Shawn Phalen: What kind of relationship that you really want to be in. And is this the person that you wanna spend your time with because

93
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.250
Shawn Phalen: You know you don't want to get in a situation

94
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:33.930
Danny Couser: It's something happens in the cops are called and then ship goes down, and then you got a whole nother issue on your hands, you know, and it seems like she's

95
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.810
Danny Couser: In the moment she gets

96
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:44.370
Very riled up and she can't on herself down, she doesn't have those coping skills.

97
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:55.110
Danny Couser: And so you need to be careful about situations that you find yourself in with her and

98
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.440
Shawn Phalen: You know you're in early sobriety and

99
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.010
Danny Couser: your focus should be you.

100
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.710
Danny Couser: And your staying clean and

101
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.140
Shawn Phalen: A life for yourself that you want and that you deserve.

102
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.450
Sometimes it's scary.

103
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.000
Danny Couser: Chiang

104
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:43.830
Danny Couser: mai trashy, like I say I'm a very on like thinker analyzer and all this nap. But I don't vocalize it. I feel like it's absolutely necessary, you know,

105
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:59.970
Danny Couser: And have like almost too thick of the filters like her. Like if she's just like, Oh, why are you do that. Like, like, like, like women don't like guys that do that. I'm like, wow, really, like, like, are you serious like

106
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.880
Danny Couser: Anybody could have just went without you saying that like that that really have like an issue.

107
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:14.340
Danny Couser: Versus like why do you think she doesn't have friends as they get angel groups.

108
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.100
Danny Couser: pardon my language. She's just a pitch.

109
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.650
Danny Couser: Pitch and

110
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:36.870
Danny Couser: Like you said, like I tried to tell you, likes to be careful with her. She makes him last night that she can order to get along. And that's it. She did exactly that, like, real demand for it solid two months, you know, to create a taco.

111
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.530
Danny Couser: TV Land in a

112
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.160
Danny Couser: House every day, left to right. What else is going on like

113
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:53.460
Danny Couser: Am I good I mean is that is that an artist or Mike Yeah.

114
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:54.900
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

115
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.790
Sir, very

116
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:10.860
Danny Couser: Charming. In the beginning, you know, there are various they they come across as very fun and very caring and and loving all of your flaws, you're

117
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:22.260
Danny Couser: Like me I smoke cigarettes and they're like, oh yeah, like this most secret actually Nikita like guy can't skanks Nike. Nike, it's just like, I'm like, Okay, here's my from one extreme to the

118
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.490
Danny Couser: Other extreme like how like she's

119
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.430
Danny Couser: Like I said, I really heard of the word ours. I like Jesse said I was

120
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.830
Danny Couser: Like I have to Google.

121
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.570
Danny Couser: And I'm like, Okay, that's really a mind.

122
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.120
Danny Couser: He said,

123
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.180
Danny Couser: What do I do now, but

124
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.360
Shawn Phalen: So our sister, a lot of projecting

125
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:52.740
Yes.

126
00:16:53.910 --> 00:17:05.730
Danny Couser: And that's, that's really what they do is they project and they sort of suck the energy out of the room and they suck the energy out of the person that you're with.

127
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.220
And

128
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.790
You need to really

129
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.890
You know, I suggest you think about this. Think about

130
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.340
What's good for you.

131
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.020
Danny Couser: She gave me an ultimatum, like, you know, like a

132
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:41.790
Danny Couser: Free

133
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.670
Danny Couser: Make a phone call or program or anything.

134
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.230
Danny Couser: Like

135
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.660
Danny Couser: That whole

136
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.550
Danny Couser: Like

137
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.160
Danny Couser: Something at least something today or get your stuff and go

138
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.440
Danny Couser: Like, okay, well,

139
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.810
Danny Couser: I called the county access

140
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.490
Danny Couser: Right.

141
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.470
Danny Couser: Side of the heart. Talk to the doctor. The next morning.

142
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.870
Danny Couser: I don't know.

143
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.990
Danny Couser: Like that. I think that was kind of

144
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:27.720
Danny Couser: My decision is that I feel like she's a good person that has experience or much for me to get clean pretending it's not all that, you know, I mean, I don't

145
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:36.120
Danny Couser: Add gets the best to me, big time to come to, like, all this sort of

146
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.610
Shawn Phalen: Hey, how long can you stay here, Mom.

147
00:18:48.420 --> 00:19:06.540
Danny Couser: Always said doors open flame, but I'm literally like on the couch two bedroom apartment 500 people there, you know. Yeah, so that's, to me, that's the other day. It's like out to sound like a music player but yeah I mean I have a place to stay in my portion to read

148
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.900
Danny Couser: And obviously, it's much comfortable being in the master bedroom stuff that

149
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.650
Danny Couser: Obviously,

150
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.150
Danny Couser: This boy.

151
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.950
Shawn Phalen: Maybe

152
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:33.540
Shawn Phalen: You know, maybe, maybe stay at your mom's for a little bit longer kind of think about

153
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.310
Danny Couser: This your head clear

154
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:45.150
Danny Couser: Maybe, keep your distance from her for a couple more days and just kind of see where you are with things.

155
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:54.780
Because this is really like we talked about this last time. I think it's like, now it's about creating a life.

156
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.860
Danny Couser: Right, making healthy choices and healthy decisions for yourself.

157
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:12.660
Danny Couser: And it might do in that baby like almost like torture myself. I put up with her, like, because it's kinda like what I was used to

158
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.930
Danny Couser: It. Yeah.

159
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.660
Shawn Phalen: Totally. And what it is, what it is is a familiar here.

160
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.680
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's, it's like when you're when your life is, you know, in chaos and you're

161
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.490
Shawn Phalen: You're making losing and you're making that

162
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.390
Decision.

163
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.450
Shawn Phalen: And you're around people that

164
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:47.040
Danny Couser: Don't make great decisions, either because most of your friends are going to be people that use and your relationships are going to just be crazy. And I'm helping

165
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.770
Danny Couser: That's what you know.

166
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.810
Danny Couser: And so now it's about making, making

167
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.180
Danny Couser: Changes.

168
00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:58.890
Shawn Phalen: Knowing

169
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.240
Danny Couser: That you don't have to live.

170
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.780
Shawn Phalen: That life.

171
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.280
Danny Couser: Of chaos that

172
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.200
Danny Couser: Your listings were using

173
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.110
Shawn Phalen: And so yeah, all this stuff feels very familiar to you.

174
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:17.820
Shawn Phalen: Know, and so you have to think about what would it be like to be in a relationship. There's no trauma and bullshit going on.

175
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:34.410
Danny Couser: That's okay, as my exit in her broke up because I couldn't get it. I get blind to Capri Sun would like to start going to Methadone clinic a bit templates. About two months before after I got done I really started or

176
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:52.620
Danny Couser: She was to get like never taught me the x ray that I can help us find a familiar stupid dumb. Sure. Other than that, I mean they're equal phenomenal. He knows, really, the only reason why, and it

177
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.060
Is

178
00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:13.440
Danny Couser: And I think I like I try to make it make you knows. Like, I think she knows that because I made. Okay, yeah, great Nikki's more attractive than, like, I don't like look, sir. Whenever the bonus. I'd rather go for a much deeper connection and that

179
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:22.530
Danny Couser: I think Nikki knows that. Because I mean, soon as far as like going on Facebook and like you know like screen shutting up

180
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.460
Danny Couser: And like I'm a guy like it is fat weekend. Bye bye. I'm like,

Danny Couser: I haven't even seen a picture were in like four or five years and on my okay yeah students a few pounds. I've been there but like I mean, who cares what what's your point.

182
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:49.410
Danny Couser: Exactly like it just, you know, just like attacking her like disparate like cycle. I mean, she's just a file bully like to it like I'm a manager over 683 hundred pounds in isolation. It's stuff.

183
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.430
Danny Couser: That means you

184
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:59.850
Danny Couser: Verbally slammed with anybody right without hesitation.

185
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:13.530
Danny Couser: I mean even her. She told me that I should like eight year old son, Tommy. We're in talks with them, the one time and these shoes literally in the room.

186
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.240
Danny Couser: Two Boys sitting on the bed, two feet away from as she's just reading, reading back through, like, I'm just going to cancel the boat tomorrow.

187
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:30.870
Danny Couser: Tags drug addict Caroline champion like like right there for kids, you know, they're active Microsoft asleep but they're not, you know, and

188
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:42.540

Danny Couser: Like, that's what started it like this is great. This is great. My step mom, my dad,

191
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.730
Yeah, so I think you need to think about this.

192
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:17.640
Danny Couser: You really really want to be around somebody like this because I can tell that it's really affecting me and it's really stressing you out.

193
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.940
Danny Couser: Like, I mean, I'm already questioning like every last time we talked

194
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:32.400
Danny Couser: And I said, I got a short fuse. You know, like, like honestly like I kind of gathered that much is her

204
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:20.070
Danny Couser: It seems like everything exactly what I wanted to do. I believe the benefit of it.

205
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.680
It's like

Danny Couser: Overwhelming place during YC

221
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.430
Danny Couser: Take a couple of days. Okay, just like take a, take a

222
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.150
Try not to think about it up in a space where you're

223
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.440
Shawn Phalen: Like

224
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.690
Danny Couser: Trying to have limited contact with her.

225
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.070
Shawn Phalen: And get your calm down.

226
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:03.420
Shawn Phalen: And give it a couple of days and then start to think about, okay, how do I want to see what is the best for me and not take

227
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.690
Danny Couser: This is really critical for you.

228
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:14.490
Shawn Phalen: In terms of thinking about what's going to be good for you and for your future okay because

229
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.700
Danny Couser: The reality of this is if you stay with her. This is your

230
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.200
Shawn Phalen: Reality. This is

231
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.580
Danny Couser: Your future with her.

232
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:27.210
Danny Couser: I can tell you right now that it is most likely never going to change.

233
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.900
Shawn Phalen: Ever. Okay.

234
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.490
Danny Couser: I know that

235
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:47.130
Shawn Phalen: And I know you don't want to say that that's why I want you to take a couple of days kind of think about this, take some deep breaths. Do whatever you need.

236
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:57.990
Danny Couser: To whatever is to that you like to do. Okay, really critical that you do this. Okay.

237
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.210
Shawn Phalen: There's no magic.

238
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:06.540
Danny Couser: Trick, you might have to go through this comfort and the emotional pain of this because it's painful.

239
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:19.710
Danny Couser: But you just have to let yourself know that you're going to get through it and that it's gonna be okay. And I will work with you and we will get through this together. No, I will help you make, you're not alone and

240
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.790
Danny Couser: That's my biggest fear like

241
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.730
Danny Couser: Much with social I've

242
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.160
Danny Couser: Dealt with very many years.

243
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.800
Danny Couser: Obviously that's

244
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:51.840
Shawn Phalen: So remember, REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE REBUILDING YOUR LIFE. Okay. And so it's going to take some baby steps here.

245
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:58.290
Shawn Phalen: You know, like you don't have a great support system. I mean, you have your mom and your sisters. Good.

246
00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.370
With your neck.

247
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.710
Shawn Phalen: But the next step is to get you to where you're doing stuff for people that are

248
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:21.900
Danny Couser: Not using your to expand your life a little expand your social group you know you you know we want to get you steady and stable and grounded and that's why it's so critical that a focus on you and what's good for you.

249
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.120
Danny Couser: Okay, and then we'll talk in two weeks. And if

250
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.570
Danny Couser: You

251
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:33.150
Danny Couser: If you're running into trouble. Just call call them transformative time to meet with you.

252
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.950
Shawn Phalen: Alright, so don't worry. We'll get through this.

253
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.770
Danny Couser: Yes. Okay. Okay.

254
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.230
Okay. All right.

255
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.330
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

256
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.290
Genevieve Crawford: Hello.

257
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:05.400
Sorry.

258
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.920
There.

259
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.520
Shawn Phalen: What's happening I'm talking a while feels like it's been a really long time.

260
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.260
Genevieve Crawford: I know, I think, I think it was in December.

261
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.800
Genevieve Crawford: Before the holidays. Yeah, I've just been really busy at work and then

262
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:34.500
Genevieve Crawford: I'm especially like in work mode right now, some hour, and this was just like a really busy week

263
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:43.590
Genevieve Crawford: So I can't like chat for all that long. But on the whole, like things are going well like

264
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.840
Genevieve Crawford: I'm making more of an effort to do things outside of work to like have fun and like

265
00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:07.110
Genevieve Crawford: Cultivate like passions and then make friends. And I've been going to some synergistic women's network stuff. And that's been really nice and then starting to think about applying to business school like

266
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:22.320
Genevieve Crawford: Getting excited about that. My brother's currently at Stanford Business School, and he's having a really good experience. And I think that would just be a really great like interlude to really focus on myself and like

267
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.260
Genevieve Crawford: Yes, like to start preparing for that too. So that'll kind of diminish fun in the

268
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:44.070
Genevieve Crawford: Like short term until I can like take my gra or G man G my Asian stuff. So overall, just like super busy, but things are positive.

269
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.030
Shawn Phalen: So if you what's the timeframe on that. Do you have a time frame when you'd like to

270
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.860
Start like when, when would you want to start school

271
00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:08.310
Genevieve Crawford: And that would be in 2021 like September of 2021 so I have to submit my application by this September. So, okay, yeah.

272
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.390
Shawn Phalen: And then, so then you would obviously still continue working where you're working right.

273
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:25.890
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah and there's a day. I also had my performance review, since we last spoke, and it was really positive and really encouraging and

274
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:34.650
Genevieve Crawford: feel really good about it. And I mean there's a chance that especially as a woman in there so few women in this field.

275
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:46.590
Genevieve Crawford: If they really do continue to like me and the way that they do, they might pay for business school and then have me come back, which would be pretty cool.

276
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.430
Shawn Phalen: And when is that a two year program.

277
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:51.240
Yeah.

278
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:04.380
Genevieve Crawford: That's exciting. Yeah, so all a lot of stuff to look forward to. But I mean I have to really work for it but you know I like to work so

279
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.810
Genevieve Crawford: Problem.

280
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:15.270
Shawn Phalen: And okay so overall like how's your any depression and anxiety fatigue. What's happening with that.

281
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:32.730
Genevieve Crawford: Will increase my flocks mean dose. Two weeks ago, and I'm still kind of like going to the adjustment period. So I went from 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams, so have some like kind of najah and like sleep disruptions.

282
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:48.870
Genevieve Crawford: But I think that'll probably start to subside sin, but I feel like, oh, for all my anxiety is down, but I think that's also like feeling more established in San Francisco. And my job and like my new life here.

283
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:55.530
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah, so I don't know like things are coming together pretty well. It seems like it.

284
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:08.760
Genevieve Crawford: So you're feeling like you're connecting a little bit better socially and outside of work and creating time for yourself to do things that give you joy and fulfillment. Yeah.

285
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:18.690
Genevieve Crawford: My next step is like working on incorporating exercise. Okay, cool. That's always good. So does your life feel more balanced now.

286
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.630
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah, I mean, it's still

287
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:34.920
Genevieve Crawford: Like not it's not perfect by any means. And it like fluctuates, but I think I'm making gradual progress towards that. And I know that I have a way to go.

288
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:47.130
Genevieve Crawford: But I'm starting to feel more confident about like putting myself out there. Yeah. That's awesome. I've noticed I can tell there's there's a definite difference, you know, and

289
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:56.130
Shawn Phalen: So, Tommy. Like, how, how were the holidays for you. I think you were leaving to go on a family trip. I don't know if we talked since then.

290
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:08.190
Genevieve Crawford: Um, well, I just went home to Colorado for the holidays. And then I went to New Mexico with my boyfriend. So he met my parents for the first time after Christmas.

291
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:23.820
Genevieve Crawford: And that was really fun and it was really nice to be home like to my brother wasn't there excuse traveling for business school. But just having the family all together was like really great and just super relaxed.

292
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.140
Genevieve Crawford: So you had you had like two weeks off right

293
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:46.350
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah, I had to work like a bit, but it wasn't like overbearing so I really got the chance to like unwind and rest and just kind of like focus on being president with my family. Okay. Sounds good to me.

294
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:54.780
Shawn Phalen: Um, okay. Anything else that you that you want to go over

295
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.930
Genevieve Crawford: No, I like

296
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:11.340
Genevieve Crawford: Granted, I do have like a presentation tomorrow, so I'm kind of like stress about that but

297
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.520
Genevieve Crawford: Trying to think of like

298
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.030
Genevieve Crawford: Good to discuss i don't know i i think i've

299
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:38.910
Genevieve Crawford: Kind of since I stepped into this role, especially being one of the only women. I have some performance anxiety, especially with public speaking. So I'm trying to find ways to like overcome that.

300
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.580
Shawn Phalen: So you have a presentation tomorrow. And who's the presentation to

301
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:53.010
Genevieve Crawford: Its to the investment committee so it's like 30 men like around like a big board table.

302
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:06.150
Genevieve Crawford: Of like varying ages, but mostly like white men in their 30s, 40s to 50s, so it's it's pretty daunting.

303
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.280
Genevieve Crawford: Can be done that before.

304
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:21.270
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah, I've had to give presentations like every couple of weeks, and I've definitely been improving over time, but so is scary.

305
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:24.390
Scary.

306
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:30.780
Genevieve Crawford: Sometimes it's helpful for you just look at it like you're having a conversation. Yeah.

307
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:38.790
Only you're just doing the talking, you know, kind of like when you're out. You're like, I don't know.

308
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.440
At a party or an event and you're just like,

309
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:54.240
Genevieve Crawford: You just look at it like you're talking to somebody and you're doing what you need to explain and you're presenting it that way, and

310
00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.990
Genevieve Crawford: That's always what I would do when I had to interview you know I would just

311
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:18.390
Genevieve Crawford: I would just look at it as kind of like a social event, but a more formal social event and yeah know where I was just kind of selling myself and my experience and my skills. And so that has always helped me in the past.

312
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.390
Perfect them at so many

313
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.010
So,

314
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.990
Shawn Phalen: Kind of like with

315
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.710
Shawn Phalen: As you do it, you know, you obviously you get more experience and you get more comfortable and

316
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.490
Genevieve Crawford: All that other stuff. Yes, I'm sure you'll do fine.

317
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.460
Genevieve Crawford: There you'll be very prepared. What, what time is it tomorrow.

318

320
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.880

321
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.640

324
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:20.670

325
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.620
Genevieve Crawford: Think that makes sense, just like check in every month.

326
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.560
Shawn Phalen: Because it does seem like

327
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.200
Shawn Phalen: You know, it does seem

328
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.440
Like

329
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.290
