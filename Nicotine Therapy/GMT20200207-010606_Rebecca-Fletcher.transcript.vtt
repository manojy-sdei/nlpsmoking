11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.000

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.270
iPhone: Good probably

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
iPhone: I mean it's, I would say, like, it's like I was truly a

14
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.880
iPhone: Fully addicted abusing opiates for probably three or four years but been doing them for seven years and

15
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.710
iPhone: And then I started using heroin. I'm

16
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:35.430
iPhone: In the, in the last phase of my addiction. I started using heroin, probably about seven months prior, and I'm

17
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.130
iPhone: Like

18
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.200
iPhone: My life felt I felt like I was at a point where I just

19
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:59.880
iPhone: I didn't care. Once I once I finally gave in and decided to use heroin, because I couldn't find opiates that, you know, clean or whatever be called Clean from the doctor, you know, from like

20
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:18.840
iPhone: Pills. I once I made that decision. I feel like I kind of just gave up. I felt like my life was good. Nothing good was going to happen for me that it's, there's just no point. And why not just and so I was doing that for a long time and then

21
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
iPhone: My mother finally confronted me about

22
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:39.780
iPhone: You know, just like what's going on with you and she was severely, severely shocked. She told me she did not expect that was that was what was going on.

23
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:51.810
iPhone: And as this. Secondly, this at the same time, we had that confrontation and I just told it you know I'm ready, I'm ready to go to rehab, you know, let's

24
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.680
iPhone: Let's figure this out. And so I went to rehab in November 26 and

25
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.290

26
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.620

28
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.140

32
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're right, very much.

33
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:48.030
iPhone: But I was prepared for that. I watched as other people were sent away and I prepare myself for that. And I decided I was going to eat every second of every day I was there to to strengthen my coping skills.

34
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What we have did you go to

iPhone: Like mainly mainly anxiety. So I saw my psychologist was 15 and and and insomnia, that was a problem too. And then, so I saw him for like three years, three and a half years. And then he decided to work at a institution, instead of private practice so

44
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:09.000
iPhone: That was kind of it after that. And before before he had left I had decided because I i was prescribed like Ambien for sleep, and I didn't want to take that anymore and

45
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.060
iPhone: Yeah, um,

46
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:33.960
iPhone: And then I saw one more therapist. When I was about 19 and but that that time was mainly more cuz it was 18 i think i was 18 and my. It was more of my parents, making me and I didn't really want to. I feel like I never really connected with that therapist.

47
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any past

92
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:27.420
iPhone: She just, I mean, it was, it was weird. So I just don't know what's going on with that. That's kind of like a turmoil. I'm dealing with, I don't understand why if she is mad at me or something but but ok so growing up.

93
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:39.030
iPhone: My stepfather was extremely alcoholic and addicted to opiates like Vicodin and Percocet and I'm there was

94
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:49.170
iPhone: A lot of violent incidences just growing up like elementary school, middle school, all I just constantly remember like at nighttime. I mean, they're just be

95
00:12:49.800 --> 00:13:10.590
iPhone: Like just constantly screaming, yelling fighting. I'm sure my mom was anti antagonizing him. He's antagonists, where there's like bottles thrown smashing them was, I can hear you now. And there was a one in like it got physical a couple of times, but one specific incidents.

96
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:31.290
iPhone: My brother. I was like I was 13 I just turned 13 and my brother came running into my room and he's like dad to mom dad's him mom. And so I go out to the kitchen and I had a little hunting knife that my grandfather gave me and

97
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:42.060
iPhone: My mom was like standing like she was on her knees in front of him. And he was just beating down like on her like with his fists, so I

98
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:52.980
iPhone: GRABBED THE KNIFE. And I just held I held it to him and I you know I just, it's like kind of like a blackout of just craziness. But, I mean, I was like, like I'm gonna

99
00:13:54.030 --> 00:14:05.850
iPhone: kill you if you like. I'm gonna, I'm like, stop. Like, and I had stopped him and then after that, the violence didn't really happen anymore. After that, but

100
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:15.180
iPhone: Yeah, and that was so that's that's a good example of what the dynamic was in my childhood.

101
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that's a definitely high stress environment for for any kid, you know,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.210
Yeah.

103
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

104
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's funny because you've already answered the rest of the family dynamic questions was there alcohol abuse or drug abuse or you know anything

105
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you've already answered the rest of coast.

106
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.120
iPhone: And yeah, not one point when I was

107
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:57.690
iPhone: Basically, once I at the point that I can remember when I really got into it like when it was like like that, it becomes a schedule of

108
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:06.270
iPhone: purchasing the jokes and taking the jokes any purchasing was when my step father when I was 18 started asking me

109
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:22.560
iPhone: To because I knew people and they would sell me like large amounts of painkillers and so I would. That's how I kind of got until I just, yeah. You know, you know what I mean, that's kind of how the cycle started like

110
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:37.290
iPhone: Yeah, and it was a total he, you know, it was like a secret, like, you know, it's kind of like he would tell me a leap it somewhere in the garage. And in a way, it was kind of a way to get him to stop like messing with the gate.

111
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

112
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.690

No.

115
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.110
iPhone: No for divorce. That was another crazy situation that's just, I don't think, like, you know, I don't think we have time for the when

116
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You were kind of drug through with them with your mom.

117
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:09.300

118
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:27.930
iPhone: He took everything from me and my brother, who is his son and my mom moved into like a very like tiny crappy apartment in town and like you know he took the house he, you know, there was no support.

119
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm going

120
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:43.860

iPhone: I I graduated high school I was diagnosed with a DD when I was like 15 but you know I think I do have a DD just not now. I like. And I think you know the difference between like ADHD and a DD, like I think my mind, is it. It was really hard for me to to focus and

122
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:22.980
iPhone: I think I I've analyzed it a lot in my what I think is that my household was insane. I mean it was just insanity and constantly in school was a place where like there was

123
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:31.710
iPhone: Rules that everybody had to be had to fall in there. And I mean that their structure and I just kind of took that as an

124
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:46.080
iPhone: I didn't, it didn't like, go with me. I wasn't getting good grades. I was, I was like, finally, relax, and I can have a little fun like and I would, you know, I, you know, so I was definitely, I wasn't like

125
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:56.280
iPhone: Like it like me or anything to teachers or people, but I was kind of a clown at school and would mess around.
