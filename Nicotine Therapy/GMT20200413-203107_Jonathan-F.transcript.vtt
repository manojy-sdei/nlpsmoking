1
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.009
Jonathan Figg: Okay, we're doing the take for getting in Washington. My

2
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.900
Jonathan Figg: Background is

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.779
Jonathan Figg: Just inconvenience.

4
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.470
Jonathan Figg: Time.

5
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.850
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me.

6
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.530
Dottie Newton: I can

7
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.680
Jonathan Figg: Try that again.

8
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.270
Dottie Newton: Can you hear me.

9
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.580
Jonathan Figg: There we go. Wonderful. Hopefully my baby who just woke up from an inconvenient nap time. There is not to out in the crowd and Jason advance for that.

10
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.250
Dottie Newton: I was going to apologize for my Chihuahua likes to sleep.

11
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:24.360
Jonathan Figg: Just so you know, so that if you see it says recording we record all our session so that we can make our notes problems, but otherwise they stay confidential and Dr. Phil, nice to meet you.

12
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
Dottie Newton: Now let me ask question before I guess.

13
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.640
Dottie Newton: I had a call with Dr. Bill on Friday.

14
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.980
Dottie Newton: She did not know why I was referred to your clinic.

15
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.720
Dottie Newton: So I want to make sure you can help me with pain management. I'm not addicted to anything except probably my pain killers.

16
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.320
Jonathan Figg: Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:00.930
Jonathan Figg: Yes, so I manage both people who just have opioid use disorder, what we would call dependence on opiates and I also manage people who have pain and often there is an overlap and

18
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:15.540
Jonathan Figg: Absolutely. So, so you were referred to us for pain management. So the kind of the order that we want to go through things is for me to understand what what you're in pain from in kind of the history on that.

19
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.610
Jonathan Figg: Okay, what's been done about that, leading to where we are now.

20
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.920
Jonathan Figg: And then we'll talk about what we can do.

21
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.820
Dottie Newton: All right. He just wants to start blabbering here.

22
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.520
Jonathan Figg: Well, yeah, go ahead and tell me. Okay.

23
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.180
Dottie Newton: It's it started in August of 2014 and I had a knee surgery.

24
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.610
Dottie Newton: The knee surgery.

25
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:49.920
Dottie Newton: Produced a severe infection that took within a month span three more surgeries. So within a month. I had four surgeries on many

26
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.180
Dottie Newton: And

27
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.460
Dottie Newton: That was my left knee.

28
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.410
Dottie Newton: And

29
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.930
Dottie Newton: So since then, I have been on oxy codeine and gabapentin

30
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.120
Dottie Newton: Um,

31
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.260
Dottie Newton: While I was in the hospital during my third surgery.

32
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.330
Dottie Newton: I fell and tore my rotator cuff.

33
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.890
Dottie Newton: And so then I have to have a surgery for that as well.

34
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:29.280
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so that started initially you said in 2014 and a bunch of surgeries on your left knee in 2014. I'm just going to say it back to make sure I understand.

35
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.190
Jonathan Figg: So, and then, when did you hurt your shoulder.

36
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.590
Dottie Newton: The same year.

37
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.000
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

38
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.360
Jonathan Figg: Okay. And so what's kind of

39
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.580
Jonathan Figg: If, if you are still in pain. What is this

40
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.010
Jonathan Figg: Yeah. What is, what is the source of your current pain.

41
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.830
Dottie Newton: Um, I actually have been 36 hours without without oxy

42
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.050
Dottie Newton: Be

43
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.550
Dottie Newton: Fabulous. If I could stand up and walk. I mean, my husband or the grocery store today because I got

44
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.720
Dottie Newton: It sometimes it feels like a knife with every step going into my knee.

45
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.830
Dottie Newton: Um, it's, it's just ridiculous.

46
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:30.900
Jonathan Figg: So you have. Do you have continuing arthritis. Do you have a misalignment. Do you have what we call Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.

47
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.750
Jonathan Figg: What's the

48
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.390
Dottie Newton: Answer is yes.

49
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.910
Jonathan Figg: Right, so someone should have looked at that I told you I this is what we think is the source.

50
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:54.540
Dottie Newton: Well, yeah. They've done. I've had MRIs, CAT scans X rays. So right now, I've got bone on bone arthritis.

51
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.090
Dottie Newton: I'm

52
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.430
Jonathan Figg: Discussion of a knee replacement

53
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.010
Dottie Newton: There has

54
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.640
Dottie Newton: Been. I hope you

55
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.880
Dottie Newton: Hope you can understand my reluctance to do that after everything that's been done and nothing being done, you know, to me,

56
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:23.640
Jonathan Figg: I understand it's really I'm not an orthopedic surgeon. So I'm not here to persuade you one way or another on something like that. I just want to kind of understand the other work up because that certainly also should happen.

57
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.860
Jonathan Figg: Do you still have pain in your shoulder or is

58
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.800
Dottie Newton: The name.

59
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.670
Jonathan Figg: God, yeah.

60
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.870
Jonathan Figg: Just to me.

61
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.240
Jonathan Figg: And so forth. And you've been on Oxycodone and

62
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.570
Jonathan Figg: So I'm required to pull a prescription history.

63
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.850
Jonathan Figg: Excuse me for Washington

64
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.470
Jonathan Figg: And so it looks like you've been on the 15 milligram tablets four times a day.

65
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.490
Jonathan Figg: Right, okay. In addition to how much counter-offensive you take

66
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.810
Dottie Newton: And taking 800 milligrams three times a day.

67
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.590
Jonathan Figg: Okay, and how does that do for keeping you functional on able to do what you want to do.

68
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.810
Dottie Newton: I can't walk my dog around

69
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:31.110
Dottie Newton: That a little driveway. I just, I'm walking up and down, so he can do his business. But you know when I'm feeling really good. I'll go to the grocery store with my husband. I'm living in Republic, Washington. It's a tiny grocery store, so I can get around there pretty well.

70
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.670
Jonathan Figg: But

71
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.720
Dottie Newton: That's about it.

72
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.620
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so, so you're certainly not as functional as you would like to be, but you are able to do some of your activities. I'll be with some limitations there.

73
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.230
Jonathan Figg: major issue being down been without oxy Cotto and so we're in withdrawal with me. Yep.

74
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.870
Jonathan Figg: Yes. Tell me about how you're feeling outside of your knee right now.

75
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:13.140
Dottie Newton: Um, yesterday, my husband and I were going through a couple issues so yesterday was a bad emotional day. Um, but my knees. I could hardly stand up on my knees, um,

76
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:24.330
Dottie Newton: I've been through withdrawal before man, it's, it's the diarrhea. It's the

77
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.350
Dottie Newton: I'm gonna call it mental anguish, I just break out crying. If he looks at me wrong. You know what I mean. And

78
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.040
Dottie Newton: It's not that he says anything to upset me just, that's all has to look at me wrong.

79
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.930
Jonathan Figg: It's not necessarily

80
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.480
Jonathan Figg: Something wrong. It's just your emotions kind of run run wild. Okay.

81
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.610
Do you sweat.

82
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.680
Dottie Newton: I've not gotten to that part. My, my, my sister.

83
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:06.990
Dottie Newton: Is in Florida. She is a nurse, so she tells me some of the things I can expect to go through. But, but I've not had shakes or anything like that.

84
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.480
Jonathan Figg: everybody's everybody's withdrawal pattern is different. There's certainly certain symptoms that we find common

85
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.710
Jonathan Figg: That everybody learns differently. So I'm I'm interested to know

86
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:26.370
Jonathan Figg: How long after your last dose of oxycodone, do you typically start having withdrawal symptoms of any kind. And then how do they progress.

87
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.610
Dottie Newton: I took my last dosage.

88
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.870
Dottie Newton: I want to say like 4pm on Friday.

89
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.760
Dottie Newton: Right.

90
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.200
Dottie Newton: What's hitting Monday.

91
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.890
Dottie Newton: It was

92
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.210
Dottie Newton: It was Saturday.

93
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:47.130
Dottie Newton: So when the rest of of Saturday without and yesterday, without and

94
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.290
Dottie Newton: I was just

95
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:59.670
Dottie Newton: Miserable cranky. I can't. I have to literally push myself up with both of my arms get my legs under me

96
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:11.460
Dottie Newton: The diarrhea has started yesterday which which surprised me. Because when I was in this spot before it wasn't

97
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.650
Dottie Newton: That quick

98
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.310
Jonathan Figg: And who was managing your Sokoto before

99
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.270
Dottie Newton: Um, before Washington

100
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.770
Jonathan Figg: Know before right now.

101
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.960
Dottie Newton: I'm Jane Jacobson and Republic Washington has

102
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.670
Dottie Newton: Or what what

103
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.960
Dottie Newton: She was but she

104
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:41.670
Dottie Newton: Yeah, she told me she will not prescribe it again because I have a pattern of alcohol abuse in the past.

105
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.200
Dottie Newton: I'm

106
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.870
Dottie Newton: Republic, Washington.

107
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.980
Dottie Newton: Pharmacy.

108
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.220
Dottie Newton: I've been on and abuse since July and has been working wonderfully

109
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.250
Dottie Newton: They can, like, get it here.

110
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.600
Dottie Newton: Right now.

111
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.420
Dottie Newton: And tell me it's on back order till May.

112
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.760
Dottie Newton: So I don't. So that's something else that that's going all over for me right now.

113
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.850
Jonathan Figg: Okay, tell me about your history with alcohol.

114
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.680
Dottie Newton: Um,

115
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.050
Dottie Newton: It's long, long history and I overindulge frequently probably daily

116
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.140
Dottie Newton: Okay, yeah. But then when we decided to come to Washington.

117
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.430
Dottie Newton: Yeah, I think my husband and I both had enough.

118
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.750
Dottie Newton: We were he was drinking. I was drinking

119
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.990
Dottie Newton: So I get on the and abused. He did not need it. He did very well on his own.

120
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.730
Dottie Newton: So we've not been drinking till we got here. Okay.

121
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.430
Jonathan Figg: And so are you out of anti abuse now.

122
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.750
Yes.

123
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.840
Dottie Newton: And I don't know what the other medications. I'm taking

124
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.900
Dottie Newton: Here, if there's something else I can take

125
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.300
Jonathan Figg: What

126
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.450
Jonathan Figg: You mentioned you mentioned the gamma Tyson. What else

127
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.950
Jonathan Figg: Do you think

128
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.710
Dottie Newton: Oh my god, I should have. I should have done this. I've got a laundry list.

129
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.240
Dottie Newton: Um,

130
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.790
Dottie Newton: I take Paxil

131
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.890
Dottie Newton: For depression.

132
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.180
Dottie Newton: They just raised that to 60 milligrams a day.

133
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.370
Dottie Newton: I'm

134
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.490
Dottie Newton: I'm taking the generic I gotta walk out to the kitchen, bear with me.

135
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.600
Dottie Newton: My dogs on the left, you can have to move

136
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.660
Dottie Newton: I'm sorry, Dr. V.

137
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.760
Dottie Newton: I'm taking a pronounce this not right. I'm sure divulge Pro X.

138
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.380
Dottie Newton: Do you want to spell that

139
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.720
Jonathan Figg: Out for x. Okay, what's the dose.

140
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.880
Dottie Newton: Yeah, that is

141
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.980
Dottie Newton: My husband just brought this home for me this morning. I can't play and it

142
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.700
Jonathan Figg: Should be

143
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.710
Jonathan Figg: Five to 50 or 500

144
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.610
Dottie Newton: It's five

145
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.780
Dottie Newton: And I take

146
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.940
Dottie Newton: I take that twice a day.

147
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.960
Dottie Newton: And then

148
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.560
Dottie Newton: The Pax, Pax. So we got

149
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.230
Dottie Newton: We got

150
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.690
Dottie Newton: Taking a load of pain.

151
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.540
Dottie Newton: 10 milligrams

152
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.910
Dottie Newton: Once a day.

153
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.260
Dottie Newton: And

154
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.760
Dottie Newton: Oh,

155
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.940
Dottie Newton: That thyroid medication stills starts with an L EV O th

156
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.980
Jonathan Figg: Oops.

157
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.330
Dottie Newton: I'm 175 MCG

158
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.880
Dottie Newton: And products that

159
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.570
Dottie Newton: I've got try am turning HC cheesy.

160
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.610
Dottie Newton: That's 37.5 slash 25

161
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.430
Dottie Newton: Ridiculous. The Gabba pet night debut.

162
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.290
Dottie Newton: And then, and since I

163
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.390
Dottie Newton: Since I don't are

164
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.000
Dottie Newton: Because they don't want me taking so much ibuprofen during the day.

165
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.680
Dottie Newton: My doctor get a prescription for the 800 milligram

166
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.000
Dottie Newton: Three times a day on that.

167
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.430
Dottie Newton: Don't need my pen and paper.

168
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.660
Jonathan Figg: So you say,

169
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.430
Dottie Newton: Oh, and

170
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.200
Dottie Newton: I'm taking anti anxiety pill, um,

171
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:56.850
Dottie Newton: Can you help me out with that. My husband took the prescription down it or the bottle down this morning, start to be U. S.

172
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.900
Lucifer.

173
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.890
Jonathan Figg: Yep. And is it 1020 or 32 well 1015

174
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.050
Dottie Newton: Come in five

175
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.790
Jonathan Figg: They might. Okay.

176
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.460
Dottie Newton: I'm going to say five twice a day.

177
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.210
Jonathan Figg: That's fine. Okay. Do you think that's all just to make sure and yeah

178
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.140
Jonathan Figg: It's just to make sure, like you said, we want to be sure of our interactions and things like that.

179
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.860
Yeah.

180
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.630
Jonathan Figg: When you were not on the attributes. How many drinks, do you have in a day.

181
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.050
Dottie Newton: A lot. Um,

182
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.910
Jonathan Figg: So how many families a lot a lot to you might be a lot to me or vice versa. So

183
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.020
Dottie Newton: Um, I know it's recommended for when men, but

184
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.880
Dottie Newton: Now, I'd say, five, six.

185
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.380
Jonathan Figg: And what do you drink.

186
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.780
Dottie Newton: Vodka. Okay.

187
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.100
Jonathan Figg: So you have five or 652 drinks a day, are they mixed drinks for the shots.

188
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.050
Dottie Newton: Are mixed drinks. Yeah.

189
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.530
Dottie Newton: Vegetable juice, okay.

190
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.650
Jonathan Figg: And since you ran out of. When did you run out of attributes.

191
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.870
Dottie Newton: It's been about

192
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.680
Dottie Newton: I'm gonna say two and a half weeks ago.

193
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.110
Jonathan Figg: Have you started like drinking at that level.

194
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:33.900
Dottie Newton: I had three bad days since then. Yeah. Oh, not at that level know I've had, I've had on my bad days. And it's really only been about three I've had wine, a couple glasses of wine.

195
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:39.510
Dottie Newton: Okay, I'm not not getting toasted like that.

196
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.620
Okay.

197
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.280
Jonathan Figg: We want to do something about that.

198
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.860
Jonathan Figg: There is a national shortage of entities as I look at libraries pharmacy suppliers.

199
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.240
Dottie Newton: Oh really,

200
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.130
Dottie Newton: I was wondering why they just couldn't ship it in from somewhere else.

201
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.320
Jonathan Figg: So some of the some of the ways so

202
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.550
Jonathan Figg: National shortages don't mean everybody's out of it. It means a lot of people out of it and some people are not

203
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:20.400
Jonathan Figg: Pharmacy or not. So the question is whether we can find one who has it because if antibodies work well there's every reason to use that

204
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.720
Dottie Newton: Yeah, that

205
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:39.450
Dottie Newton: Did in fact my, my sister and my daughter were telling me I probably should have been into some kind of therapy with that. And I was like, well, you know, if it was working well. I didn't want to drink. I wasn't drinking

206
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.080
Jonathan Figg: So,

207
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:56.970
Jonathan Figg: We have a few things that we want to work on. One is I want you to not be in withdrawal from your oxycodone

208
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.020
Right.

209
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.440
Dottie Newton: Is there something else you can give me

210
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.420
Jonathan Figg: So,

211
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:15.300
Jonathan Figg: You are on a reasonably high dose of oxy codeine and not as functional as you want it to be so. And how long have you been at that dose bicycle.

212
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.940
Dottie Newton: Oh, Jane, just

213
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.720
Dottie Newton: Major that amount here. So I'm going to say maybe maybe three months.

214
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.370
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

215
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.720
Jonathan Figg: I watch for you and before

216
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.700
Dottie Newton: 10 milligrams four times a day.

217
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.930
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so it went from 10 to 15 four times. Okay, and

218
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.900
Jonathan Figg: How long have you been on oxycodone in general.

219
00:18:44.280 --> 00:19:01.290
Jonathan Figg: Since 2014 65 okay so 556 years of oxy for them, there is we frequently find that people become tolerant to a specific opioid and to opioids in general.

220
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.770
Jonathan Figg: And we do what's called

221
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:23.670
Jonathan Figg: Allergies rotation, which means we change the pain medication, not the fact we are doing something about the pain. But what we're using because often while you might be tolerant to opiates. In general, you're more tolerant to oxycodone that you are to something else.

222
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.970
Jonathan Figg: In addition, you've got withdrawal.

223
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:40.140
Jonathan Figg: And five years into opiate therapy you most likely kind of what we call hyper LG to which means hyper sensitivity to pain as the oxy codeine wears off.

224
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.280
Jonathan Figg: So everything hurts worse than it did when it first started

225
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.140
Jonathan Figg: And we and we frequently find that. So one of the things that we often

226
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.100
Jonathan Figg: Try and run it in

227
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.030
Jonathan Figg: As a first line medication would be buprenorphine.

228
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.770
Jonathan Figg: Which is

229
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.080
Jonathan Figg: an opiate

230
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:07.110
Jonathan Figg: Pain medication. If you think of the actions of opiates in your brain have four main actions one they turn off pain. It's what we want.

231
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.740
Jonathan Figg: To thing cause a high, which we don't want

232
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:23.250
Jonathan Figg: Three, they can make you sleepy and for they can turn off your breathing. Those last two are dangerous, particularly with some of the other things, right. That's what an overdose is is when you take enough that it stops your breathing.

233
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:32.220
Jonathan Figg: And all of those are dose dependent. The more you take the more it does those four things.

234
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:40.470
Jonathan Figg: For what we call a full agonist opiate which means it switches those things fully an oxy codeine is a full agonist opiate

235
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:54.660
Jonathan Figg: buprenorphine is what we call a partial agonist, which means it's still flips all four of those switches in your brain, but it doesn't push them all away so it still is a good parent lever, particularly for people who have been on opiates for a while.

236
00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:08.010
Jonathan Figg: But it does not cause a high, it does not tend to make people sleepy in the equivalent doses and it has what we call a ceiling effects will be on a certain dose more is not better. It kind of

237
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:20.250
Jonathan Figg: plateaus at a certain point, and so it is very difficult for people to overdose on so it tends to be a safer opiate and so it's one of the first things that we try and rotate in

238
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.750
Jonathan Figg: And so that would be my suggestion would be to try and get you more functional to get you certainly out of withdrawal.

239
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:38.910
Jonathan Figg: And at the same time try and shift to something that's got a lower overdose potential, especially given the concerns with your alcohol use.

240
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.580
Jonathan Figg: Because alcohol plus opiates can definitely cause overdose.

241
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.270
Dottie Newton: Right now.

242
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:58.530
Jonathan Figg: I know so and and I want you to understand. None of this conversation is in any way or you know flaws or anything like that. My goal is to get safe and get you out of withdrawing and you fall

243
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:16.470
Jonathan Figg: And so that would be my first suggestion would be to start young entrepreneurs. Normally when people are already on an opiate we have to have what we call a washout period, which means you have to stop the opiate and for at least 24 hours but you already gone through that.

244
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.310
Right.

245
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:27.570
Jonathan Figg: The reason for that is because when we start people on buprenorphine. It holds on to the receptor in your brain tighter than other opiates.

246
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:42.450
Jonathan Figg: And what that means is if you're already on buprenorphine. It will block some of the effects of other opiates. So it's useful from a an abuse potential for that because for people who are abusing opiates it effectively prevents them from getting high.

247
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:52.890
Jonathan Figg: But if you're already on an opiate like Oxycodone and you take buprenorphine. It will come in and kick the oxycodone out and put you into withdrawal.

248
00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:05.670
Jonathan Figg: And that's a bad place to be because if there's nothing you can do except wait it out. And so, but you've already gone through the wash up period. I just want you to kind of understand the way these medications work and why we do things a certain way.

249
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.740
Dottie Newton: What

250
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.320
Dottie Newton: Is he say, and something I didn't know about oxy buzz.

251
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.160
Dottie Newton: You get a certain

252
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.560
Dottie Newton: I don't know, a level where you're used to it.

253
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.100
Dottie Newton: It doesn't do anything more for you.

254
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.790
Jonathan Figg: Is that right, not oxycodone buprenorphine does

255
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.690
Dottie Newton: Okay.

256
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.680
Jonathan Figg: It has what we call a ceiling effect that ceiling effects is high enough that we get a good pain relief.

257
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:47.550
Jonathan Figg: But from a safety perspective, it's difficult to overdose on

258
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:59.430
Jonathan Figg: Particularly for people who have been on opiates for a long time beyond a certain dose taking more does not stop your breathing anymore.

259
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.660
Jonathan Figg: So it's difficult to overdose. So that, that's what I was talking about there.

260
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.730
Jonathan Figg: But

261
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:18.270
Jonathan Figg: So that's the first thing I'd like to start, you probably on buprenorphine and started a low dose and work our way up to try and find an equivalent those they get you more functional.

262
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:27.510
Jonathan Figg: The second thing I would do. While there are other medications that we can use to decrease

263
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.620
Jonathan Figg: The drive to drink.

264
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:39.330
Jonathan Figg: This of the impulse and particular usually we're trying to suppress impulsive behavior.

265
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.710
Jonathan Figg: In people because that's usually you know you shouldn't drink.

266
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:57.420
Jonathan Figg: In right consequences are. But we're human, and we're impulsive and so most of the medications that we use tried to decrease impulsive decision making. But if I'm

267
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:03.030
Jonathan Figg: If I saw from if Antabuse was really effective for you to kept you from drinking

268
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:03.930
Dottie Newton: Mm hmm.

269
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:11.400
Jonathan Figg: And then I would very much like to see if we can find a pharmacy that has it that can ship it.

270
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.590
Dottie Newton: That would be great.

271
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:22.140
Jonathan Figg: That would be the place that I would start would be by calling Molina because they should have pharmacy contacts.

272
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:40.680
Jonathan Figg: And most most insurance most ensures have, you know, like a, what we call a retail benefit, which is what they pay for, if you walk into Walgreens, and then they have a mail order benefit, which is when the pharmacy ships. So that would be things like CVS Caremark

273
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:48.570
Jonathan Figg: And there's a few others, but I would like to start by seeing if we can find a pharmacy that has

274
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.400
Jonathan Figg: Okay. Um, what was the dose of your entities.

275
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.620
Dottie Newton: Oh,

276
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.850
Dottie Newton: That's a very good question. I don't know.

277
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:05.850
Dottie Newton: What

278
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.740
Dottie Newton: Do you happen to remember the dosage of my interviews.

279
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.370
Dottie Newton: Yeah, that's a, that's a tricky question.

280
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.660
Jonathan Figg: 50 or 500

281
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.100
Jonathan Figg: Yeah.

282
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.020
Dottie Newton: It was a white tablet.

283
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.700
Dottie Newton: I, I really remember.

284
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.980
Dottie Newton: Would they would they put me on

285
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.200
Dottie Newton: If I was drinking heavily, would they put me on the lower dosage.

286
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.130
Dottie Newton: To start out

287
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.000
Hmm.

288
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:47.610
Jonathan Figg: I mean, we start we start, pretty much everybody on the lower dose and what's the last pharmacy that filled in.

289
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.170
Dottie Newton: I'm Republic drugstore here in Republic, Washington.

290
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:01.770
Jonathan Figg: So the thing to do is call for you to call that pharmacy and ask them, what was the dose of the

291
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.100
Okay.

292
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.130
Jonathan Figg: Because they'll still have the prescription on file. They just can't focus, they don't have it right so

293
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.080
Jonathan Figg: But that would be that would be the thing to do.

294
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.770
Dottie Newton: I'm going to walk around and see if I can find an empty box.

295
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.990
Jonathan Figg: That would be good too.

296
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:32.400
Jonathan Figg: So, because I would like to start you back on that. And then I would like to get you paired up with individual therapist and bright heart that can help you from the counseling perspective.

297
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:47.820
Jonathan Figg: You know, we're looking for counseling for pain management. We're looking for counseling for a history of alcohol abuse and to help you with the behavioral aspects of both of those things. So

298
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.540
Okay.

299
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.100
Jonathan Figg: And then

300
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.410
Jonathan Figg: The last thing that I would do.

301
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.280
Jonathan Figg: Would be to bump up your cabin Penton

302
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.610
Jonathan Figg: Have you been on a higher than ever before.

303
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.720
Dottie Newton: No in fact I'm

304
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.480
Dottie Newton: Jane Jacobson.

305
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:20.250
Dottie Newton: She was introduced to us as Jane. So I'm not being disrespectful by calling our first name.

306
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.260
Dottie Newton: Yes, she

307
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.170
Dottie Newton: I'm sorry, tell me that question again.

308
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.900
Jonathan Figg: My question is have you been on a higher dose of the gap of Hampton you're currently on 803 times a day.

309
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:41.700
Dottie Newton: No, in fact, Jane bumped it up to 800 she told me I wasn't at a maximums you

310
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.570
Jonathan Figg: Right. You're still a

311
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.600
Jonathan Figg: Dab of Hampton. Okay. Does it make you sleepy.

312
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:50.820
Dottie Newton: No, it doesn't.

313
00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:01.140
Jonathan Figg: So, so, the question that we always the concern that we always have to have when working with medications like this is that they can all make you sleepy.

314
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:14.760
Jonathan Figg: Actually coding can make you sleepy buprenorphine can make you sleepy gather panting can make you sleepy alcohol make you sleepy boost prone to make you so right, all of these things to make you sleepy and what we don't want is to knock you out.

315
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.560
Dottie Newton: Right. Thank you.

316
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:25.320
Jonathan Figg: For your breathing. Those are the two things we do not want to do so right you're currently wide awake now could be just because you're in withdrawal.

317
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.440
Jonathan Figg: But the it's kind of, I want to understand how you react to some of these things so

318
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.090
Jonathan Figg: You're still not in Mexico. So you could go up to 804 times a day.

319
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:42.330
Jonathan Figg: Beyond that is kind of it starts just going straight through. You can't absorb it.

320
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.490
Dottie Newton: But yeah, but

321
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.800
Jonathan Figg: Correct beyond, beyond an 800 hours, four times a day. It

322
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.990
Jonathan Figg: Basically starts to go right through you and give you diarrhea. We don't want that. So,

323
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:10.110
Jonathan Figg: But gamma Penton helps with chronic pain. It helps with nerves that are misfiring and it helps decrease what we call dysphoria, which is just a bad feeling

324
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:19.680
Jonathan Figg: When you have a history of alcohol use a lot of people who have a history with alcohol when they stopped drinking. They just feel bad.

325
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.640
Jonathan Figg: Because they're not suppressing everything

326
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.740
Dottie Newton: I didn't go through that at all.

327
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.120
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

328
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:27.870
Okay.

329
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:40.260
Jonathan Figg: Began repentance has has some evidence that it can decrease recurrent return to drinking and so it may be useful for several reasons. But, um,

330
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:54.900
Jonathan Figg: So I don't have any concerns with the gabapentin I do have concerns with the OxyContin for the same reason that she did is with that history, we just, we don't want you to be in a place where you can hurt yourself.

331
00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:11.730
Jonathan Figg: Right, and so I would switch over to the buprenorphine. The way we would do that is to start with. So buprenorphine comes as a sublingual tablets or film. Okay. The film's look like the little breath strips. If you remember them that were popular

332
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.930
Dottie Newton: Oh, yeah, yeah.

333
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:31.080
Jonathan Figg: And they come in a little foil wrapper and whether it's a film or a tablet. Either way, you take it the same way you put it underneath the side of your tongue and let it fully dissolve. You don't chew it. You don't swallow it, it has to be absorbed through the veins underneath your toe.

334
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.160
Jonathan Figg: Because you're essentially don't absorb it at all. If you swallow it.

335
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.190
Jonathan Figg: And you won't get any of the effect

336
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:41.520
Dottie Newton: So,

337
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.620
interrupt for just a second.

338
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.830
Dottie Newton: The reason they put me on gab

339
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:55.260
Dottie Newton: Why I'm even taking that is the third surgery on my knee. They did nerve damage.

340
00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:06.630
Dottie Newton: They told me that would help for the nerve damage because it goes from the back of my knee down to my foot and half of my foot is numb.

341
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.210
Dottie Newton: Okay. Yeah. Okay.

342
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.730
Jonathan Figg: So the Gabba Thompson is useful for that. Definitely. Does it work well for that.

343
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:16.230
Jonathan Figg: Yes.

344
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.750
Dottie Newton: You know, it's hard to say.

345
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.200
Dottie Newton: If amount of oxy I'll take

346
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:29.010
Dottie Newton: One of my Gabba patents with an 800 milligram ibuprofen.

347
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.530
Dottie Newton: And that kind of

348
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.320
Dottie Newton: Has a settling effect.

349
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:42.600
Dottie Newton: But yeah i i can't explain. It's like pins and needles in the butter. My foot when I'm off of my pain meds.

350
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:54.120
Jonathan Figg: So for that kind of pain gabapentin tends to be more useful than opiates, regardless of any opiate they just they're not that good for nerve pain.

351
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.550
Jonathan Figg: They do something. They're just not as effective as other things. So

352
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:13.560
Jonathan Figg: The gamma panting date. It doesn't tend to do much for numbness not there's not much they can do anything for numbness lack of feeling, but it can usually help the burning sensations, the pins and needles sensations.

353
00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:22.020
Jonathan Figg: The electric shock sensations that various people have, depending on what that nerve is misfiring on so

354
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:30.360
Jonathan Figg: So that that would be those are some of the things I think would be useful here.

355
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.200
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

356
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:45.630
Jonathan Figg: And I'm just looking at various parts of your chart to try and make sure that we take care of everything. Um,

357
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:53.190
Jonathan Figg: So just to kind of summarize the things that I would do, I would increase your gap of Penton dose again.

358
00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:06.210
Jonathan Figg: From three times a day for or whether you whether you take it three times a day, or four times a day, or whether you know you take it, you know, twice a day to filter or however there's various ways. It just depends on when

359
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.170
Jonathan Figg: The sensation bothers you, the most

360
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:10.620
High

361
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.560
Jonathan Figg: But I would increase your have a patent from three pills a day before pills today.

362
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:27.060
Jonathan Figg: I was starting on a prescription of buprenorphine. Like I said, it's a sublingual tablet, I would start you have eight milligrams, I would start you on one a day.

363
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:36.720
Jonathan Figg: And let you slowly work your way up by half a tablet at a time as you need to. The way we generally do induction for people who are in some level of withdrawal.

364
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:48.660
Jonathan Figg: Is I'm started that dose based on how much oxy code, you were taking. It's a close estimation, there is no perfect conversion because they work differently.

365
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.850
Jonathan Figg: But

366
00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:00.810
Jonathan Figg: The one tablet is likely to stop your withdrawal to a great degree without being so much that makes you drowsy.

367
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.690
Jonathan Figg: Then we're trying to find the balance.

368
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:09.390
Jonathan Figg: The way you would do this is you would fill it with the pharmacy.

369
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:21.840
Jonathan Figg: You would take the first tablet dissolve it under your tongue. It usually takes five to 10 minutes to dissolve and then you don't eat, drink or smoke for at least 15 minutes afterwards, just to make sure everything's in there it's absorbed.

370
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.650
Jonathan Figg: And then you wait about two hours and evaluate your withdrawal symptoms, we would start this today.

371
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:41.430
Jonathan Figg: You would evaluate your withdrawal symptoms to decide, am I still having diarrhea and my still feeling the withdrawal symptoms that I currently or were feeling more do I feel better.

372
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:53.490
Jonathan Figg: Because if you feel better from those great we at least film The dose. They got you out of withdrawal. If you still have some withdrawal symptoms, then if it's been two hours, you can take another half tablet dissolve.

373
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.590
Jonathan Figg: And then the same thing. Wait two hours reevaluate. Does that make sense.

374
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.330
Dottie Newton: It does.

375
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.250
Dottie Newton: So where are you telling me don't

376
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:12.840
Dottie Newton: I think I misunderstood. This one part don't smoke, drink or eat until it dissolved or two hour

377
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.810
Jonathan Figg: For at least 15 minutes after you dissolve it

378
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.610
Dottie Newton: Okay.

379
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.340
Jonathan Figg: It's just to make sure everything gets absorbed into your time.

380
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:27.540
Jonathan Figg: You don't want to wash it down and then not absorb the medication and get no effect and still be able to draw

381
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:40.470
Jonathan Figg: And then that that's the first the first priority is to get you out of withdrawal. The second priority is to get you more functional. And that's a longer

382
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.830
Jonathan Figg: Course, a time

383
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.640
Dottie Newton: To finish.

384
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.900
Jonathan Figg: Off the dose to get you there.

385
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:47.610
Jonathan Figg: But

386
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.810
Jonathan Figg: No, but I would start there. And so

387
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.890
Jonathan Figg: Those are the two things that I would start with and then we'll see if we can find your aunt abuse.

388
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:10.140
Jonathan Figg: It's important to know buprenorphine safer than oxy cotton from an overdose standpoint that mixed with alcohol and things that make you drowsy.

389
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:21.570
Jonathan Figg: People can still get hurt. So, you know, just the same as oxycodone, so it's not without risk, but it's certainly lower risk and then they actually kind of and I think it's likely to

390
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.640
Jonathan Figg: Do hopefully a better job of getting you functional

391
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:34.830
Jonathan Figg: As we work through this, my goal would be to get you in as little pain as we can.

392
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:41.010
Jonathan Figg: In amazing side effects with as much functionality as we can, but

393
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:50.940
Jonathan Figg: In all likelihood, you still need to go find a maybe a different orthopedic surgeon. If you didn't have such a good relationship, the last one.

394
00:37:52.890 --> 00:38:04.020
Jonathan Figg: To talk about a knee replacement because that's probably the road you're on whether you're at that destination yet is different, but that's probably the road rod.

395
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:05.910
Jonathan Figg: Because

396
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.980
Dottie Newton: I know. I just don't want to hear.

397
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.050
Jonathan Figg: For most people who are bone on bone.

398
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:22.470
Jonathan Figg: If that's the level of arthritis. You're at regardless of the other things that most likely causes you significant discomfort. Anytime you're active

399
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:31.620
Jonathan Figg: At rest it shouldn't hurt much but anytime you're active that's problem and a knee replacement in the overwhelming majority of people at least reduces that

400
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.010
Jonathan Figg: And give them more mobile than they were so

401
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.360
Jonathan Figg: But, but that's that's a conversation for an orthopedic surgeon

402
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.890
Jonathan Figg: So yeah, okay.

403
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.000
Jonathan Figg: What questions or concerns do you have

404
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.480
Dottie Newton: Um, how do you

405
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.760
Dottie Newton: Okay, how do you prescribe medication for me here in Washington.

406
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.650
Jonathan Figg: So I can send it pretty much all prescriptions are sent electronically now.

407
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:08.400
Jonathan Figg: You know, we don't we don't tend to hand out paper scripts anymore. So just the same way, your other doctors do I can send a prescription to your pharmacy.

408
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:18.090
Jonathan Figg: You know electronically here. Sure. We have her pharmacies information Republic drug on Clark Street.

409
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:20.520
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

410
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:26.400
Jonathan Figg: So that's what we do is I would send a prescription

411
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.900
Jonathan Figg: When is the last time you filled your gap.

412
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.560
Dottie Newton: Um, I do have plenty of that.

413
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.140
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, three months.

414
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.250
Dottie Newton: Script. I don't get a three month to your I wish they did.

415
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.270
I'm

416
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.420
Dottie Newton: Think

417
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.680
Dottie Newton: I've probably got ad left

418
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.290
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so you just felt a few days ago. Okay.

419
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.180
Dottie Newton: Okay, yeah.

420
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.780
Wait.

421
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.790
Jonathan Figg: Until you're closer to being out to send a new prescription for that.

422
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.820
Jonathan Figg: Because if I if I send another prescription. It'll confuse the pharmacy to go. She just

423
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:32.760
Jonathan Figg: Don't want to do that. And when's the last time. Let's see you. You filled your legacy code at the end of March.

424
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:35.160
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

425
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.170
Jonathan Figg: Oh,

426
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.200
Jonathan Figg: You're already at oxycodone

427
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.020
Jonathan Figg: So here's a question. How did you go through a month of oxy Conan in two weeks.

428
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.040
Dottie Newton: I'm I did that.

429
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.910
Dottie Newton: I got off schedule my husband's also on oxycodone

430
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.860
Dottie Newton: And I got off schedule by taking two months too much.

431
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.300
Dottie Newton: So we kind of go back and forth, back and forth. So I had to pay him back some of mine.

432
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.800
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so you use each other's medications. OK. OK.

433
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.650
Dottie Newton: Now, I'm out.

434
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.950
Jonathan Figg: Gotcha. Okay, so, so you were taking more than four times a day, or for pills a minute.

435
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.740
Dottie Newton: I have. Yeah.

436
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.720
Jonathan Figg: Okay, how much, how much were you taken

437
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.760
Dottie Newton: I've taken as much as five and a half, okay.

438
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:41.550
Jonathan Figg: The it's important, so that I can try and understand how how much buprenorphine. We're going to need

439
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.380
Jonathan Figg: Okay, like I said, there's no judgment in this call and this is what I do for a living.

440
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.850
Jonathan Figg: And many, many people are in similar situations to what you're going through.

441
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.080
So,

442
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.610
Jonathan Figg: So, so up to five and a half or more than that.

443
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.780
Dottie Newton: I'm trying to thank the last

444
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.600
Dottie Newton: The last day of took it.

445
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.640
Dottie Newton: Because I know I was going to take the last one, maybe six

446
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.650
Jonathan Figg: Obviously, OK.

447
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.130
Jonathan Figg: So then, then I would still start you with one tablet of buprenorphine.

448
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:31.050
Jonathan Figg: But my expectation was you would be you might go up to two tablets to get you fully out of withdrawal.

449
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.440
Dottie Newton: And just decide or call you back.

450
00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.400
Jonathan Figg: I said,

451
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.010
Dottie Newton: Do you want me to decide that well.

452
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:45.330
Jonathan Figg: I'm not going to be able to monitor which all that's going to be up to you. The goal is the goal is that you're not in withdrawal.

453
00:42:46.260 --> 00:43:00.420
Jonathan Figg: On the lowest effective dose and what lowest effective dose means is the lowest dose, they get you fully out of withdrawal, not like a little withdrawal left not like I feel a little crappy, but I'll deal with it. Like, not in which all at all.

454
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:12.840
Jonathan Figg: Like any medication buprenorphine can have side effects and higher doses. So the side effects with opiates. It makes you drowsy can slow your breathing.

455
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:22.830
Jonathan Figg: It can give you abdominal pain or RJ can give you constipation. I mean, be dry now, things like that. So, you know, the higher dose that we go to

456
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:32.940
Jonathan Figg: The more likely we are to hit side effects. So we want to minimize the side effects, get you as functional as possible. Each Other withdrawal. Does that make sense.

457
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.470
Dottie Newton: It does.

458
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:34.920
And

459
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:42.360
Dottie Newton: Yeah, I want you to know when I was taken. I'm going to get very emotional. Now, and I apologize.

460
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.240
Dottie Newton: When I was taking bills. Yes, he takes the 10 milligrams

461
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.240
Dottie Newton: did take as many as 10 of his in a couple of. It's okay.

462
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.600
Dottie Newton: So that was

463
00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.880
Dottie Newton: That it just came to me.

464
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.650
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so I yeah like I said, I think we may get up to two

465
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.760
Jonathan Figg: buprenorphine tablets to get you out of withdrawal.

466
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.180
Jonathan Figg: But let's start there. Let's get you out of withdrawal.

467
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.760
Jonathan Figg: And have your Gavin Penton which should also help

468
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.290
Dottie Newton: And

469
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.340
Jonathan Figg: And work together to get you as functional as we can. Okay.

470
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.900
Jonathan Figg: Okay, what questions or concerns you have

471
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:30.960
Dottie Newton: Struck find out

472
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.530
Dottie Newton: What my dosage of anti abuse was how do I get that back to you.

473
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:44.220
Jonathan Figg: With it. So the first the first point of contact always for us is our virtual care clinic.

474
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.430
Jonathan Figg: Right, so you have their number

475
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:48.270
Jonathan Figg: And give

476
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:53.760
Jonathan Figg: Her zoom number they prefer you know zoom to do face to face stuff.

477
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.600
Jonathan Figg: But it's like the front desk of a medical office so

478
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:06.330
Jonathan Figg: We would call the front desk of your other doctors offices. That's the first step. I would like to schedule a follow up visit for this Friday.

479
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.070
Jonathan Figg: For us.

480
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:14.790
Jonathan Figg: So that we can have another conversation, but my expectation is you'll start at one and probably work your way up to to

481
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:32.490
Jonathan Figg: To get yourself out of withdrawal whatever dose, you get to the gets you out of withdrawal if you if you stop at one great take take one a day if it takes one and a half or two to get you out of withdrawal on the first day that's what you should take the following days.

482
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.630
Okay.

483
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:45.720
Jonathan Figg: And then if you have any questions if you run into any problems, your first point of contact is the virtual care clinic and they can pass on messages directly to me. Okay.

484
00:45:46.110 --> 00:46:00.450
Jonathan Figg: Okay. And if if there's something that I need to get back to you about before Friday will try to either schedule another video visit like this, or I'll give you a phone call. If it's more urgent or something like that, but

485
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:06.480
Dottie Newton: So, so I'll let the virtual clinic know how much

486
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:07.680
Jonathan Figg: You've

487
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.020
Dottie Newton: Taken and then

488
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.660
Dottie Newton: You'll try to find it nationwide. For me, or how does that work.

489
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:29.910
Jonathan Figg: I would like you. One of the things I'd like you to do. So there's going to be a little bit of waiting time to get your pharmacy to fill the script. And while we're waiting, if you can call your insurance company and ask them if they have a mail order pharmacy.

490
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:39.840
Jonathan Figg: And can give you because I don't know which may or your insurance company and the preference would be to us there so that it's covered for you.

491
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.600
Dottie Newton: I'm Martin Molina

492
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.290
Jonathan Figg: Right, so

493
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.850
Dottie Newton: I, I have not paid one dime for prescriptions since we've been here.

494
00:46:48.780 --> 00:47:06.240
Jonathan Figg: The while that's true. If they say for instance. Oh, we use Caremark and then we send a script of silver scripts and they send you medications Molina my kid back and say that was out of network. And I don't want that to be the issue some insurance companies have all sorts of rules.

495
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:18.180
Jonathan Figg: And now job is to play within the game. Unfortunately, just so that it doesn't cost you money. So what I'd like you to do is call Molina and ask them if they have

496
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:31.200
Jonathan Figg: A mail order pharmacy that they prefer. And if they say yes. Can they give you the contact info so that you can call the mail order pharmacy and find out if they have to be

497
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.450
Dottie Newton: OK.

498
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.210
Jonathan Figg: OK.

499
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:45.480
Jonathan Figg: And then if you're if you're successful in that or if you're not let the virtual clinic know

500
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.040
Dottie Newton: Okay.

501
00:47:47.340 --> 00:48:01.980
Jonathan Figg: Because if you are successful in the sea. Yes, we have interviews that I can send a script for and if not, then we can work to try and find another pharmacy at the does. I cannot guarantee that we can find it will just try and do our best to

502
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.080
Dottie Newton: Understand

503
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.880
Dottie Newton: I did you have made to start

504
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.500
Dottie Newton: The other medication today a calling that in today.

505
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.890
Jonathan Figg: I'm going to send that script right after we disconnect here.

506
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:32.070
Jonathan Figg: Okay, and our general expectation is that for most places it gets filled within an hour or so, sometimes their supply issues. If this is not a common medication at the pharmacy feel

507
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:40.770
Jonathan Figg: Something like that. So what you can do is in an hour, call the pharmacy and say, Hey, were you able to do that. Yeah.

508
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:48.810
Jonathan Figg: So, you know, or something like that. Let our virtual clinic know so that we can try and find it. Other pharmacy or, you know, fresh new paperwork or whenever

509
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:50.700
Dottie Newton: You're gonna
