5
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I said I don't know why. Maybe there's just a influx of clients or groups or something.

6
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.970
Matthew Montano: Oh, they're really busy.

7
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so.

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.880
Matthew Montano: I took a little while for them to sign me

9
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But they did.

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.210
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.770
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.020
Matthew Montano: Yeah, if you if you text me they finally they finally got me.

13
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.280
Matthew Montano: Move my living room around. So it's kind of weird my new setup.

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it sure I'm right in front of you. Yeah.

15
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well let's let's just, um,

16
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.330
Matthew Montano: Well, I have to move this couch right here. It's actually over there but for the lighting.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, I like it because I can see really well. Okay.

18
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we talk about current events, we run the risk of you're missing out on some clinical interventions, what would today be like if we didn't do that we did today a little differently and did some therapeutic techniques.

19
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.050
Matthew Montano: Okay, that sounds good.

20
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.210
Matthew Montano: But I've lot going on the

21
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Well way just but you get to decide if what you need more than anything else is to have another human being, tell you you're not crazy. You're not alone.

22
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And have somebody else's perspective. And what I have planned comes to a screeching halt. If that's the bigger need and you need to offload a bunch of stuff, then that's what we'll do.

23
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.550
Matthew Montano: Or we can practice techniques, he said. Uh huh.

24
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.650
Matthew Montano: Okay, I think.

25
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.150
Matthew Montano: Just, just a little bit. I got a little bit to talk to you about it.

26
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me, tell me.

27
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.230
Matthew Montano: Okay, so I've been so mean. Brian split up. It's been like three weeks now and

28
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.150
Matthew Montano: So just

29
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:43.410
Matthew Montano: It's it's it's a process. Getting used to coming home at the end of the day, and had not having somebody here and that's been really lonely and I feel like my depressions been kicking in a little bit at those times.

30
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes sense.

31
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:59.130
Matthew Montano: And I've been going to the gym, like I have a friend. I'm going to the gym with like every day, three hours a day. So that's like my new my focus, but still, like, I've always had depression and it's really kicking game now that when I get lonely, you know,

32
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400
Matthew Montano: Like, I wonder what he's doing.

33
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.750
Matthew Montano: You know, that type of thing. Okay.

34
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are calling it depression. Tell me more about what the different signs are for you that you got that depression, when you sing.

35
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.870
Matthew Montano: It just when I feel lonely I thoughts can get really negative like I can start thinking by. Am I going to be alone for ever.

36
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.890
Matthew Montano: Because I feel like I

37
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.170
Matthew Montano: worked so hard for a relationship for a year and then I don't know if we'll get together back together not it's

38
00:03:47.070 --> 00:04:00.630
Matthew Montano: With this has happened before ovary been apart for a month they got back together, but I just, it seems like we're doing too much fighting and it's never going away. Right. So I don't know if we can get back together.

39
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But the thought you're concerned about the most is

40
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:16.830
Matthew Montano: My mind starts going really negative like am I going to be alone forever. Like, I don't want to get up tomorrow, it just starts kicking into depression.

41
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:27.960
Matthew Montano: And it affects my body. You know, like makes me lazy and stuff. And I've been. I've been back to go to work. I've been going to the gym and stuff. So, but it's just that time at the end of the day.

42
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So you say,

43
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:40.080
Matthew Montano: No, I'll even close myself off where I will. What I can call people I can call friends like invite friends over, but I'll close myself off at the end of the day.

44
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So for the most part it's after work, is that right

45
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.770
Matthew Montano: Yeah, after work. And then after work. I've been going to the gym and then when I get home.

46
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so when you get home. So that puts it up. What time typically

47
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.870
I'm

48
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.030
Matthew Montano: Around

49
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.520
11:11pm

50
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.040
Matthew Montano: Because I get off from work at night.

51
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:20.700
Matthew Montano: And then I can't. I won't, because I REMEMBER, RYAN nice work late so we safely. So I'm getting into that habit of pharmacy brown to we sit bossy, but ground for he's gone for work at three, so like I'd fall asleep, and then he went back up.

52
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.210
Matthew Montano: I don't go into work till till three o'clock PM. So, you know, I could sleep. Anything you

53
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.410
Matthew Montano: But I'm starting to get into the habit to go to go to bed a little bit earlier. But, you know,

54
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.360
Matthew Montano: That that depression. When I feel that depression feeling it worries me.

55
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, what are you worried about

56
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.750
Matthew Montano: I don't think I'll do anything like I've never liked hurt myself or anything, but it's just my mind gets so maybe

57
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're afraid of something because you're telling you're making sure I'm really hearing you around the I'm worried

58
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.130
Matthew Montano: I'm afraid of that pain. It's just, it feels like pain.

59
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.950
Matthew Montano: I get so down that it just feels like pain.

60
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.610
Okay.

61
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And

62
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you willing to do something different so that you don't feel the same.

63
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.310
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I was thinking maybe I need a I used to take like a depression medication for a small

64
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.110
Matthew Montano: Bit of time.

65
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You would go to a medicine before you would just change some things about your lifestyle.

66
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.740
Matthew Montano: Know I'm open to changing things about my life so

67
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's see what's possible here because this isn't depression, you're in a breakup. You're just sad.

68
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't take a pill because of a broken heart.

69
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.630
Matthew Montano: Okay.

70
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a really old way of thinking just now.

71
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. Hey, you don't like being alone.

72
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting. I can't wait. I love being alone. I like my own company. What

73
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

74
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.900
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

75
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's

76
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:21.330
Matthew Montano: I do like being alone, but I, we were together for a year and I got used to have it that best use my best friend there, you know,

77
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.520
Matthew Montano: For the last three

78
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.000
Matthew Montano: The last three months, we were growing apart what's up.

79
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened to you.

80
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why are you not a good friend to yourself.

81
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.400
Matthew Montano: And I am I do take care of myself and, you know,

82
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.430
Matthew Montano: Like last night when I laid down. I was just thinking like

83
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:56.220
Matthew Montano: I hope he's not already been with somebody or hope you stop being with somebody else right now and that those thoughts, just like kill me. Is that normal I kind of obsessed over those things.

84
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it's normal, but it doesn't mean that that's going to make you happy.

85
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not separating your now you're living in a fantasy, you're still in a relationship with him. It's just so hypothetical up in your head.

86
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.280
Uh huh.

87
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's back up.

88
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm interested in the I'm only part I'm interested in understanding that, do you want to understand more about

89
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Why it's so painful.

90
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.910
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah. I'm curious to

91
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if there's some history behind it.

92
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people emotional distress the big stuff and maybe lonely, the one for you is experienced in the brain in the same place as physiological pain. So it can be a heartache really can feel like heartache and can really feel like Cain.

93
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.580
Matthew Montano: Yeah, it does.

94
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

95
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:07.350
Matthew Montano: And I want to be able to just light it up. And when I get that I know I'm getting depressed because I can't make enough all day. I'm just thinking of

96
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:15.630
Matthew Montano: If I'm not thinking about what he's doing, which isn't all day. That's just towards the end of the day, I'm worried about, Oh, I gotta pay my bills. Now I gotta pay everything on my own.

97
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:27.990
Matthew Montano: I gotta make sure to go grocery shopping. I just think about everything about to do. And there's no like joy in it, you know, and I feel like when I was in a relationship there is

98
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.670
Matthew Montano: That was a little bit of joy. But you know what I mean.

99
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying to collaborate and plan paying for things together shopping together cooking solving problems together felt good. Yeah.

100
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.560
Matthew Montano: Makes it makes it a little bit easier. It's. That's why I wanted that relationship so bad.

101
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds a lot like I don't want to solve problems on my own. I don't want to

102
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, it's back to the although you say you really like your own company.

103
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it may be more. It's a little bit more investigation. So let's see if we're onto something with the alone.

104
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of walk it back, turn, turn off the eyelids close them down for a second. If you're comfortable with a minor close. I'm not staring at you. I'm doing the same I'll share with you and try and figure out the alone.

105
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to go back in time and see where's that earliest experience for you of discomfort.

106
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And tolerance, an aversion.

107
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And almost is this going to last forever. This the sense of being alone.

108
00:10:50.640 --> 00:11:00.570
Matthew Montano: I guess that would be when my mom and dad started having a lot of problems with arguing and then it led up to them divorcing

109
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:10.650
Matthew Montano: And it kind of that gave me major trust issues because my, that's what I think we're my trust issues initiated from because my mom to you though my dad.

110
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now.

111
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You had an image of something. What we picturing

112
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.100
Matthew Montano: I was picturing them arguing. I was picturing

113
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:33.510
Matthew Montano: When they split up. How, how sad. My dad was for a while. My dad's not sad at all anymore. He's remarried, he's happy, successful but you know I never saw my dad sad. And I remember seeing him sad.

114
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: For

115
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.690
Matthew Montano: What's up,

116
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever seen him sad before

117
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:48.240
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and I see my mom said a lot of my life. My mom's always dealt with depression and she still deals with that but you know i don't i don't see her very often.

118
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.960
Matthew Montano: Right Now she lives in another city and

119
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.350
Matthew Montano: We don't communicate that much because she's you know she she's pretty negative

120
00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.940
I remember

121
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Here with the symmetry. So it's

122
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Arguing in this memory.

123
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long did that argument last

124
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.760
Matthew Montano: It was

125
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:24.900
Matthew Montano: Very together for I think 20 something years, um, they're arguing for like about the the whole time I was in high school, since I was a freshman.

126
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.090
Matthew Montano: Till I graduated and they that's when they got a divorce. After I graduated

127
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When they argued for years.

128
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you doing

129
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.420
Matthew Montano: Um,

130
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:58.620
Matthew Montano: I got used to it. I would block it out. I would go out smoke weed with friends, I would lock myself in my room, you know, get on the computer play video games or whatever.

131
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:08.100
Matthew Montano: I and I used to go to the gym. That's why going to the gym is always been a coping mechanism. I went to the gym for years.

132
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.380
Matthew Montano: I did a lot of blocking it out. I never, I never dealt with those emotions.

133
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion. Are you talking about

134
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.220
Matthew Montano: Just about how um

135
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.590
Matthew Montano: But trust issues. I guess that's why

136
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you playing therapist.

137
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What what emotion.

138
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What were they

139
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.730
Matthew Montano: Sadness.

140
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:42.990
You were sad.

141
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.810
Matthew Montano: Just worry

142
00:13:50.970 --> 00:14:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You were worried sadness and worry and you ended up now. Is there an effort to how old was this, you were 15 that's when it kind of started

143
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.820
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah about there, maybe even 14 yeah

144
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:15.030
Matthew Montano: Well, when they were they were made for 20 something years and they were happy for the longest time in the last four or five years. I guess my mom.

145
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:22.230
Matthew Montano: Thought she started going through a depression and there really wasn't a reason for depression you know you we none of us ever understood it.

146
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so your picture and your mom and dad aren't even arguing and it's almost like you can picture years of it.

147
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you felt sad and worried. And what were you worried about when you see them arguing

148
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.900
Matthew Montano: I'm

149
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.280
Matthew Montano: I was kind of worried that they weren't going to get that they were going to get divorce.

150
00:14:50.880 --> 00:15:06.090
Matthew Montano: But I remember it became so often that sometimes I would hate seeing inviting you would bug me so much it would make me sad and then angry that I remember like my dad was the more level headed one. So I would tell him why don't you guys just get a divorce and we're telling him that

151
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What did he say when you offer that as a solution.

152
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.720
Matthew Montano: My dad would talk to me about it. He would like

153
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:31.050
Matthew Montano: If we talk about it now. He's already. He's all it probably was best that we got a divorce. He's a member, you see that when you're younger and

154
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.000
Matthew Montano: You know what, what would, would you ask him.

155
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, what did he say when you offer that solution back then.

156
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.710
Matthew Montano: He wouldn't necessarily say nothing to that right away. Um,

157
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:57.570
Matthew Montano: My dad was really good about talking about me. Like if they're arguing, we would we would talk about it and you know

158
00:15:59.370 --> 00:15:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

159
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:12.960
Matthew Montano: I don't feel like that that. Okay, so that gives me trust issues, but I don't feel like going back into those things really does anything. It's not like that's gonna be. I just want to learn how to deal with my trust issues.

160
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear that.

161
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think they came out of the blue.

162
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:33.960
Matthew Montano: They started from them from seeing my parents relationship not working out just basically that's it. Like I've dealt with all those little details of them arguing and stuff like I'm I feel like I've dealt with all that that's not really that doesn't bug me that much.

163
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that might be. So what do you know that you also said, I haven't dealt with these emotions.

164
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.070
Matthew Montano: Uh,

165
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.240
Matthew Montano: Yeah but yeah I did say that but

166
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.480
Matthew Montano: I really don't. I really don't feel like

167
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:58.860
Matthew Montano: That so much. Is it because I've had relationships. I've had like four serious relationships and I want to learn to get to know how to make those work.

168
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So how are you feeling right now.

169
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.830
Matthew Montano: I just want to know how to fix it. It's frustrating.

170
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Frustrating. Is it also. Are you feeling in patient

171
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.090
Matthew Montano: Um,

172
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:37.080
Matthew Montano: I feel like when I feel down like this and I do have a reason to feel down, I get frustrated with myself because I can't get out of it, or I want to get out of the quicker. I'm like, those being sad isn't

173
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:46.590
Matthew Montano: It. Yeah. Being being sad isn't valid. You can't just sit. You just can't sit around and besides, got to get out of this. You got to get out of this. So like

174
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right. Now notice that you did it in here too.

175
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You got impatient with where I was going, what we were doing that I'm off course.

176
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: not fast enough. You already know the origin of your mistrust and is it just that obvious. Your mother cheated. Is it, are we just supposed to go there and you got it all figured out.

177
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.410
Matthew Montano: Um,

178
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.630
Matthew Montano: I've had that was years ago, though, so I've had a long time to to kind of deal with those emotions.

179
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.370
Matthew Montano: And then there's a set of bad relationships after that.

180
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.400
Matthew Montano: And I feel like I was the problem in those relationships. You know, sometimes

181
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.240
Matthew Montano: Because I feel like

182
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:58.110
Matthew Montano: I feel like when I saw my mom and dad arguing a lot when I not so much with Ryan, but with my ex in the past like my first boyfriend that I had out of high school, I feel like when you start arguing

183
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:08.490
Matthew Montano: I would remember the way my mom and dad argued, and if I felt like I was becoming like that. Like it would. I would automatically get really angry and start

184
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.830
Matthew Montano: Saying negative stuff. And if I got angry at the person hurt me.

185
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you'll do it differently next time to learn communication skills and you'll address it.

186
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So this course of discussion has

187
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Many times off and it moves very quickly away and move over here, over here, it doesn't seem to be okay good enough to just sit with this discussion.

188
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want it. I don't want to feel. I don't want to talk about the sad. I've already worked through it. You want to you want to talk about what to do with your anger.

189
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.580
Matthew Montano: It's, I guess I'm frustrated right now cuz

190
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.790
Matthew Montano: I like I said, I've been feeling depressed,

191
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

192
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also said you're not patient but you present in a hurry.

193
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to feel sad. I don't want this depression. You want to take a pill. What is it, let's get okay

194
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that's not the way psychotherapy works it's slow. In fact, it's taking a tiny little snapshot and you could sit there for 60 minutes. It's the opposite of

195
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What we've done in here. Move. Move. Move. Move. Move. Nope, it's not that you don't get to feel something, and really know whether it's true or not, because you're moving on your ruling it out so fast. We don't get to actually find out how if there's any truth in there.

196
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just go a little bit slower and see see what's there.

197
00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.520
Matthew Montano: Okay, I'm trying

198
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I hope you're seeing that you, you want a solution. You want some answers. You want to have a healthy relationship.

199
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not willing to sit with this discussion around being alone. And so you really quick one. And answer for me. How do we get and it just reinforces the fact that you can't sit with this information, so it's it's like playing real time here. Yeah, your

200
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.740
Matthew Montano: guide your heritage day here know

201
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Matthew, you're not, you're not going to be alone.

202
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.980
Matthew Montano: Yeah, it wasn't turned around.

203
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You are adept at doing that. Actually, you've done it many times right in session very skilled massive, you're not going to be alone.

204
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.550
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

205
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.790
Matthew Montano: You know and I know that deep down

206
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.070
Matthew Montano: It's just scary been alone for a little bit.

207
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the problem with you being alone sit with it a little bit longer, don't run away from it. I understand that you have to just

208
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.620
Matthew Montano: Put on

209
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your cell phone bill pick another bill which bill is it that she sat there and he is it rent. Is that the one like now I have to be

210
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:29.700
Matthew Montano: Oh yeah, he was he was paying half of their rent, but I'll be able to afford it. You know, I just won't have as much extra cash. What it is is

211
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:41.490
Matthew Montano: I just thought, I think I just kind of thought about, I don't. I still don't want to lose him. I still see myself with him for a longer period of time, he treated me good.

212
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.690
Matthew Montano: A lot. What's, what's that

213
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't believe you.

214
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.010
Yeah.

215
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, huh.

216
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.190
Matthew Montano: When

217
00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:06.900
Matthew Montano: When it was good. It was good. But when it was bad. It was like, well, the things that would bother me about him. He would never change. That's what it was. It was like he would never and he would always play the victim.

218
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But Matthew your reference point of what a healthy relationship is is relevant to this discussion. What is in a relationship with the self is relevant to this discussion. If you don't sit with whether you have a healthy relationship with yourself.

219
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty common for someone to say your destiny is just to repeat the same thing here. Yes.

220
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and your reference point is, well, my relationships are so much worse. I'm making progress.

221
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not the same thing.

222
00:23:47.190 --> 00:24:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: you're uncomfortable with being alone, but how are you supposed to grow. How are you really supposed to find out what your, your standards are what you're going to tolerate and what you're not give you some time to do some healing.

223
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But you want to

224
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to jump into another one. What does that say about your self esteem. What does it mean sit for a second with it.

225
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.180
Matthew Montano: Well before I was with Brian I was single for two years, like two and a half years.

226
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you did with those years.

227
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.680
Matthew Montano: I think what it was is that I didn't get a chance to really

228
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.270
Matthew Montano: Have fun with myself because I was dealing with the addiction so bad.

229
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You are inactive us for those two years.

230
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:50.190
Matthew Montano: It was it was before I was well I maybe like one and a half of those years it was before I got with the last doctor, I was with for the Suboxone so I was buying enough Suboxone off the street like I've just been taking Suboxone for so long. So it was a huge financial theme.

231
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lost.

232
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't get lost for easily

233
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's back up just a little bit.

234
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to talk today about a depression that you think is worsening right

235
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:12.690
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

236
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you leaned any new information.

237
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:28.860
Matthew Montano: No, I feel like I've been giving you a lot of good information that not letting you kind of come back. So, yeah.

238
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Be your time one 133

239
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exciting it is exciting. It's exciting to talk about, you know, your impression and you've got big feelings going on.

240
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I asked you, are you willing to do something differently so that you don't feel this pain or the different relationship with pain and I invited a discussion about how old it was

241
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't mind changing it and talking about this thing with those two years where you were single and I'm interested in that one too.

242
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.300
Matthew Montano: Huh, yeah.

243
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not in the area that interest you, because it's uncomfortable so therapy is uncomfortable. It means you're you're stretching those emotional muscles and then you're going to sit with those big feelings.

244
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So she can feel them just a little bit longer.

245
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When you broke up with what's the name

246
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.480
Ryan.

247
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Ryan some recent one was this other during those two years where you were single

248
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.090
Matthew Montano: Oh, before that anything was Jevon

249
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then

250
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So break up with gentlemen you're single and around it to two years it's easier for me, you're single and you mentioned it.

251
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think you told me about them.

252
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.290
Matthew Montano: About what

253
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did you bring up that you have been single for two years after Kevin, why do you think you brought it up.

254
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.700
Matthew Montano: Oh, because you had said.

255
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.190
Matthew Montano: Something about learning how to be happy by yourself and

256
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.180
Matthew Montano: I thought

257
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No answer now.

258
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me some stories about what you did. Were you were happy to me. Get all the way through it.

259
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you were happy.

260
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And sad.

261
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And angry and frustrated broke

262
00:27:41.760 --> 00:28:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Cash Flow was, you know, the whole deal. Give me some stories about how you just did you and you did not know amount with drugs or alcohol or other accesses which we can overworking oversexed, we can oversleep, did you have any time in those two years.

263
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you were chill and just got to know yourself.

264
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.320
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

265
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me some stories about that.

266
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.340
Matthew Montano: Um,

267
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:24.330
Matthew Montano: I feel like one thing I started doing when I was by myself is, um, well, I would hang out with my friends, you know, do all that stuff. Invite them over.

268
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.940
Matthew Montano: I started getting into like decorating my house, making things nice

269
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi during these decorating things

270
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:48.120
Matthew Montano: No, no. Cuz, see if I if I was buying too much Suboxone or whatever. At that time, I wouldn't have the money to buy stuff from my house.

271
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there's other substances, you could be doing. So I'm not that naive. Where are you getting high.

272
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: During that time.

273
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.070
Matthew Montano: No, it's just been Suboxone for like the past four or five years.

274
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:12.600
Matthew Montano: With when when me and Ryan got together. It's been a little bit of cocaine here and there. Okay.

275
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So all these two years where it felt so that's that's the problem with this piece. So let's go back to the decorating.

276
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. How did you know you like to decorate. How did, how did you discover that

277
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:44.850
Matthew Montano: Because I like um well I just started happening. I just started making my apartment. Nice. Find the furniture. I wanted buying a, you know, I got a real nice fish tank and nice table for my kitchen and I just when I come home and I see have a nice home to come home to makes me feel good.

278
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.740
Matthew Montano: I can sit down and be like, you know, I feel good here.

279
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long did that last I feel good here.

280
00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:01.800
Matthew Montano: Of how long did it last. I feel like I'm still like that, that's still something that makes me happy.

281
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: How long can it last after gentlemen.

282
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.670
Matthew Montano: Well,

283
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:23.700
Matthew Montano: I'm well. That's one of the things that was making me happy. And then, you know, that was I met Ryan eventually like what

284
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:39.390
Matthew Montano: I feel like what I'm trying to say is I do, I do have a problem with depression, since I was younger, I feel like it's genetic. My mom has a real bad has real bad depression and I feel like

285
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:47.490
Matthew Montano: That is something that came from her from being a child because I've dealt with this kind of depression feeling since being a child.

286
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So one is environmental and once genetic

287
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So, which isn't she wasn't depressed. If you didn't know she was depressed. You wouldn't be depressed.

288
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:06.660
Matthew Montano: Um, I don't know, I, that's what I'm wondering. Why do I feel like this. Why do I feel emotion so strong, when I break up.

289
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:22.800
Matthew Montano: Why does it consume my body. Why does it. Why do I obsess over him being with somebody else, like why am I picturing him being somebody with somebody else in my head, and it's it's making me feel awful. Like, why is it

290
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We were trying to do that psychology offers that information, but there has to be history taking you're in a rush you want it like a pill handed to you 20 minutes ago you wanted it.

291
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't how this works.

292
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe me. You think I'm withholding some truth that I know something

293
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not telling you

294
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:48.900
Matthew Montano: Know, I believe.

295
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.690
Matthew Montano: I know it takes time. That's what's that's kind of frustrating.

296
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.190
Yes.

297
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier I asked you are

298
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: In addition to frustrated feeling impatient.

299
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said no. But if you look in patient and so

300
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Insight in and of itself isn't going to cut it. You can go read a self help book and figure this out on your own. You don't need me.

301
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You can talk to some friends. I'll give you some pretty good explanations, right, come on.

302
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.380
Matthew Montano: Yeah, good advice.

303
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you too. We got all kinds of resources you can get some some good explanation about why you're giving yourself a hard time. It's not the same thing as experiential learning

304
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it was a decision that was made in the beginning of today, which was you wanted me to hear you.

305
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:49.950
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

306
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Vs.

307
00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Vs experiential knowing not my interpretation, but your truth and that got skipped today and we'll do it another time, but just know that your rush means you're missing out.

308
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: On important things. Okay, so

309
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.060
Yeah.

310
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This depression this depression is depression this depression this depression is depression.

311
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a member of the family.

312
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah cluster of symptoms this depression is it's not a. It's not a set thing that just gets passed down from one generation to the other.

313
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.990
Matthew Montano: I feel like I do feel

314
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:52.230
Matthew Montano: I feel emotion stronger than it's, it seems like I feel emotion stronger than people when I'm happy, I'm super happy when I'm depressed. I'm super depressed. Like I feel like it might be something up in here, something

315
00:33:54.180 --> 00:34:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Out here. I don't know because i'm not i'm not you, but out here. Do you want to know how you present as a consumer of a you

316
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.130
Matthew Montano: Well yeah, I know. I know I had a lot of

317
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want. No, no. Yeah.

318
00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.250
Matthew Montano: Well yeah, I was waiting. No, I do want to know. I do want to know.

319
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.180
You have high energy

320
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Interrupt quite a bit. You're excited you're very smart.

Matthew Montano: Mark Yeah.

323
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, insightful and perceptive and playful night and

324
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:52.170
Matthew Montano: I am being super I feel like I know I'm being kind of negative right now because I'm telling you, I'm trying to handle like you're my counselor. So I'm like, I had a lot of stuff to tell you. Sorry, I kind of like overloaded on you today. I do see I did that. Yeah.

325
00:34:53.010 --> 00:35:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but remember, that's how I started, I said how, what do you want and if it's just going to be that, then you may still you know I maybe I pushed my agenda, which was to do some analysis, you just wanted to really say.

326
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I miss him.

327
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.980
Matthew Montano: Right. Yep. I felt. Yeah.

328
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what I miss him. I think about him. I think about him and and I'm still thinking about thinking about him sad and I miss them. And this is gonna be like this forever. What's he doing and I get that.

329
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.010
Matthew Montano: And I'm wondering, are we going to get back together because this has happened before. And we've gotten back together.

330
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.940
Matthew Montano: I don't feel like it's the end of this relationship yet.

331
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay how so you take that and you say,

332
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let's say I know the answer. And I tell you, and I say, You definitely are getting back together again.

333
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do, how do you run your day DIFFERENTLY NOW, DO YOU NOT PAY THE RENT kind of waiting for him to come in.

334
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.730
Matthew Montano: No, no.

335
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.870
Matthew Montano: No, that's I have money have paid paid my bills, you know,

336
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's not about the rent if you know which of course, only God knows right if

337
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do differently omnipotence is available to you and all of a sudden, you can tell the future.

338
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:22.980
Matthew Montano: And I guess the reason I bring up this relationship so much is because I want to learn how to make a relationship work and

339
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing whether you're going to be back together with them. You think that's the recipe of how a relationship will work. You see how cookie. That sounds

340
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.360
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah cookie.

341
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:36.780
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

342
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow down. So you're because I didn't get to finish my list impulsive. It's the predominant

343
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.970
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Okay. I guess I can't be impulsive.

344
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's the dominant feature.

345
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.430
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

346
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's present quite a bit.

347
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A good, it's not bad, it's just one person's opinion about it but it naked in your way. Sometimes it may be

348
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Opportunities for learning for sort of tuning into someone else you might be missing opportunities that connection of feeling someone's love and affection. And what's this, what's this when you hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

349
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel what was going on at the previous yeah

350
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.130
Matthew Montano: I feel like that was a breakthrough and impulsive, I need to learn how to

351
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you probably been this way, you're either on math right now, or you've been this way, your whole life.

352
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.770
Matthew Montano: You know, I've been the same. I

353
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.220
Matthew Montano: Know that Jesus Christ. I don't have never

354
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I figured. So somewhat so you, you may have

355
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A feature of some some hyperactivity.

356
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be the point of entry. If you want to understand more about how to regulate those those initial impulses to

357
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.750
Write

358
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how where I kept trying to steer us was how do you do around you. It's like, Are you okay with you.

359
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can self examine and see go slow. There's no way you can come up with this quickly. Yeah.

360
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.390
Matthew Montano: I'll go slow. I just had a lot to tell you that's that's what

361
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been asked the question so loneliness.

362
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm alone.

363
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In my sort of impulsivity. How did those How did those two things coexist with you. How do you he live with both of those don't like being alone and diamond impulsive. How do those two things coexist.

364
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:09.990
Matthew Montano: When I'm out in the real world at my job with my friends if those things get in the way. I feel like so I hold all those things in

365
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:28.620
Matthew Montano: Like, I don't want to go to work and be like, I'm having problems with Ryan Like I talk to you about this because the right area for it, but I hold all that stuff in when I'm out. Yeah, I don't I don't ever tell I don't talk about that stuff like that. My job and

366
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be what I'm making up on you do it so fluidly I just assumed all your buddies and friends were here in an earful

367
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.430
Matthew Montano: No, no.

368
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.060
Matthew Montano: No, because I know people don't want to hear that all the time.

369
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

370
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:49.050
Matthew Montano: My friends, there's some friends. I know which friends I can talk to about relationships and stuff.

371
00:39:50.070 --> 00:40:00.540
Matthew Montano: Like that I've a really good friend named Wendy, um, she has a girlfriend and we talk about she really listens really well and that's who I

372
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.760
Matthew Montano: took a year off to and she gives me a really good advice. Yeah.

373
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not an advice giver, if you've noticed that

374
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I do believe avoid doing that at all costs.

375
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't know what the best thing for you to do is

376
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.390
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

377
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But that shows up. That's the pill right that's that's quick, but it's not hard earned

378
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Not like sitting and coming to this conclusion on your own. That one is with you and you own it.

379
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside of you came from you.

380
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the difference. I don't just say, well, you need to go do this, and you did you do that. The only about the only time I give advice is around shame. I'll say, okay, got a strong opinion that one.

381
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a detox on that one. But the rest of it did just invitations, or you try something else.

382
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back.

383
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you really want to tell me about this relationship. What if I still not heard because I've been still talking a lot

384
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:32.940
Matthew Montano: What am I still like I did. Just think of something, um, because we were talking about. I just told you that I really don't talk about these issues in real life, maybe, except with one friend or two friends.

385
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:44.220
Matthew Montano: And the advice I get from her lot and the things that what the things that bother me about Ryan is she says we shouldn't be together.

386
00:41:45.960 --> 00:42:03.780
Matthew Montano: And I start I and then I and I, the things that bother me about Ryan, I told you, and you've taught you've said, do you want to keep dealing with that and and I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't get back with him, but it's scary because I don't want to be alone. I've

387
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.990
So,

388
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:09.690
your comfort level.

389
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of your experience because of school and bullies and certain things you've seen have go on, you're willing to tolerate

390
00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody else's willing to tolerate

391
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean it's healthy. It doesn't mean this is you know your true love. It just means

392
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: May not be what you really preferred, you may end up really preferring this whole list of these other things. Right.

393
00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just really tolerant of

394
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: misbehaving.

395
00:42:49.110 --> 00:43:04.800
Matthew Montano: Really quick. I just had a thought, what if I feel like, or I know I can be hard to deal with. Sometimes in a relationship that's why I'll put up with a little bit more from somebody else because I feel like I'm I might put off a lot on them. So it might come back at me.

396
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't get legend out that way it doesn't quite work that way, not, not, not in here. So let's see. Are you saying, Oh, you are

397
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What but but

398
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:26.400
Matthew Montano: Like I say, I feel emotions, very strong. So when I come home at the end of the day, I might take out how I'm feeling on him.

399
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.290
Matthew Montano: And I know I would do that.

400
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.190
Matthew Montano: If I had a rough day at work. I'm not

401
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:43.140
Matthew Montano: I'm not. I'm keeping them controlling myself I'm handling my job. I'm doing what I gotta do, but I'm holding that all in. So when I get home in my, in my dump it all out on

402
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.880
Yeah.

403
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You dump it on him.

404
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:59.880
Matthew Montano: If I had a bad day and I'm I it was a rough day maybe I'm feeling angry or I'm in a bad mood. So I'll be like angry towards him.

405
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.010
Matthew Montano: Sure, I'll be short towards him here.

406
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you say

407
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.800
Uh,

408
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.090
Um,

409
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.780
Matthew Montano: I don't listen to him so well say he had a rough day that that day too.

410
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.270
Matthew Montano: I don't listen to him so well.

411
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:38.280
Matthew Montano: Or say he did the did the listing wrong he made a mess. I'm like, You need to clean that shit. You know, I'm like dude, you know, pick up after yourself. You've I've been cleaning up after you for days already

412
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:45.180
Matthew Montano: But I can pick up for your app after yourself today. I think I might be like sure with him and he don't really know why.

413
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so are you trying to say that you are wondering if you're at fault.

414
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.040
Matthew Montano: I'm one thing that

415
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:13.680
Matthew Montano: The reason I feel like I might put sometimes I might overlook his shortcomings and stuff is because I feel like I might be hard to deal with. Sometimes too and I feel like I found somebody who will deal with me, I guess.

416
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.370
Matthew Montano: And then it's not

417
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.690
Matthew Montano: It doesn't sound very good

418
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just not

419
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Really interesting no

420
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:24.780
No.

421
00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:26.700
No.

422
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

423
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That isn't how it goes.

424
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.390
Matthew Montano: Okay.

425
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to be a turd. And you get to be this level, a turd. And that's happy ever after.

426
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Not how that's not how compatibility works.

427
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.520
Yeah.

428
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you need some time alone.

429
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: To talk to me about

430
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What you can say when you come home.

431
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Within being able to say

432
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: My boundaries and not be afraid they're going to leave you instead of being righteous and acting out because the acting out that little tantrum example you gave that is a child's way of handling a situation, but an adult and adult way is

433
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Shipped company. I had a really hard day I'm gonna go hide in the room.

434
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Check on you and a half hour.

435
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, and there I will bite it off.

436
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one version, right, and only feelings. Another version. Oh my gosh.

437
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So much chaos in my head I come, I'm having hoarders house is a mess. Right. And let's just go for a walk. I need, I need to go for a walk.

438
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's 100,000 different versions, but at the core of it is your awareness of yourself, your relationship with boundaries. And again, it's going to be a relationship with you.

439
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to sit with it for a very long, it's not. These are the book that here we are. This is how he is. This is how I am. Are we meant for each other.

440
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

441
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Host just to know that.

442
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:27.780
Right.

443
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:29.730
Matthew Montano: You

444
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Grow if you want to be a better person, whatever that version is of you that you've assessed. I know I'm working on myself. I'm always moving and growing and learning.

445
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but if you want to. That's interesting. And you have the time to do it. But if you spend all of your energy, thinking about this.

446
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm analyzing See we like that.

447
00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It was me. It was just like oh if I wasn't such an ass like 10% less of the time. Can we be together. Yeah, yeah, that's it. No.

448
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:06.090
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

449
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't do that what you have right now is an opportunity to self reflect, you can look at what you liked what you didn't like you just touched on some things that you're not terribly proud of, and that's where a therapy can be helpful.

450
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:20.610
Yeah.

451
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.030
Matthew Montano: And you know what, I'm scared right now because I have been self reflective and

452
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.310
Matthew Montano: In the past,

453
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:35.910
Matthew Montano: I he would want him to come back right away I

454
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:44.400
Matthew Montano: I would enjoy his company right now. I'm still just like I can get over some of the things that are bugging me about him.

455
00:48:46.500 --> 00:49:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So good sit with that you might be butting up against a real preference of yours that might be your gut that might be your intuition, saying, I know this isn't about tolerating someone this person is unkind. This

456
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.550
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and I do get those strong feelings and stuff.

457
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but you go to a funny place you go, well, maybe I'm just too sensitive or something like there's something fundamentally flawed with you.

458
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Where does it come from, you won't sit with me. We can't do any analysis to find out where that's coming from next time you might want to consider, you get more out of it by picking you can say, All I do is obsessive a Ryan and that's what I want to work on today. That's it.

459
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.790
Matthew Montano: Yeah, well, I don't. That's not all I do. It's just, it's just the thing I've been doing

460
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: My point is that you can still have change insight without having

461
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:42.630
To

462
00:49:44.700 --> 00:50:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk these other interventions that we can do, they can access other like unconscious areas or hidden desires. Okay, you get there, but not this Tu, Tu, Tu, Tu, Tu, Tu there's other ways to do it. This

463
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:02.700
Matthew Montano: Is

464
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This what we did was buddy and I won't watch like, I'm not going to tell you what to do. I won't, I won't tell you

465
00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.460
Matthew Montano: I suits me. Yeah.

466
00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I care about you and I am concerned that

467
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to walk away from today and go

468
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Exact same. And yeah, let me think about writing again I think about Ryan. YEAH, WHAT DO I DO WHAT HE DO WHAT I DO WHAT HE DO THE WAY THIS OUT. Hmm, maybe I should call them. I think I'll call him talking with him. Yeah, they'll be great. I don't know.

469
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:42.450
Yeah.

470
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:44.820
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

471
00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: self reflection, you spend time alone and you, you kind of go by.

472
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Loneliness thing and I noticed I really did not want to feel sad. I didn't

473
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about

474
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.210
Matthew Montano: I have a question for you. Should I

475
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.230
Matthew Montano: Start talking to other people. Yet, or is it too soon.

476
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:09.630
Matthew Montano: Not too soon, and

477
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go basic

478
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically are are working through their addiction, they all start relationships for a year.

479
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You have not had a chance to grow up, you are in a really young person and I don't know which parts this the substance use has delayed.

480
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The learning that normally developmental you would have gone along the way. But you're robbing yourself, which means that, let's say it is impulsivity. Or maybe it's selfish. So whatever label you give yourself, you're gonna

481
00:51:46.260 --> 00:52:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna you're gonna wait another five years. And maybe, maybe it didn't have something to do with you and you could have figured it out here with me in the quiet of a therapeutic relationship in the safety of a therapeutic relationship with really don't give a shit about me so

482
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But right the risk is lower love snot on the line. I'm gonna care. Wow, you can do whatever he wants. Yeah, I'm still gonna care.

483
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.160
Matthew Montano: You're

484
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: giving yourself an opportunity to grow up so that you have this healthy stuff to add

485
00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can expect it back. You can say, You know what, I'm bringing a lot of hard work I put into growing up here I. Is it possible that you could do these same things my needs are quiet space when I get home from work.

486
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That that half hour and you will have developed and cultivated self esteem, the ability to just set boundaries and not act out

487
00:52:47.730 --> 00:53:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are able to say, but you're not going to get there if you just try and find some perfect match out there. That's what just about the match, go find the match. Now, you didn't go find another match will go find a match. That's oh my

488
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:01.980
Matthew Montano: God and make it work.

489
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you work, you go, you go find out what you like about yourself. Catch yourself with your friends. Do it. Do it with people that maybe you you know there's not all that intense intimacy.

490
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: take it slow.

491
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

492
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:38.880
Matthew Montano: But there the end you did give me some good advice. That's what I was wanting you like I need to be alone. And I need to self reflect and it's not bad.

493
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not bad. This is

494
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This

495
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's a pretty. A lot of the stuff, especially in group, we talked about has to do with look at the authentic self. What do you really want you. Sure. Okay. Well how's your environment responding to you. Well, guess what you're finding out in real time as you grow. This is the response.

496
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The people

497
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That are drawn to. You are going to start to change the people you're drawn to her in a change. You sure you want to bring in another person. Now, is this who you really are.

498
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Are so then takes a look

499
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.460
At that

500
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to be alone. You're going to be a happy man if you want family, you're going to, you're going to get what you want. You got all the pieces.

501
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you got them all.

502
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But you might end up with an immature volatile chaotic relationship if you don't grow.

503
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's hard. I mean, sitting with

504
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that was me. I gotta do it differently. It's sitting with that again and again and again.

505
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not advice. I don't care. You go get yourself in relationship. Again, I mean that you go do your thing.

506
00:54:52.890 --> 00:55:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But in general, that's what people do in recovery is they first they get themselves really solidified into what do I really want, what am I not willing to compromise anymore that alcohol and drugs allowed me to compromise.

507
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Period. See you later see in group.

508
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:13.650
Matthew Montano: Okay.

509
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.180
