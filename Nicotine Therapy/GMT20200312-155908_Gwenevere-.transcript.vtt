00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, thank you.

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.080
Cynthia We: Very pretty.

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you feel like I'm doing the same thing with it but I getting the big response today.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, yeah.

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.550
Cynthia We: No, you don't normally have stripes in it.

16
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're in there. I just don't

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, they're in there, it must be because I'm seated, maybe you can see the top of my head. More maybe

18
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.690
Cynthia We: File to print so you can because I've never noticed that you had stripe.

19
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: stripe. Yeah.

20
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.300
Cynthia We: Types, it's really

21
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay maybe she didn't sticker, maybe, maybe there's bigger

22
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.640
Cynthia We: Yeah, they're darker.

23
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it's a it's a thing I like them. I like you know

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: became fashionable. Well, I'm not trying to be fashionable. I just, I guess I get tired of look another big white blob on the top of my head.

25
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw a text from you that you were able to accomplish some homework without it moving up into sentences, but a lot of time has passed since then.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.050
How has it been going since then.

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.190
Cynthia We: Right. Um, yes. Uh,

29
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.260
Well,

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.100
Cynthia We: I accomplished that. And I

31
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.100
Cynthia We: Don't know what Scott and I are gonna do about

32
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:13.440
Cynthia We: About Teagan Scott got really mad at me because he I was out working out or something and I came, I came home and he

33
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280
Cynthia We: Was yelling at Tegan

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.440
Cynthia We: And I'm about dishes and homework.

35
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.960
Cynthia We: And I think it was the aftermath of it and

36
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.680
Cynthia We: You know, chicken. I think this happened last week, too, because I'm having deja vu right now as I'm explaining it to like it happened two weeks in a row.

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:52.500
Cynthia We: Where Scott screamed at him got really close to him and his face and scared him and I didn't jump in and I don't know, maybe I'm supposed to

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.780
Cynthia We: But, but one of the things that when I was growing up that really upset me was when two adults came at me at same time

39
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:17.700
Cynthia We: Right. It was, um, it felt it made me feel really small and powerless. So when Scott is dealing with him. I just kind of let it you know i just back off and let them do it and I'm so he got really mad at me.

40
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.280
Cynthia We: He called me upon

41
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Who did Scott did

42
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.450
Cynthia We: I was mad at Teagan. Okay, turn on me go, um,

43
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.850
Cynthia We: Yeah, he's never used that he has never called me that before. Oh, yeah.

44
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Game on with that word, isn't it.

45
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

46
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.050
Cynthia We: I mean, I kind of feel like, you know, as I say, asphalt and all the flight, but I feel like that's like, no, it feels more acceptable.

47
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.620
Cynthia We: I was mortified any also call me a manipulative manipulative

48
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:14.880
Cynthia We: I'm bit and I think bitch or something. And he was just so mad in but he was so mad it taken and it was so obvious to me that he just turned it. He was mad that he wasn't getting worried needed to get with Tegan and he just turned it in and targeted at me, so I'm

49
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.580
Cynthia We: Taken kind of shrunk.

50
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:32.130
Cynthia We: Into his room because then we were too busy, you know, between the two of us. And, um, I don't know that his dishes ever got done whatever Scott was mad about

51
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.020
Cynthia We: That you like to run and I have had since that sentence and I have had

52
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.290
Cynthia We: an easier time of everything, like just

53
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

54
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.380
Cynthia We: Is that I'm

55
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.740
Cynthia We: Not so quick to blow me off and assume it's going to work.

56
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.810
Cynthia We: That's what it feels like.

57
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you probably are seeing something feels like a not just a feeling it's probably a witness of

58
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Tangible measurable things like homework done. He walked here. He picked that up. My guess is it's not just a feeling it's things. Oh, he did what I asked. I don't have to come back a third and fourth time and now lose it on him.

59
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So he's not blowing you off. Yeah. Actually consequence behind your request. So maybe he's starting to

60
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.160
Cynthia We: Respect your one time it seems crazy

61
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To see it does seem like that can't be the only thing going on. But wouldn't that be convenient. Ooh.

62
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I was expecting. There's nothing I was not expecting you to say that to me. I thought what you were going to say to me was, oh, that's all fine and good when it works. Once

63
00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, all he does is, push, push, push back and I don't want to. And I know I don't want to have to take that phone away. You know, I thought we'd be right there.

64
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.880
But we're not alone.

65
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

66
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:28.050
Cynthia We: Listen to me, and respectfully when I explained to him how it was going to go and how I hated it. When I yelled at him and I didn't like myself. He was like, I think you happy to hear that. You know, I'm that that's, I don't want to be like that.

67
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.360
Yep.

68
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: very humbled of you to do that part to include

69
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:53.700
Cynthia We: Greg yesterday. All right, I'm his therapist, and he was in a I didn't go in with him because I was driving little, little kids, but I'm usually healed. He has to be go in when we're in the middle of like when we need to talk about something and we can't talk.

70
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're seeing some things are working

71
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.110
Cynthia We: Yes, seeing

72
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, look at that and quite quickly.

73
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably will backslide hold on review again, you can go pick it up and say, okay, unfamiliar i what i want to do is just kind of lose my temper and all humility humility. Honesty. Honesty.

74
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me refresh. Okay. This is what I've been told you I would do, I got to show you on consistent. So here we go. And that's okay. We don't have to pretend like we are super parent. Like, let's just

75
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.270
Cynthia We: Say, right.

76
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.680
Cynthia We: Yeah.

77
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, like you've been doing this for 10 years and now all of a sudden this stuff. Like, come on. Something's up. OK. And now you see something that isn't working.

78
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.080
Yeah.

79
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been seeing it for quite some time.

80
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because you made a change

81
00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You have changed the whole system. Now, the system will either fight harder to keep itself, the same to keep the positions of power, the way it was, which is

82
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to them was enjoying some whatever piece of power with dad was enjoying it with you. But he may have decided he's going to turn that towards, towards dad and now maybe

83
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe chickens trying to extract the same type of thing that you're giving him he's going to try and get it from dad. I'm not saying this is conscious stuff.

84
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And dad doesn't have it doesn't doesn't kind of know how to do what what you and I kind of orchestrated

85
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So your system is feeling your change.

86
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling it.

87
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're calming down. This is puffing up right

88
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

89
00:08:47.100 --> 00:09:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's predictable. We don't have to catastrophizing we can you saw it, you're like, oh, he that frustration was turned towards me. And were you able to literally calmly say to yourself, that's not about me. I'm not. And there was no shame.

90
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.050
Cynthia We: I'm at first.

91
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.440
Cynthia We: I feel. Yeah, I feel like I held on to myself.

92
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.940
Cynthia We: I will done

93
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.890
Cynthia We: Um, he

94
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:25.110
Cynthia We: He went on and on and was like screaming like in the bathroom screaming and I locked the bedroom door and call the breeze.

95
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: With him.

96
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.480
Cynthia We: And then, um, I went to bed.

97
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:40.440
Cynthia We: And then he freaked out. And once you come into the bedroom and so I let him in. But I didn't feel like we needed to keep talking about it.

98
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:49.110
Cynthia We: I didn't. I haven't think I went to shame because I was really clear that it whatever was going on with him was not about me.

99
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.310
Cynthia We: Okay, I was a little hurt. I guess maybe

100
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I mean, when we're a punching bag. It's hard not to. I mean, hey, you know. Uh huh.

101
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But, uh,

102
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.570
Cynthia We: He did apologize for the

103
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.760
Cynthia We: First things he

104
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Went there that's like, put it on a

105
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

106
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A journal. It's like he went there. Yeah. Okay, so something big. Right, so probably something significant happening for him to his level of frustration, but I want to not move from this piece which is I wanna, I wanna, I want to verbatim. I want to just the way you have it written

107
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we can we can get our pom poms out and celebrate

108
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. I want to respond to my husband's accusations.

109
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

110
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

111
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.580
Cynthia We: Yeah, I feel like maybe I did it.

112
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.970
Cynthia We: I say maybe because um

113
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:03.660
Cynthia We: Yeah I swore a couple times and I'm I don't want to go there, but I feel like it was it was moving in the right direction.

114
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's do the minimalist part here and say,

115
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A spiral would normally end in what if it was a true SHAME SPIRAL for you. What would it, what would it

116
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.500
Cynthia We: Be

117
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:18.870
Cynthia We: Okay.

118
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.360
Cynthia We: He's right. I'm sure

119
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You go there.

120
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.350
Cynthia We: No, it

121
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't make you selfish narcissist because you didn't know

122
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You used sounds like anger, you use some of that right to not get the hurt part the bruising because someone's abusing they're using nasty words as intended to provoke and you used anger to sort of protect self.

123
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I also heard a couple of things. There was, I walked away. I did breathing and I was able to go to sleep you're

124
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000
Cynthia We: Breathing. I wasn't actually sleeping.

125
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

126
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.940
Cynthia We: I was laying there breathing.

127
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.620
Cynthia We: Consciously filling my lungs and my

128
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.630
Breath.

129
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.880
Cynthia We: And and I heard him.

130
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:34.410
Cynthia We: saying all this stuff and I just kept breathing. I was really trying to fall asleep. I really wanted to just go to sleep because he thought I was sleeping so I didn't want to argue anymore, and I'm

131
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:44.610
Cynthia We: Okay. Yes, I heard all the threats. I'm really surprised by how quickly he goes to, we've got to break up like

132
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.590
Cynthia We: It's a

133
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.940
Cynthia We: Probably a year ago, he started, he said something about divorce and

134
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:01.380
Cynthia We: freaked me out because I've always felt very stable. I always felt like no matter how bad we thought

135
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:12.000
Cynthia We: We weren't going to split up, but he used that word free. It might have been longer than that might have been like two years freak the kids out because they heard him.

136
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:19.650
Cynthia We: And so he had to walk it back. But ever since then it's like his go to

137
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:31.620
Cynthia We: If things get too extreme. I don't know what we're doing, why are we doing this we we just, I just don't. I just, we shouldn't be together. And I'm just like,

138
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.430
Cynthia We: I don't believe him.

139
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:43.110
Cynthia We: But I do like part of me does and it freaks me out. Like I I don't know where I stand really

140
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it.

141
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:59.430
Cynthia We: I don't like that. My mom and dad never ever threaten that so they would fight and fight and fight and I thought they'd be together forever. And I felt very safe in that

142
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:07.800
Cynthia We: Even though they were fighting. I felt that our family wasn't going to blow up. You know, we were working together.

143
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.130
Cynthia We: And I don't think he has that same experience of having adults.

144
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:16.890
Cynthia We: Committed

145
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.070
Cynthia We: His, His parents divorced when he was fault.

146
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Me hear a little bit about some environment for a moment. Is he working. Yeah. For how many is it one one week. He's been away or two.

147
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.740
Cynthia We: Um, he

148
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.960
Cynthia We: He worked like three days last week.

149
00:14:47.250 --> 00:15:01.290
Cynthia We: And he has worked. He's there today. And I think he went in on Monday or something. So Monday coming up starts officially he'll be away every day. But coming home at night because this shows in Santa Fe.

150
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

151
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.560
Cynthia We: And the other. There's a rumor that the only going to work 10 hours a day.

152
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.170
Cynthia We: Still a lot. I know.

153
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:15.900
Cynthia We: 10 hours.

154
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, that's still

155
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot, a lot.

156
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.690
Cynthia We: But it needs time off in between.

157
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:38.880
Cynthia We: And something else pretty exciting happened. He got a little bit of money from his dad to help Fernie and they're getting equipment for Stranger Things

158
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:49.590
Cynthia We: Okay, very good things called Scott and said they wanted him to do the show. And he said, I can't because I'm on this other show. I'm like, don't give it to Adam. Give it to frame because Frank is like

159
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.950
Cynthia We: Frank also uses Adams equipment but Frank if you gave it to Adam, what would be Adams forever.

160
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.260
Cynthia We: Frank, Frank.

161
00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Will take that

162
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.860
Cynthia We: But still can be Scott's

163
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

164
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:11.190
Cynthia We: And next year might be Scott, you know, and, and the guy said, the producer said he hated out him and he doesn't

165
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:18.990
Cynthia We: He doesn't want to run Adams equipment. So Frank was like this Fernie have his shit together and Fernie almost does

166
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:33.870
Cynthia We: And so Scott talked to his dead and got the remaining money so that they can do it. So it's not exactly what you want, but it's like you know it's a step in the right direction and it's awesome. So he is feeling good about himself.

167
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.940
Cynthia We: So he'll get like probably 40 or 50% of the lot of the rentals for that.

168
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: She taught or doing

169
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:50.940
She's a mess.

170
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:58.260
Cynthia We: Know, she's, she's good. In some ways, but she's also developed this terrible habit of freaking out.

171
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.640
Cynthia We: Like falling apart. Anytime.

172
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:16.320
Cynthia We: She does something wrong, like like last night. She didn't do her homework and I was like what it's 930 at night. Why, why don't you do your homework earlier. So I get mad and she falls apart and I'm

173
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:28.200
Cynthia We: I see it as manipulation and I'm so she doesn't have to deal with anybody saying, or I don't know but i but i don't really know what to do about it.

174
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:43.260
Cynthia We: Scott was able to sit with her and help her with her homework and she calmed down, but I, she's done it about 10 times this week about different things. And, um, I just want to stop it.

175
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.610
Cynthia We: Because it really rattles me. Yeah.

176
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would it be any different than what you're doing with Tegan

177
00:17:52.200 --> 00:18:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but the same thing. The only thing is I just heard something which was she needed some help. That's it. That's an actual

178
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:00.870
Cynthia We: Yeah.

179
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say why did she do it by 930 you really mean why

180
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.710
Cynthia We: Well, what I meant was, why

181
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:16.140
Cynthia We: Why aren't the adults asking her at 730 where if she has homework.

182
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.010
Cynthia We: She was sitting with Scott down there and

183
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.610
Cynthia We: I'm kind of mad at myself too.

184
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, you know, okay.

185
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.240
Cynthia We: It was it's our job at her age. It's our job to remind her

186
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you can can redo that. Right. You saw so I've happily take

187
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.340
Cynthia We: My alarm.

188
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.750
Cynthia We: I have my alarm set for bedtime. But I should set my alarm for homework to

189
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Write. Okay. So it's the same same process she needs, maybe a little earlier bed time and of course things

190
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.020
Cynthia We: Like, oh my gosh, you

191
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Get done you know before a certain time and you work at

192
00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.340
Cynthia We: Eight.

193
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.710
Cynthia We: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah.

194
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're mad at yourself.

195
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why on your own, it didn't occur to you that what worked for Tegan would work.

196
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter and

197
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:25.350
Cynthia We: Lola. I usually just asked her, she has homework and she does it.

198
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: She nine yet. How old is she,

199
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.890
Cynthia We: Shall be nine on Monday.

200
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.470
Cynthia We: Her friends started her period this week.

201
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.150
We have a

202
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple of my mind.

203
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Days. I just

204
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.690
Know,

205
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:53.820
Cynthia We: Oh, and her dad. She doesn't have a mom. So I went and I bought her that she did her dad was like

206
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.250
Cynthia We: Well,

207
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.270
Cynthia We: Of course I will go to Target and I will get you some items and then

208
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some education.

209
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.230
Yes. Okay.

210
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what else. How is it. How's mom has a relationship with mom.

211
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.270
Cynthia We: I'm good. She paid for kids camp this summer.

212
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.830
Cynthia We: For half and

213
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:39.150
Cynthia We: was thrilled to do it. And then she's been asking what lower one for her birthday, and she's excited. I'm just grateful for her, that she's so excited about the kids. Yeah, um,

214
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.350
Cynthia We: Well, it turns out we're going to Michigan in May, for a wedding.

215
00:20:49.050 --> 00:21:05.010
Cynthia We: And it turns out the kids are not invited, which is good because ticket of a performance on Saturday two performances Saturday. So we will leave him and Lola home and probably just fly in and fly out

216
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.450
Cynthia We: On

217
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Sister

218
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:18.780
Cynthia We: And. She's good. She's having some health issues. Oh, and Liam moved back to Michigan.

219
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.370
Cynthia We: Overheard oldest, the one that was talking about coming here.

220
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.530
Cynthia We: Yeah, um,

221
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:40.620
Cynthia We: She convinced him to go to Michigan and she said that if she wanted to do a wellness check on him first and she wanted to find out if he was on drugs, really, I think, before he came here and

222
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.020
Cynthia We: At first he says, screw that. And then somehow it ended up happening.

223
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.380
Cynthia We: And so then she ended up getting them an apartment in a car to stay in Michigan.

224
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.980
Policy 24

225
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.700
Cynthia We: He's got some time in the same rehab. I went to Brighton.

226
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.980
On when he was younger.

227
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.340
Cynthia We: And he's had some

228
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.330
Cynthia We: Some, some troubles.

229
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.230
Cynthia We: He's just lost needs some guidance.

230
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To tough age we're figuring out who we are, you know,

231
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:35.220
Cynthia We: Yeah, it is. And I feel like he probably could have, I mean maybe he'll figure it out again. But, but he's really talented. He had a scholarship to go to a Center for Creative Studies in Detroit.

232
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:44.520
Cynthia We: He's really talented with that and music and I feel like he might be involved in things that prevent you from doing that.

233
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.560
Cynthia We: And I won't be rediscovers it because I think is that

234
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, to have a natural talent like that you hate to see it not be you know manifested have it reach its full potential. What

235
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.230
Cynthia We: What my problem. So that's good. No problem at all.

236
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Speaking in full potential. How is the I want my career back and

237
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.620
Cynthia We: It's very good.

238
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.340
Time.

239
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:29.790
Cynthia We: Oh well, I am you know I've been working with Helga and I thought I just had these two chapters to do to read redo and like kind of expound on and Sally and Greg from my writing group gave me some comments Friday.

240
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:40.800
Cynthia We: And one of them was great. If Well actually the main one was great. It was just that my first chapter. It's supposed to grab you from the first

241
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:51.180
Cynthia We: Sentence you read mine doesn't or didn't it had like a few sentences several sentences of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

242
00:23:51.570 --> 00:24:09.870
Cynthia We: She's like, so what if you started it right here. This is great. And so I just I just rewrote that and that felt really good to get it done because I'm kind of the last two chapters I don't I'm having trouble with because it involves a lot of reflection and

243
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.620
Cynthia We: You know what, like, thinking back on what this means and

244
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.310
Cynthia We: I have a little bit of a hard time with that.

245
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you don't want to sit with the thoughts.

246
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.560
Cynthia We: Mm hmm. Yeah. Okay.

247
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that would make it hard to write about it. Again, think about. Yeah.

248
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:42.360
Cynthia We: It's hard to it was hard to even edit the second half of the book because all the stuff that comes up because Tikkun came into the scene.

249
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:53.580
Cynthia We: And I have this whole you know impressions. One thing to be a drug addict, but it's like a whole nother thing to be a parent that's addicted to drugs and um, it's really hard for me to

250
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.770
Cynthia We: To sit system in that but but I'm doing it.

251
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.820
Cynthia We: I'm doing it and I'm fixing my L wise you know l wise or foe PA and I use them a lot.

252
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.420
Cynthia We: It's lazy writing and I didn't know that.

253
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Aggressively angrily. Like, we're not supposed to do those thing.

254
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.750
Actually

255
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.490
Cynthia We: Okay, paused on

256
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.650
Cynthia We: Right, yes just it's just

257
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.720
Cynthia We: There's always a better way to say it.

258
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:36.420
Cynthia We: So my goal was to have everything have my query letter out on March 15

259
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.340
Cynthia We: And, um,

260
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.780
Cynthia We: So I can get an agent. Right. Okay. And I'm might fall just a tiny bit short

261
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.360
Cynthia We: Of that

262
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.670
Cynthia We: Because I'm in the middle of writing my query letter M.

263
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:05.700
Cynthia We: And it usually need to write a few times, you know, like five or six times edits to make it perfect and pop and it's my one chance so

264
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.410
Cynthia We: I'm doing that and doing the lies and the last few chapters at the same time. So I think I might fall short by like a week.

265
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.350
Cynthia We: Which is great. I think

266
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.440
Cynthia We: My own deadline.

267
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, it's not just great to set your own deadline and actually

268
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Only be off by a week.

269
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.660
I know

270
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, that's no small feat.

271
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you described, really good. How's my career doing it's feeling really good

272
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.240
Okay.

273
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:58.200
Cynthia We: And I also wrote an essay, like after we did some of that work. I wrote an essay, like, just out of the blue that

274
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.690
Cynthia We: I really like like

275
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:10.770
Cynthia We: I have some ideas on how to make It funnier. But I'm just kind of putting that aside because that's not what I'm supposed to be focusing on right now.

276
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:19.380
Cynthia We: But it, you know, it could be that I send it to I send it out somewhere.

277
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.150
Cynthia We: While I'm working on getting an agent.

278
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many milligrams, you have right now.

279
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway,

280
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.070
Point.

281
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.840
Cynthia We: Two five

282
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.750
Cynthia We: And I'll be group on Monday.

283
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.730
Cynthia We: I'm really worried about the

284
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.230
Cynthia We: Locker.

285
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The what

286
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: rotavirus. Oh, okay. Um, I assume it's that you'll get it. Our family will get it.

287
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.260
Cynthia We: I'll get it. Yeah, okay.

288
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.210
Cynthia We: I don't think anybody in my family would die from it, but I think I might

289
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.390
Cynthia We: Which may or may not be a realistic fear. I don't know.

290
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know either. I

291
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.420
Cynthia We: Am healthy but I smoke.

292
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I thought you were making some efforts to that end, we were filming progress, how you out with that. What, how many cigarettes, which you say

293
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.510
Cynthia We: Hey, I'm

294
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.640
Cynthia We: Playing high five

295
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

296
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:41.100
Cynthia We: I was saying I wasn't five before i don't think i was i think it was a 10 because I

297
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.560
Cynthia We: You know, now I'm actually paying attention to what I'm smoking and it's it's

298
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.360
Cynthia We: It might be cyber six. It depends on how much driving. I do.

299
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.600
Cynthia We: Um, but I'm using that that I'm put off.

300
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:06.510
Cynthia We: Like the last day and I find sometimes I forget about it completely. And then I also after I work out.

301
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.930
Cynthia We: I put that one off. I mean, it's some silly. So after you work out, um,

302
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:23.640
Cynthia We: But, but it feels really good. And I, if I put it off while I'm in the car driving home I can usually just forget about it and not even do it.

303
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.570
Cynthia We: So I feel like some of those tools are are really helping and I'm taking the Wellbutrin that she gave

304
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Me the other side effects, positive or negative from the Wellbutrin you noticing as far as mood make

305
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.970
Things, um,

306
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.030
Cynthia We: No.

307
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:57.030
Cynthia We: I know I had sexual side effects. Last time I was on it, which is why I stopped taking it, but that's not really a problem right now.

308
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it doesn't present itself has an issue.

309
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.220
Of

310
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:10.020
Cynthia We: Saying

311
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I like to be complaining about it, but I am

312
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the complaints. Okay then.

313
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Very funny.

314
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I haven't heard you say is

315
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott's yelling at me about money.

316
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.810
Cynthia We: How I did, yeah. I met with little argument was the other night.

317
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:35.610
Okay.

318
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:51.780
Cynthia We: Yeah, I guess that's why it's so disconnected for me because he was yelling at taking about dishes and then he was mad that I didn't jump in and and save them or jump in and help him with the argument to TN

319
00:30:52.650 --> 00:31:01.500
Cynthia We: But, but what he was mad about was that money because he had looked at the bank account, and I had gotten to sprouts and I bought like

320
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:24.570
Cynthia We: I bought vitamins B vitamins and so I spent like $30 that was not accounted for, um, because we don't really will start the budget. Once we have some money, but we are still in this foggy area of just don't spend anything and I had gone get gas. And yeah, there were like three or four things.

321
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.080
Like

322
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.190
Okay.

323
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.940
So, well, then there was. It was there.

324
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: As your confidence grows and by that I mean

325
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you were able to hold on to yourself.

326
00:31:50.820 --> 00:32:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: In the presence of disciplining Teagan where you're holding on to yourself in the presence of acting out behaviors from Scott

327
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's feeding structurally your self confidence for the you know it or not, it's building

328
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.760
Cynthia We: I know it.

329
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

330
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay even more exciting. If you can even be like, whoa, hey, look at me, I'm vertical. I'm not an amoeba right okay exciting. So as that continues and I keep warning, I keep saying your systems going to notice.

331
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to notice.

332
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What may also happen is you may start to notice more and more around boundaries. I know that phrase right oh boy here we go again. You may start to find what was once tolerable because you weren't worth it.

333
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, is now unacceptable.

334
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying that might happen.

335
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If it does,

336
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe it has, I'm sure. Yeah. So, where, where might show up in order to show up.

337
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.160
Cynthia We: Around money and around the

338
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.990
Cynthia We: The, the questioning, I should, yeah.

339
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:27.960
Cynthia We: I mean, like, I don't really understand why it's okay for him to get gas and it's not okay for me to get out. What I'm the one driving to Albuquerque. My kids all around like

340
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:42.960
Cynthia We: I'm so is that boundaries, just the fact that he doesn't understand that I'm, I'm thinking, same as him. I'm thinking on the cheap. I'm not out spending. I haven't been to all top

341
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.520
Cynthia We: Up and also yes. Okay.

342
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.950
Cynthia We: I'm buying gas for the car so so like that kind of, um,

343
00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:02.370
Cynthia We: The idea that I've been frivolous with gas or frivolous at the pet store is really annoying and

344
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.710
Cynthia We: makes me really mad.

345
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.430
Cynthia We: The idea that only he can grocery shop properly. Thanks, man.

346
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:21.480
Cynthia We: I'm not willing to spend four hours grocery shopping. Yeah.

347
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: No, he said he's going to do that shopping thing, but what

348
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:30.690
Cynthia We: Four hours. The other four hours going to two stores.

349
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.280
Cynthia We: Like

350
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:46.860
Cynthia We: I don't have time. But I he was taking pictures of the ingredients and he was trying to compare it was like it was a little extra some extra time, I was just

351
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.630
Cynthia We: Trying to decide if it was worth it to go all the way

352
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: He can listen. He can

353
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.150
Cynthia We: Do it.

354
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.320
Yeah.

355
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: He wants to budget his mental retinue he wants to budget that mental space for that. That's where he wants to direct it, you've got stories, right, you've got things good

356
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.410
Cynthia We: Things to do

357
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

358
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.900
Cynthia We: And I get once he's at work, and he has things to focus on

359
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Channel all that compulsive detail oriented.

360
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Something else.

361
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

362
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I heard you when you said, is this a boundary. So what I've written down so far as the word questioning

363
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

364
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What you didn't say just now is

365
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Being called names.

366
00:35:45.540 --> 00:36:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Having spit in your face. The yelling that volume that hits this right threats ultimatums about the dissolution of a marriage. You didn't say any of that. What you said was questioning

367
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm noting all these other things. I wonder why you didn't bring those up to me.

368
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.080
Cynthia We: Because I get so I'm

369
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:29.730
Cynthia We: I'm so confused. Like, is it my fault. Maybe it's like maybe I'm doing Winston, maybe I'm making him the way he didn't use stuff like this, so it must be something I'm doing just like he said it's something I'm doing take them.

370
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.900
Cynthia We: Out.

371
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's the old one.

372
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the default operating system. I recognize it.

373
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one that if you kip keep feeding that one that's the one that's going to wipe out

374
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of it a little bit. We can touch on that we can say, oh, I just heard the word

375
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Why didn't you come in and rescue me rescue me ask me, what's my belief on parenting. What's my belief, like we can go inside and self reflect, but I don't know if that's what you're doing.

376
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do when you're here. Let's say we go content will put aside, how he's delivering his complaint.

377
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't rescue me. What's your philosophy on parenting that

378
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:35.640
Cynthia We: I don't ever feel like it's the other parents job to rescue the one parent. And that's not really how we've ever operated with the kids. We don't gang up on them.

379
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not what he said.

380
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:49.920
Cynthia We: His he was expecting me to act in a different way than we always have. We always take like if taken and I have something going on. So that doesn't jump in. It's, um,

381
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But he said,

382
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.440
Cynthia We: He asked him to

383
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Write he said rescue me. Yeah.

384
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.960
Cynthia We: What he meant um

385
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.910
Cynthia We: I like stand next to him and argue with chicken.

386
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.580
Cynthia We: Not rescue. He didn't mean to rescue him. He meant to to to

387
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.250
Cynthia We: I'm

388
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.040
Cynthia We: Co parent. Yeah, well,

389
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.250
Cynthia We: Yeah, I perceive it as ganging up on to

390
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know you mentioned that before.

391
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

392
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:31.860
Cynthia We: I thought that they could handle themselves. I didn't need to jump in because I don't want to King Ubuntu you

393
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice all

394
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:35.700
Cynthia We: Said excuse

395
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I will just come from one other place before we go there, it would just be my opinion. Anyway, but I noticed also that you didn't jump in to rescue taken

396
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.580
Cynthia We: With that, yeah, that

397
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.740
Cynthia We: Via

398
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.440
Cynthia We: Because that was right. He was right.

399
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.010
Cynthia We: diggin Antiguan was being a shit.

400
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:03.900
Cynthia We: So,

401
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:22.950
Cynthia We: I have jumped into rescue team when I felt Scott was outline how and I did feel that night that Scott was out of line going in his face and making ticket backup. So he was scaring him with his size and his about volume.

402
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.280
Cynthia We: But I'm

403
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.960
Cynthia We: Taking kept asking him to stop doing that and kept taking a step back, so I should. Yeah, I probably should have been

404
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:43.680
Cynthia We: putting myself in the line of fire and i don't i'm not just what to do.

405
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just status. Be quiet. Let's just sit with it for a second, that's a big thing that we just talked about, let's just let it, let it sit in the air for a minute. Okay.

406
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.670
Cynthia We: This is our, our family pattern.

407
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

408
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All fixable.

409
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, yeah. Just sit, but we do have to sit with it.

410
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but just for the quiet just just Trista now just, just notice it again just compassionate witness. Take that role on

411
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just compassionate, all I noticed just like that. This is how our family is this is how I have to describe it. Oh, I don't like it. Okay, and then move to the next one. Oh, I heard her say all fixable. What do I do with that. Am I getting shame activated. What's happening to me just run

412
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked a hard question.

413
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

414
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Around rescuing again.

415
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, he was being shipped, but he must

416
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.560
Cynthia We: Have felt abandoned by me.

417
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's a lot of analysis, let's just

418
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.230
Cynthia We: This is, I agree.

419
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we'll focus on you okay he's not here, he made himself clearly put his hand up and

420
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:08.070
So,

421
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember my original question, let's back up, we're getting more and more pieces of the content because I had asked you, when it comes to boundaries and you use the word questioning. I don't, I don't want this questioning. Is that a boundary

422
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I said, well, I noticed you didn't bring up volume.

423
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: In your face. Yeah. Line behavior which would be intimidating scary be intimidating.

424
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And earlier, even before that, I said, There may come a time as your confidence grows at what you tolerate it before you may not want to tolerate anymore.

425
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And what will you do with that. How do you

426
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.700
Cynthia We: Never been able to tolerate it is always upset me

427
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:08.460
Cynthia We: And and I you know I don't know that Scott even sees himself is doing that.

428
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.170
Cynthia We: Like it's such a pattern such a way of

429
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.190
Cynthia We: Getting what he wants that.

430
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.670
Cynthia We: I'm not sure he's

431
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.050
I'm not sure he's aware

432
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a little bit of that. So we know we didn't address the things that you guys didn't bring up

433
00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were together so

434
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was in the room the whole time that was we just it was the elephant is his anger. Your elephant was SHAME. WHICH WE BROUGHT UP I, you know, and his, his anger.

435
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:57.480
Cynthia We: I told him again that it was necessary for him to get some help. And then I have asked him before. Yeah. And he hasn't done anything about it. And, um,

436
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.180
Cynthia We: I would appreciate it if he would

437
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.400
Cynthia We: Find some help. I already given him several references so

438
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:16.050
Cynthia We: But I don't know. What does that mean I haven't followed up before I haven't demanded that he do it. I don't see myself walking out the door. If he doesn't do it.

439
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I know. So, this is this is this weird space of notice how you said, Well, how do you follow up with someone to steal someone else's behavior is not your son. It's not your daughter.

440
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where it boundary comes in.

441
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where it's in the other room if it's intolerable. It's letting this person know I'm changing

442
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Where normally I might scream and yell and match you on that out of line, quote unquote, I'm using your terms. Okay, not mine. Mm hmm. I normally Scott, I might match you toe to toe with out of line yelling and in your face and I would defend my position, the best that I could

443
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't like myself when I do that. And so you're going to probably the same way, we're talking about today. Right. Probably going to see me doing some different things. I'm going to disengage. I can escalate it don't want the kids to hear it. I feel

444
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The wounding, even when I'm the one yelling the wound feels the same as when someone's yelling at me. It has been said that is so I kind of liked it when I read that. I'm like, I feel like that.

445
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I don't want it. So I'm not going to do it. And so you're going to see some things you can interpret it. However, you're going to, but here's it's intense. I need to protect myself from that I'm don't want the kids to hear it. So I am going to do some kind of

446
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Distance a little bit ago in the room. I'll do some breathing.

447
00:44:50.070 --> 00:45:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't follow me, please. I, I insist. Do not follow me. That would feel respectful, you're going to be yelling at that volume. If you are going to be moving your body towards when using your size to make your point, I'm going to notice. And I'm going to, I'm going to walk out of the room.

448
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to ask, Please don't do it to the kids.

449
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're going to see me and this is the part that I don't know.

450
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because a boundary is a line boundary is that space that you are going to protect something

451
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is why I was asking about Teagan

452
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to get involved. You don't want to be in the line of fire.

453
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Reporting might be in the line of fire, he shouldn't be up for taken yeah that's that's the one I know this is a family value and only you can navigate this

454
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But I thought I'd just bring it up, you know, because what you were saying was, you just pulled back. But then your son's little man is putting up with this so

455
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.570
Cynthia We: Okay. So, okay, yeah.

456
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we're sitting with it. We're feeling it.

457
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I was saying as your confidence grows, you're going to be able to write, you notice how your whole body just squiggles and squirmed with that discomfort.

458
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: As your confidence grows, your ability to sit with those will grow and your line might get clearer and clearer and clearer not only yours. But what you'll tolerate in the parenting style with your children.

459
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Which will tolerate with your husband's behavior. So that may start to change.

460
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't make some an adult is something and that's

461
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What we here we can protect ourselves and we can change the rules of engagement. I'm not going to want to talk to you. I won't all walk away while you're talking like that.

462
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And there may come a point where I may, you know, I don't know what the Member how we've done contingencies. I don't know.

463
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've asked you to see someone about it. You, you come back and say, You aren't doing it, which really concerns me because, are you saying you don't see your son, saying, I don't like that.

464
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you're, you're saying you literally don't do that. You don't see your son, putting this pop and

465
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.370
Cynthia We: Taking a step back, we

466
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:24.300
Cynthia We: Need to step back and you crying because you scared him. He's 13 like he doesn't cry easily

467
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So all of that is this whole piece around you and where your line is you're just starting to hold on yourself long enough to even see it. So this is a longer piece of the work that you're going to do.

468
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming

469
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's back up. Let's see what we can say today.

470
00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: In its simplest terms,

471
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were to add another goal. Maybe we'll close one out.

472
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What is something you'd like to see yourself do more of what is something and I need a fraction, don't, don't rush in talking about incremental

473
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What is something you want to see yourself do more of. And it might just be a thought.

474
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What is something you'd like to see yourself to listen.

475
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.550
Cynthia We: I want to be able to

476
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:49.590
Cynthia We: To trust myself and what I feel. And my boundaries and hold on my

477
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.800
Cynthia We: Faith them and hold on to myself I want to be that confidence. Okay.

478
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.470
That even make any sense.

479
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.660
Cynthia We: That's not very eloquently said

480
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's eloquently said it's someone's self trust someone's

481
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: attuning to their intuition is just difficult to measure it relies completely on your self report, I welcome it. But I am reliant on it which means

482
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be conscious means you're going to have to be conscious of it. It means, what's my what it right, you're going to catch it body first. So things we can measure we can say how frequently, am I

483
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: noticing how my viscera my literal, physical body feels right now as these familiar antics are going on. Oh, I just felt it. Okay, well I'm getting better at it.

484
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I not only do it once a week or maybe it's once a month, I have a baseline, I start with. Now I do it three times a day.

485
00:49:54.510 --> 00:50:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so familiar with that I know exactly where it gets activated around anger when someone's passive aggressive or when I'm not speaking my mind it's in a different part of my body. I've gotten really good at it.

486
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something we can do, it's often a first place of well, how do I start, um, because that body is going to respond first to threat to perceived threat before you come up with a fancy word for even you have a good argument put together. It's going to respond unconsciously.

487
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can catch that.

488
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And come back and say, oh, I now have been investigating this and I have a good little theory going here. I think my chest. Does it when

489
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I

490
00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this. Maybe it's my fault. My chest gets tight.

491
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And I do the self blame and of course the predicted shame, what

492
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I caught it. I sat there and I did. I took no action. I just felt it.

493
00:50:53.910 --> 00:51:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it. Look at it. Look at it feeling and feeling and feeling it. Look. Is that true, is that true. Is that true, am I yelling at me. Look at me, I'm blaming myself and running through I'm bad, I'm bad and bad. Oh wait, I'm not bad await huh

494
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's enough. That's, that's a tangible thing that we can get our hands on and say I don't just go unconscious and do the habitual thing. Now I'm in my body. I felt it. I'm investigating. I kind of gotten familiar with.

495
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The points, the pressure points where I feel it. And then the next step and then it right it, then it's hmm, I'm going to go ahead and assume that this message is true if something important at stake. What do I believe in right now.

496
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your body's responding so it's an overreaction is this is a really dangerous. OK, so the ground or it. Okay, wait. Oh, there is there's something a real big value thing.

497
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: About is getting pressed on right now. Oh, it's look I see my son.

498
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.900
I feel for him.

499
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel it squiggly out of my skin thing. I bet that's how my son feels

500
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh there is danger, right, there's an actual danger.

501
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So what to do. That's where you go inside and you go, Well, what do I believe in. What's my parenting approach what. What's my role here. What do I do

502
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to know it. Right now it's just getting to know the message from the body. Eventually it'll be, can I trust it. Is it dialed up too high.

503
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do I go from there. But just get in the habit of again the body like what's, what's it up to what's the message because it happens very, very fast we can get that handled meeting really familiar with catching that quick.

504
00:52:47.820 --> 00:53:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the notion of 10 I trust my intuition, can I trust myself will come much faster, we're diving right into again right to the body because that that's that's your truth. Something's going on important now.

505
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We can look at it.

506
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do from there. That's a later session that's different targets that we can set

507
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.780
Cynthia We: Whoa, but I want to go there now.

508
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know but you said

509
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be able to myself.

510
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then let's start with yourself.

511
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:21.900
Perfect.

512
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you'll be a little detective.

513
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you'll pay attention to the body. Soon as you get the text from Scott as soon as you pick up your son and and and you ask him, have any homework and the second mean you notice it.

514
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you go in right to daughter's room and, oh, it's a mess. And she hasn't heard back. So I'll tightening up not even open, you know, you're going to notice it what's going on. Where is it ok ok

515
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I hear you. I want to be able to trust my intuition.

516
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And

517
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:22.980
I think you happen

518
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: To happen. Oh, don't forget that when you decide to not

519
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Collapse and

520
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you decide to follow through with with something that you're going to do a little behavior experiment. Maybe it's fatigue and maybe it's with someone else, and that is trusting your intuition. You're deciding to I want to go this way. I want to go that way.

521
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.280
Cynthia We: Is it worth it. Yes.

522
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.350
Yeah, right.

523
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

Yes, I agree.
