00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:55.680
Amber Hascall: Who she doesn't like or trust. I don't know. And the only other person. I knew in that town was her ex husband. So I called him and it just happened to work out that he was supposed to be moving out which never ended up happening and

70
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.480

Amber Hascall: And now it's been completely compliant with them and they surrounded me and tackled me and put me into a 50 250 hold

72
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:51.600
Amber Hascall: And then when I seen the head doctor he showed me the paper that said why they put me in there and it says that I said I don't want to live here anymore. Not that I don't want to live in. And the doctor was

73
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.170

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.640
Mary Kastner: And hope you have a nicotine cartridge

159
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.540
Mary Kastner: Yeah okay just realize it. That will keep you awake nicotine is a stimulant.

160
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.400

162
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.770

163
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.480

164
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.420

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:58.110
Mary Kastner: Ok ok ok so that's what we're going to do. We're going to order us some Ambien

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.240
Mary Kastner: Again, that might contribute to your sleep problems. So if you can try to cut that down.

Mary Kastner: Okay, just realize that all of these medications work on a neuro chemicals in your brain. And these neural chemicals are produced from protein breakdown amino acids.

177
00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.610
Mary Kastner: So if you don't fix your diet, you know, you're not going to have those neural chemicals needed for mood sleep concentration in your brain.

178
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.820

342
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:36.540
Mary Kastner: The efficacy or the success rate with a nicotine abstinence is with a dual program either a patching gum or a patch and Wellbutrin or gum and Wellbutrin well beauty.

Mary Kastner: Know it's a norepinephrine, dopamine agent.

348
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.440
Mary Kastner: And that's why it's so good with cravings.

349
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.850
Mary Kastner: Because it helps with doping me

350
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:09.960
Okay.

351
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:28.200
Mary Kastner: So think about, you know, which you'd like to try the side effect of Wellbutrin can be insomnia. So you take it in the morning. You don't want to take more than protest prescribe because it can lower seizure threshold and you don't want to give it to anybody who's had a seizure.

352
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.410
Amber Hascall: I've taken it before and I didn't like to feel a long time ago, but

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:35.910
Mary Kastner: Uh huh.

354
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.770

355
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.760
Amber Hascall: Yeah.

389
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:49.530
Amber Hascall: Just

390
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.930
Mary Kastner: What do you mean I'm paranoid all the time.

391
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.560
Amber Hascall: Like if I'm driving in a car. I think we're about to crash.

392
00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:04.770
Amber Hascall: Every time or I get the thoughts like something's going to happen to my kids like they're gonna get kidnapped every time they walk out the door or

393
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.850
Amber Hascall: I don't know, just certain things.

394
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.460
Mary Kastner: When do you ever have panic attacks.

395
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.830
Amber Hascall: I have before. Yeah.

396
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.310
Mary Kastner: Yeah. And what happens when you have a panic attack.

397
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.650
Amber Hascall: I just can't breathe. And I just, just kind of stop and

398
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.520
Mary Kastner: Uh huh. So these bad thoughts come

399
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.560
Mary Kastner: Frequently, or are they triggered by something

400
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.690
Amber Hascall: They just come

401
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.790
Amber Hascall: All the time. They're just there.

402
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:42.930
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm. So there's feelings of impending doom around your own safety and your family safety.

403
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.500
Mary Kastner: Okay, so, um,

404
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.740
Mary Kastner: Does it keep you from going outside.

405
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.380
Amber Hascall: I'm

406
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.870
Amber Hascall: Kind of sometimes

407
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.950
Uh huh.

408
00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:13.590
Amber Hascall: I mean, I can't drive right now, so I don't really go outside, unless some takes me so I don't like walking. So I guess. Yeah, I can get my car. Then I feel more safe, I guess, I don't know. I get nervous around lots of people sometimes and

409
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.870
Amber Hascall: Sometimes that doesn't bother me, but

410
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.660
Mary Kastner: Are you afraid of anything in particular.

411
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.380
Mary Kastner: Not really, okay.

412
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:31.380
Mary Kastner: Okay. Um, so another issue we uncovered was poor nutrition. She's not eating well

413
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.000
Mary Kastner: So diagnoses really major depression.

414
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:42.840
Mary Kastner: Major Depressive Disorder recurrent panic disorder with modified

415
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.570
Mary Kastner: agoraphobia.

416
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.890
Mary Kastner: It continues disorder.

417
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.990
Mary Kastner: And of course the diagnoses that Dr.

418
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:11.160
Mary Kastner: Jackson has, I believe, the opioid use disorder. So our plan is going to be that we're going to increase effects or two to 25

419
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.780
Mary Kastner: Daily. We're going to add Ambien

420
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.800
Mary Kastner: 10 milligrams, I would start with half

421
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.360
Amber Hascall: Okay.

422
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.090
Mary Kastner: And make sure that your

423
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.890
Mary Kastner: Son has the keys. We don't want you getting up in the middle of the night, driving

424
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.780
Mary Kastner: Till we know you don't have any of these what we call parasomnia

425
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.620
Mary Kastner: Once you start sleeping well I'd like to see you back off on the Ambien

426
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.130
Mary Kastner: Okay. Um, and then

427
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:56.130
Mary Kastner: We're going to give you nicotine four milligram gum and 21 milligram patch you remove the patch at bedtime. Because again, nicotine can keep you awake.

428
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.450
Mary Kastner: Okay. And the way you use the GM it you park it

429
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.460
Amber Hascall: Okay.

430
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:09.420
Mary Kastner: People park it down here where you would keep snuff are up here kind of where your teeth in

431
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:22.590
Mary Kastner: Those are the two areas at the mouth of saliva glands come in. And so when you feel a need to vapor. You take the gum out chew it. It should have a little popping type activity.

432
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:30.990
Mary Kastner: And then you can park that again should not have that parking popping activity, then it's time for a new piece of gum.

433
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.670
Mary Kastner: Okay, there's such thing as nicotine toxicity.

434
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:46.920
Mary Kastner: Which can cause nausea and rapid heart beat sweating. So if that happens, you've got too much nicotine want to back off.

435
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:47.790
Okay.

436
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.100
Mary Kastner: So,

437
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:57.060
Mary Kastner: As far as a panic. Are you going to continue to take the Klonopin when you have the panic.

438
00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:58.860
Amber Hascall: Yeah.

439
00:32:59.280 --> 00:32:59.760
Okay.

440
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.680
Mary Kastner: And then I'm going to get your, um,

441
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:11.640
Mary Kastner: I wouldn't take it routinely. I would just take it when you have the panic. We're going to get your records.

442
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.060
Mary Kastner: Woodland and

443
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:27.180
Mary Kastner: If you haven't given us labs. We definitely. Yeah, there's a urine drug screen, but I don't see

444
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.820
Mary Kastner: The labs.

445
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:37.590
Mary Kastner: So we need for you to get those done and I guess they were sent to quest.

446
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.650
Mary Kastner: I'm going to ask that we get them.

447
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:46.230
Amber Hascall: Okay cuz I asked if I can have them sent from my doctor, he just did that but

448
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.560
Amber Hascall: Either way, whatever it's easier.

449
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:50.700

452
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.180

Amber Hascall: I guess I

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:37.290
Mary Kastner: Because that's, you know, not one. I'm feeling. Dr. Jamison is filling that. So let me just check and see if she did anything that

628
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:38.040
Sydney Kent: Okay.

629
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.310
Sydney Kent: Well, the pharmacy and they can't fill it till tomorrow, but

630
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.830
Sydney Kent: Like I'm I've been with john

631
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.010
Sydney Kent: A couple of days. I mean, I went to the doctor. The hospital yesterday.

632
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:55.560
Sydney Kent: And they give me somebody text. So it was like seven o'clock at night and you know I usually take Suboxone today. So I was wondering

633
00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:03.150
Sydney Kent: If they can't fill it today, like maybe if Dr. Jason could give me like a day's worth of salary text or something, cuz

634
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.580
Mary Kastner: I just can't afford you're sick.

635
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.990
Sydney Kent: Right now, so

636
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.990
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I hear you. Okay. Looks like I

637
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:18.420
Mary Kastner: Jamison gave you seven days on

638
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.940
Mary Kastner: On the 20th and today's a 26

639
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:32.040
Mary Kastner: So I could definitely put in a request that she feel that, but I felt this Seroquel

640
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:37.290
Mary Kastner: Yesterday, the Wellbutrin yesterday.

641
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:42.240

644
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.190
Mary Kastner: So you've missed two days.

645
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.090

Sydney Kent: The pharmacy said something about you guys like doing an early, early release thing on it because

671
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:05.640
Sydney Kent: Normally, they're not supposed to give it to me till tomorrow. So I don't know what that means.

672
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:14.160
Mary Kastner: Yeah i right all right that on there and you wouldn't hurt if you brought your police report into the pharmacy.

673
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.710
Sydney Kent: Okay, yeah, I have the number just not yet.

674
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:37.740
Mary Kastner: Well, before you got all this stolen. How you doing,

675
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.560
Sydney Kent: Okay. I mean, I've had a moment. But once I get better.

676
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:46.680
Mary Kastner: Was your mood adequate and you're asleep adequate.

677
00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.410
Sydney Kent: Yeah, my soup is good.

678
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:50.580
Sydney Kent: And I knew

679
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.770
Sydney Kent: Better. I mean,

680
00:58:53.880 --> 00:59:02.490
Sydney Kent: I don't want us to have a found anything not really seems to work other than just like yoga or something, holistic like that.

681
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.710
Mary Kastner: That's what works best for you is some kind of exercise.

682
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:49.680
Mary Kastner: CVS on Shaw is what I have for Suboxone. Do you want it at Walgreens.

683
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.690
Mary Kastner: Because the rest are at Walgreens.

684
00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.380
Sydney Kent: Then they say take a data transfer.

685
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:01.800
Mary Kastner: Say that again.

686
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:04.530
Sydney Kent: Then they said it would take a data transfer it

687
01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.950
Mary Kastner: To who said, who said that

688
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.330
Jamie

689
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:19.740
Mary Kastner: But I'm putting it in right now. So my question is, do you want it at CVS or Walgreens because your other medicines at Walgreens.

690
01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:31.140
Sydney Kent: Walgreens doesn't take my insurance but probably I just sent it to Walgreens. I think it was probably best actually

691
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.770
Mary Kastner: While your other medicines at Walgreens, and they don't take your, your farm your insurance.

692
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:38.820
Sydney Kent: Know,

693
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:41.940
Mary Kastner: What should I, should I switch all the others, then

694
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:48.720
Sydney Kent: Now it's okay, I can get it. I can get it at Walgreens, because I have a card on file. So it would be easier that way.

695
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:53.580
Mary Kastner: Okay. And so now this six strips of Suboxone you want at Walgreens.

696
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.140
Sydney Kent: Mm hmm. Okay.

697
01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.600
Mary Kastner: On chai Avenue.

698
01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:00.120
Sydney Kent: Yes.

699
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.700
Mary Kastner: So one China elemental today. And of course, you want the Suboxone today. Correct.

700
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.720
Mm hmm.

701
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.660
Sydney Kent: Nicer cool. I haven't slept really good either with

702
01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.680
Mary Kastner: All of those meds.

703
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.000
Mary Kastner: All those meds, as I read to you are going to Walgreens.

704
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.570
Okay.

705
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.590
Mary Kastner: I'm so sorry this happened because your mood, you said was pretty good. And you were sleeping.

706
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.510
Mary Kastner: How many hours at night.

707
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:34.800
Sydney Kent: Maybe seven

708
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.750
Mary Kastner: Say that again.

709
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.000
Sydney Kent: Like, seven, eight.

710
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.590
Sydney Kent: Wow, it's like

711
01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.710
Sydney Kent: 123 hours.

712
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:48.210
Sydney Kent: I slept two hours tonight before. And then last night was like maybe four

713
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.960
Mary Kastner: People that do this to other people. I just don't understand

714
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:56.580
Sydney Kent: You know, I don't either. I just really hope that the truth comes out.

715
01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:01.380
Mary Kastner: Are you feeling like you want to hurt yourself or anybody else.

716
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:02.640
No.

717
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.170
Mary Kastner: This is weird.

718
01:02:44.190 --> 01:03:01.320
Mary Kastner: This Seroquel I put in is at CVS and the Wellbutrin at Walgreens. The mitchells at CBS. The other limit those at Walgreens. This is all over the place Gabba Penton

719
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:10.620
Mary Kastner: Was at walk. I have to fix. I have to fix the Lamictal 25 to Walgreens, then

720
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:16.620
Mary Kastner: That is that your preference or the 200 okay yeah

721
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.780
Mary Kastner: Why does this think bounce back and forth. That's what I'd like to know.

722
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.810
Sydney Kent: Hey, I don't know, I think it was because yesterday, since it was Memorial Day.

723
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.910
Sydney Kent: And I had told them Walgreens, because I, I didn't know they were closed. So I think that's what happened with that.

724
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:47.130
Mary Kastner: Okay.

725
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.440
Mary Kastner: Thank you. It's not me.

726
01:03:54.870 --> 01:04:02.640
Sydney Kent: Because I had moved from Walgreens CVS. Um, but I think, in my opinion, Walgreens right now is better.

727
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:11.100
Sydney Kent: Just because I already have a card on file. I don't have to go through all of that to get to pick up medicine.

728
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.620
Mary Kastner: Going to Walgreens.

729
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.650
Mary Kastner: I looked at this.

730
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:05.820
Mary Kastner: Okay, Walgreens Walgreens.

731
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.880
Mary Kastner: Evil thyroxine is at CBS. Okay.

732
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:14.520
Mary Kastner: Gotta change it.

733
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.050
Mary Kastner: You taking one zero point

734
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.130
Mary Kastner: And you need to get your labs done

735
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.140
Sydney Kent: Okay, yeah, I'll do that.

736
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:17.250
Mary Kastner: Why does this keeps when you talk to them. Tell them to put Walgreens as your

737
01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:20.400
Mary Kastner: Your primary

738
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.750
Mary Kastner: So this is Synthroid

739
01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:25.950
Mary Kastner: Is that okay

740
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:27.690
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

741
01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.340
Mary Kastner: They can substitute if

742
01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:36.450
Mary Kastner: Your insurance doesn't pay for that.

743
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:50.250
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that's the problem. It keeps bouncing back to CVS. So they need to to put that in as your primary in the circle is also at CVS, so I'll have to fix that.

744
01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:09.720
Mary Kastner: 300 milligrams of Seroquel

745
01:07:49.980 --> 01:08:40.290
Mary Kastner: 200 I just put in and it went to it went to CBS

746
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.900
Mary Kastner: They keep bouncing back. Hmm.

747
01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.310
Sydney Kent: This is a 3025 milligrams at Walgreens.

748
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:58.560
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that is right that is put in there correctly, but the other one went to walk or to CVS.

749
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.520
Mary Kastner: I forget what they call that

750
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:45.030
Mary Kastner: Default I think they call default

751
01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:47.520
Mary Kastner: Pharmacy.

752
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:48.450
Huh.

753
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.930
Mary Kastner: For Sydney can't

754
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.920
Mary Kastner: To Walgreens on Shaw.

755
01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:03.540
Mary Kastner: Correct.

756
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.180
Sydney Kent: They did the CVS because my insurance takes it. That's what they do with that.

757
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.890
Mary Kastner: Well, what do you want is what I'm asking you, because I just changed them all.

758
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.250
Mary Kastner: And I'm asking them to change your default

759
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.140
Sydney Kent: Well, I mean, I can pick them up today at Walgreens, um,

760
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.750
Mary Kastner: But you don't want the default changed.

761
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:31.980
Sydney Kent: No, I don't think

762
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.520
Mary Kastner: So,

763
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.330

Mary Kastner: Okay, I'm not gonna do that then. Okay.

766
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:54.480
Mary Kastner: Everything else should be in there.

767
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.780
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay.

768
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.020

772
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.240
Mary Kastner: Do you know how to check your pulse.

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.670
Sydney Kent: Yeah, how do I count again.
