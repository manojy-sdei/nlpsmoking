00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

2
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

3
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed you weren't there at a quarter of in the virtual clinic.

4
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What what happened that checking in early right so that I can know whether you're going to be here.

5
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened is it what do you think happened there.

6
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.010
Michelle Lucero: Um,

7
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.800
Michelle Lucero: I was still asleep, honestly.

8
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what what you were doing, but you've scheduled appointments before

9
00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.090
Michelle Lucero: So yeah, my alarm was set. I don't know why it didn't go off. I have three alarm set. I wish I could show you

10
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.940
Michelle Lucero: And they're all set. I make sure they're all on before I go to sleep.

11
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:16.140
Michelle Lucero: And I never wake up with anything's thing like you slept through your alarm, because usually that would happen.

12
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a good idea to take time. Go ahead and take a peek at it.

13
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. Most people once they do this and they take a look

14
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: They can see what the problem is. So you can kind of your videos on hold while you're looking at it, you can take a look at

15
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It because this is going to keep happening.

16
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't discover what the, what the, the issues.

17
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.050
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, all, all three are on for five o'clock in the morning, that's

18
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.730
Michelle Lucero: When I went to bed early last night.

19
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.750
Michelle Lucero: I

20
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.130
Michelle Lucero: It doesn't say, and like usually would have some kind of

21
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.390
Michelle Lucero: message saying if I miss my alarm clock or if I slept through my alarm clock.

22
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.890
Michelle Lucero: Because I guess it will only try a couple times.

23
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just curious. What time did you get up yesterday.

24
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.910
Michelle Lucero: At five my alarm woke me up yesterday.

25
00:03:47.730 --> 00:04:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe the problem is the setting an alarm that if this isn't for this appointment that alarm is a general alarm for I'm assuming it's so that you start your day. I think what might be needed is an alarm that is

26
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: More towards an appointment. That's actually set so

27
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This one would have been missed. If I hadn't asked Angelina, to give you a call right

28
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

29
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check and see if there's other things going on. If there's a not wanting to maybe confront something or say something or talk about something or not wanting to be awake at all. See if there's something beyond just the alarm that might be going on.

30
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

31
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not your first time right this is something that we've got to take a look at because

32
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't the first time.

33
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.380
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

34
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's gonna be I think inconvenient for you.

35
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.030
Michelle Lucero: I'm the only thing I could think of.

36
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.860
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, like I have to cook today because my nephew's funerals tomorrow.

37
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

38
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.490
Michelle Lucero: And I have to go take the food over there today.

39
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Michelle Lucero: But I honestly don't even know if I can because

40
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.890
Michelle Lucero: I need to contact my appeal because it's an Albuquerque.

41
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.030
Michelle Lucero: Uh huh.

42
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.600
Michelle Lucero: And I didn't even think of that until last night.

43
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.430
Michelle Lucero: I didn't think of that. Anthony's, the one that reminded me. He's like, you can go to Kyle's funeral until

44
00:05:45.420 --> 00:06:00.150
Michelle Lucero: You get a hold of your appeal. Like if anything happens, we get pulled over, you're going to be in trouble. And I was like, oh my god, I didn't even think of that, like, I haven't gone anywhere out of the city. So I haven't had to ask my appeal for permission.

45
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.710
Michelle Lucero: I don't know.

46
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, where's your to do list for today. Maybe we could start with that. Where's your to do list for today.

47
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.780
Michelle Lucero: In my head.

48
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go get paper.

49
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.260
Michelle Lucero: I have a

50
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So first thing

51
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start with setting an alarm for

52
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Our next appointment.

53
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I think you're starting work on me. See, Michelle starts 11am I think you're starting May 2 has that changed.

54
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.380
Michelle Lucero: Um, no.

55
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.380
Michelle Lucero: Well, maybe I don't know I could read you what my boss of me.

56
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking, I just have a little handwritten note here. I wrote myself. Michelle starts 11am it's, it's just a question you

57
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that on Saturday.

58
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.170
Michelle Lucero: Um, no, I guess. As of now, no. Because the last thing I heard was

59
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.690
Michelle Lucero: It says

60
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.420
Michelle Lucero: Lola. We can't open as planned, but

61
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.490
Michelle Lucero: Limited administration and services to f will start

62
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.720
Michelle Lucero: May 11 so that's

63
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

64
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's do this while you're in there in your phone. Um, why don't you set an alarm for 830 sorry let me try again 7:30am and said it with Gwen on May six,

65
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.410
Michelle Lucero: Oh,

66
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So look, if you can

67
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.570
Michelle Lucero: I already had one set for me for that 10 for an individual with you and I

68
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you're right. I see it, nevermind I just caught my eyes just caught that.

69
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.300
Michelle Lucero: So do you want me to leave that one.

70
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to change it because that's your group day right so

71
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.450
Michelle Lucero: Maybe would be dumb us

72
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:37.830
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, we could, that's fine, but you'd said we're going to do know group that week. And then the next week group.

73
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what

74
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.750
Michelle Lucero: Do one like every other week.

75
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember the context.

76
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Of why we did that.

77
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We did that because you were working now you're

78
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.400
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

79
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, let's go. May six, you can plug in the phone 7:30am just put go in and make check in some kind of way that you register. I've got a check in it because what if they have you do a drug.

80
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, when you look at Wednesday. Is that a day. That is good competition with your PO on a Wednesday.

81
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.110
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, the next time I see him is on the six

82
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's see really going to work. What time does he need you in there because my recollection was he was understanding when you are eating right heart health, that it wasn't an issue.

83
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:49.530
Michelle Lucero: Right. Um, let me look for it. The, the meeting with him is on May six at 10

84
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Need from eight to nine with me.

85
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.860
Michelle Lucero: No, not at all, because

86
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.570
Michelle Lucero: It's a dual meeting with him.

87
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.560
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

88
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll get in your phone, at least when 730 check in something like that so that it's going to make sure it's set so that there's an actual

89
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Alarm set to to them.

90
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.300

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

92
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let me just get the context because it's different for everybody. So last night. It took you

93
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To confirm the appointment. What, what was going on.

94
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.300
Michelle Lucero: At that time, I just got into town.

95
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

96
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:53.280
Michelle Lucero: So when when I replied. Yeah, I noticed that you sent it like at five something and I usually do reply right away. But I was in surreal.

97
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does that translate to me. What does that mean, like, what made it responding difficult. Tell me what that means.

98
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.480
Michelle Lucero: I was in serious. I don't get service out there until

99
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Work right there. I was in. So, so I don't have service and surreal surreal says no meaning to me right i don't know surreal from cats and dogs.

100
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.840
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

101
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I didn't have service. I got it. Okay, um,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.100
Michelle Lucero: At one

110
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.620
Michelle Lucero: That's what I have next

111
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that was when you weren't when you weren't working

112
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.820
Michelle Lucero: Okay, let me see the calendar than it is.

113
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were working the context has changed now so

114
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next next group is Monday at may 4

115
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: At one at one. What time are you going to set the alarm on your phone.

116
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.440
Michelle Lucero: 1230

117
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I would, yeah I mean not you guys would know better, but it's taken a while to get checked in.

118
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then two days later. You See Me, May six,

119
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to check in at 730 or your alarms go off at 730 at least

120
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And then we'll

121
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll take it from there. Now you are going to start as far as, you know, you're going to be in

122
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Work the following Monday, which is may 11

123
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Which makes me think, maybe you're not off on Mondays.

124
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:21.600
Michelle Lucero: And that's just the day they said the half staff was gonna go back. That's not my regular schedule warehouse schedule is Tuesday to Saturday. So every Sunday and Monday. Everyone in the warehouses off.

125
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.230
Michelle Lucero: Would even if it isn't.

126
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.100
Michelle Lucero: I just have to let my boss know like he knows

127
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:43.500
Michelle Lucero: That he knows about these meetings and he knows that I had already moved them to Mondays, because he changed my schedule again so

128
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you've had a lot of changes, it would be nice to see you.

129
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Given your description of yourself. I have a poor memory.

130
00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That you stick with this if you want. Let's stick with that. So let's

131
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's leave that there, and

132
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's already put in place so that there's there's real clarity. The same thing may 13 in the morning, would it be a difficult challenge for you to be going to on a Wednesday, the same day, you probably see your PO to be able to meet at 8am on a Wednesday.

133
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:35.670
Michelle Lucero: Know,

134
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: wouldn't be an issue as long as he knows

135
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:39.480
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

136
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do that. So May 13th at 8am which on your alarm would be set for more like 730

137
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll be able to confirm these as they get closer, but at least there.

138
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:51.840
Michelle Lucero: And that's

139
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.610
Michelle Lucero: That's a individual

140
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.690
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, so the 11th will be my group, though, right.

141
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.410
Hahaha

142
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

143
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how how your family's doing

144
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.540
Michelle Lucero: I think all of them are like just thinking the way I am.

145
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.850
Michelle Lucero: Just I'm good. Cuz it's

146
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:32.460
Michelle Lucero: It's just a long story. The lady that my brother had the baby with was a longtime family friend.

147
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:45.180
Michelle Lucero: Uh huh. And she was a lesbian. She is a lesbian. And she was with her girlfriend for 20 years before she had this baby with my brother.

148
00:15:46.290 --> 00:16:03.510
Michelle Lucero: And I believe that she did it just to have a baby because she obviously couldn't with her girlfriend. And the minute that Heil was born. My Brother Dave I'm parental rights away or just signed away right

149
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:09.090
Michelle Lucero: Cuz that's what she wanted. And he wasn't like in his

150
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.000
Michelle Lucero: He wasn't like

151
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:21.870
Michelle Lucero: Ready to be a father again he already had three kids and they're already grown and it kinda like caught him by surprise, you know,

152
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.530
Michelle Lucero: So he he did and he he signed away his parental rights.

153
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:39.300
Michelle Lucero: And only when it was convenient for her and in the Kyle ever come into our lives like when she broke up with her girlfriend.

154
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:47.490
Michelle Lucero: She introduced Kyle to all of us, because none of us have even known him and he was like four years old.

155
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.800
Michelle Lucero: And then

156
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:06.300
Michelle Lucero: She met her now husband. So then she took him out of our lives. Again, but then my nephew died my brother's oldest son died.

157
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.050
Michelle Lucero: So she brought him back into our lives, then

158
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.580
Michelle Lucero: And then after the funeral and everything was over.

159
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:31.920
Michelle Lucero: She took him out of our lives. Again, and like we would try my brother would try to like get a hold of her and say, like, it's Christmas. We have gifts for Kyle, you know, because all that's just the way it was.

160
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.630
Michelle Lucero: Messing

161
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.090
Michelle Lucero: So I guess now.

162
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:49.170
Michelle Lucero: More than anything, we're just her because he just kept getting pulled out of our lives. I know my brother is like killing him. He has severe guilt.

163
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.760
Oh, yeah.

164
00:17:51.990 --> 00:18:03.930
Michelle Lucero: I'm not knowing them and he always thought he was gonna have time because he was only 15 but my brother always thought he was gonna have time to

165
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is 15

166
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.230
Michelle Lucero: To knowing pale.

167
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness. Oh.

168
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:21.930
Michelle Lucero: They killed him in a wall. They say it was a road rage in Albuquerque. But I don't know if he was involved in gangs.

169
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:30.180
Michelle Lucero: But they said both cards were shooting at each other, but there's no proof that piles are had a gun because

170
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.440
Michelle Lucero: They can't even find who shot and killed him.

171
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this, this, the brother that's living with your dad really

172
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And how, how often are you talking to is this Stephen

173
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's your brother's name.

174
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:55.950
David

175
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've called Davey before I think

176
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.560
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, Davey

177
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

178
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think that he's you said it. My family's all feeling the same as me and you just mentioned that he's feeling guilt somehow is the guilt because is it. Oh, I took the easy way out. I, I didn't fight harder to see. Kyle, like what's the guilt over

179
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.210
Michelle Lucero: All of it all the above

180
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:37.560
Michelle Lucero: Oh, because he signed the papers for parental rights because he didn't fight harder to see him because he always thought he was gonna have that chance to explain to Kyle.

181
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:45.660
Michelle Lucero: Like it wasn't as they didn't want you in our lives like when he got older and he's not going to have that chance smell.

182
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said that everyone shares that somehow

183
00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:16.260
Michelle Lucero: Well, I was talking with Noel yesterday and we she had came by, because she's making two capsules of green in Chiba others they making to have read. So we went to the store together yesterday to go buy all the ingredients for the enchiladas. And we're talking about it and I told her, like,

184
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:30.360
Michelle Lucero: I just asked her, like, how do you feel about going tomorrow because I know I've had some very anxiety. Since I found out about it, but of course I didn't want to show my brother that because I don't want him to feel worse.

185
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:46.950
Michelle Lucero: But I told her, like, how do you feel for going and she's like, I don't want to go to be honest with you, I want to go take the food, go to the viewing angles straight home. I don't want to because it's supposed to be taking the hot food to Joseph to house which is the mom.

186
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:57.660
Michelle Lucero: Because they can't have any public gathering anywhere. So they're going to do it illegally at her house because you're not, it's not legal to have gatherings.

187
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:08.670
Michelle Lucero: I see. So, and that's another reason why I don't want to, like, you know, a member of Asian I can be around anywhere that the police get called

188
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:27.600
Michelle Lucero: So you're supposed to go drop off the hot food to Joseph. Let's go to the viewing between three and five and then go back to Joseph afterwards he and no one wants to go back to Joseph to eat, and I don't think we're going to because

189
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:36.180
Michelle Lucero: I'm terrified to get like in trouble for being on probation and then police being hauled

190
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

191
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.330
Michelle Lucero: And my brother just doesn't want

192
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.780
Michelle Lucero: He doesn't want the looks like, what is he doing here, you know, when

193
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.310
Michelle Lucero: He was in his life.

194
00:21:47.910 --> 00:22:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you guys in brainstorming ways to still do this in a in a meaningful way where let's say Davey Noel you and whoever else if you guys met in some way.

195
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: lit a candle read a poem read a prayer.

196
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Something drew had of Canvas from Michael's and painted some thing together you doing saying like

197
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:29.970
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I totally brought that up yesterday because the viewings going to be unfortunately the viewings going to be online.

198
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.400
Michelle Lucero: Like they're going to have a live feed of his viewing

199
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.900
Michelle Lucero: Because of the circumstances. Now there's only allowed to be five people at a time, the mortuary

200
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:55.290
Michelle Lucero: So like everyone's supposed to be waiting in their vehicles and five supposed to go in at a time. Wow. Who's going to tell the first people, which are probably going to be his mom and his dad.

201
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

202
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:02.760
Michelle Lucero: He's gonna tell them to get out so everyone else is gonna get in, you know, my know

203
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are running the service, they'll do that they

204
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.320
Need

205
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To do they really do they because they know everybody is just out of their mind is grief that this is their job they're good at that.

206
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:29.760
Michelle Lucero: So I was like, I don't being that my brother's the father. I don't know if we're going to be the next ones up but I surely don't want to be the one to tell them on like okay you neither

207
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine like that is not how I'm no it's not going down like that.

208
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.520
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, like I have so much anxiety over stupid things like that.

209
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.780
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god. OK, so

210
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:52.860
Michelle Lucero: I told my brother last night because he's like I've been talking to him every day and he talked to the mom. He's already talked to them a couple times.

211
00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:07.830
Michelle Lucero: But, um, she was like, you're gonna come right and he's like yeah because when his son died. I mean, I hate to make it sound like that. But when his older son died, Joseph was there for him.

212
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:18.420
Michelle Lucero: And she remembers that, of course, and she's like, I need you here tomorrow and or Thursday. And he's like, Yeah, I'm gonna be there.

213
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:34.620
Michelle Lucero: So I don't know. It just sucks, but then their family has always been there for our family when we've had them because we've all been close family, friends, since we grew up like they all grew up in the cereals with us.

214
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.900
Michelle Lucero: So like

215
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:45.360
Michelle Lucero: It's so weird what Joseph sister, Wendy. I call cousin, even though we're not cousins, but

216
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:54.990
Michelle Lucero: That's how close we are what I didn't grow up with Joseph, so I don't consider her cousin, but her sister. I grew up with.

217
00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:06.270
Michelle Lucero: So like, it's just, it's weird. And then my brother had a baby with that family. And I remember my daughter was like

218
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:26.880
Michelle Lucero: Three years old because yeah Kayla's 18 and Kyle was 15 so Caleb was like three years old and I was pregnant with Devon at the time and Josie that came over, she was pregnant with Kyle and I remember her saying I can't believe I'm pregnant by Davey Cerro

219
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.310
Michelle Lucero: Like she was

220
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.240
Michelle Lucero: Like in shock about that. I remember

221
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.680
Michelle Lucero: It was his kids were already in their 20s. My brother was like done having kids.

222
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:55.950
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, I feel my own personal thoughts as I feel that she did it just have a baby with him because she wanted more kids her daughter was already older like her daughter was

223
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.740
Michelle Lucero: Like 13 already, I think.

224
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:00.990
Michelle Lucero: And

225
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:16.140
Michelle Lucero: Leslie her girlfriend had put in her head like to have a baby. So she wanted to maybe they try to adopt, but it didn't go through because of Leslie's history like shells domestic violence, so I'm

226
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.970
Michelle Lucero: Joseph got pregnant. My Davey, and then immediately after

227
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:29.190
Michelle Lucero: Having him sign away parental rights and left and went back to Leslie, then they fought

228
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.990
Michelle Lucero: And then she found her now husband.

229
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:48.450
Michelle Lucero: I mean, that's just my opinion, my brother. I don't like to tell my brother that because I don't want to make him feel that way, you know,

230
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.860
Michelle Lucero: make him feel like he was just used to have a baby with

231
00:26:54.690 --> 00:27:00.150
Michelle Lucero: Well, that's the way I see it, though. And I don't know if he fills out late because I've never asked him about it.

232
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What other way could he interpreted

233
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.000
Michelle Lucero: Sorry.

234
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What other way Mikey. Think about it.

235
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.130
Michelle Lucero: I'm

236
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.510
Version.

237
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.220
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. He feels now he he told me yesterday. He was like,

238
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.570
Michelle Lucero: I just get so sad about it because

239
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:45.570
Michelle Lucero: Joseph had the power to pull him out of our lives and to bring him back whenever she wanted whenever it was convenient for her and he was like, I just feel like shit because like

240
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:59.280
Michelle Lucero: I feel like she didn't think we were good enough to have him in our lives while he was alive. But now that he's dead. She needs us today like she's he doesn't get it, and I'm like, I don't get it either.

241
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:08.070
Michelle Lucero: He's like, it makes me feel like I'm not good enough or I wasn't good enough to be in his life while he was alive because she only brought him in

242
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:17.040
Michelle Lucero: Maybe three times and it wasn't for very long periods of time, maybe like a month tops at a time.

243
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So when when you guys both of you, you just sort of said how you feel. But what you did, right, is you gave us some stories you actually do know something, you know, your response to what's going on, you know, your response.

244
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you irritated. Are you angry. Do you also feel some guilt. Do you also have some sorrow. It might be a combination of some of those. You don't have to figure out what her intentions were over these these 15 years for you to actually have a response to it.

245
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.020
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I feel all the above, I feel that I felt

246
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:05.070
Michelle Lucero: sad, I feel guilt. I feel shame because I didn't try harder.

247
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:24.330
Michelle Lucero: And then the times that I was around him. I don't even remember him being like, there's a picture for my sister Angela's daughters like third birthday and Kyle was there. I don't remember him being there, but I took a picture with him.

248
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:35.070
Michelle Lucero: Like his and sent me that picture because the mom sent it to her because she did, like, all I'm

249
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:47.310
Michelle Lucero: Like one of those memory videos. Anyways, she sent me all the videos of him with our family. And I was like, oh my, I don't even remember him being there that

250
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.690
Michelle Lucero: I, I don't remember him being there. And I think it's because he was so sporadically in their lives that

251
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:05.130
Michelle Lucero: Things like that, that he was that I don't remember him being there because he's usually not there. Does that make sense.

252
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't remember him being there that phrase, of course, that makes sense.

253
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:21.510
Michelle Lucero: Just because he wasn't there all the time. So it was easy to like forget he was there for Molly's third birthday.

254
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.250
Michelle Lucero: And I feel bad because

255
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.700
Michelle Lucero: I always told myself like

256
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:41.040
Michelle Lucero: I know Joseph going to do this again. I know just have to move move away and she did. She moved to Albuquerque.

257
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.100
Michelle Lucero: And I said, I'm gonna stay on top of it.

258
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:55.110
Michelle Lucero: But it wasn't as easy as she blocked me on Facebook. She changed her home phone number and her sister Wendy told me I don't want to get in the middle of it, and I wouldn't make

259
00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:58.980
Michelle Lucero: So,

260
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The Bad idea.

261
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This brains assess some text and you can hear you. A little vibrating phone

262
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.760
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, so we have a group

263
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.880
Michelle Lucero: A group text.

264
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.330
Michelle Lucero: That me my breath. Everyone that's going tomorrow.

265
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.530
Michelle Lucero: My just got a message from it says

266
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.860
Michelle Lucero: Oh wait, that's not from them. That's from isn't

267
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:39.840
Michelle Lucero: Windy so after the viewing of Kyle when we're going to go to the food in the prayer, it's just

268
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:54.240
Michelle Lucero: It's going to be out till that's because the church was going to allow 20 at a time and then 20 minutes in between each group. So that would mean we would all be there until like 10 or 11 at night.

269
00:31:54.990 --> 00:32:00.420
Michelle Lucero: Oh, so we decided to do it. Joseph's address. Yep. We already know that.

270
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.410
Michelle Lucero: Okay, so, yeah, it just

271
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.380
Michelle Lucero: The whole thing like

272
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:17.550
Michelle Lucero: Albuquerque and Bruno Leo have had more cases of coronavirus in Santa Fe and I'm terrified to even go over there because of that reason.

273
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.870
Michelle Lucero: And even more so because of

274
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:31.860
Michelle Lucero: The, the way I'm thinking, people are going to look at us like what are they doing here, they have the nerve to be here.

275
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you remember I was brainstorming earlier and then it off.

276
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.380
Michelle Lucero: Like what do I want to do.

277
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this isn't just about I think you acknowledging that a human life a little boy.

286
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.010
Michelle Lucero: And she said, No, I didn't. And I said, Yeah. And he said, What is that means

287
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:41.670
Michelle Lucero: Either never anything. Nothing that means they're going to have it like on the computer is going to be on the computer and he was like even him laying there. I was like, I'm guessing that's how they're doing it now because of the coronavirus

288
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:52.620
Michelle Lucero: And he was like, Wow, so we don't even have to go and I was like, Well, I've told him since the beginning. No, you don't have to go if you don't feel like it.

289
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.360
Michelle Lucero: I didn't want to make him feel

292
00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle, you're still diverting, what do you do

293
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.520
Michelle Lucero: I would rather watch the viewing with our family.

294
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now

Gwenevere Abriel: Going to prepare anything

301
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To say, or two to acknowledge is or is there something like that could be done that.

302
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:43.350
Michelle Lucero: They can feel that

303
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.410
Michelle Lucero: I could, I could see stuff because

304
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.480
Michelle Lucero: Me and my brother were the ones that have seen him the most

305
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

306
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.340
Michelle Lucero: So I could say something

307
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on to that I could say something. I also want to prepare the red enchilada. So you just master the kitchen.

308
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You have everything that you need. You had gone shopping was Noel yesterday you have everything you need.

309
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.080
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, okay.

310
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any ambivalence ambivalence means mixed feeling about making that meal.

311
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.700
Michelle Lucero: I have uncertainty, because I don't know if my brother's gonna change his mind.

312
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:34.710
Michelle Lucero: Going

313
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when the food itself though.

314
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.030
Yeah.

315
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:47.160
Michelle Lucero: Like no, I don't have any know I can make. It's not a big deal like

316
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.310
Michelle Lucero: Out of all the stuff she had on that list. I think enchiladas, where the easiest to me.

317
00:35:53.910 --> 00:36:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have you made up your mind you're going to make the enchiladas. And you're going to do it if you say, I'm going to do it, thinking about Kyle.

318
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.190
Michelle Lucero: Yes.

319
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Not where this food is going to go. Who's table, who's going to eat it, that that's

320
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you being mindful, maybe you'll be in prayer. I don't know. Maybe you'll be grieving crying. I don't know what will be going on. But having that presence of mind.

321
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Vs Bri just said, I'm confused. I don't know what we're going to do with this meal. That's a different approach to the enchilada. That's different.

322
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so are you going to make the meal.

323
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.690
Yet

324
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That lands. Who knows, maybe it'll land at someone's house you weren't expecting, but you made it with love.

325
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When you made it yet.

326
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

327
00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: could compare and contrast maybe how you were, were your thoughts were and where your feelings were when we started this

328
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.800
Michelle Lucero: Morning.

329
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To check in and see how you're doing now.

330
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:13.260
Michelle Lucero: Um, I just have a lot of anxiety. Still, we still got to get over my deal just be if I even go

331
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.890
Michelle Lucero: Today or tomorrow.

332
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.480
Michelle Lucero: And

333
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.760
Michelle Lucero: I don't think I think I'm gonna message. His for his mom.

334
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:34.980
Michelle Lucero: Cuz I know they're going through a lot and they're not thinking. I know. But what they wanted us to do is take the hot food today.

335
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

336
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:42.300
Michelle Lucero: But that doesn't make any sense to me like are they going to keep it warmed until tomorrow.

337
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.090
Michelle Lucero: And is it still going to be good. By the time we're done with everything.

338
00:37:49.260 --> 00:38:02.550
Michelle Lucero: So I, I don't know if it was a typo and cold foods were supposed to be taken today because it doesn't really make sense to take that happens today being that it's not till tomorrow.

339
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You need information.

340
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:10.530
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, so I have a lot of uncertainty, like I said, just about everything.

341
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.550
Michelle Lucero: Okay then.

342
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that that list of that you started, which was first we wrote schedules down and now the first thing is

343
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's not called to maybe it's called us on because now you don't know what you're asking for from the PO, you don't know which day you're going

344
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To maybe the first thing is get clear

345
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.750
On

346
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Meal Prep date or drop off date and then called PO

347
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're talking with on you can say, I have some constraints. I don't know how open, you are, but I have to get permission to leave the city.

348
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So it really I do need to know this because I'm about to call my PO. I don't know what your openness is. But if it's wide open. Then you can say it to your on and then she can get you clarification or who knows what she'll say,

349
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.930
Yeah.

350
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what

351
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what else I need to get done.

352
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.560
Michelle Lucero: Then I have to like cook food.

353
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then start, start cooking some cook the chicken or whatever. Yeah.

354
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.080
Michelle Lucero: Well actually okay yeah all know then because if

355
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.920
Michelle Lucero: If it's not till tomorrow that I have to take it. I'm not making it today.

356
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You have anything else going on tomorrow.

357
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.080
Michelle Lucero: No, that's the only thing

358
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like you've got your contingencies. It'd be nice to know when it is if you're permitted to do it. And then you'll know which day to start

359
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's still this whole thing. Watch the viewing with the TiVo with my knees and there's that whole thing. What do you want to do with that. So look at your notes look down at them see your notes. What does it mean think about with this other topic.

360
00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Watching the viewing and

361
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:08.190
Michelle Lucero: I wanted to call my brother before any of this. Oh, OK.

362
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Call brother.

363
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.070
Michelle Lucero: And asked him.
