00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.050
Dawn Parry: November 3 of

142
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:57.150
Dawn Parry: And I was using it for pretty heavily for over a year until it was about. That was the but I had already started to cut down

143
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.380
Dawn Parry: Because I knew that I was going to be leaving. So I started to plan my getaway.

144
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:12.990
Dawn Parry: And I knew I could be on it that like that and just leave and be okay so

145
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:25.530
Dawn Parry: I would do, I started to, you know, like those down. I started to cut back and I was down to like a point one, zero.

146
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:40.050
Dawn Parry: I was I was doing IV, I would do the, you know, just a little tiny shot just to keep me from because I would have terrible mood swings. If I didn't have it just terrible. Like I never seen myself.

147
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.380
Dawn Parry: Have the mood swings like that before. I like I it blew my mind. It's scary. It was scary.

148
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.260
Dawn Parry: Because I had tried quitting, you know, cold turkey before and

149
00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:03.450
Dawn Parry: I had such terrible mood swings. I figured I needed to, you know, come down because I didn't want it. I didn't for my my own dumb prideful reasons I didn't want to go into detox.

150
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:14.790
Dawn Parry: You know, and they don't believe that you can have mood swings from that or have withdrawals from it. Anyway, you know, most places you don't have withdrawals from math and that's bullshit.

151
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:31.020
Dawn Parry: So I, I, it was about three months before I finally was able to leave that I started to bring myself off of it. But as soon as I got on that Greyhound bus that was, you know, the day before. That was the last time I you

152
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.960
Dawn Parry: Know, I mean it was just a little bit per day that I was, you know, so I was keeping myself from having the withdrawals.

153
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.250
Dawn Parry: And then I went cold turkey on that bus.

154
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.490
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so why don't we do this.

155
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.950
Dawn Parry: Can we set another appointment sense. Yeah.

156
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.960
Shawn Phalen: Since we need it. Like I said, you know, they like to

157
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:16.890
Dawn Parry: Yeah, no, I like i said i i know that it's necessary, you know, my doc. I'm very open and very honest with my doctors, um, you know, and

158
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:28.140
Dawn Parry: I, I hate to medical advice. I know it's necessary. It's just spread those things. Yeah, just like rather than old wounds, but I know it needs to be talked about.

159
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.660
Shawn Phalen: What what days are your group.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.300

Shawn Phalen: Sorry. How are you doing,

218
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.210
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, I've been doing really well. Surprisingly,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.550
Shawn Phalen: Why is this crazy

220
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.580
Minh Triet Vu: Here because I used to be in shambles and not always in good shape.

221
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:41.910
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so this is this is good news for you.

222
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:54.060
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, I think change is good, but I myself don't like changing that much because

223
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.080
Minh Triet Vu: I'm afraid. Neil anything new. Right.

224
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.570
Shawn Phalen: You're not

225
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.680
Minh Triet Vu: Afraid of anything.

226
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.430
Shawn Phalen: How are you feeling

227
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.070
Shawn Phalen: Going back to school.

228
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.210
Shawn Phalen: Are you, are you excited

229
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.950
Minh Triet Vu: No you're not. Yeah, no.

230
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:31.260
Minh Triet Vu: I'm not excited

231
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:35.160
Minh Triet Vu: What's happening.

232
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.300
Minh Triet Vu: It's hard to say it's

233
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.130
Minh Triet Vu: It's not really what I want to do, but I have to do.

234
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.820
What you want to do.

235
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.690
Minh Triet Vu: If I have enough money, and I am the one in control of everything.

236
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.110
Minh Triet Vu: Then I would buy a house.

237
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.280
Minh Triet Vu: At a countryside and then growing plants or

238
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:25.680
Minh Triet Vu: So, and then, yeah. And then so support myself through my life because, yeah, I've been watching some videos people growing a lot of young people don't go to groceries anymore. They start growing stuff at the park at their garden. I think that's fascinating.

239
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.950
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so you you don't really want to go back to school.

240
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:51.510
Minh Triet Vu: I mean, it's not that I hate and I am so against it. Now, I mean going yes I have to go. That's what I feel so not excited happy.

241
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.740
Minh Triet Vu: Imaginary and fluffy but

242
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.650
Minh Triet Vu: OK, so I'm going back to school. Okay, I'm going

243
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.820
Shawn Phalen: Why do you feel like you have to go back to school.

244
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.240
Minh Triet Vu: Oh, I cannot. I cannot

245
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.180
Minh Triet Vu: Stay doing nothing anyway.

246
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.100
Minh Triet Vu: That's enough for

247
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:24.900
Minh Triet Vu: Me to divert my energy into something else. Okay, so you're

248
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.180
You're

249
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.150
Getting bored.

250
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.280
Minh Triet Vu: Not necessarily board.

251
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.670
Minh Triet Vu: But I feel empty and have

252
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.100
Minh Triet Vu: Too much time.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.050
Minh Triet Vu: In order to stay healthy. I think I should avoid that for a while.

299
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.440
I agree.

300
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.010

You know, we talked about how

For you.

315
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.360
Do

316
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.660
Minh Triet Vu: That is to have a smaller

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.620
Minh Triet Vu: You considering its size.

320
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.750
Minh Triet Vu: So,

321
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.160
Minh Triet Vu: When I need to do something.

322
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.200
Minh Triet Vu: I just set an alarm.

323
00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:24.750
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.070
Minh Triet Vu: Okay, see you give yourself a window.

325
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:32.970
Minh Triet Vu: And

326
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.140
Minh Triet Vu: I bring something that

327
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.630
Minh Triet Vu: Will absolutely distract me

328
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.190
Minh Triet Vu: From anything that

329
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:41.580
Shawn Phalen: I

330
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.560
Minh Triet Vu: That I do at the moment in time at that specific moment of time.

331
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.720
Minh Triet Vu: Because it brings so loud.

Minh Triet Vu: Okay.

334
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.970

Minh Triet Vu: Yes.

336
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.810
Give yourself.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.830
Shawn Phalen: To get them.

339
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:17.160
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, and also set an alarm for dinner for lunch or time to go to bed, everything

340
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:19.470
Great.

341
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.230
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so

342
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.890
Shawn Phalen: How many hours of sleep a night. Are you getting now.

343
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.310
Minh Triet Vu: Okay, sorry.

344
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.130
Shawn Phalen: Then when you start school. How many classes are, you know,

345
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.100
Minh Triet Vu: It varies

346
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.920
Minh Triet Vu: For for ones. I don't know which one day will offer

347
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.590
Minh Triet Vu: Because right now, everything is a mess.

348
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.300
Shawn Phalen: I don't even have

349
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.600
Minh Triet Vu: The schedule. I don't even have the calendar.

350
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.160
Minh Triet Vu: And yeah, they have not announced anything coming up that

351
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.810
So,

352
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.880
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so you can even search or register for classes and so

353
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:06.600
Yeah.

354
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:08.940
Minh Triet Vu: Right. Yes.

355
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:11.520
Minh Triet Vu: Maybe July.

356
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:16.020
Minh Triet Vu: I think July is is quite late already but

357
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.460
Shawn Phalen: Consider

358
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.470
Minh Triet Vu: The situation right now.

359
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.390
Minh Triet Vu: That's understandable.

360
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.380
Shawn Phalen: You wanted

361
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.540
Minh Triet Vu: It's hard to answer that.

362
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.750
Minh Triet Vu: For

363
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.120
You take four classes and you're going to be a whole thing.

364
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.280
Minh Triet Vu: Oh, yes.

365
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.280
Minh Triet Vu: I'm still thinking

366
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.970
Minh Triet Vu: I'm sorry.

367
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.480
Minh Triet Vu: Maybe it's because maybe it's because right now. I feel like I have too much time.

368
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.650
Minh Triet Vu: For my own good.

369
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.210
Minh Triet Vu: And I need to divert the energy into something else.

370
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.610
Shawn Phalen: Okay. Would you be open to starting out with maybe three classes for

371
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:14.820
Minh Triet Vu: I'm sorry.

372
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:21.780
Shawn Phalen: Would you be open to doing three classes, instead of four classes. Yeah.

373
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:24.780
Shawn Phalen: And

374
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.740
Shawn Phalen: How many more classes do you need to graduate female

375
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.380
Minh Triet Vu: Oh,

376
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:39.060
Minh Triet Vu: It has to be somewhere between

377
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.980
Minh Triet Vu: 12 and 15

378
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.690
I'm a junior

379
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.150
Minh Triet Vu: And that's about. I know.

380
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.430
Minh Triet Vu: Because

381
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:01.170
For once,

382
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.750
Minh Triet Vu: I think my G. My general education is not complete, that's why.

383
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.880
Minh Triet Vu: I still have

384
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.560
Minh Triet Vu: I think

385
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.450
Minh Triet Vu: Three, four more to go.

386
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.010
Minh Triet Vu: Ahead for general education. Yes. And then

387
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.030
Major

388
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.070
Shawn Phalen: Even in classes for your major. You're not in addition

389
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.310
Minh Triet Vu: I'm in

390
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.920
Minh Triet Vu: A pool divisions day allowed

391
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.610
Minh Triet Vu: Me to register for the upper division classes.

392
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:43.290
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, but then also they also send me a notice saying that general education is not complete, and you should take this, this, this and this.

393
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.070
Okay.

394
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:51.210
Shawn Phalen: Well can you do you think you want to start out taking your general ed first

395
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.530

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.600
Okay.

401
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:26.100
Shawn Phalen: Okay. My, my. When I asked you if you'd be open to taking three just doing three classes, you know, just to kind of get yourself in the swing of it, get back into the groove. You know, we don't have a start out like

402
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.430
Shawn Phalen: Maybe start up slow.

403
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.770
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, I understand.

404
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.380
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, give you time to adjust.

405
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.090
Shawn Phalen: Okay. All right.

406
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:55.590
Shawn Phalen: Um, so I know with not knowing if classes are going to be in person or online that creates an issue for your, for your stain because your rent your lease is up right next month.

407
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:57.570
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

408
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:06.000
Okay. And have you given that. Any more thoughts are each going to wait to hear from the school I'm going on.

409
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.280
Minh Triet Vu: I'm sorry, when

410
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.460
Shawn Phalen: Are you just gonna wait to hear from the school.

411
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.960
Shawn Phalen: Before you make any decisions about moving or staying

412
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.930
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

413
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:21.900
Minh Triet Vu: So,

414
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.280
Minh Triet Vu: There's one thing I'm getting kind of used to

415
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.230
Minh Triet Vu: Displace yeah

416
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.500
Minh Triet Vu: So it may not be a best thing for me to move back

417
00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:32.370
Right.

418
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.880
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, okay.

419
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.170
Minh Triet Vu: I think i think i think helping my parents.

420
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.790
Shawn Phalen: Just a pre tax.

421
00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:47.220
Minh Triet Vu: I think my, I think my real intention is, I just want to see.

422
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.260
Minh Triet Vu: If

423
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.180
Minh Triet Vu: I will be able to live here.

424
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:52.710
Right.

425
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.870
Shawn Phalen: And I'm wondering if that would just give you

426
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.110
Extra work, you know, if you were to be back home like can be with family.

427
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.390
Shawn Phalen: What do you think

428
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.690
Minh Triet Vu: It's, I think it's not something that can answer right away.

429
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:18.240
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

430
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.740

462
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.650
Minh Triet Vu: We still have to fill out all that paperwork for them. Correct. Yes, but

463
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.450
Minh Triet Vu: Not a lot.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.160
Minh Triet Vu: No.

470
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:15.090
Shawn Phalen: All right.

471
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.660

Minh Triet Vu: Movies that classic or recent ones.

483
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.130
Shawn Phalen: I like

484
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.860
Shawn Phalen: Or film.

485
00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.390
Like documentary

Shawn Phalen: And I don't really like classic movies.

489
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:49.950
Shawn Phalen: I watch a lot of Netflix.

490
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.450
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah. Many people watch on

491
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:58.140
Minh Triet Vu: Netflix. Yes, don't have cable. I don't watch TV.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.960
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, me too. I don't watch TV.

493
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.430
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, but I do, I do watch movies from time to time.

494
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:07.380
Minh Triet Vu: And

495
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:14.160
Minh Triet Vu: I think the movies that I watch. Not a lot of people watch them.

496
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.800
Minh Triet Vu: I can, I can name a few.

497
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.570
Minh Triet Vu: Titles, but

498
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.840
Minh Triet Vu: The whole movies. Maybe I will read, I will

499
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:35.670
Minh Triet Vu: Of course I will remember the movies, but I would just pay attention to want to quote in that movie.

500
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:38.640
Minh Triet Vu: So,

501
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.170
Minh Triet Vu: The one

502
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.700
Minh Triet Vu: That I'm still thinking right now about right now.

503
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.290
Minh Triet Vu: Is the one

504
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.680
Minh Triet Vu: It's called I origin.

505
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:53.760
Yeah.

506
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.680
Minh Triet Vu: It's a weird one.

507
00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.430
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, I remember just one thing.

508
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.850
Minh Triet Vu: It's about it's about

509
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.750
Minh Triet Vu: The war and urge form.

510
00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:08.850
Minh Triet Vu: Me saying it's

511
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:09.600
Correctly.

512
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.090
Minh Triet Vu: It's a kind of warm

513
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.050
Minh Triet Vu: No legs.

514
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.210
Minh Triet Vu: No eyes live in the dirt.

515
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:16.800
Yeah.

516
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:18.570
Minh Triet Vu: Yep.

517
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.050
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, so

518
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.720
Minh Triet Vu: There's an experiment.

519
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.910
Minh Triet Vu: There's an experiment.

520
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:35.880
Minh Triet Vu: To conducted on the earth swarm to determine whether they have eyes or not.

521
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.610
Minh Triet Vu: And then at some point one scientist says that

522
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.690
Minh Triet Vu: He can

523
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.060
Minh Triet Vu: He can somehow

524
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.930
Minh Triet Vu: Get them.

525
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.850
Minh Triet Vu: Eyes.

526
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.740
Minh Triet Vu: It's not like he can

527
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:56.550
Minh Triet Vu: He can plans eyes on them, but give them a sense of vision that they do not know about

528
00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.700
Minh Triet Vu: Something like that.

529
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.180
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, but then the question is,

530
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.240
Minh Triet Vu: Will they be happy with that.

531
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.220
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, that's a good question.

532
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.330
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, or they will be extremely fearful.

533
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.940
Minh Triet Vu: Because it's something that I don't don't know about.

534
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.410
For millions years

535
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:23.640
Minh Triet Vu: Yep.

536
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.240
Minh Triet Vu: And it's the same questions. Ah.

537
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.010
Minh Triet Vu: That I'm asking myself.

538
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.720
Minh Triet Vu: Again and again and again.

539
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.280
Minh Triet Vu: Whenever I meet something new.

540
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.910
Minh Triet Vu: So that, that's, I think that's the reason why I can resonate.

541
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.930
Minh Triet Vu: Well,

542
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.340
With that movie.

543
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.060
Minh Triet Vu: Extreme X specifically that part.

544
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.210
So have you

545
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:52.830
Here.

546
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.130
Shawn Phalen: Have you have fear around

547
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.070
Shawn Phalen: What

548
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.340
Minh Triet Vu: It is to be happy. No, it's more like

549
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.300
Minh Triet Vu: I can see myself changing. And I wonder if I

550
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.890
Minh Triet Vu: Am going to be happy with it.

551
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.920
Minh Triet Vu: That's all I know it's good for me.

552
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.070
Minh Triet Vu: Even I, myself, I myself.

553
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.810
Minh Triet Vu: am very aware

554
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.580
That it's good for me.

555
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:26.640
Minh Triet Vu: But then again,

556
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.900
Minh Triet Vu: In the long run, will I be happy.

557
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:31.650
Minh Triet Vu: With that

558
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.280
Shawn Phalen: He feel happy.

559
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.700
Minh Triet Vu: I'm not sure.

560
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:43.530
Minh Triet Vu: It's the here I'm just not sure. I don't know. Even I don't even know what

561
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:46.560
Minh Triet Vu: How

562
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:47.370
I don't know.

563
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.080
Minh Triet Vu: How did you feel happy.

564
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.840
Minh Triet Vu: Is that another word for suffocation.

565
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.480
Yeah.

566
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.170
Here happy or you're happy where you are right now.

567
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:21.870
Shawn Phalen: In this moment.

568
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.100
Minh Triet Vu: So you see

569
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:36.570
Minh Triet Vu: It, it's kind of hard.

570
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.390
Minh Triet Vu: It's not that it's not that

571
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.580
Minh Triet Vu: I'm in a bad place right now.

572
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.410
Minh Triet Vu: I'm in a good place right now and I can feel that I know that

573
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.050
Minh Triet Vu: And I know that I

574
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.970
Minh Triet Vu: Will try my best.

575
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.160
Minh Triet Vu: Not to be in the exact same place.

576
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.580
Minh Triet Vu: That I

577
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.690
Minh Triet Vu: Was before

578
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.190
Minh Triet Vu: I know that

579
00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.800
Minh Triet Vu: I know that I need to change.

580
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.090
Minh Triet Vu: But

581
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.070
Minh Triet Vu: In physics, you have to base.

582
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.900
Minh Triet Vu: You have to base everything

583
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:09.360
On something

584
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:11.670
Minh Triet Vu: So,

585
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:13.260
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, to

586
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.160
Minh Triet Vu: To to

587
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:15.630
Minh Triet Vu: In order to compare

588
00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:17.280
Minh Triet Vu: The speed of two

589
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:17.940
Shawn Phalen: Cars.

590
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.460
Minh Triet Vu: You have to base it on something.

591
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:25.650
Minh Triet Vu: You have to basis on one man standing at the corner of the street.

592
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:28.350
Minh Triet Vu: And then measure, measure the

593
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.130
Minh Triet Vu: Velocity of each car and then say, Oh, this one is faster than that one.

594
00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.690
Minh Triet Vu: Or you have to

595
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:34.470
Measure

596
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.960
Minh Triet Vu: The distance that they

597
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.220
Minh Triet Vu: Travel in an hour.

598
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.010
Minh Triet Vu: To see that, Oh, this one is faster than that one.

599
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.440
Minh Triet Vu: But I have nothing to to

600
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.210
Minh Triet Vu: To compare myself.

601
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:45.540
Shawn Phalen: To

602
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.200
Minh Triet Vu: I can only compare myself with the self that I was before. And I know for sure.

603
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:52.950
That

604
00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:54.300
Minh Triet Vu: That

605
00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:57.660
Minh Triet Vu: The place that I was before was bad.

606
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.030
Minh Triet Vu: And that's the only that's

607
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:01.620
Minh Triet Vu: The only reason that I can

608
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.390
Minh Triet Vu: That's the only reason that I can tell you that

609
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.010
Minh Triet Vu: Oh right now I'm in a

610
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.790
Minh Triet Vu: Better place.

611
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.270
Minh Triet Vu: But if you if. But if you ask

612
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.620
Me internally.

613
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.100
Minh Triet Vu: Am I in a good place. Right.

614
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.150
Minh Triet Vu: Now, I don't know.

615
00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:23.550
Minh Triet Vu: But

616
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.710
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, it's just something. But to be honest.

617
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.600
Minh Triet Vu: I think I can.

618
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:31.470
I think I can live

619
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:33.600
Minh Triet Vu: In the place

620
00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:35.490
No, I mean,

621
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.850
Minh Triet Vu: The place that I'm at right now.

622
00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:45.720
Minh Triet Vu: The self of this moment particular moment right now. I think I can live with that.

623
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.300
Minh Triet Vu: So don't be worried

624
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.520
Minh Triet Vu: It just something that I have on my mind.

625
00:58:51.630 --> 00:59:04.260
Shawn Phalen: Know, and I and I understand that. I know that we talked before and I know you were not in a good place. And I think that even when we were younger, you weren't sure if you were happy.

626
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.450
Minh Triet Vu: I have been alone for a very, very, very long time.

627
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:13.830
And

628
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.440
Minh Triet Vu: So yeah, the only

629
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.620
Minh Triet Vu: The only trouble that I

630
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:21.000
Minh Triet Vu: Tend to encounter a

631
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.980
Minh Triet Vu: Lot that I think a lot

632
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:27.210
Minh Triet Vu: But I don't say it out loud. That's all. So,

633
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:32.520
Minh Triet Vu: From time to times I find myself at a place that I have

634
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:39.450
Minh Triet Vu: An incredible amount of tots, and I just need to

635
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.350
Minh Triet Vu: Somehow express it, but I'm not very good at that.

636
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:48.030
Minh Triet Vu: So yeah, better at it than you think you are.

637
00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:58.560
Shawn Phalen: Because when I meet with you, you're able to articulate your thoughts and we're able to talk about in your head.

638
01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.750
Shawn Phalen: That you're just the kind of person, you're, you're highly intelligent

639
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.320
Shawn Phalen: And highly intelligent people think a lot

640
01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:21.000
Shawn Phalen: So when you start to feel like your mind is full of all these thoughts, then you know you gotta stop talking to somebody or you gotta start writing it out on like a journal

641
01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.100
Writing, you know,

642
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.170
Shawn Phalen: Whatever.

643
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.400
Minh Triet Vu: And use the right a lot

644
01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.380
Minh Triet Vu: I used to write a whole lot

645
01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.810
Minh Triet Vu: But then it cause it cause

646
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.710
Shawn Phalen: Other people

647
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.080
Minh Triet Vu: It press so I stopped.

648
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.170
Minh Triet Vu: Friends.

649
01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.700
Your journaling.

650
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.650
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, but I need

651
01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.210
Minh Triet Vu: I need. I just need something that I can compare

652
01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.020
With

653
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:11.670
Minh Triet Vu: So this is how I saying is that normal

654
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.270
Minh Triet Vu: That's the question. And in order to to redeem

655
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.560
Minh Triet Vu: To redeem

656
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.060
Minh Triet Vu: The state of the thoughts. I had to

657
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:35.250
Minh Triet Vu: I had to give it to somebody to read it and they say they may say, oh, it's normal. A lot of people saying that or they may say

658
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.830
Minh Triet Vu: No, it's not normal.

659
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.690
Minh Triet Vu: And people

660
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:40.740
Minh Triet Vu: Don't think that

661
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:42.570
Minh Triet Vu: That much

662
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.350
Minh Triet Vu: So, yeah.

663
01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:48.180
Minh Triet Vu: Because

664
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:50.040
Shawn Phalen: My

665
01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:55.020
Minh Triet Vu: Because taught and then my opinion is by ass.

666
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.640
Minh Triet Vu: If I were to talk about

667
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.150
Them.

668
01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.850
Minh Triet Vu: With myself right

669
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.540
Minh Triet Vu: So you always need someone else to validate

670
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.680
Anything.

671
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.860
Minh Triet Vu: So taught taught generated

672
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.780
Minh Triet Vu: Within within you. Yeah.

673
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.020
Minh Triet Vu: And you have no way

674
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.250
Minh Triet Vu: To to determine whether is

675
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.210
Minh Triet Vu: Right, or

676
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.800
Minh Triet Vu: Wrong, true or false.

677
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.440
Minh Triet Vu: The only way is

678
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.560
Minh Triet Vu: To talk to somebody and then

679
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.550
Shawn Phalen: To see

680
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.160
Minh Triet Vu: To have somebody validates

681
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.300

Shawn Phalen: When you an iPod. Does this help you

683
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.950

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:16.140

688
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:16.800
Minh Triet Vu: It's

689
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.270
Minh Triet Vu: The characteristic of the job.

690
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:20.400
Minh Triet Vu: But you have great listener.

691
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.020

Shawn Phalen: I think you're happier you might question your happiness, but I can tell you this from

700
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.950

708
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.670
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, but then, you know,

709
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.840
Minh Triet Vu: There's always a tiny, tiny cell within my brain.

710
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:10.050
Minh Triet Vu: Trying to tell me not to believe that

711
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.510
Minh Triet Vu: But I would try to believe that

712
01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.060
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I believe that because

713
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:21.360
Minh Triet Vu: I don't I don't lie. And if there, if there, if I felt like there were

714
01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:30.720
Areas of Concern or areas I felt like needed to be addressed. I would address I have an ethical obligation to do that.

715
01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:35.430
Shawn Phalen: So I need you to understand that I'm not say something that's not true.

716
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:37.590
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

717
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.910
Minh Triet Vu: You know, it's not

718
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:39.990
Minh Triet Vu: It's not that

719
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.090
Minh Triet Vu: It's not that I don't believe you.

720
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.500
Minh Triet Vu: I do believe you actually are, in fact, I believe.

721
01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.710
Minh Triet Vu: You will lot more, maybe even more than just saying

722
01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:53.820
Minh Triet Vu: But then there's always, there's always

723
01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:56.790
Minh Triet Vu: A tiny cells within my brain.

724
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.690
Minh Triet Vu: Saying, not to do the right thing always

725
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:03.570
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, or maybe

726
01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:04.710
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, you know,

727
01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:05.880
Sometimes

728
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.750
Minh Triet Vu: Sometimes I know what is the right decision.

729
01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.260
Minh Triet Vu: But then I always, there's always a tiny

730
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.180
Minh Triet Vu: tiny cells of the brain.

731
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:17.130

732
01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:17.820
Minh Triet Vu: Not to do it.

Minh Triet Vu: I think it's what it's what you may call fear right fear.

734
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:27.690
Shawn Phalen: And fear turns into self sabotage.

735
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:40.710
Sabotage you know you're you know the right thing to do. You know in terms like internally, you know the right thing to do. And in your country now the right thing to do to don't follow your heart.
