Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's do a sound check, check, check. Sound check. Got did you will get sideways.

4
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.640
Lauren Anderson: I know I'm trying to make

5
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.590
Lauren Anderson: I don't know why my phone doesn't want to do it.

6
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.480
Lauren Anderson: Here.

7
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.410

Lauren Anderson: You with this direction, it did it.

9
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no. Some a mess with you.

10

Gwenevere Abriel: All right, good morning. So we've got good audio. We've got good video you can hear me okay and it's it's in sync with my video. Yep. Okay, so are you. You're you look in sync with what you're saying, I'm going to pull up a note here.

11
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.620
Were you able to get a lot

12
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We able to get in a little walk with your, with your pup.

13
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.800
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, we went around the block. So at least that then otherwise she gets a little grumpy. By the end of the meeting. She's like, you know,

14
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.340
Begun

15
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.580
Lauren Anderson: Like, what about my turn. When you talk to me.

16
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: anytime he can. Yep.

17
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.690
Lauren Anderson: So we're going to big one. After this you guys even in campus, it's paradise.

18
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how, how far away is that, that's cool. What

19
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.320
Lauren Anderson: From me. It's not that far. Do you live in Albuquerque or

20
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in Florida.

21
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.620
Lauren Anderson: Oh, okay. I wasn't sure. Um, I tell you look kind of familiar. I thought I had met you, maybe other different clinic. A few years ago, but

22
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.440
Lauren Anderson: Definitely not Florida, um,

23
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:33.150
Lauren Anderson: Let's see. It's a really steep hill from here to the UNAM but it's only once is sycamore may bowl ash pine and the university. It's like five blocks up a real steep hills to you and him and then it's a big

24
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.800
Lauren Anderson: You know, big square area campus. It's awesome, especially now, it's like, ghost town hardly

25
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.390
Lauren Anderson: Anybody is out.

26
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.340
Lauren Anderson: Anywhere. So yeah, it's really fun. It's Poppy paradise.

27
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I call it. There's just

28
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.850
Lauren Anderson: Infinite places to explore and there's a duck pond in the middle of the campus.

29
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.380
Lauren Anderson: So,

30
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.000
Lauren Anderson: Did you love to

31
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of Scituate your residence there kind of nearby school intentionally or was that kind of just an accident.

32
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.500
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I've been in the UNAM area basically for a long time. I mean, I was taking classes until a couple years ago when I fell off.

33
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of secondary to the substance use, being the most important thing was that like

34
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.690
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I lost my insurance and then I ran out of my meds of like summer 2013 I think are in. Anyways, it's a

35
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.100
Lauren Anderson: It was a year before some of them 2012 but

36
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:45.540
Lauren Anderson: It was 2013 sorry but uh, so yeah, once I ran out of that. I just slowly. Everything was kind of went by the wayside, unfortunately.

37
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.610
Lauren Anderson: Well, we get really

38
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we always eat what we studied

39
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.600
Lauren Anderson: A pure mathematics looks like abstract theoretical math and piano performance classical

40
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.280
Here.

41
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, you're like, you've got one is that those kind of brains. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's great. I'm do not have that brain that's

42
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:22.500
Lauren Anderson: I love math. I know a lot of people just don't even like it even that are good at it, or whatever. But I've always. I mean, it's always been like game for me, you know, it's that much fun so much fun that all actually. To this day, pull up my calculus book.

43
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.730
And just no

44
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.890
Lauren Anderson: Fun. No, and the true nerd true geek.

45
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, fantastic.

46
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a love that I'm

47
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.980
Lauren Anderson: Empty. I know I've always played piano since I was about to I saying when I was leaving like less than a year old with recording to me making these little songs

48
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:59.970
Lauren Anderson: And then started writing stuff on the piano when I was about to my mom showed me a couple things. And then it just, you know, flew from there started lessons with a lady. When I was when I started second grade eight seven. It just turned seven so

49
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the classes themselves.

50
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: At this is a community college. Correct. The one you just referenced.

51
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.230
Lauren Anderson: Know, University of New Mexico.

52
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So sorry sorry you and I'm sorry yeah okay I'm

53
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.260
Lauren Anderson: driving down the street from seeing them, which is the Community College.

54
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And the pure mathematics, you know, no idea what chalk it up, but I wrote it down.

55
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you take classes there. And you were advancing and you had like a double major wasn't music theory. It wasn't like you were doing two things like

56
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:50.280
Lauren Anderson: It's two different majors and as long as I complete. I think the math one first. The because I need a minor for that I've done music. I think it's the other way around. I have to

57
00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:00.360
Lauren Anderson: Finish the degree in the music first and then the mass counts as a minor and then I can still also have a second degree in the math, but it has to be in that order in order for it to work. It's

58
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.500
Lauren Anderson: Kind of screwball i right now, I owe them tuition for semester, which I have a doctor's note for from the Student Health Center actually

59
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:19.440
Lauren Anderson: But, uh, by the time I tried to file that and get the tuition waived in order to do that. It's all online now i'd had to access my account which I couldn't do because I wasn't in good standing. Because I owed the money.

60
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How much catch 22. I know, I know a lot of. There's a lot of those out there. Um, so, how much do you have. Oh, and if you're uncomfortable telling me, then we can talk about that discomfort.

61
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It. No. Okay.

62
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.260
Lauren Anderson: Semester. I think it's like a little under 2000

63
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:47.160
Lauren Anderson: Student Aid loans and stuff is a different story, but I don't need to make that perfect before I can get back in just that tuition.

64
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.510
Lauren Anderson: Okay, so

65
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now let me see got so like he just said, I'm

66
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, there's two grand, that's the part that might be holding you back from re-enrolling let's say you know the planets align and everything gets teed up

67
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's not about these other pieces these other pieces of money. It's really you've been able to sort of exact in on this, this

68
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.760
Lauren Anderson: I just needed to take rectify that semester.

69
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.580
Lauren Anderson: And then I think I'm in good standing with the University

70
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:26.340
Lauren Anderson: Yes, I think what the way I've got to do it is probably pay it, and then it afterwards retro retro grade or whatever, I'm

71
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.100
Lauren Anderson: Apply for the waiver and maybe get a reimbursement or get credited for the next semester probably gonna have to go in that order. Because otherwise, I think I'm going to be chasing my tail.

72
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.730
Okay.

73
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just now I'm taking a peek at

74
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What you had mentioned when you first met me about what your goals were

75
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And sort of juxtaposing them to the conversation we're having right now. One of the things you mentioned was I want to never use street drugs. Again, I never want to return to heroin. Yeah.

76
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.660
Lauren Anderson: That's for sure.

77
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.530
Yeah.

78
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's like, well, well.

79
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

80
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never

81
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.550
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, and I really have no desire to him, you

82
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.790
Know,

83
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:23.130
Lauren Anderson: Even when I was, you know, I was miserable. I hated it. It was never a, I don't know, with the cocaine. It's different. A bit along you know romance history with that one, but the heroin was never, I never liked it. I was always

84
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:35.850
Lauren Anderson: A really hated about my friends that were doing it years ago worried about them and negative would let them in my house, you know, because it was I've had people still for me before it over. You know, I'm

85
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry romance is really about cocaine.

86
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess. Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.000
Lauren Anderson: I do see

88
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So so so just

89
00:08:47.370 --> 00:09:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Boo, boo. Yep. Okay, so where that first part meets your goal, which is I want to never use street drugs again cocaine is the one probably you'll be thinking of and that portion when you when you said that heart. I never want this.

90
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.250
Lauren Anderson: I don't know that I'm totally over the

91
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.460
Lauren Anderson: Moon about that part yet.

92
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.950
Lauren Anderson: But I never went. I definitely feel that way about

93
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:19.650
Lauren Anderson: Heroin and I've tried math a few times on. I never want to try that again. But it's the, I don't know. I'm not over the moon about that yet.

94
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

95
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.350
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, we're wanting to use it again.

96
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

97
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.430
Lauren Anderson: To be honest,

98
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the only way this is gonna work. I love it, love it.

99
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.230
Lauren Anderson: And that alcohol to is fits in the first category never want to touch it again.

100
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it, and alcohol.

101
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and but as far as like if you had to really say goodbye to one alcohol or cocaine, which one would you go kicking and screaming like

102
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.350
Lauren Anderson: Oh no, I'm not.

103
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.120
Lauren Anderson: I'm saying I'll goes in the in the same category with the heroin. I never want to use it again.

104
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

105
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.960
Lauren Anderson: Don't have a desire to never want to not an issue for me.

106
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Easier easy like heroin alcohol. You could put it on a ship and be like, by

107
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.190
Lauren Anderson: Notification the

108
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.860
Lauren Anderson: Only thing, it's the, it's the physical

109
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.190
Lauren Anderson: Dependency is the problem with the heroin. That's

110
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.320
Lauren Anderson: Obviously, why I'm on the meds. But as far as desire. Yeah, no desire to

111
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.940
Lauren Anderson: Go back to it effort.

112
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful really really zeroing in on what originally was this and now we're kind of getting more specific, very helpful. Thank you for that.

113
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing, remember, I'm sort of taking what you shared when we first met, and I'm kind of cross referencing the discussion around this education, you know, that was probably very much in the forefront of what was directing day to day activities and

114
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.250
Lauren Anderson: And you were a big part of my life.

115
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

116
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.010
Lauren Anderson: So God even playing piano, it's

117
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.150
Lauren Anderson: From, from when I wake up when I go to sleep. That was my life and I loved it.

118
00:10:51.840 --> 00:11:01.320
Lauren Anderson: You know, that's why. Yeah, last week I was feeling so down that I just don't even feel motivated to learn to read to read, learn to read. You know, to read

119
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.180
Lauren Anderson: Or to play piano. I just resident. I was having to force myself each day to at least do a little bit to, you know, keep me in the game, kind of, I guess, but

120
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:19.140
Lauren Anderson: But not feeling the desire which is not normal for me. I was used to having a lot of positive energy and wanting to do all these things so

121
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, I'm a

122
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.380
Lauren Anderson: Lot better today than I did. I think the first time I talked to you for sure. So, yeah.

123
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So just putting putting those sort of slowing time down and I'm taking

124
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of my life was all about school and and and furthering my interest in these two things this pure math and piano and your life really revolved around that.

125
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.800
Lauren Anderson: And and nanny.

126
00:11:46.860 --> 00:12:00.060
Lauren Anderson: For my sister, my two nieces, they're born 2009 and 2013 but Britain and Hazel spelled like, Great Britain and Hazel named after my grandmother

127
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:08.790
Lauren Anderson: They're so precious and I was. That was their nanny. I watched them a whole lot. My sister did the, I think she's still doing it producing the

128
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:19.620
Lauren Anderson: Channel four Channel seven News Channel 14 so she was on when she started there the graveyard shift, she you know she was there all night, getting the news ready. So I would show up.

129
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:28.530
Lauren Anderson: 1030 or something and and watch the kids, and then I'd be there the whole next day while she slept on my days off. So I kind of had my school schedule, if I could to

130
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:39.990
Lauren Anderson: Help. My sister Marion with the with the little girls. So I would watch them. I think I my classes were on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Then, and I had one one Monday night one so I watched them.

131
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.060
Lauren Anderson: The other time. So that was kind of my full time job as far as how many hours. I was doing a week.

132
00:12:45.870 --> 00:13:02.490
Lauren Anderson: That was one of the most painful things when I fell off was losing that you know I didn't want to be around, you know, I didn't want that around them or to be around them and I was ashamed. So losing Nanny nanny and watching the girls was it's still really painful to me.

133
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And yeah, I can tell you're feeling it right now.

134
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We miss them.

135
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.600
Lauren Anderson: may miss when I love them.

136
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.360
Lauren Anderson: And I just, I can never get those years back.

137
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, it brings just we can use that negative stuff. And we can sharply bring into focus your motivation.

138
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to lose your, that's all.

139
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We use those negative reinforces and we say we don't want to lose time again.

140
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.460
Lauren Anderson: Get any more time yeah want it.

141
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't spend time in regret. We don't spend, we just use it, we say, okay, we don't want to lose time again get back into the now for back here. And what I'm doing is I'm continuing to pull back up in front of both of us. This was the goal oriented time back then and includes

142
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Being and family. Yeah.

143
00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Family. Yes. Okay. And your goals. Now, notice how your goals now are and I'm going to read them again. I want to never use street drugs. Again, I never want to return to heroin. You also mentioned, I want to find peace and work through my mental health issues.

144
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about what you mean by that.

145
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:32.520
Lauren Anderson: Well, what comes up kind of on both sides of the fence, like a because I think I told you is that progress I no longer only hurt myself cut myself burn myself for

146
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:50.940
Lauren Anderson: The emotional relief because I'd cry for 3040 hours straight, and that was that would stop it. Finally, you know, exhausting. Then, and I'd be devastated and such a horrible state of despair, and that was the remedy, but after years of doing that, I, I, you know, got till like it. I

147
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:59.370
Lauren Anderson: Knew I don't know but I liked it. So I would do it sometimes in a good mood, just for the hell of it.

148
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:13.470
Lauren Anderson: Which can be kind of scary. So I'm kind of, I don't know. So I scared because I know each time I do it more drastically as well when I'm upset, especially each time. It's a little more severe.

149
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.520
Lauren Anderson: And that scares me a little, you know, because it's not a safe thing. That's why I don't on the gun because I know just

150
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:32.130
Lauren Anderson: Take that one moment of not feeling okay and you know not the, you know, this moment will pass so you don't feel that way sometimes when it's that bad. And so I just don't. I, I know I can't have it in the house because it's

151
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:33.600
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

152
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

153
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.080
Not safe.

154
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:55.110
Lauren Anderson: But, but at the same time, I enjoy. Okay, so I'm kind of on both sides with it. I want to get rid of it in my life because I know it's a risk, and I know it hurts my family when they see these things they don't understand why would do that to myself that really hurts them.

155
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:08.790
Lauren Anderson: And. But then at the same time. Like I said, I like it. Now, like another part of it that I feel both ways. I don't like it scares me. And on the other side. I really like it.

156
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.530
Lauren Anderson: It's enjoyable. It's fun.

157
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.330
Lauren Anderson: I like to play with blood.

158
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that like so many things we have this duel experience we have these contradictory is about the human condition, and you, you have another one. And you're aware of that. And you can see

159
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I hurts my family.

160
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see it, but I like it hurts my family. There's a negative consequence, much like the substance right hurts my family and I miss my family, but I like it.

161
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:43.920
Lauren Anderson: Mm hmm.

162
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there's these this dual thing going on inside.

163
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's another way that it shows up.

164
00:16:50.280 --> 00:17:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I continue to learn how you make meaning out of certain words and one of them is I wanted to check in on what is my client. How does she define mental health issues, right. I want to find peace and work through

165
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: My mental health issues. I really wanted to understand what you meant, and now I'm getting closer and closer, I think I heard you say

166
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: When

167
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I cut myself.

168
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like it.

169
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the thing that we're going to go through together. We're going to go through that we're going to understand it more. We're going to define more and more clearly what you want around the self injury.

170
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:49.350
Lauren Anderson: I don't know. I like it. I'm not sure that I am ready to that I want to address I guess maybe at the core more is the moods that bring on the

171
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.470
Lauren Anderson: Okay, severe mutilation, um,

172
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.990
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, just those

173
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.840
Lauren Anderson: I stopped being able to maybe control my moods, a little better.

174
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.400
Lauren Anderson: I have extremes. I mean, I go way down and do those things. But I also

175
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:17.640
Lauren Anderson: I i've seen myself more elated and excited and energetic and positive and very productive creative than most people I know, also. So there's those, you know, you get the both extremes. So

176
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can, can we know that

177
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.800
Lauren Anderson: That was always my problem with medications to say to even

178
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.470
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I don't know if that's if that's peace. I don't want it.

179
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. I gotcha, I gotcha.

180
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I think I get it. I'm going to put it in the same sort of category.

181
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: As with the cocaine. It's like, no, I don't want to talk about get rid of that. Let's talk about this other piece. So let's do it. So I need a little bit more information if you could, I'd like to know the cycling. So timing of the

182
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Year. Are you familiar with the word hypomanic or manic is that word like you kind of like it.

183
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.010
Lauren Anderson: That way up.

184
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right way productive filling yet.

185
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.530
Lauren Anderson: But then I last time I

186
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:14.100
Lauren Anderson: Was a really, really big one that I stayed up for five and a half weeks maybe 48 hours of sleep total and the whole five and a half weeks and I was completely out of my gourd by the end of it. So it's not a good thing.

187
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.810
Lauren Anderson: You know, I couldn't sleep. I wanted to

188
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with me stay with me as I continue to assess. Okay.

189
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.530
Lauren Anderson: So I know hypomanic yes good description of it.

190
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a word that we could use fluidly that could encapsulate reduce need for sleep high energy

191
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: High, high confidence, I can get it all done. And I'm gonna and you move in move and move and accomplish. We can all encapsulate all of those behaviors in a really quick communication of

192
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: mania manic hypomania we could kind of encapsulate it was one word and then we could move on to the next piece of our conversation without the

193
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.620
Lauren Anderson: Overhead. Wouldn't it be hyper mania not hypo

194
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

195
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.020
Lauren Anderson: I think

196
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yes.

197
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.620
Lauren Anderson: Okay, hyper. Yeah, that's good.

198
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So Mike, it does not offend you, if I say mania or manic beautiful fantastic. Now I'd like to know a little bit about how fast it cycles. So slow way down as much as you can, try not to answer right away. Wait for it. Here it comes.

199
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically

200
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: 24 hour time span. I see myself in a given 24 hours cycling through

201
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression rejection abandonment and all the way up to hyper productive mania and then dropping back down to miserable up and down in a single 24 hour period. Up and down within those 24 hours for

202
00:20:50.640 --> 00:21:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of see which one you lean more towards that cycling's a little slower and that high might that mania might last days, and then it crashes down

203
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's this depression and that might last days and crying and maybe self injury to maybe they're in both, but the cycle itself. The high mania last days, and then the depression last days or months, tell me which one cycles in a day were more likely to cycle over many days.

204
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:38.580
Lauren Anderson: It's the longer one and within that I might have little blips of the opposite. Like you just described in the 24 hours. I'll have little, little fluctuations. But in general, it's definitely the longer cycle. I would say weeks or months, weeks of each. Yeah.

205
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And would you say today. What do you notice about where you are today just even in the span of time that you and I have been talking, which does it feel more like

206
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.160
Lauren Anderson: Still feel like I'm kind of coming out of the

207
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:11.280
Lauren Anderson: Self medication slump of heroin, which kind of just told everything down. So I wasn't really having those fluctuations, it pretty much just even me out, or I just wasn't. I was kind of just depressed, all the time. I just laid down all the time. Besides walking without

208
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now, Lauren. How do you feel

209
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:24.120
Lauren Anderson: Like I said, I'm still coming out of the slump. So I'm kind of in general, more depressed.

210
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.760
Lauren Anderson: And anxious

211
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it right now. What I'm seeing is, I can only see in here. I only have those two things. What I'm seeing and hearing your experience of it is depression and anxious

212
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

213
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

214
00:22:43.710 --> 00:23:01.590
Lauren Anderson: I'm yeah I'm still missing the energy that I used to have that feels more normal for me positive energy where I want to learn and get the absorbing things all my waking hours. I'm still waiting hoping for that to come, but I'm feeling a little better each week when I talk to you so

215
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

216
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now even even on our conversation year you're experiencing it still with depression. Do you think the depression is the part that has you moving from, let's say,

217
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: One topic to the next topic, just

218
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.220
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, absolutely.

219
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.920
Lauren Anderson: Depression well and and the manic, I was gonna say when we're talking about my school stuff.

220
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:44.460
Lauren Anderson: And the math and everything. I get, you know, I can get very manic, I think you've seen a lot where I start talking quickly get excited about things. So yeah, that's those miniature

221
00:23:44.910 --> 00:24:02.310
Lauren Anderson: Fluctuations I I guess I would probably in general, even describe when I'm really manic, um, especially as I got older, a lot of those were manic depression, where I was super high energy and super positive about all the negative shit in my life and really letting it go full throttle.

222
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.100
Lauren Anderson: If that kind of makes sense.

223
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm, I'm just curious. Um, when have you adjusted any stimulant at all today of any kind, including caffeine energy drink Coke.

224
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:26.760
Lauren Anderson: Just made coffee. I've had a couple sips. So it's I've had maybe like forceps, it's still pretty full like to hear and that's it actually slept better last night.

225
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:37.170
Lauren Anderson: That's why text today I slept in. I've been getting up at like seven 730 actually which I did. I would say I slept from like 11 to 1230

226
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:51.330
Lauren Anderson: And then I went back to sleep at about five and woke up at seven and then I took my subs and then went back to bed at eight and got up at like a like few minutes before 10 so I got almost but that's almost six hours.

227
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It was interrupted sleep not back to back, but still

228
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.510
Lauren Anderson: It was a little better than I've had, and

229
00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. Okay. Okay. Wow. Congratulations. And let me tell you something that makes a difference in how our brain functions. It really does.

230
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.520
Lauren Anderson: moods. Yeah.

231
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to be clear, you have had none. No stimulants at all in the last would you say 2448 hours or have you had a little

232
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:29.460
Lauren Anderson: Well, just the coffee. I make, like, two cups of coffee in the morning, you know, the coffee pot make that it's a it goes up to about here in this cup, which is, I don't know what this is 16 ounce maybe

233
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.220
Lauren Anderson: And that's it. I usually don't finish it. So maybe 10 ounces of coffee in the morning.

234
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had any cocaine or mass in the last 48 hours.

235
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.940
Lauren Anderson: No, I, I believe I tried enough like two times maybe three times. Years ago.

236
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:51.660
Lauren Anderson: That's all my experience with it. It's a very different. I mean, I know they're both stimulants, but you

237
00:25:51.900 --> 00:26:06.360
Lauren Anderson: Let's say you take a line of cocaine, you get high. And then you're down within about an hour. You take a line and Matthew, you're up for three days. It's, it's a very different, very different drug. So only done that two or three times ever and about 15 years ago something so

238
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So probably what I'll do what you're informing me is when I asked that question of, when was your last use I'll probably just say hey,

239
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the last time you had had cocaine and we'll

240
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.690
Lauren Anderson: Just like leave you that that assume I won't be doing this.

241
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.850
Lauren Anderson: Okay, what is the Wednesday. Okay. Wednesday before last, I think.

242
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.410
Lauren Anderson: Because I

243
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:41.430
Lauren Anderson: Talked with you and Dr. Gabriel to know that. Yeah, it was the Wednesday before last, I think, right, because we spoke last Tuesday. She joined our individual and I'd had it the Wednesday before that so

244
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's

245
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.390
Lauren Anderson: Go.

246
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go down here to we were starting or I was seeking to clarify what mental health issues will be in our work together.

247
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you clarified, for me, which is very useful is hey, Glenn don't really want to talk about saying goodbye to cocaine don't really want to say goodbye to cutting but you know we can do

248
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take those let's talk about those moods, talk about the moods and what are we talking about the deep sad and the high manic is that exactly moods that you're talking about.

249
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:36.390
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, it just be nice to be able to direct them or I don't really want to get rid of my highs and lows. But how I deal with them the tools I use to deal with them could probably be a lot more positive.

250
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:50.490
Lauren Anderson: I think a lot of my issues that that lot of times what would drive me into it. I've had a lifetime of obsessions, like I i get obsessed with someone. Usually it's not someone that even knows I exist.

251
00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:05.460
Lauren Anderson: But, and then for the guys I pick the actual guys I dated and stuff now in retrospect, they're all like my step mom to the tea leaves the dynamics are emotional

252
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:25.860
Lauren Anderson: psychological abuse or so. I've never had a physical puncher abuser. But I every single when I've dated has been that mental psychological abuse of every single one. And that more times than anything else has driven me to hurt myself and driven me into deep deep deep despair.

253
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:36.540
Lauren Anderson: So, and it can be someone also that I'm just, I'm in love with obsessed with it doesn't even know it then goes on for years and uh torments me

254
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, gotcha. So

255
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.400
Lauren Anderson: Really think

256
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear it now you have

257
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this

258
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You have one of these brains that can store logic, reason can really store away right you've got math, it can see sequence, it can really have sort of that logical side over there, you clarify this word hypo or hyper V on it right away.

259
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:27.570
Lauren Anderson: Right, it's out the window when I'm upset. I know I can be logical and know when I'm doing is irrational or that it'll pass and I just even so it's my logic not able to convince my mood brain.

260
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.370
Lauren Anderson: When it when it's that extreme.

261
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And that is typical. Those are my peeps. Okay.

262
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. These are the people I'm, I'm with you guys every day all day. Okay, this is my comfort zone. So

263
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not daunted by it. I'm I'm welcoming this information. I'm not overwhelmed, none of that. It's just really wanting to know our terms because

264
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.530
Lauren Anderson: Understand that

265
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I will. Because each word

266
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Each of us comes about the meaning of through different experiences you might there might be some word that I just I offend you somehow I say something that you're just like,

267
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.850
Lauren Anderson: To fit. It's me wrong.

268
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep. And, and so out loud in here. I want to in advance. Say I probably will. I don't mean to I'll probably offend you. I'll make a mistake, and I'll hurt your feelings. I won't intend it. And my hope is that you'll come back in here and even if you're angry.

269
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.340
Lauren Anderson: But, you know, let me know.

270
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.390
Lauren Anderson: I will

271
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.950
Lauren Anderson: Try to I did learn that from my step mom, my dad was to be very open

272
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.320
Lauren Anderson: So, yeah.

273
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And so my

274
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.880
Lauren Anderson: Fault almost like TMI or, you know,

275
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

276
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, it'll play out in here to the same way it does with I might use this word, a motto, and I might say, well, it's sort of plays out. We recapitulate it

277
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: With the people that we fallen in love with we draw back in our life that stepmother experience and I look at it from a perspective of it's a chance for us to actually heal, whether that's doing it unconsciously. I know it's our natural instinct to heal.

278
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't look at it as a pathological thing I say. Okay.

279
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to heal from that traumatic unproductive really sort of dysfunctional relationship with step mom. We keep bringing it back in our life.

280
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will, you know, because of transference and counter transference and all of that. I'll probably look like her. And if we can hang on long enough. If there gets to be enough trust in here where you can say

281
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like

282
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid you're judging me. I'm afraid I'm afraid no matter how many times you try and tell me that you think I'm good, or good enough. I still think you're thinking in the back of your head.

283
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: something negative about me or waiting until the end of the session when you're going to slam me

284
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:04.650
Lauren Anderson: Huh.

285
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to pull the rug out from under me right at the end. So I just made up a story just completely out of the blue.

286
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where your work in here. Maybe really meaningful, it might play out in our relationship. So don't be surprised if you're pissed off at me.

287
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.480
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I guess I'm not real comfortable with female therapist because the

288
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:28.950
Lauren Anderson: Issue.

289
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'll be step mom and so that now I happen to be aware of that stuff. And so I don't take it personally. I know that I'm paying attention to me. Am I being respectful. Am I do I care about her. Yes, I do. It's

290
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.860
Lauren Anderson: Usually, since it when someone's being negative like we're talking about criticism.

291
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.840
Lauren Anderson: Game group and

292
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:03.990
Lauren Anderson: Sometimes I mean, okay. Let's, for example, I go play open mic and afterwards. I call it the golden ticket compliment because it's happened to me so many times. Someone comes up great set

293
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:11.190
Lauren Anderson: And then they proceed to insult me and demean me for like 10 minutes just bash me and I know I've heard they're set to. I know it's like a

294
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:25.020
Lauren Anderson: Insecurity and the jealousy thing and I can explain that to my brain to help me feel better about the fact that they just were just so wickedly cruel to me. Um, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt just because I know why they're doing it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

295
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.560
Lauren Anderson: I like my step mom, I'm pretty sure she was doing it because it was a

296
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.230
Lauren Anderson: Jealousy thing or a competition with her daughter.

297
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.110
Lauren Anderson: I said I didn't make it hurt any less. Yeah.

298
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

299
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The comma, but right all the stuff before it all that praise and accolade is completely annihilated from the comma. But let's

300
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.060
Lauren Anderson: Start with the real short vague compliment and then they get

301
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.980
Lauren Anderson: Specific and just mean

302
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:56.280
Lauren Anderson: Not intentionally bashing. Yeah.

303
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I can recognize it right away. I haven't felt that from you at

304
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.710
Lauren Anderson: All so far. I mean sometimes I get frustrated but I haven't felt that negative

305
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:19.920
Lauren Anderson: Like undercurrent or anything like that from you I can usually be front. I think because of my step mom unless it's someone I'm in love with and dating. I can see it really clearly right away, and since it when someone's not coming from a good place with their criticism or words.

306
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Even then,

307
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be something about a gesture, it's so subtle, it might be something I wear little hand gesture some little flip of the hair. It could be any number of things that I might do. Maybe the doctor, won't you

308
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And your limbic system right it will flood you and hijack and you know how you want to say, well, I know logic and reason. Well, let's just say it's this let's play with this little theory. See if you, if you like. This is the theory I use

309
00:34:52.170 --> 00:35:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When we experience ongoing developmental trauma, which it sounds like you. You have you over and over and over and over and over and

310
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Over. Okay, so, um,

311
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The limbic system gets so activated right and it floods.

312
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The hippocampus, which holds all our memories. It's a fantastic part of the brain that's really good. And that's its job. It, it holds all these great memories.

313
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But when that flood of the amygdala comes in and actually cuts off, believe it or not, it cuts off.

314
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Reaching other parts of the brain, the messages that normally would go all the way to the different parts of the brain, and they can coordinate their efforts in the remember it, including logic it's cut off it goes right here and

315
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All it does is flood. Look at this. This is your, your hippocampus. Right. The ninja comes in these big floods, day after day.

316
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hippocampus that's met note down here memory part this is hippocampus. So watch this. This is so cool. Once I got this. I was like, that's some cool science right there, yo.

317
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So here comes so here comes right

318
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The image just like hey flood flood hijack hijack and it is releasing a you know this cortisol.

319
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's flooding cortisol over this hippocampus and that would all be fine. It's not great but this hippocampus is covered in cortisol receptors.

320
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The very memory part, the one that needs to have a proper timestamp, the one that needs to know that this event was in the past and not happening now is corrupted

321
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that cortisol is just flooding it all the time. Flooding flooding it here's what happens to memory and just want to talk about this for a second.

322
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: timestamp.

323
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's necessary. This happened when I was 10 1520

324
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't there, it messes that cortisol messes with the timestamp. So every time someone like me, I could be boyfriend. I could be female, whatever, right, it triggers something in you.

325
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That it amygdala response that limbic response feels as if it's happening when now you're there's a timestamp. It's like it's all just this flooding of intensity right now.

326
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense to me because I'm like, huh, and over time to the interventions. If you decide to continue right to keep working with me and doing some of these these techniques together. What I've watched just this

327
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All of a sudden, people are able to say, well, you know, this time the sky at work, he pissed me off for this woman said something snarky and we're normally I'd be flooded and and I would want to punch her in the face, or I want to go cut or whatever the responses I noticed something different.

328
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a distance. There's a slight distance between my response.

329
00:37:50.010 --> 00:38:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And my right, or sorry, my stimulus. And my response. There's just this little bit of distance and then over time it gets further and further so that the events of history, stay in the past where they belong. They're not relived in the moment.

330
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's exciting. I like that. I like to psychotherapy confirm that medicine can't do that. That's why behavioral health and the things that you and I are going to do, or at least going to invite you to do.

331
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can bring that healing for people

332
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.480
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I believe it. I agree. It's really important to talking

333
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.860
Lauren Anderson: Through it, and then sticking hopefully with the same therapist for a long time so you can really

334
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:42.330
Lauren Anderson: You know, draw all the issues and get to the nitty gritty. I know. I feel like it's more important, like I should be a therapist for the rest of my life, but not the meds. You know what I mean like eventually get to

335
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.920
Lauren Anderson: A point where I can you know it's a. I agree. It's more important.

336
00:38:47.430 --> 00:39:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that I didn't hear about your stories just now. I gave you some science right I explained why psychology for many, many years. Right. It's like we've known we've had these theories and science is catching up.

337
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We can now see where the blood flows and which part of the brain happens when we label I'm freaking out. I'm having a panic attack and we can measure where does the blood go

338
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's got all the attention. Where are the synopsis occurring. And we have a long way to go before we actually figured it all out. But how exciting.

339
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That psychology has relied on theory and we're starting to get some biological biochemical you know neurological evidence to support what we've been using us theory.

340
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's also transforming the work we're doing to so now how earlier you said yeah this talk I maybe I need to talk and talk about these things. There might be times when you don't want to tell me the story.

341
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.060
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, and

342
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Em Dr allows that space.

343
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.350
Lauren Anderson: With em, Dr.

344
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of neat. You can look this up.

345
00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I movement.

346
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't just be I move, and I wish they changed the name of it because it's just bilateral stimulation, but em, Dr. I movement Desensitization and Reprocessing so the RS reprocessing DSD sensitization. But when you go look it up. Don't get too hung up on the eye movement.

347
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.270
Lauren Anderson: Because the last word.

348
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.060
Lauren Anderson: Sorry reinterpretation

349
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Reprocessing. You got it. Yeah.

350
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.200
Lauren Anderson: Okay, yeah, I'll look it up.

351
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And one of the, it's the go to evidence based intervention for post traumatic stress disorder of like Vietnam vets, what have you. Because a lot of times people don't especially my client population that have sort of

352
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Sexual violations when they were little, they don't really want to talk about it.

353
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What they had an assault here or they had some really right. The whole amygdala gets remember I was telling it. It feels like it's being read lived in the moment they don't want to

354
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:07.500
Lauren Anderson: Have picking my step mom was boyfriend. So it actually went beyond her I continued with that same dynamic

355
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.770
Lauren Anderson: With the guys I dated one after not every single one was my

356
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.000
Lauren Anderson: Step on pretty much the

357
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:28.830
Lauren Anderson: The dynamic so I kept reinforcing it basically that that trauma, in a way, but I couldn't even see it. You know, I didn't even know when i would i attracted to these men until retrospect like oh my god that was like, just like Vicki very, very strange.

358
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So just just restating or I'm staying way sort of on a psycho educational level saying way out here kind of talking about science and I was defining some terms for future work together.

359
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to continue the whole piece. This is the part of the reason why I just brought up the am Dr. Is this number hours telling you that the amygdala hijacks

360
00:41:48.750 --> 00:42:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And right makes you feel as if that trauma is really happening in the moment. What's really unique about em dr is this. You do not have to tell me

361
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The trauma. It is so cool. All you have to do, and there is still some desensitization because you're pulling it off in your own awareness. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, of course you can. Sometimes we want to witness. We want to finally tell someone but that's your choice.

362
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.430
Lauren Anderson: Don't have to do it to them, you know,

363
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.260
Lauren Anderson: You don't think for Tarsus, you

364
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have for

365
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Isn't that wild. That's so cool. I think that's

366
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.870
Lauren Anderson: counterintuitive. I

367
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.220
Lauren Anderson: Don't know that I buy it.

368
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely. You don't have to. It's so cool. So for some people they don't want to say it. It's so activating and re traumatizing to say it again. They don't want to

369
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have this other piece which is to do the Desensitization and Reprocessing experience through the bilateral stimulation and it works. It's so cool. So if there's ever a time where you don't want to tell the story.

370
00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But you want to have a different relationship with that story with that memory with that image with that emotion. We have alternative techniques that we can do and it is working even here through the cello medicine.

371
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.290
Lauren Anderson: But, uh, but if I can talk about it.

372
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.330
Lauren Anderson: Will be beneficial or

373
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. You, this has to do with creating options for you guys. If you, if you're in. Usually I can tell whether someone wants been yeah wants to talk about it or not.

374
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: For many of us, like what you're probably describing is you want to say it right and you can want high reaction, you can kind of see, you know, she feels

375
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:37.080
Lauren Anderson: Allies, it kind of get an affirmation and assurance that uh

376
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:41.280
Lauren Anderson: I'm not just crazy. And she was in the right the whole time thing, right, that's

377
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All Yeah, then it's going to be really important for you to make sure you get, get those stories out

378
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:54.330
Lauren Anderson: I could understand sexual abuse, especially as kids that they've. I think if that were the case with me. I don't know that I'd want to talk about it with people either

379
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:54.810
Lauren Anderson: Write

380
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:55.950
Lauren Anderson: A whole

381
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.350
Lauren Anderson: Whole nothing I could see that for sure.

382
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.090
Lauren Anderson: Even physical abuse it.

383
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:08.640
Lauren Anderson: There's kind of a shame. Maybe involved with it with if your parents are doing that unspeakable kinda I know I can understand

384
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do something a little different today before because we've got

385
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of time, I'd like to take just the last little piece.

386
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like I'm inviting you to take a look at today's session.

387
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just rewind it

388
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And look through it. Your memory.

389
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're coming away with what's your maybe

390
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A slightly

391
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: new insight that you have into yourself maybe you noticed something a little different about yourself today. It could be just the smallest thing. But what what do you think you noticed about me. That was a little different.

392
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.850
Lauren Anderson: Um,

393
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:49.590
Lauren Anderson: I don't know.

394
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.540
Lauren Anderson: I, I definitely I'm gonna look up the EMT ER and the non lateral

395
00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:07.080
Lauren Anderson: Bilateral bilateral the bilateral thing. I wrote it down bilateral stimulation. I'm gonna look those up. So I kind of an end the parts of the brains of a little better basis when we're talking about it next time.

396
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:20.100
Lauren Anderson: Totally that's on my list of to do's okay um and I don't know I always feel afterwards, no matter what. But, you know, I'm a little more emotional I feel cleansed, a bit like that day I feel refreshed like a

397
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.920
Lauren Anderson: Bit of a new

398
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:37.350
Lauren Anderson: New Leaf turning over a new leaf, a little bit afterwards I feel refreshed. No matter, no matter what it's positive, and it's reassuring. So I don't know, different. I DON'T KNOW. I'D LIKE TO INTERRUPT YOU less and be able to shut my mouth.

399
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.430
Lauren Anderson: Okay, without

400
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:44.700
Lauren Anderson: You know, I do and I literally can't stop myself sometimes it's well I know I can. I need to learn to

401
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.150
Lauren Anderson: Me to, like, shut up, Lauren.

402
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Going on and on, on

403
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um,

404
00:45:54.090 --> 00:46:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I heard you. There's a sense of relief and there's this

405
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an inner critic there too, which is shush. Oh, look at you, you're talking so much but there's also relief there. If there's that both and again

406
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a really

407
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm still criticizing myself.

408
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that's one of the things, Major, I'd like to address here actually as my a

409
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:27.090
Lauren Anderson: Nice social anxiety. I, I, not this way at home alone when I'm with people I have that my heart starts racing.

410
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:34.110
Lauren Anderson: My palms are sweaty and I feel like I'm going to start weeping and I can't shut up. I'm like motor mouth, and it's a

411
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:43.710
Lauren Anderson: People think I don't know if they think it's because I'm extra social and open and talkative. It's really not that, in fact, it's the exact opposite. I'm so uncomfortable and nervous.

412
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:54.690
Lauren Anderson: And I can't even get ahold of myself and it would be nice to that I can see it affects other people and it's, I don't know, it doesn't really reflect me very well, because I'm pretty sure it's probably misunderstood.

413
00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, let's, let's, I'm going to reopen this this note, let's try it a little goal around that. I'm excited because I liked. I like that idea. The second time you brought that up. So let me get in here and

414
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.380
Lauren Anderson: Now just off to the talking about and talking so fast I

415
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.480
Lauren Anderson: It is there, right there. Like I feel like I'm gonna start weeping. At the same time, it's

416
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.860
Lauren Anderson: It's with it. It's

417
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the third time I've seen it and it's right at the end. So there's something going on.

418
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.950
Lauren Anderson: And you know it happened earlier to

419
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.650
Lauren Anderson: Oh yeah, three or four times.

420
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks a lot like the yes but

421
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks a lot like the comma. But as if like the whole session is okay. This is really, that's all nice and find a good one is when going to slam me right at the end. Hey, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that to you.

422
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

423
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.240
Lauren Anderson: Okay, I'm not worried about that.

424
00:47:52.170 --> 00:48:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, I wanted to see if we can. Real quick, I'm going to type something up. You know how you just said social anxiety and you identified some behaviors. Let's refine them. What would you like to see yourself do more of

425
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to see yourself do less of around social anxiety.

426
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:20.310
Lauren Anderson: Um, I would like to try to restrain myself maybe at the beginning from just starting to talk because that I'm starting to recognize it with you.

427
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:30.240
Lauren Anderson: Because when I'm listening. I can keep my mouth shut. I wonder if I could just as an experiment around people not speak because once I start. It's hard for me to control it just

428
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:47.130
Lauren Anderson: You know that like you've seen some maybe that could be not permanent, you know, never speak whenever I'm people but just, uh, I don't know. I'd like to be able to, if I open my mouth to just respond or make my comment without extrapolating endlessly.

429
00:48:47.670 --> 00:49:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see if we can refine that even more. That's exciting. Um, so, let's see, we've got you. You push back and tell me what yours is. But see, if we're getting close with this one. I'd like to see myself respond to any question this just as an experiment to any question in

430
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: five words or less.

431
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or 10 words or less. Are we getting close.

432
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:18.180
Lauren Anderson: Maybe five or less, but I think 10am I'd already be on my diary, of course.

433
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see how close. How much do we really saying five words I found that experience welcoming that's five words do you think

434
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:31.320
Lauren Anderson: Maybe, maybe seven or eight, I don't know, maybe up to 10, I guess.

435
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How about that. Let's just start somewhere.

436
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're even being able to live it, it

437
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be kind of cool for you to be like, Oh my gosh, I did it on. Now, let me see if I can tighten it even more we can play in there. Let's see what happens with under 10

438
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.040
Lauren Anderson: Okay, and they do. I think if I don't, because that's when I start talking because of the

439
00:49:50.760 --> 00:50:02.280
Lauren Anderson: I don't know if it's because I don't I don't start talking because I'm anxious, but because of my anxiety and uncomfortable at once I start talking that the fact that it's like the attentions on me because I'm speaking make

440
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:08.400
Lauren Anderson: ME NERVOUS. And then I can't shut up. So it kind of activates the anxiety because suddenly I'm in the spotlight.

441
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

442
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:18.300
Lauren Anderson: Sad. I'm more comfortable on stage playing piano than anything else in the world. And I'm not nervous about it. Well, good nervous. The beginning, you know, it helps you perform better, but

443
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I've got an idea of kind of how to work this piece.

444
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the sort of homework invitation part some little behavioral experiment for you to try on but I want to put in quotes. I love my quotes

445
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want to hear from you what your goal is. See if you can wrap in the words social anxiety. See if you can label.

446
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to baba baba blah social anxiety something with social nice and short so you can keep it in under 10 words if we can find it. What's your goal around your social anxiety.

447
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.440
Lauren Anderson: For this week.

448
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: No for the whole your life.

449
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:01.920
Lauren Anderson: I don't know.

450
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.330
Lauren Anderson: I don't, I don't really know. I mean, where do I go and I can't

451
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.650
Lauren Anderson: When I'm not, I don't know.

452
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.210
Lauren Anderson: I don't know what I want

453
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want less social anxiety.

454
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.870
Lauren Anderson: I want to feel it. That's for

455
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure, yeah.

456
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then that's the one just so simple.

457
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a beautiful one

458
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.700
Lauren Anderson: Nice. I like my thought processes to be

459
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.930
Lauren Anderson: Called as comb.

460
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:31.440
Lauren Anderson: Around people as they are when I'm alone.

461
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:46.650
Lauren Anderson: So that I can express myself succinctly without overwhelming my listeners with so much information because it's not mindless dribble dribble, but it's a lot of information when I just keep going and going and this because this, uh, but

462
00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

463
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.450
Lauren Anderson: I probably creating anxiety and hundred people.

464
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So well

465
00:51:54.600 --> 00:52:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this together, let's, my eyes are closed and I'm going to turn my head to slide off to the side.

466
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do a little bit of breathing only just like let's say we'll set three breaths.

467
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to see what it's like to be here together without words, just so we can test this theory, we've got

468
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:21.600
Lauren Anderson: The no words. Okay. It really is. When I speak that the anxiety comes I could sit with someone in silence comfortably.

469
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're talking. So let's see ready. Here we go. Three inhale.

470
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, helping out

471
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

472
00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

473
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale into the belly nice expanded lower

474
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: lower part of the body, they're expanding and then when you're ready, just exhale it all out.

475
00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep your eyes closed. If you can pay attention to your heart. See if it increase in its rate demand for oxygen or if it stayed the same.

476
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.440
Lauren Anderson: New columns on third stop talking.

477
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You did. Okay. Oh, that's exciting. So that's, that's something we can work with. Right.

478
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:20.910
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I knew that I know that to be true. It's the talking that activates it and then I

479
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.470
Lauren Anderson: Get up.

480
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:33.960
Lauren Anderson: I think maybe five words is better than 10 honestly I think 10 is a little too far out in the field where I'll lose hold

481
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll keep going. So

482
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.260
Lauren Anderson: Then I think before I speak. Okay, five words put in your response to five, you know,

483
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.170
Lauren Anderson: more manageable. Let's do it.

484
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it. And what I would invite you to do is

485
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get more into the breath work, but we're kind of at the end of the hour here. For most people, it's key.

486
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to want to really explain that in depth and invite you to practice it on a regular basis. But in the meantime, I love your idea and I go back and change the goal to five no more than five words. Okay.

487
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.620
Lauren Anderson: What do you mean breathing this key like when I'm actually with someone in this experiment with the five words.

488
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.240
Lauren Anderson: And what would you, what would be your

489
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.370
Lauren Anderson: Recommendation with the room I

490
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell you, I will tell you exactly what it is. This is what it would look like I'm

491
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, it is the belly breathing and that's very, it's a pretty formal piece. We did a tiny bit of it, but it was right at the end. And I don't know that it's stuck. And I know you already know breath work. So this is socially what it would look like.

492
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone asked me a question.

493
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I give myself permission to take a breath to create time for blood to return to my brain not to my large muscle groups and blood goes back to my brain. And I remember. Oh.

494
00:54:55.230 --> 00:55:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I am doing an experiment. Every time someone talks to me. I'm just going to say five words, I'm actually going to write it down.

495
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, here's my response to this guy won't do you really like that that artist. I mean, he's kind of like kind of cheating and he kind of cheats and borrow someone else's music me really like me respect that guy.

496
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I like Sam whatever I'm making up a name. Sam Jones made up an artist. I like I like Sam Jones 1234. Wait a minute. I LIKE JOHN Sam.

497
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of his

498
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: melodies 1234567. I don't know how we can accomplish this in five words. But if you can. That's great. I had a hard time even responding with seven

499
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: By

500
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:49.440
Lauren Anderson: 10 then make but but breathing. First, maybe we'll make reasonable manage

501
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.250
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, here.

502
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what it. Yep. Here comes the breath. This is what it looks like. Socially

503
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.750
Lauren Anderson: Okay with hi Gwen.

504
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Here we go. Watch.

505
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She got half smile. I'm breathing now and I'm staying socially engaged. I'm looking at this person and I want you to see how long it actually takes whether it really is that awkward silence. So here we go say hi to me again.

506
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.240
Lauren Anderson: Okay. Hey, Glenn. What do you think about that.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, did you notice I went I gave, there was time. Did you want to see it again. I went like this.

509
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I took a breath and I smiled, and I kind of move my body. I was also still in connection and communicating with them.
