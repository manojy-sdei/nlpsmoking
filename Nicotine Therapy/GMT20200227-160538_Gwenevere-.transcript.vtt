00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.970
Daniel Guerrero: I've been trying to

16
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.430
Daniel Guerrero: I've been trying to practice, you know, a lot of like keeping cool you know like

17
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.140

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.810
Daniel Guerrero: So aggravated all the time.

19
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.840
Daniel Guerrero: I catch myself, you know, getting aggravated at times and I just like

20
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know, try to, you know, slow down and do the box breathing a little bit more

21
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.030
Daniel Guerrero: And then

22
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.710
Daniel Guerrero: But for the most part I, you know, I've been having a pretty good week. You know, I've been

23
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.070
Daniel Guerrero: I've been trying to stay more focused at work.

24
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.210
Daniel Guerrero: Even though I'm really like getting irritable in my job.

25
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:47.340
Daniel Guerrero: But I've been I'm just looking at the positive about my job is because without my job. I can't pay my bills. So that's like a positive that that keeps me going there.

26
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.690
Daniel Guerrero: On the positive is like without my job. I can't, you know, provide for my children so

27
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.650
Daniel Guerrero: The net

28
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.530
Daniel Guerrero: Work.

29
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Me about the irritability or what is it a person like

30
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.320
Tell me about the room.

31
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.810
Daniel Guerrero: It's just, it's more

32
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.210
Daniel Guerrero: It's more the boss, then, did anybody else because

33
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.960
Daniel Guerrero: Now, sometimes I just I just feel like I'm worth more than what he's paying me

34
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.380
Daniel Guerrero: Because I do a lot. I do a lot of the work you know like and

35
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.860
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like I'm worth more than what he's paying me

36
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.030
Daniel Guerrero: But I'm thankful for what I'm getting you know I'm thankful for, for what I do get paid.

37
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.960
Daniel Guerrero: And I started doing the math. You know, when

38
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.590
Daniel Guerrero: Something's not adding up because

39
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.930
Daniel Guerrero: On a weekend.

40
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.050
Daniel Guerrero: On a on a on this for an example, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

41
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.710
Daniel Guerrero: I get eight hours a day that's that's 24 hours.

42
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.340
Daniel Guerrero: And at $10 an hour.

43
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.530
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

44
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.660
Daniel Guerrero: It's 240 bucks. Okay. That happens twice a week. So, and twice a week.

45
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.370
Daniel Guerrero: You know, that's like 480 books.

46
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah where's

47
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.770
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. But see, that's just, that's just it. And other than that I'm making an extra

48
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.820
Daniel Guerrero: Hundred and 50 bucks. And that's it. That's all I'm making all my checks, is you know 500 and almost $600 every two weeks. That's not any money.

49
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you you were in total agreement only differences and I'm just jumping in here. This doesn't mean this is really your point and just struck me

50
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You you

51
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: can earn more money.

52
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably in a different job now when you signed on with this guy, like it or not, you probably agreed on the rate of $10. Is that right,

53
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.680
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, I'm actually when I, when I first got hired with them. I started at 850

54
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.060
Daniel Guerrero: So I've been, and we'll see, I've made it this far in about seven months.

55
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.590
Daniel Guerrero: Uh huh. I've made it $1 50 raised about seven months.

56
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.170
Daniel Guerrero: Eight months about and what the deal is, is that

57
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.920
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if I'm just being selfish or what but my mom is like you gotta be thankful. You have a job, you know,

58
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.560
Daniel Guerrero: But okay.

59
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

60
00:05:43.680 --> 00:06:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a phrase that I think matches you and you are under employed. I told you that you are an intelligent charismatic your grasp of language is so like just like because you've been in management.

61
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: it your way of speaking is so professional, you can. Aside from this record of yours, which is a real inconvenience.

62
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

63
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You could go anywhere. I mean, you, you, you really truly do you have this tone of grace. Your way of speaking. I just think that would not be an issue.

64
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no doubt you are what we would call right in the in this field underemployed, which means you're in a job that isn't really capitalizing in all of your skills. Okay. And you're not at your earning potential. It's not this guy's fault, this may not be the place for you.

65
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.310
Daniel Guerrero: Right. And I've been taking it. You know, I've been like, I remember last time I told you I had been working on that resume.

66
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.520
Daniel Guerrero: And so I had been doing that.

67
00:06:52.290 --> 00:07:02.460
Daniel Guerrero: I also called I got so caught up the college and so on the 30th of the March we have, I have to go do some testing for three days or four days.

68
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.260
Daniel Guerrero: I guess they're going to see like

69
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.360
Daniel Guerrero: Where am I, where am I at, you know, I guess I do these like math and then like

70
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.760
Daniel Guerrero: Placement. There you go.

71
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.220
Daniel Guerrero: So I'm going to do that on the 30th. So

72
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:36.420
Daniel Guerrero: I'm really hoping that I want to get my GED and but like I want to get my GED, so I can try to do something, you know, positive, you know, because you know most places now they asked for a GED, you know, and, and, like,

73
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.830
Daniel Guerrero: I want to get a better job. So I'm waiting for

74
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.570
Daniel Guerrero: I got like two and a half years left and I can get my CTO, so that's

75
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:54.120
Daniel Guerrero: That's basically what I'm trying to do is is kind of just make it for these two and a half more years. And so I can get a CDO

76
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:02.490
Daniel Guerrero: So I can drive for a four major trucking company because they've already recruited me. But what's holding me is that the felony is still

77
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.180
Daniel Guerrero: Under 10 years okay the initial charges under 10 years

78
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.960
Daniel Guerrero: BUT WHEN I CAUGHT THE CHARGE. I wasn't charged for it until 2013 so it still makes it under 10

79
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.750
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so, like, so when I got caught when I got caught with the possession

80
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:32.250
Daniel Guerrero: I went to court and everything, but they didn't actually charge me with it until like august of 2013

81
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:44.940
Daniel Guerrero: So that's when the felony stuck was in at that time. So for three years, almost two and a half years. I was on the streets, you know, working going to court going to court going to court.

82
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.890
Daniel Guerrero: Then finally,

83
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.580
Daniel Guerrero: They send it to me on that charge. Go, go, go.

84
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.070
Daniel Guerrero: But, um, so that's what's making it an issue today.

85
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.410
Daniel Guerrero: Go.

86
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.110
Daniel Guerrero: There.

87
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

88
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great that you followed through with the placement testing. Where are you going, what what school is that

89
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:36.120
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, yeah, that's a club. Is that close community college that CCC that you and I talked about

90
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said the 30th. But there's there's no 30th. Is it that it's on Monday, March.

91
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.230
Daniel Guerrero: Is it understood. YEAH, IT'S MARCH 30 oh

92
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

93
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.550
Thank you.

94
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Okay. All right.

95
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.520
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, because they already had, like,

96
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.190
Daniel Guerrero: They had already registered

97
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:03.360
Daniel Guerrero: So we have to wait for them to to register again. So that's why I had to wait till March 30

98
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:06.570
Okay.

99
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I want to hear. Because here's what might happen, right. It can get a little

100
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: sketchy. If

101
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking at your boss expecting him to continue on a raise, sort of situation if it hasn't been agreed on. So what's where's the miscommunication is

102
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.020
Daniel Guerrero: That although it has been agreed on. Right.

103
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.130
Daniel Guerrero: He told me that when he gave me this race.

104
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.800
Daniel Guerrero: Just to give them a couple months or a few more months and that he would get me, you know, up to where I want it to be.

105
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready, one,

106
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.260
Daniel Guerrero: Will be honest, I want to be at least at 1112

107
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple means to in my language, a few means three

108
00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.640
Daniel Guerrero: And what I've been pretty

109
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Fortunate to hear from him. What that expectation was

110
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:18.930
Daniel Guerrero: Right, because there hasn't been hasn't been like, so it's been like at 50 cents at a time. Right, but it's been 50 cents at a time for an example, three months or two and a half months at 50 cents at a time.

111
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.080
Daniel Guerrero: And it's just it just frustrates me. This is the only frustration that I have is because I'm

112
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.400
Daniel Guerrero: At my job. I do I do about

113
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.860
Daniel Guerrero: 80%

114
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.110
Daniel Guerrero: Of the kitchen work.

115
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.960
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm not recognized for it. I had a big I begged him for a day off.

116
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.450
Daniel Guerrero: In the middle of the week for Saturday, right, because my family and I, we want to go to Lubbock, Texas. I don't know if you know or love books at

117
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All but is it for fun. We're going to go have some

118
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.330
Daniel Guerrero: Fun. Right. Well, my mom lives there.

119
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.240
Daniel Guerrero: And

120
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.690
Daniel Guerrero: So that's where we want to. I swear I want to go.

121
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.020
Daniel Guerrero: But I don't I'm only off on Sundays. Right. And so I'm like,

122
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.540
Daniel Guerrero: I asked him for Saturday.

123
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.080
Daniel Guerrero: Like, what can I have Saturday and Sunday off or Sunday. We're closed so I said I need Saturday off.

124
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.530
Daniel Guerrero: Because I want to go to Lubbock will see my wife and my son also work at my job.

125
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.220
Daniel Guerrero: He's like, well, I'll give you up, but I can't give them off.

126
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.280
Daniel Guerrero: I don't like really

127
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.050
Daniel Guerrero: And then my daughter is a fatness there.

128
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:45.540
Daniel Guerrero: And he's like, he went ahead and instead of just, you know, letting all three of them because they all three work during the daytime. My wife, my daughter and my son.

129
00:12:47.040 --> 00:13:05.550
Daniel Guerrero: And instead of letting my daughter. Go ahead and work. He gave her the day off to, well, he didn't give my wife and my son a day off, but because I work in the afternoon he was able to cover the afternoon shift right but he couldn't cover the daytime shift.

130
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.940
Daniel Guerrero: And so I figured it would be the same for not covering the daytime shift is covering a fountain shift.

131
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:20.400
Daniel Guerrero: But he went ahead and gave my daughter off. Well, she only gets two days a week because he goes to high school, right. She's a, she's a sophomore in high school.

132
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.650
Daniel Guerrero: And I don't want her working more than, you know, few hours a day.

133
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:33.060
Daniel Guerrero: Because to me, her education is important because I don't have one. So I strive for them to have one right

134
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

135
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.450
Daniel Guerrero: Thank you. And so

136
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.180
Daniel Guerrero: But you know, it's like

137
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.760
Daniel Guerrero: But I'm already comfortable. So, I'm afraid. Like if I go to some results and expect

138
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:59.910
Daniel Guerrero: And then I don't get what I'm expecting, then it may turn into a situation to where I become an employee. I know, right. And so that's why I stay. That's what I stay there. I understand.

139
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you were this manager. How would get the shift covered what Bonnie's what staff would cover it for that Saturday and Sunday.

140
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.030
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, um,

141
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.040
Daniel Guerrero: But

142
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would do it if your family wasn't there.

143
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.030
Daniel Guerrero: Nobody, nobody could

144
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's a pickle right there's there's one really negative challenge, right. Um, another one has to do with this piece, you just talked about. I'm doing these things. Right. Are you overdoing hoping that that will get the attention from him.

145
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:47.580
Daniel Guerrero: Oh no, because I'm you know i i have one level that I try to stay on.

146
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.250
Daniel Guerrero: I said I set a standard for myself. I don't care what anybody else is doing, you know,

147
00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:06.930
Daniel Guerrero: I work hard for myself. I don't work. You know, I work hard, because you know I went, I went to what I'm trying to lead by example. You know, I'm trying to be the example you know that everybody needs to follow, but

148
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.230
Daniel Guerrero: I got a couple of guys that works for me that are, you know, under the age of 27 you know so

149
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

150
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:32.280
Daniel Guerrero: Amen. And I take that I take that into a real high consideration on like your youngster, you know, oh man. No, you're not a man you you still got about two and a half more years.

151
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Statistic center. So, okay, all right.

152
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, rewind.

153
00:15:47.250 --> 00:16:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, what did you like about What didn't you like and what you're doing is you're struggling with, right, you obviously want more money coming in, but you're also talking about you're putting all of this energy into this job.

154
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know you're saying, No, I don't expect anything in return. But notice how you said, I do 880 percent

155
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:12.690
Daniel Guerrero: Of the kids.

156
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you know out to me that doesn't i do i do 100% of the kitchen work like doesn't have any meaning. What does that mean to you like like.dot.so what like what does that mean to you.

157
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.340
Um,

158
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:36.870
Daniel Guerrero: Well you know I like I like doing. I am a cook, you know, inside you know deep inside of me, I'm a cook. So it's like, no, it's not really

159
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.930
Daniel Guerrero: It's not really that hard, you know,

160
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.460
But

161
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: It's more of the labor part I guess that I'm doing. I'm like,

162
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.080
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I don't know, you probably never worked in fast food before restaurant because

163
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.710
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, but like when you're working in the kitchen. You know there's there's a bunch of like

164
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:05.610
Daniel Guerrero: Besides cooking, you know, there's dishes to be washed my being, you know, cleaning that needs to be done. Yeah.

165
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.470
Daniel Guerrero: So I do a lot of that. I do a lot of the

166
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:17.400
Daniel Guerrero: Good part of it without question without without argument without

167
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.840
Daniel Guerrero: You know something just to me. It's an immediate. Yes, sir. No, sir. I got you.

168
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.370
Daniel Guerrero: Right on it you know type deal

169
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.540
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like that. Maybe I'm not being

170
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:44.250
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like I'm being taken. You know, like I never say for granted. I'm just feel like I'm talking, you know, like advantage of because

171
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.680
Daniel Guerrero: Well, he'll do it.

172
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Daniel. Stay right there.

173
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is tricky. If you go in today, tomorrow.

174
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you stop.

175
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing. Let's call it, we're actually going to call it.

176
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to call it 100% if you see something that needs to be done. Done. You will go do it. You just will

177
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't need to be asked if this needs to be filled. This needs to be cleaned this needs to be replenished. And you're just going to go to it.

178
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get price for it and you don't get compensation money.

179
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I'm hearing you saying this is pretty common for people, they're blaming the boss for that.

180
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember earlier I said you're upset because you want to be seen for what you're doing. You said, No, no, no, I'm doing because I want to be. I'm trying to set an example let's rewind a little bit

181
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not your family well

182
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott funny family is working there but your boss is not your family. So there's no law right there's no love on the line there.

183
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a job when

184
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I do this, I do this, I do this, and I do this. And for that, I get this compensation.

185
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to take a look at whether you were hoping that if you do hear this really great stellar right 100% guy, something needs to be done, that you will get

186
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Compensation for it. I mean, think about it. Do you only want to. Oh, good boy, you're such a great employee or do you want a higher paycheck for it.

187
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.550
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I need a higher paycheck.

188
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

189
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Our fans. We want to thank you, our family. Those that's where we get our praise.

190
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where it feels good, but at work. We're not there to get a hug. Okay. We're there to pay our bills.

191
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So just notice how your phrasing was wanting to blame him for being taken advantage of.

192
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't asked to do those things you did it with an expectation, it would be acknowledged and the compensation would be there.

193
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.840
Daniel Guerrero: And I know this stuff is

194
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Super hard to hear. But you do decide whether you want to do that. Hundred percent or you want to reel it in. So you're not angry and resentful, and all of those feelings packed up about to pop off.

195
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like can't take it anymore. You know your I'm feeling exploited. I don't want you to get to that point, either.

196
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it means that you you're like lots of choices. You can either be real clear with him say listen without being asked. I'ma tell you these are the 10 things I'm doing

197
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: My checks not reflecting it. I'm going to turn all of like all those that that's about a, you know, about seven hours extra work that I'm doing a week.

198
00:20:51.330 --> 00:21:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not being reflected in the compensation. I'm going to be doing this with it. Instead, so I'm just going to make you know be turning. I don't know what the task is I'll just be sticking with reorganizing this thing is that's part of what you're paying before

199
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we could negotiate a pay increase because I, I'm happy to continue with these activities. But who do you know, who do you think's going to come in and do it like, what's this, what's your boss's name.

200
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.160
Daniel Guerrero: Newsletter Lance

201
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Lance That's funny. My name is pointed here. So, all right. Um, so, Lance Lance

202
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Lance Lance a lot. So, Lance.

203
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.070
Lance is loving it.

204
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What

205
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.440
Daniel Guerrero: Did you say Sir Lancelot

206
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:47.370
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

207
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.890
Daniel Guerrero: That was pretty funny.

208
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. My name is going to be or so Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur and Lady, whatever.

209
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I

210
00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so my hair. Um, so basically got Lance, and he's like, this is great. I got this great employee and I don't need to pay him a lot of money. And we have this really loose arrangement.

211
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You have

212
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.920
A choice.

213
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you got a lot of choices. One of them that happened to be thinking of right now.

214
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you can sit down with them and say,

215
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm actually doing more than what we agreed on.

216
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, are you willing to compensate me for that or ask Sarah Fred or Benny to do those tasks and pay them or would you like to sort of compensate me for them.

217
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I realize, you know, I'm not getting compensated for it is pulling from my my time elsewhere. So that's it. You can truly define what the job is and say this is this is this is I think a reasonable compensation for it.

218
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you don't do 100% you only do at you pull back because watch, believe it or not, this is really hard for people to get

219
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your and I'm saying it's slow you're reinforcing

220
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Lance every time you keep working for nothing that extra work in the kitchen and refilling things and cleaning and all that.

221
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing

222
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The shaping of behavior. You're telling Lance you'll do it for free.

223
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is really tricky. Daniel only, you know, the nuance of being in that relationship about whether

224
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to do those extra little things in order to continue to get this 50 cent piece this this increase only you know that i don't know that I'm completely I'm out of it. Right. You will register the truth of that environment you to write, you're in it so you know what's up.

225
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't want you to feel trapped. You're a participant in it.

226
00:23:55.170 --> 00:24:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say to me kind of this. I feel stuck, they're trapped afraid to say goodbye. Well, what if there's a period of unemployment.

227
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's, that's why you're tolerating what you're tolerating

228
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: My getting

229
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The main point.

230
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:27.420
Daniel Guerrero: I get it. Yeah, you know, because I have I have bills to do every two weeks. You know, I have I have set up a system that were some of my bills are due every two weeks. Okay. And so I've been doing that for the past eight months, you know that these bills are due on

231
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:35.310
Daniel Guerrero: Every two weeks. And if they're not paid for, then there's a chance. It's going to be my car is going to be talking

232
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:43.650
Daniel Guerrero: You know, or, you know, some of the things that I have in my house. You know, I had to go to, you know about my, my kid some really nice furniture and stuff but um

233
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.440
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I started you know getting down that focused, you know, started get on the right track again.

234
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.830
Daniel Guerrero: And so there's something I don't want to lose.

235
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.380
Daniel Guerrero: All right, can I

236
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:13.590
Daniel Guerrero: Can I find another job within two weeks. I think I could if I put my energy into it. Okay, but I don't have that time, right. So, because I'm at home I you know we sometimes we take turns taking the kids to school in the morning.

237
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.440
Daniel Guerrero: And after that.

238
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.080
Daniel Guerrero: I worked from two o'clock to 10 o'clock.

239
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:29.910
Daniel Guerrero: Every day, six days a week and I'm bringing home 550 bucks every two weeks.

240
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.050
Daniel Guerrero: And it's to me. It's not worth it.

241
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:34.920
Okay.

242
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

243
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.760
Now,

244
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes when people are on a pre trial release probation. I don't think you are. You're not on any kind of supervision of any kind, but those offices. Do you still have a decent connection with a with a prior to you have a good relationship.

245
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.470
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I think I

246
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: called him up and be like, look, I'm

247
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm having a hard time finding employers that will take me on. I'm looking for, you know, 12 to $15 an hour deal here supporting this many kids.

248
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a list.

249
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Of employers that you tend to refer your supervisors to that are kind of bonded because that's sometimes what what a

250
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Drug Court or something will do, they'll, they'll go out in the community and they'll tell certain employers, they'll say, Listen, I've got some felony folks there offenders, but they're good. I can vouch for them.

251
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to send Daniel over

252
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And they may have a list of organizations that welcome felons felony record folks like you. And even if that conversation isn't isn't the one you can say

253
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah, maybe. Maybe that's a little I only I only send the people that have supervising okay okay well what would you suggest keep maybe. Hey, do you know anyone who might know

254
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, you know,

255
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Stocking being able to stop ization whether it's Walmart or it's $1 tree or something.

256
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:31.590
Daniel Guerrero: And that's something I did do. I went, I went to Walmart and I had, I put in the application. I went to the just like first little session.

257
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:43.860
Daniel Guerrero: Interview. I made it to the second interview I got my orientation papers ready. I mean, I was I was set. I know we're gonna do. We're going to start me off for like 13 at an hour at Walmart.

258
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.940
Daniel Guerrero: And then I just get this email and the email telling me that I'm under qualified for the position.

259
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.310
Daniel Guerrero: So,

260
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't think that's true.

261
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I just don't

262
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.360
Daniel Guerrero: I just like so I call Walmart and they're just like

263
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.520
Daniel Guerrero: Well, he received an email, you need to follow up with it. Okay.

264
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we did say

265
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That

266
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so many things to talk about. Are you going to be able to manage that piece around

267
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The anger with with Lance, knowing that you have some choice you can stop doing all that extra work. You can also have a conversation with them if you want it to and say, I'm really struggling. I want to keep this job.

268
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we move that that extra dollar up so that I'm not struggling so much or however you want to have it.

269
00:28:48.360 --> 00:29:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We can spend time talking about that. Go look at your resume together. Remember I said we were going to kind of work really sort of distinctly and objectively task oriented. We can do that.

270
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but we can go in lots of different directions. If you're, if the message to me today is I'm about to punch the guy I got to hear that because I don't want you to lose choice and option and freedom.

271
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.040
Daniel Guerrero: How close are you. Oh, I'm not

272
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.150
Oh, no.

273
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.910
Daniel Guerrero: That wasn't even a thought, you know, my thought process was like I could we do something else with my time, you know,

274
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.280
Daniel Guerrero: On the cool like

275
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:42.510
Daniel Guerrero: From eight from from Ada from two o'clock to 30 to 10 it's only 70 bucks. I'm not losing anything on the cool you know 70 bucks 30 bucks I

276
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:50.070
Daniel Guerrero: Won't be honest and please forgive me, but like I wipe my ass for 70 bucks, literally, because that's what I buy toilet paper, a month.

277
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:50.820
I

278
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.920
Daniel Guerrero: Mean

279
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand what you're saying.

280
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.700
Daniel Guerrero: Okay and so

281
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:06.570
Daniel Guerrero: I'm thinking just like take a day off. And, you know, go look for a job, you know, I'm not going in. Today, I'm going to go look for something better.

282
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now

283
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There may already be some time in here.

284
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember this hour that we have carved out here you go in. Is there any way that you could do some job hunting either on Sunday or

285
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.980
During. That's right.

286
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you can you really push for that for yourself.

287
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.830
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I do. I do.

288
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.280
Daniel Guerrero: Every day, I'm on. I'm on the phone, putting in an application and I'm just waiting, you know,

289
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.470
Daniel Guerrero: But like everything is done online nowadays all applications and then

290
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:56.610
Daniel Guerrero: I call these places. They're like, Oh, well, we're having technical difficulties with receiving the applications or ours, our hardware is not needing a purse. There's always something. There's always something

291
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.160
Daniel Guerrero: And just

292
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, okay.

293
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:09.420
Daniel Guerrero: That's, that's why I'd say that's why I'm saying, like, Dale, my hands are tied. So now I have to go to this job where I'm unhappy and

294
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.470
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and bust my ass there for him. You know what I mean.

295
00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.070
Daniel Guerrero: I

296
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I do know. And let me just say it's an and it's it that I need to go to continue to have an income, it's not enough.

297
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: A nd

298
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm continuing to aggressively look for somewhere else.

299
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. The problem thinking is, I'm trapped. I'm stuck. I'll go nowhere and I'll always be like this. Those are the problem thoughts. Okay.

300
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.530
Right.

301
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.720
Daniel Guerrero: So be

302
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Really careful with yourself. This is temporary. I know.

303
00:31:53.400 --> 00:32:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That if you continue doing what you're doing two and a half years is going to pass it is going to pass those two and a half years are going to pass. And what do you want to be doing and who do you want to be and a half years, the guy.

304
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That ends up back in custody, not with their family. We know for sure that's not it.

305
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.860
Daniel Guerrero: That's not. Yeah.

306
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's real clear but

307
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everyone's really clear about that. They start to self sabotage and end up going

308
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

309
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, you're clear about that. Two and a half years. You can do this. You can tough it out two and a half years. But it's that it's going to stay like this and I'm trapped is the problem thinking

310
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've literally, you've got to push that negative thought aside and get right back into just like you said, I'm going to have to when I see a window to

311
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To grab some time some extra time to face to face, go to a gas station to, uh, you know, I don't know what your skill sets are, whether it's a car shop or whatever it is and interact with people because let me tell you something that's all fine and good. We're, we're looking at resumes online.

312
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're winning, you're gonna win. Enter personally, you're just you're gonna win. What's the right once people get past that link.

313
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as

314
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.610
Daniel Guerrero: You're talking

315
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be the one they want

316
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's what I was really hoping for, you know, when I was

317
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.660
Daniel Guerrero: Went to go play McDonald. I mean,

318
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:29.700
Daniel Guerrero: Mama, mama right and and the lady that I spoke to. I mean, she did. She looked right past it. She's like,

319
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:39.120
Daniel Guerrero: Because I had went to go get a haircut. Right. Well, they had messed up on my hair as, like, oh, I couldn't stand it. So I shaved my head right

320
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:51.090
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I don't know if you can see it on the screen but i'm i'm blasted you know all over my head. You know, so, and I was just like, Man, I hope she just, you know, see all this and you know what she didn't

321
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.070
Daniel Guerrero: And

322
00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:09.240
Daniel Guerrero: So to me, I thought her and I had a good connection as far as a boss employee hire you know let's get started, let's do this. Let's move you up and then it's like it didn't happen so

323
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:11.100
Daniel Guerrero: That was

324
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:21.450
Daniel Guerrero: That was a real bummer. You know, for not only for myself, but for my family because there was like, Oh, Dad, you're gonna be working at Walmart Dad That's cool. Oh, yeah. And then, boom.

325
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you don't. It is disappointing and you can't sit there for long. You've got to go to what wasn't the right timing and frankly, I might have just missed

326
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurricane a nightmare. I could have ended up having, you know, a drug dealing, boss. That was swinging in the back of the store, you don't know what you just missed. You're not God, neither am I.

327
00:34:48.330 --> 00:35:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That door was not meant for you. But what you did get was you know this to be true when you meet someone right you click keep in that mindset I gotta, I gotta get face to face with people. I've got to go in, where I want to work and say, Listen, I know I've got this thing.

328
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do that.

329
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For some organizations like let's say it's a restaurant or something like that, you'll say,

330
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me start as a buzzer. I'll work this hour. At this rate, just to show you what kind of employee. I've got to get these I've got a

331
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Tech shooting it straight about the two and a half years I all make a compensation backwards that sale take less for done it amount of time. But then I want this. I mean,

332
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're gonna win over people if you're face to face with them. I mean, I could definitely see working out. I mean, do you have anything you're you're in Clovis, it's a small place right

333
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.300
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, it's pretty small.

334
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um, where are you thinking of going

335
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.540
Walking in

336
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.330
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

337
00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:06.480
Daniel Guerrero: Because I'm already in I because I'm already in the field of management. I don't want to. I mean, I would, I, I've already told myself I wouldn't mind coming in, into a place and starting at the bottom and working my way back up.

338
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:15.420
Daniel Guerrero: Because I'm capable of it. And I know you know and I'm not trying to, like, you know, all or nothing but I'm that fucking good. You know,

339
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.120
Daniel Guerrero: I am and

340
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.270
Daniel Guerrero: So I know, I know what I can do.

341
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:31.950
Daniel Guerrero: You know, there's always been. And there's always opportunities and different places, you know, for that are paying their managers way better than what I'm getting paid.

342
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, oh my gosh, yes.

343
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:34.980
You know,

344
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.470
Daniel Guerrero: And and that's

345
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:45.420
Daniel Guerrero: That's kind of what I want to do. I want to go into somewhere where I can step in, not if not step into the management team maybe get put on some probation.

346
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.250
Daniel Guerrero: To be put on the management team, you know, maybe like a 90 day probation period or

347
00:36:50.970 --> 00:37:03.600
Daniel Guerrero: You know 30 day probation or, you know, okay, we're going to bring you in. Can you learn the paperwork and once you learn the paperwork. Can you manage, can you manage the crew and then we'll move forward. You know, so that's something I really want to do

348
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was talking to about the the licensed and bonded stuff from a parole or probation organization like What struck you about that, that that's like a no go for you because you kind of didn't entertain it much like what are your thoughts on that don't want to call them what

349
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.950
Daniel Guerrero: Oh no, I don't mind.

350
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:29.550
Daniel Guerrero: I wouldn't mind calling them in and asking for, you know, employment, help, I wouldn't mind at all because

351
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.810
Daniel Guerrero: WHY DON'T KNOW, I KIND OF

352
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:34.830
Daniel Guerrero: It's kind of, you know,

353
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed that the only reason why I say that because I have a lot of clients that are being supervised okay and

354
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: Right, and that

355
00:37:46.860 --> 00:38:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Number, you're bringing in is low. So you're on point with this isn't matching like I should be making more and I agree. I agree. But it's not like angry at boss like that was we started at eight like that was the agreement. So it's almost like this.

356
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.710
Daniel Guerrero: This places.

357
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: are tired of this place. Maybe it's somewhere else to go.

358
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:22.890
Daniel Guerrero: Right, because he asked me at the, at the very first interview, he was asking me, like, Well, you know what, what, how much money are you looking for and I said I want 10 bucks. Yeah. To start, yeah.

359
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.980
Daniel Guerrero: I know because I told him, I said, I'm that good you know that I want 10 books to start and then we can move up from there.

360
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:39.810
Daniel Guerrero: And where they call me back in like what was such an 850 and move you up from there. And so now that I made 10 books he's like well, isn't this what you originally wanted was 10

361
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:41.880
Daniel Guerrero: Right and so

362
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.490
Daniel Guerrero: So it's like down. Yeah, you're right. That's what I said.

363
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.750
Daniel Guerrero: But I said that to start

364
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You said it was a start. So let's just say this is

365
00:38:52.980 --> 00:39:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where you're going to, you're going to show up your kind of keep the toilet paper and the basic foods coming into the house out. That's all this is, this is just a temporary thing and you'll continue to look elsewhere.

366
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: My message is don't get yourself into that that negative thinking that this is your future. This is all that's available to you. This is temporary. If what you have to do with this is say this is just a test.

367
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just a test to see if I'm going to go back to that old life. This is is the universe just testing me. What will I do with this. These are your choices. Okay.

368
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not think about it like that, instead of it's hopeless right all always kind of have this limited resource and access to things to do. My concern is, I don't want for you to have the negative thinking that can lead to depression acting out in anger and substance use. That's my concern.

369
00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't want that bad. So I think, I think you've got some great ideas here, you really get that that meeting people face to face. Um, so what do you need for me. What do you want for me as far as what we can do to sort of continue moving forward. How can I be out here in Florida.

370
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.690
Daniel Guerrero: How can I help you out here in Florida.

371
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically I know all I know.

372
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.300
Daniel Guerrero: When

373
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My point i

374
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to make. I can show it. I can look at it and I can say, yeah, let's use a fancy word here or this phrase or this grammar or something. We can go real time stuff. Um, do you want to put it in front of me. You want to take a picture of it, send me a text. What do you want to do.

375
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.800
Yeah.

376
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.720
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I had filled out I had done, I had do the resume.

377
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.970
Daniel Guerrero: I remember, I don't know how to upload it from my phone onto the

378
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:09.660
Daniel Guerrero: Application right because because it says I have to have a certain type of app. I guess it's called like a BF a BS.

379
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:25.230
Daniel Guerrero: I can't remember the name of it. At this time, but so I tried to upload it from my phone to that because it says it's oh BCF compatible or something. But my phone won't upload it. So I'm wondering if I need to go down there to

380
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.360
Daniel Guerrero: Get on my Gmail, the library and upload it from the computer. You know what I mean.

381
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. You just found it. That's it. Okay, so when the library that's that's that's. That sounds like a great idea.

382
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:50.520
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, there's something about a playground most definitely do today what my wife goes to work at 1030 and my hands are pretty much free until two so

383
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So library. So getting over to the library doing that.

384
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know anyone

385
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Who could hook you up with

386
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a connection to working somewhere, even for, you know, a few months just to sort of get you through this period.

387
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:15.540
Of

388
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.070
Daniel Guerrero: Thing.

389
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.140
Daniel Guerrero: I honestly don't.

390
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.570
Daniel Guerrero: I KEEP I KEEP I KEEP MY circle pretty small and tight and so

391
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:31.350
Daniel Guerrero: Right now. Right now my, I bet a limited limited

392
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.370
Daniel Guerrero: You know resources for like money.

393
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.530
Daniel Guerrero: Because I

394
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I've already. I've already been that other way, you know, and

395
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:55.260
Daniel Guerrero: That's all I know. That's all I know is the streets. I know, right. So, but I'm doing 100% just stay away from the streets because I know industries, I end up in prison and most definitely is.

396
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a

397
00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there $1 tree or dollar store out there where you are.

398
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.790
Daniel Guerrero: There's both, but because I'm a felon.

399
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know but i i know employees that have worked for dollar tree.

400
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: With felony record. So that went out. Okay, I don't know the pay and they can be real jerks as bosses.

401
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm just, I'm looking at some of the people that

402
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, obviously the landscaping. There's no one, you know, that could, you could kind of join in and doing that kind of thing on the short term, no one to do some landscaping.

403
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.490
Was yeah

404
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:42.900
Daniel Guerrero: I have a friend that has his own business. Well, it's kind of like his own construction company. Yeah.

405
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:50.910
Daniel Guerrero: But he said he's not when I talked to him about a day for yesterday. He said he's not going to be hiring until you know mid April, you know, maybe may

406
00:43:51.900 --> 00:44:03.300
Daniel Guerrero: Summertime, you know, okay, well, that sort of thing. Picks back up, you know, construction, everything's just it's it's starting to pick up you know it started to be the days are starting to be more sunny down here in New Mexico.

407
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:12.600
Daniel Guerrero: And but also we still have those West Texas weather where it's raining wind is blowing snow in it and

408
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:15.570
Daniel Guerrero: It's always jacked up up here, you know,

409
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What about, um, do you have any of those sort of handyman skills. Is that something you could post maybe on marketplace.

410
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, man. You do certain trade skills.

411
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.640
Daniel Guerrero: Something like that, or you know there's something, there's something that I had done was

412
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:45.930
Daniel Guerrero: On the side is I've always done landscaping. You know, I've always had a good law more weed eater, you know, rake something so that's something that I've always done. So that's something that I most definitely want to start be doing

413
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.180
Daniel Guerrero: here pretty soon did

414
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:59.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know, from eight o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon. Now, if I can get three yards doing two yards done you know that's an extra maybe hundred bucks.

415
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.330
Daniel Guerrero: So that's something I'm definitely going to be trying to be doing.

416
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

417
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to look through some of the people here that what they're doing.

418
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You may only have a month.

419
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of

420
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right path together and then you may have an opportunity to a little bit of construction work. So it's not as catastrophic right as years of having to tolerate this

421
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say just focusing on

422
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.460
Daniel Guerrero: The next

423
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to the library. If the Gmail. Get that thing uploaded fill yourself interacting with people if there happens to be $1 tree on your way. And when you're going are you wearing

424
00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A color shirt and you know how to dress, right, all that business.

425
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:01.650
Daniel Guerrero: Yes. No.

426
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I figured I didn't mean to at

427
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All. No, no.

428
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't mean to.

429
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

430
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.240
Hmm.

431
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, me personally I'd be calling, I'd be calling a PO

432
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be calling because when I go online, because I look a lot and i i looked at. Here's a website that says, you know,

433
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.450
Organizations that exact

434
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Individuals felony records and when my client went to go check those out. If it didn't turn out to be as fruitful as she thought. So that was a little disappointing for her. So I'm reluctant to recommend that website again.

435
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But on your own. Have you looks like typed in organizations that employ

436
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.400
Daniel Guerrero: Yes, ma'am. I said, I have a felony. Where can I get a job, you know, kind of, you know, just at Google.

437
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.560
Daniel Guerrero: And a lot of these places came up like Burger King Dollar Tree.

438
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:12.000
Daniel Guerrero: You know, Sonic McDonald's those places did pop up, you know,

439
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.020
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I'm

440
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The CTO, that's what you keep in

441
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:18.630
Mind, it's

442
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not any harder than being in prison, it's not, you can do this. You can do it. It's just your pride. Just keep a close eye on on on on that pride. You can do it. You're not how much money you make, you're not the toys and the furniture.

443
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You were born exceptional and lovable and it has nothing to do with your possessions, you're going to have to just stay nice and close and tight to your faith.

444
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it right

445
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It was we start to feel overwhelmed.

446
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:53.160
Daniel Guerrero: And

447
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'll get your CDs well

448
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You already have a plan. And if you end up in you know you want to get GD you want to go back to school for something else you want to get your journey men's license or something, whatever you get to have those choices. You get to do

449
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You have

450
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.720
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, that's something that I, you know, when I first called for these places. It was about

451
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:27.540
Daniel Guerrero: Four months ago. So like four months has gone pretty quick. So that I'm something I'm holding on to so that away. Yeah.

452
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:38.370
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I try not to look at the time, you know, but you know I look back at four months of like down that four months went by pretty quick. You know,

453
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours, you can do. You can do it.

454
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:47.490
Daniel Guerrero: The next the next four months, you know, will be just as fast if not faster, like I just like where the days go and it's Thursday.

455
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:48.540
Daniel Guerrero: Oh my god.

456
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.430
Daniel Guerrero: It was like yesterday.
