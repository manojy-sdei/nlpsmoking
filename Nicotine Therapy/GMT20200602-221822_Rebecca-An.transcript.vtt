Yeah.

175
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:24.480
LG K40: And it's a good reason for me as a server because I think quite mental breakdown situation happened because

176
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:34.860
LG K40: I wasn't saying sober and using drugs or bad substances like a card.

177

184
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.090
LG K40: It's probably like 90 something degrees out soon.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.140
Yeah.

186
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.030
LG K40: I'm glad I paid my rent and stuff. I need you to hold

187
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:29.970
LG K40: Just certain people, I need to have my phone on stuff and then play my PS4. I gotta have gigs. I got 25 gigs now.

188
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.160
LG K40: With my service fun

189
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:38.280
LG K40: Huh. It's normally only 60 bucks for how my service plan is now but if my mom goes in.

190
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:45.540
LG K40: On a service plan with me. She cannot pay 45 and I can only pay for a favor. However,

191
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.600
LG K40: We can still make it that way.

192
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.570
LG K40: I lived in Jeddah to Metro PCS, sir.

193
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.230
LG K40: That's why service provider here.

194
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.100
So,

195
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.990
LG K40: Yeah, we have $45 apiece. If we go in on a shared plan.

196
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.210
LG K40: And then

197
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.160
LG K40: That would be cool.

198
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.120
Yeah.

199
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That'd be cool, but

200
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.320
LG K40: Either way, I saved us, I got us 10 extra gigs for life.

201
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.800
LG K40: With our service plans and it only have been done like I did it the second to last day of the month, last month.

202
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:32.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

203
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.920
LG K40: And they said about a did it trained to do it this month. I wouldn't have been able to see if there's 10 gigs for life.

204
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.060
LG K40: So I'm talking one gives we get another 10

205
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.680
LG K40: So I have. I've just 25 games on my phone now.

206
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.800
LG K40: I'm going to probably play my racing game needs a energies, a hotspot.

207
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.790
LG K40: So,

208
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.560
LG K40: It's a really cool racing game though. It's the new crispy. The 2015

209
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

210
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.080
And the

211
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:14.130
LG K40: Is a and I was like the best graphics and as like realistic like fire.

212
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.870
LG K40: Like comes out of the exhaust pipes. When the engines like going a certain way.

213
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:27.870
LG K40: Yeah, it's just real cool and it's HILLARY, HILLARY looks awesome on my new TV when each of us really really pull

214
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:40.560
LG K40: I think I left out like on that TV like they have like it doesn't even have really it doesn't have a scratch on it, you know.

215
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

216
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.230
LG K40: So it's really cool. And it was barely used hardly any a bit

217
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:53.970
LG K40: So I just got love to use headcount that when people wanting to do business with me right away and met with me.

218
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.610
LG K40: I know I'm actually glad that other person didn't come with their TV because

219
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:08.790
LG K40: I don't know where they were whatever shun like a bad deal. They had some other stuff resell it looks on their profile. They had like

220
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:17.700
LG K40: Like a gym equipment for sale. So I was like, Screw this like it's probably not. It wasn't a non new seller to

221
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.930
LG K40: The seller was like a not verified or whatever.

222
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, you gotta be careful. Good cats.

223
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.250
LG K40: Yeah. So yeah, it could have been a chance. Some trader up rip me off or something.

224
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.350
LG K40: Because if they're not verified people want me to verify. So I have a verified account on my let go and so

225
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.040
LG K40: I think you verify it by going up your account on their Facebook.

226
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

227
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.100
LG K40: That's how it works.

228
00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:05.550
LG K40: I go on there allowed. I gotta sound system that is really cool like lights up with like to blue lights and then like center lights up a bogus like stuff on it and so

229
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:20.640
LG K40: It's all blacks and stuff. I have the remote for to I asked him to give me the remote he did I, I really wanted it a lot. So after if there's any way to pay like 10 bucks for their gas and the light up 10 bucks and give them 64

230
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.450
LG K40: And it's like $100 system easily like least you know

231
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.260
Yeah.

232
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.240
LG K40: So,

233
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.700
LG K40: That's cool.

234
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's some good stuff happening. Huh.

235
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.630
LG K40: Yeah, I'm glad I got my internet back on the hot spots are with my new single plan.

LG K40: Service provider with my phone.

238
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:55.620
LG K40: Because I'm now I'm going to have a lot of internet to play my probably my racing game.

239
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.970
LG K40: He's waiting for, like, a body kits and I ALREADY I ALREADY

240
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.520
LG K40: Put a lot of aftermarket modifications on it like for performance.

241
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:18.570
LG K40: Yeah, so I got like the beginning like I'm starting to get likes it faster and stuff. I got the horse power up like 20 horsepower with the stuff I did, or whatever.

242
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.850
LG K40: Yeah, so click that. It's like certain parts and stuff for, um,

243
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.430
LG K40: Can you see you is like the computer of the card or like

244
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:40.080
LG K40: Like brain of it like makes everything works together a certain way to where you get like five extra horsepower seven or six extra horsepower, whatever.

245
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:51.450
LG K40: Yeah, maybe like 10 horsepower. I don't know. It just depends, you know, yeah, that when there's cars as an ECU there seems to be like put things on them and faster.

246
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.230
LG K40: And it makes everything work together, but different like better, you know, like all the same time.

247
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

248
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.270
LG K40: And then there's like camshaft so I'm looking into that, but that's like

249
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:11.970
LG K40: Probably something to do with like shit. Like, like with yours are shifting or the motor with the engine or whatever, like

250
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.800
Cylinders or something.

251
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:21.480
LG K40: I'm those things helped you. I brought my vehicle up like three or four horsepower.

252
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.630
LG K40: It's really realistic game, you know,

253
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

254
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.940
LG K40: And it's a UK like tune up like to do their the pressure in their tires and stuff, a certain way.

255
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.210
LG K40: Uh huh. So drone new and need say my favorite version of any racing game.

256
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

257
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.790
LG K40: I even got like the case where it's like a clear red one for the PS4.

258
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.890
LG K40: We knew that we

259
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.190
LG K40: Said, like a blue clear one

260
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice. Cool.

261
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.310
LG K40: Game yeah so surreal cool version of the game and stuff.

262
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:07.020
LG K40: Like the master version you mastered version where like take out any glitches and all that stuff and graphics, you're better and everything.

263
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.670
LG K40: But even the cover art like the like have better and stuff and

264
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:13.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool huh

265
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.020
LG K40: Yes, the coolest version.

266
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.240
LG K40: I knew because I knew about. I know about games and disks and stuff.

267
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.140
LG K40: Yeah, like I had to check him in for being good and not

268
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:38.160
LG K40: Like, I know the circle scratch like on the side of one disc that's orange kind of scratchy could get as a circle. One, it is like a circle going around the circle is different, but those are bad, too, I think.

269
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.200
LG K40: It's a circle on like side of a disk. It's a real bad being, you know,

270
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.070
LG K40: Well, I know, because it's like I know about digital stuff and you know

271
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

272
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:59.550
LG K40: I used to get a lot of DVDs and queries and games. And what else to people and stuff in there. Tell me about certain things and so

273
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.890
LG K40: That were important. I thought like

274
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.100
LG K40: It's a big deal. You know, like he told up a disc like the light and if you

275
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.340
LG K40: If you don't see any like missing parts or if you see it don't see any light through it pretty much

276
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:25.050
LG K40: Yeah, actually, as you can tell that this might play if it's on like real good laser like my PS4 something

277
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:36.570
LG K40: Uh huh. It's a if you have a strong enough laser and then you got to clean them under water and, like, make sure that water doesn't get in between the desk like where you hold it with your finger here.

278
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.410
Uh huh.

279
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:51.330
LG K40: And like swipe it off with like high pressure water in the tub with hot and cold water, you know, and try not to break it and stuff and Natalie. And so often like cold water and it'll be like clean and other sites you you know

280
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.690
LG K40: Yeah, often dirt out from in it and so

281
00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:01.620
LG K40: I'm I've been watching a lot of DVDs. I got like five there P scratch to just work just trying, you know,

282
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:08.730
LG K40: As I was when you see it like through like how it is in the dark and stuff in the PS4 Reverend gene.

283
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.760
LG K40: It'll just be that. And if this is like clean. You know, does have a circle stretch anywhere on it.

284
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:25.980
LG K40: It'll probably read it you know like if it's clean and not missing the top and certain stuff about it, you know, if it's not broken or whatever.

285
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:26.880
Yeah.

286
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.400
LG K40: So that's cool.

287
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool. So tell me, how is been your self care. How are you sleeping and eating.

288
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.500
LG K40: I've been sleeping a lot. Um,

289
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.860
LG K40: I've been sleeping.

290
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:51.030
LG K40: I said probably that five times in a row for like one day. Like, I think, does it

291
00:25:51.870 --> 00:26:00.930
LG K40: Mm hmm. I've been seeking more in towards the beginning of the morning like this morning I woke up early compared to how late. I've been waking up lately about

292
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:09.750
LG K40: Normally I'd wake up about like one or 12 or two or three or 4am you know

293
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.030

LG K40: I got like $365 you need me to one time on my throat to

306
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:19.200
LG K40: Choke and went and got like stuff here and there. And then I went by, like 200 bucks VTS works pretty much

307
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.620
LG K40: And it was all really cool stuff.

308
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.420
LG K40: Like I still have a lot of like I love gummy bears.

309
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:36.540
LG K40: Like some stuff and he go shopping. Again, but I usually just eat out. Now I don't qualify for

310
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.200
LG K40: More than 25 bucks a month, usually

311
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:52.620
LG K40: Its current, current various he gave me like gave me $163 and then $126 or $8

312
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.830
LG K40: And then it will be back down to 25 so

313
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:09.390
LG K40: I don't know. I had a friend, he got me some food, a lot of food is like four different kinds of Joey's and user spectacular groceries.

314
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:17.790
LG K40: So you got him some of your issues because he asked you wouldn't have been nice. Not so you know just reading the paper for that.

315
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.510
LG K40: Um,

316
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.400
LG K40: Yeah I friended that a few times, actually.

317
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:33.030
LG K40: Um, so I got it. Like, but I had to set a limit. You know I has a like

318
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:42.150
LG K40: Like 50 bucks or whatever. And then they can each get two special items, a piece after that. So he's you're like 25 or whatever.

319
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.080
Yeah.

320
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.710
LG K40: Yeah, so I had to do that. And then like I think

321
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.630
LG K40: I'm I knew that was. It was like one time.

322
00:28:53.550 --> 00:29:01.170
LG K40: And I told him because they asked again, or my friend asked again. I said, oh, they cut me off in notice 25 bucks a month so

323
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.790
LG K40: Yeah, maybe helped him with a 70 bucks or whatever.

324
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.400
LG K40: You've actually done everyone

325
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.890
LG K40: Does it, you know, can

326
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.580
LG K40: But I feel good because that person is paid off, he's paid off with me and

LG K40: I'm

330
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.000

331
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.650
LG K40: Yeah, you have like 1400 probably tomorrow.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.090
LG K40: And I can get a vehicle. I'm going to start looking for one anyway.

333
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.220
LG K40: I get off for 1400 for like 400 or something.

334
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:51.570
LG K40: Like

338
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.140
LG K40: And nope, no one says anything like maybe I don't want to really drive her out on the street.

339
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.170
LG K40: I gotta make sure it's a good one to

340
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.080
LG K40: Like 1400 BUCKS, IS A LOT FOR SOMETHING TO JUST risk.

341
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:26.850
LG K40: Are you pretty good at it. But even foreigners could get beat up and stuff like Missy and engine rod or something.

342
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

343

345
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:54.180
LG K40: Guys like go under the engine or take the engine out to the whole thing. So that's way too much work for me for like 1500 dollar vehicle or the thousand dollar vehicle or whatever.

346
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:54.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

347
00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:08.610
LG K40: So I'm gonna go for more if I hadn't my first one. I could go for like 2700. They got it from 1500 and all I had to do is add some steering power steering fluid totally fixed the steering situation.

348
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.840
LG K40: And I thought it was going to be. We will do and stuff, but it wasn't

349
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

350
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.040
LG K40: Yeah, that seems like 1500 bucks.

LG K40: That was my first official vehicle I'm

352

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.240
LG K40: I don't know. I'm just. Other than that, just, I don't want to talk negative really

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.810
LG K40: I think, but I don't want to bring it up. It's just their problem. You know, I don't want to bring up stress chemicals.

362
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.310

LG K40: Utility that'll bring up stress, causing chemicals that can make like diseases and stuff.

364
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.070
LG K40: That stress even causes that stuff. So I get mad at my little brother and have to tell them, you know, or whatever.

365
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.320

LG K40: And then they'll uh they're pretty bad news, you know, the trading give you bad plays and stuff, just like real jokes.

371
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:21.330
LG K40: Mm hmm on time. I thought this one, it knows it's cheaper than I thought was just this person, that person has asked at weddings. Oh, hey, I just lost my job.

372
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:31.350

374
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.270
LG K40: And I noticed like
