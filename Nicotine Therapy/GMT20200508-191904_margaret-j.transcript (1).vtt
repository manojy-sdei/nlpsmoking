125
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:12.570

126
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.590
Donna Jochimsen: amphetamines and Valeo, which is kind of a weird thing to do, but

127
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:29.670
Donna Jochimsen: My brother, my brother, how to methamphetamine diction, and my sister was about 400 pounds which I consider to be also an addiction.

128
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.450
Donna Jochimsen: Food, though. Yeah, there was some

129
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.750
Donna Jochimsen: Some addiction and my family.

130
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.530
Yeah.

131
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.800
margaret johnstone: Well, that just makes it a little harder, harder for you to work on all of this.

132
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.800
margaret johnstone: But you certainly can do it and you're doing a good job you're doing a really good job.

133
00:09:49.830 --> 00:10:04.860
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I was. I was doing really well. I mean, I really well. I have a really good attitude, you know, a positive attitude. I was really happy with how I was doing and then just got hit with this manic episode.

134
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.390
margaret johnstone: So I'd like to go over your medications that you're taking right now.

135
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.720
margaret johnstone: And let's talk about and see what you what you think would tell me what you think would be helpful.

136
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.750
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I'm

137
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.280
Donna Jochimsen: I think, more or less, and probably would be a good place to start.

138
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.910
Donna Jochimsen: I think it was on the low level.

139
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.170
Donna Jochimsen: They told me to tell you if you can't find it in my charts, but it's

140
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.670
Donna Jochimsen: Under the thyroid

141
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.280
margaret johnstone: Oh, I couldn't find it.

142
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.170
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

143
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.100
Donna Jochimsen: They hit it.

144
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.290
margaret johnstone: So,

145
00:10:51.180 --> 00:11:04.110
Donna Jochimsen: So the lithium. We probably we probably need a little bit more and then the Suboxone I'm taking I've started taking us they're giving me a low dose of Seroquel to help me sleep.

146
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.240
Donna Jochimsen: That's good, but it's not not doing. It's definitely not doing the job.

147
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.740
Donna Jochimsen: And Colombia to Clonidine for anxiety.

148
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.680
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm.

149
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.900
margaret johnstone: How's that working

150
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.600
Donna Jochimsen: And under normal circumstances that works pretty well.

151
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.600
margaret johnstone: Yeah, so right now.

152
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.930
margaret johnstone: So have you taken Seroquel

153
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.410
margaret johnstone: Bad would

154
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.730
Donna Jochimsen: That would be all

155
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, I have taken circle before

156
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.490
margaret johnstone: Okay, okay.

157
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.820
margaret johnstone: Well, there's a couple options.

158
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.990
margaret johnstone: And when was your last lithium level done. You remember

159
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.210
Donna Jochimsen: February.

160
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.110
Okay.

161
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.250
margaret johnstone: We certainly can go up on the lithium.

162
00:11:52.710 --> 00:12:00.060
margaret johnstone: So that would be one thing we can do. And the other thing we could think about doing is going up a little bit on the Seroquel

163
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.670
margaret johnstone: How much are you making it bedtime right now.

164
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.830
Donna Jochimsen: Here.

165
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.600
Donna Jochimsen: I'm supposed to take one half to one tablet and

166
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.600
Donna Jochimsen: And it hundred milligrams

167
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.420
Donna Jochimsen: I've been taking the one milligram, but

168
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.340
Donna Jochimsen: Obviously not sleeping.

169
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.440
margaret johnstone: hundred milligrams

170
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:35.550
margaret johnstone: Yes. Yeah, I mean, we definitely can go up on that 250 so up to one and a half.

171
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.830
margaret johnstone: And then increase the lithium and get another lithium level in a couple weeks. How's that

172
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.590
Donna Jochimsen: That's, that's fine.

173
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.520
Okay.

174
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:56.400
margaret johnstone: So if you lithium responder. That's actually really good because not everybody responds to it. And it's a really good drug

175
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:16.680
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, yeah, I know that they tried to put they put me on Depakote. At first, and that just asked her for me. I did not do well with Depakote at all, but they switched to lithium and and and i do respond to that it has it has most definitely helped even me out.

176
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:30.720
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm. Yeah. That's a, that's a real miracle drug for a lot of people. And they said, a lot of people can't take it and I went to a really good lecture on it by a guy from Stanford.

177
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:49.380
margaret johnstone: Who said that the studies, they've done on lithium and the brain are lithium is kind of protective of your brain. It doesn't harm your brain in any way and they think it may protect your brain cells. And as we age, protecting our brain cells is a bigger and bigger.

178
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.330
margaret johnstone: Yeah, let me tell you.

179
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:52.920

195
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.360
margaret johnstone: Right.

196
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.740

Donna Jochimsen: March. Yeah, yeah.

204
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.140
margaret johnstone: Congratulations. That is the hardest addiction to stop that.

205
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.530
margaret johnstone: Yeah, no, it is people really really struggle with that. And so

206
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:25.140
Donna Jochimsen: I have I have tried to quit. So many times over the years. And I don't know, I just, I quit. I quit. Like last summer for a few months.

207
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:39.630
Donna Jochimsen: And I ended up at once again being around people that were smoking and I ended up starting again. But so I know that I can. I already knew that I could quit. I'd done at once. I could do that again. So I just did.

208
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.840
Donna Jochimsen: Well, that's just a couple of slip ups but not

209
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.770
Donna Jochimsen: But not bad.

210
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.180
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

211
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.270
margaret johnstone: That's fabulous that you're able to do that.

212
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.140
margaret johnstone: I'm trying to find your lithium information. Hang on here.

213
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.850
margaret johnstone: You get that

214
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.490
Donna Jochimsen: The Syrah

215
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.290
margaret johnstone: Yeah.

216
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.300
margaret johnstone: Well he's somewhere in the

217
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.860
Donna Jochimsen: Thyroid section.

218
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.370
Donna Jochimsen: Okay.

219
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.430
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not sure, I think, is it why oh eight is. Does that sound right.

220
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.850
margaret johnstone: Yeah, that's where they like it. That's the considered the

221
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.640
Donna Jochimsen: The standards. That's what it is right now.

222
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:24.390
margaret johnstone: See, that's a perfect level. So if we take you up another your 300 twice a day, which is a low dose 600

223
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:35.430
margaret johnstone: If we take you up to maybe another hundred and 50 on the lithium. It'll push your level up a little bit, but

224
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:42.570
margaret johnstone: Okay. Right. Right. Now, it might be worth a try, just to get you more stable. What do you think

225
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:50.190
Donna Jochimsen: I think that I think that's a good idea. And I'll get it checked in a couple of weeks to make sure that it's not too high.

226
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:50.820
margaret johnstone: I'll put

227
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.280
Donna Jochimsen: I'm so used to doing that I've been

228
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.460
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, getting those lovely I'm levels for many years now.

229
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.760
margaret johnstone: It doesn't. It affects your thyroid and your kidneys.

230
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.550
margaret johnstone: And so those things we watch

231
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:09.030
margaret johnstone: And as we get older our kidney function goes down just naturally. So, um, and women at more

232
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.750
Donna Jochimsen: I realized I was a little late. I was a little late, checking in at at 12 because I had to pee before, right.

233
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.620
Yeah.

234
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.880
margaret johnstone: Isn't that the truth. Isn't that the truth.

235
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:32.280
margaret johnstone: Yeah, me so. So right now I think the plan would be to go up slightly on the lithium and increase the Seroquel just slightly to one and a half.

236
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.290
margaret johnstone: Okay. Hundred and 50

237
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.890
margaret johnstone: Eric. Well, and we'll add in an additional

238
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.210
margaret johnstone: Either hundred or 150 if it comes in hundreds, I may just give you an extra hundred to put in there.

239
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.190
Donna Jochimsen: And do you take your board that lithium.

240
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.440
margaret johnstone: Yeah dude, does it, I think.

241
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.820
margaret johnstone: I think it comes in. Hundred and 15 so we'll have to see.

242
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.950
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not sure. Yeah.

243
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:13.230
margaret johnstone: So, oh, I'll put in another prescription for you for that, um, anything else you're doing to help get yourself any place you can go outside, you have a yard that you can be in

244
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:21.540
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I think I can go outside and and the area. I live in. It's a small area. I can go to the beach and walk

245
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.410
margaret johnstone: Oh, good.

246
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:32.970
Donna Jochimsen: I can do, I can do those things. I, I have not been doing much of it because honestly I don't trust myself driving when I'm you know manic and such. I, I just tried to stay home.

247
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.500
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm. So how long do these manic episodes last

248
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.320
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I want to say maybe one to two weeks, usually

249
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.420
margaret johnstone: Session.

250
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.100
Donna Jochimsen: Sure, happy.

251
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.650
Donna Jochimsen: Oh,

252
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.100
Donna Jochimsen: My cat is 17 years old and he just

253
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.060
Donna Jochimsen: Fell down

254
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.050
Donna Jochimsen: The side of the bed in the wall and was stuck. You can get out

255
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.150
Donna Jochimsen: My goodness.

256
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.710
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

257
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.440
margaret johnstone: Well, you're a busy lady. But, you know, right now.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.690
Donna Jochimsen: I just I just take a daily supplement and

260
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.180
margaret johnstone: Like a women's one one a day. Multiply thing.

261
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.190
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, but when the women's one. Yeah.

262
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.500
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm. Good. Because right now, they think that that's going to be very helpful.

263
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.220
margaret johnstone: Because we want to not get the virus.

264
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:50.340
Donna Jochimsen: Oh my that scares me. I hear about that on TV, the nurses talking about how, how about that. There's and makes me not want to leave the house at all.

270
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.070
Donna Jochimsen: You know, but it's, that's a scary thing.

271
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:14.250
margaret johnstone: Okay, well, it is hard. It is hard thing to adjust to we have to change everything we do. Have you been going to the supermarket for yourself and things like that.

335
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:47.910

336
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.190

339
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:10.800

340
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.600
Donna Jochimsen: Right. It made it a little easier because he suffered a lot

343
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:32.010
Donna Jochimsen: I definitely did that I definitely did that which you know which, in a way, it was a shame because he was still there, you know,

344
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:41.550
Donna Jochimsen: Right, I feel like we like that. Maybe I lost some quality time that I could have had because I was already in the grieving process, but it is

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.050
margaret johnstone: Okay.

370
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.700

371
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:08.160

373
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:17.850

375
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:31.230
Donna Jochimsen: Our would be the depressive part of it, but we'll see. Maybe we can maybe we can stop that with some sleep and some more lithium.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:41.610
margaret johnstone: Exactly. Your brain heals while you're sleeping so forget it, you sleeping eight to nine hours sometimes even 10 it actually helps a lot.
