00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.059

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.809
No.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.070
Dominique Pozo: No.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.040
Dominique Pozo: I just got your text. Yeah.

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.080
Martin Price: Okay, good, good. I wasn't sure I thought maybe because there was a memorial day that

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
Martin Price: You know, we weren't gonna meet, but I just wasn't sure.

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.030
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, I'm one moment, I'm just going to clear one thing on my phone here.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.750
Okay.

9
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.570
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

10
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.170
Dominique Pozo: How are you doing,

11
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.900
Martin Price: Not too bad. My niece. My 38 year old niece.

12
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560
Martin Price: came and visited this weekend, and she was trying to, like, you know,

13
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.200
Martin Price: cheer me up and she's like a realtor in Colorado Springs and

14
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.540
Martin Price: He really helped me a lot like she listed the House on Zillow

15
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.700
Martin Price: As a rental and you know data video of it where she described the rooms and the outside so maybe we'll get a couple guys are interested in it for two or three months.

16
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.180
Martin Price: Great. He was, I don't know. I guess he kind of felt like she needed needed to come down here and bolster up my

17
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.960
Martin Price: When I say ego by just, you know, try and

18
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.180
Martin Price: Get me to feel a little bit better about things.

19
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.040
Martin Price: Because I get, you know, I just get kind of despondent and

20
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.710
Martin Price: You know, but then I pull out a bit. I don't know what to say.

21
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.070
Martin Price: But anyway, she was

22
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
Martin Price: You know, it was kind of refreshing and we went for a really nice. Hi, can

23
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.330
Martin Price: You know, it was weird kind of being with somebody for like 48 hours, you know, because

24
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.360
Martin Price: It used to being alone, you know, and then you have a visitor. And it's kind of like the whole you realize how certain ways, you get, you know, when you're living alone.

25
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.880
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, totally.

26
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.230
Yeah.

27
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.490
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm so I'm wondering just

28
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:17.010
Dominique Pozo: I don't know, one of the first thing that came up in my mind was, I'm just wondering how your conversations with April have been, have they kind of opened up to some more. Maybe revealing and intimacy or how, how is that going

29
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.810
Martin Price: She started sending me a lot more pictures and

30
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.460
Martin Price: You know, a lot of the conversation is about her dealing with her son and

31
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.750
Martin Price: her son's girlfriends and like

32
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.500
Martin Price: She won't let the girlfriend come over and stay

33
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.170
Martin Price: It's not

34
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:55.500
Martin Price: Yeah, we've definitely had more intimate or intimate times and Holly. My niece is like you know she's not the one for you. She's back. You don't want her and you know she was really down on April and

35
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.800
Martin Price: I was trying to say I like I've gotten

36
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:09.060
Martin Price: myself into trouble when I always try and like focus just on like a good looking girl versus, you know, getting to know someone and

37
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.110
Martin Price: You know, being with them for them, you know, just the way they look, it's hard to get over the

38
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:34.830
Martin Price: Physical whatever it is attraction. But you know, I like April and she's you know what I really kind of like is she's just kind of been there for me for through through thick and thin, you know,

39
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.700
And

40
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.540
Martin Price: So on.

41
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.680
Martin Price: You know, Holly was just kind of being a

42
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.610
Martin Price: She was, I don't know what to say.

43
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.470
Martin Price: That

44
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.880
Martin Price: Like the way she felt about me was that I was

45
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.460
Martin Price: Very empathic that I, you know, tend to take on

46
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.730
Martin Price: Other people's emotions, you know,

47
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.610
Martin Price: Like if they're down or if they're

48
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.620
Martin Price: By tend to

49
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.810
Martin Price: You know, like, like, make them mine or something like

50
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.440
Dominique Pozo: What's up,

51
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.610
Martin Price: Kind of make them mine. I don't know how to describe it. But where you're

52
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.400
Dominique Pozo: Where you're taking on someone else's stuff.

53
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.100
Martin Price: Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know if that's like

54
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.440
Martin Price: The classic codependent or whatever but

55
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.990
Martin Price: My daughter with the one with schizophrenia. I really had that

56
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:47.640
Martin Price: Or has that badly you know she thinks she knows what other people are thinking about her and, you know, and then she's got all you know they have a she has a lot of different voices.

57
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.840
Martin Price: They're very critical, and they

58
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.940
Martin Price: Tend to

59
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.180
Martin Price: You know I

60
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.550
Martin Price: Guess she kind of like

61
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.080
Martin Price: Looks at the way someone's responding to her and

62
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.340
Martin Price: thinks she can read their minds, almost. And it's always in a negative way, I guess.

63
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.580
Dominique Pozo: Um, I don't know if I would label it as that's codependent I think it's also temperament and, you know, if you're a very sensitive

64
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:31.290
Dominique Pozo: If you have a sensitivity and you're a deep feeler which it seems like you are then I think it's the work is to recognize okay that's there's this is mine.

65
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:45.480
Dominique Pozo: You know how much it's been able to kind of tease it apart and and allow someone to have their experience and not it doesn't. I don't think it serves anyone if both people are feeling down and out about it. Yeah.

66
00:06:45.540 --> 00:07:00.840
Martin Price: Yeah, I always hate being, you know, I remember with my wife. I just always hated being like, if we got in a fight and was unresolved. I was just so troubled by it. You know, I could hardly sleep and

67
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:14.520
Martin Price: I always wanted things to be on an even keel. And so, like, that's why I always I was always like the first one to apologize and I was always apologizing, because you know I just couldn't scan.

68
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.960
Martin Price: Describe it. The, you know, the bad feelings or whatever out there.

69
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.620
Dominique Pozo: Right. Okay. Well, this is a great thing to touch on, because part of

70
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:50.610
Dominique Pozo: What people who tend to become you know their dependence on a substance, it's often because the window of tolerance for discomfort is is is not that large yet. So, you know, someone will have uncomfortable feelings and then go to take the pill or shut up or whatever.

71
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.540
Martin Price: whatever they're doing

72
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.250
Dominique Pozo: Or drink, you know, drink.

73
00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:00.990
Dominique Pozo: Or have sex or, you know, this compulsive behavior, whatever the addiction is or work. I mean, work is another one.

74
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.840
Martin Price: right for me or running

75
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.460
Martin Price: You know, exercising.

76
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:14.100
Dominique Pozo: So it comes in so many forms, and I think some good work that we can keep doing is tolerating discomfort, learning how to tolerate it.

77
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:27.000
Dominique Pozo: And be okay with it. It's not fun. It doesn't feel good yet. I think the more that you experienced that. OK, I can feel uncomfortable and I know how to take care of myself and I'm going to get through this. The less that you'll

78
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:41.280
Dominique Pozo: In the future, reach towards anything, whether it's a woman or work or a drink or a pill, all of it you know that's that's a big part of the, you know, recovery process, I think, is learning how to tolerate

79
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.100
Martin Price: It was low tolerance for emotional pain kind of her emotional outbursts.

80
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:55.860
Dominique Pozo: Totally. So if you want to write down in quotes growing the window of tolerance, that's, that's something I want to keep focusing on

81
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.830
Dominique Pozo: And what that takes is turning towards the uncomfortable feelings not away from them.

82
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.190
Dominique Pozo: Sitting with them breathing through them writing about them making art through them making music, whatever. However, you can stick with it.

83
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.240
Right.

84
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.280
Martin Price: Yeah, it's always been like an issue with me and I think it was just

85
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:35.280
Martin Price: There was so much like kind of conflict and turbulence in my house when I grew up, that

86
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.850
Martin Price: Maybe I was always trying to find a way to settle it down or something or get to stop or whatever.

87
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I, I imagine to that maybe some of that.

88
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:59.910
Dominique Pozo: Maybe anxiety that comes up a few start to feel uncomfortable. It's so related to, you know, that younger part that was like couldn't control the situation and it didn't.

89
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.440
Dominique Pozo: Feel good you know

90
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.090
Martin Price: So,

91
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.340
Martin Price: I mean, I can't really like

92
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.110
Martin Price: Sink back and relate to it that well, but it makes sense.

93
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:20.790
Dominique Pozo: And you know, we don't even need to trace it and come up with memories and all this. I think the the practices. Okay, next time this is, this will be your homework, next time you feel uncomfortable feelings.

94
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:35.190
Dominique Pozo: To just sit with it track your body notice. Okay, where am I feeling this and really locate okay like maybe like for me if I have uncomfortable feeling sometimes my chest gets kind of tight.

95
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.350
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes I get tension in my throat. So really tracking okay where does this live

96
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:54.270
Dominique Pozo: And then going going into it a little more, and at the same time without having to come up with a story of what happened in the past. Just think of your little boy. The little boy you

97
00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:06.000
Dominique Pozo: And just in your mind's eye just give him a hug or or stroke him and just say, You know, I'm here, I'm here to take care of you. We're going to be okay. We're going to get through this.

98
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.530
Martin Price: Yeah, I, I had like today.

99
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:20.940
Martin Price: It was really weird. I've been kind of tired because I've been exercising all app, but it's like it's much more easy for me to kind of step back

100
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.780
Martin Price: And and

101
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.530
Martin Price: See my thoughts you know and like

102
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:40.140
Martin Price: Either about Michelle or or whatever, you know, and it's funny to kind of watch that tape go round and round and round and to be able to detach from it a little bit.

103
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.510
Martin Price: No, that was a good feeling rather than getting so stuck in it.

104
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.910
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's it sounds like you were being the witness, which is the big

105
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.660
Dominique Pozo: Part of this

106
00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:00.240
Dominique Pozo: Right, just watching what's going on and you know not. Yeah, as you say, getting get stuck in it.

107
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.930
Martin Price: I'm just writing some of this down.

108
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.340
Dominique Pozo: Sure, sure, sure.

109
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.750
Martin Price: Yeah, so I don't know if the right term.

110
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.800
Martin Price: For I was empathic but it just kind of

111
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.430
Martin Price: It sort of made sense to me to somebody who empathizes too much or something, you know,

112
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:40.080
Dominique Pozo: I don't know if you have any interest. So when I was living in New Mexico. I had. And when I was in school for, you know, studying my program. I had a great teacher and mentor who

113
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:56.280
Dominique Pozo: Would look at astrology charts to look at the character structure people and we were we were looking at clients and people that you know I was seeing when I was in my practice them through the lens of astrology and it's it's really fascinating because we do have different these different

114
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:14.130
Dominique Pozo: Personality signatures. And I wonder if you have any interest in and absolutely no pressure, but some things that helps to see okay there's some strong energy with, you know, these certain their archetypes is what they are. The, the planets are archetypes. Have you ever gotten into any astrology.

115
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.730
Martin Price: You mean like Leo or Pisces or

116
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.720
Martin Price: Yeah, so

117
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:24.540
Dominique Pozo: So the signs which are the constellations, there they are there. They're like,

118
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:40.380
Dominique Pozo: They're like an energetic field that is an archetype. And then at the time of our birth certain planets, the sun, the moon, they were passing through certain constellations, when we were born and then that kind of creates an energetic that it's

119
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.980
Dominique Pozo: Just

120
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:49.350
Dominique Pozo: It was very interesting to look at and i i mean i'm so blown away about how sometimes accurate and helpful. It is to

121
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:58.950
Dominique Pozo: Look at someone's and all it is, it's, it's our tendencies. It's okay. What do we tend towards where the weaknesses in our chart and where the strength and how do we support ourselves.

122
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.320
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean, I'd be willing to take a look at it that way.

123
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:15.720
Dominique Pozo: Sure. So anytime we can do it today or next time, whatever you wish. If you just at some point when you want it. Give me your birth information, but the place the time

124
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:22.470
Dominique Pozo: The date. And that's, that's all I need. So the location where you're born, the time and the date.

125
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.660
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know the time. I mean, I obviously know the date the place but

126
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:36.450
Dominique Pozo: The time really helps because the this you know as the sun's rising that that's part of it, the ascendant in

127
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.040
Dominique Pozo: The chart and it's it's really

128
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:42.900
Martin Price: Good to do

129
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.890
Dominique Pozo: You do.

130
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.760
Martin Price: For 15 PM.

131
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.440
Dominique Pozo: Do you have any interest. So we look at your chart, would you want to do that. Sure.

132
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.970
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna pull it up.

133
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.800
Dominique Pozo: I need to plug in. Let me um let me get this up.

134
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.460
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

135
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.270
Dominique Pozo: Okay, what is the date.

136
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.530
Martin Price: August 3 1959

137
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.980
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and then the time

138
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.680
Martin Price: It says 4:15pm

139
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.610
Okay.

140
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.720
Dominique Pozo: And then, where were you born

141
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.600
Martin Price: It was Colorado Springs, Colorado.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.380
Dominique Pozo: So have you ever. Have you ever had anybody look at your chart. Do you know like when I pull this up. Is it going to be like a different language.

143
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.180
Martin Price: Oh, my daughter talks about it. Oh, she always looked at looks at

144
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.960
Martin Price: I don't know those astrological

145
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:07.170
Martin Price: Reports that you know sense like a, here's what a Leo was going to encounter today and we're feel today.

146
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.280
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

147
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.600
Martin Price: She's really into it.

148
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.700
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so let's um

149
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.770
Dominique Pozo: So I'm gonna pull it up now and

150
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.860
Dominique Pozo: Oh wow wow you got a lot in Leo.

151
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.620
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's i'm going to share the screen with you.

152
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.270
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

153
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.140
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Can you see that

154
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.150
Martin Price: Yeah.

155
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.400
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

156
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.930
Martin Price: Did you just make that

157
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:56.250
Dominique Pozo: I didn't make it. No, I have a program where I plug I plug all the information and then it, it gives me because I do this to this is with certain clients if they're interested. We'll look at their chart to look at character structure and

158
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.060
Dominique Pozo: If someone's into it. I'm it's sometimes it's helpful so

159
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.660
Dominique Pozo: So let's see here. You've got

160
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.670
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, this is your son. This is the the constellation that the sun was in when you were born, which is Leo.

161
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.690
Dominique Pozo: And then looks like your moon, you've got so much and Leo well

162
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:23.910
Dominique Pozo: Your, your moon the moon's right on the cusp. It's in Leo as well. Mercury so

163
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.920
Martin Price: Let's do that. Mega something

164
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.120
Dominique Pozo: Or so this is

165
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:40.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this is Leo right here, this one. So the archetype of Leo is it's very warm hearted. It's very generous. It's a fire sign. So there's, there's, there's a generative energy about it and

166
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:54.930
Dominique Pozo: I'm just looking here what so where if you if you imagine that there's a place in you that wants support, what would that be so we can look at your chart and try to find an area that would support that.

167
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.680
Martin Price: Word again.

168
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.240
Martin Price: What is

169
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:10.920
Dominique Pozo: What is there is what aspect of your life do you want, would you want a little more insight on how to support yourself because

170
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:19.590
Dominique Pozo: What we're looking at here is kind of your native tendencies, your ways of operating. So if there's, you know, if you have a

171
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:28.800
Dominique Pozo: Inquiry around. Okay, I really want to be able to support myself more in this area, then I'm going to look at your chart and say, okay, well here's

172
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:39.300
Dominique Pozo: Here's a place that if you haven't already really developed it are focused on it. There's a very natural tendency here. So let's see what it's like. If you start to really focus on that.

173
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.690
Martin Price: Yeah, I guess it would be like

174
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.190
Martin Price: Asking for and accepting help kinda

175
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:58.770
Dominique Pozo: Ok ok so that that would be your house of communication, which is typically the third house that's ruled by Gemini and you don't have

176
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.920
Dominique Pozo: You don't have anything. And so here's Gemini right here. This is the symbol, the glyphs for Gemini and

177
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.160
Dominique Pozo: In the sixth house and when something's in the sixth house.

178
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:21.750
Dominique Pozo: That's about it's the, it's very particular that is this House talks, it speaks to

179
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:32.010
Dominique Pozo: When someone really puts their mind to developing a skill and is very precise. So something that I'm already getting is that with

180
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:42.180
Dominique Pozo: If you're going to communicate, you need to be very precise about you know what what you're needing and ask for it with a lot of clarity. So being very clear.

181
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:56.550
Dominique Pozo: You have a capacity to do this naturally. If you've got a flex the muscle really taking the time to think about, Okay, what is it that I want to need. And then once you start practicing this. There's a there could be a lot of ease and doing

182
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:14.070
Dominique Pozo: And and speaking from your heart, you know, your mercury is is also is the glue the the archetype of communication and this is also in Leo and leal so warm and is so connected to the heart. So really,

183
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.430
Dominique Pozo: I think that this could be helpful to summon the courage to speak from your heart, your truth and you won't go wrong.

184
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.450
Dominique Pozo: How does that sound when I

185
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.320
Martin Price: Was like

186
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.260
Martin Price: my older daughter called me today and

187
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:37.140
Martin Price: You know she was talking about ways to like help hold on to the house here, you know, and

188
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.780
Martin Price: You know her and her boyfriend. Like if she could work remotely she could come, they could come down here and live or something like that, you know, which is

189
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.140
Martin Price: I'm looking for ways to try and help pay the mortgage

190
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.950
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

191
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.040
Martin Price: And it's so that was kind of neat, you know, is like

192
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:09.810
Martin Price: I don't know, I just feel like for 60 years or not 60 years but for 34 years of marriage or whatever. I just felt like I

193
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.710
Martin Price: I did my best to like take care of everybody financially, you know,

194
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:24.360
Martin Price: And and then I've kind of had this kind of reversal of fortunes in the last couple years and

195
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:33.120
Martin Price: So yeah, I need to be able to, like, number one, ask for help. And then if someone

196
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.030
Martin Price: Is offering help you know

197
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.880
Martin Price: Open up to it.

198
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.810
Dominique Pozo: And it would be really helpful if you're very specific with like getting very clear about the

199
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:52.380
Dominique Pozo: specificities of the kind of help you need what that looks like for you. That's what this is telling me here is that

200
00:22:52.770 --> 00:23:05.340
Dominique Pozo: You know, it being very precise with it and and this is interesting. Your cairon which is this is like the wound. All of us have a limp in our chart and your limp is in the second house which is all about.

201
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:16.560
Dominique Pozo: Like money home. It's the, the, like the the mundane and this is where the limp is and it's in Aquarius, which to me.

202
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:33.300
Dominique Pozo: That's an air sign. It's about thinking out of the box. And I think what comes to my mind around this. What you spoke about a number of times around your finances is, you know, thinking it through and thinking it through in your own way, not, not the way that the the

203
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:43.650
Dominique Pozo: You know the status quo. It's like, you, you, you have the capacity to do this in a different way, but is maybe innovative or

204
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.330
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, is out of the box.

205
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:52.620
Dominique Pozo: And I think that that might support the wounds that you've experienced so far. If you're able to get out of the box of

206
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:59.430
Dominique Pozo: Of the way that it's supposed to be and do it. Martin's way, you may, you may, it may

207
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.960
Dominique Pozo: Support this place that is kind of a weakness in the chart.

208
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.280
Martin Price: So the wound is like

209
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.800
Martin Price: My lamb and

210
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.260
Martin Price: And it's around

211
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.340
Martin Price: I mean, it was something I was born with.

212
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:27.060
Dominique Pozo: So the second house is all about. Yeah, its security its finances its home it's it's the material realm. It's like

213
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:35.670
Dominique Pozo: The foundations and yeah and we all have them. We all have our everyone has a cairon in their chart and it hits different parts of the

214
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:49.230
Dominique Pozo: The chart. And again, please take this all with a grain of salt. You know, this is it's not the way it is. It's just one lens of potentially looking at things with some more insight.

215
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.760
Dominique Pozo: And if it resonates. Great. And if it doesn't, toss it you know

216
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.470
Martin Price: So you're kind of saying, Get out of the normal way of thinking about finances.

217
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:10.620
Dominique Pozo: Well, how does that sound to you when I say when I say that it may be helpful to think out of the box a little bit with you know

218
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:18.810
Dominique Pozo: The way that you're managing your money or or have been managing your money. How does that sound to you.

219
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.620
Martin Price: Um, well, kind of to me like a

220
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:27.510
Martin Price: I

221
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:38.550
Martin Price: Didn't have very good discipline in 2019 and that's why

222
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.090
Martin Price: You know I'm struggling now.

223
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.600
Martin Price: So it's kind of like I felt like I sort of threw caution to the wind and it it really

224
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.590
Martin Price: Kind of boomerang done. It was, you know, really took its toll.

225
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.300
Dominique Pozo: So just throwing caution to the wind equate to out of the box for you.

226
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.940
Martin Price: Probably, yeah.

227
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.680
Martin Price: When it comes to finances.

228
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:17.100
Martin Price: You know, it was like Michelle had this super sad story and I was just all about

229
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.610
Martin Price: Helping her out financially.

230
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.920
Martin Price: You know, to make her family's life better, you know, and it

231
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:40.530
Martin Price: You know, part of it was me, seeking her love. I get that. But there was also a big part of me that genuinely wanted to help her, you know, and her family.

232
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:59.100
Martin Price: You know, but now like as more of the truth comes out. It's like, I just realized, a lot of it was just fabrications on her part, so I really don't know how much of it was true or not, but that's where I felt I felt like I was coming from a reasonably good place.

233
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:13.140
Dominique Pozo: Something that comes up for me, which I'm curious about is, you know, are you holding the story and a belief that which is very, it's more of a traditional belief that the man has got to support the woman or

234
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.850
Dominique Pozo: Got a kind of be this.

235
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.870
Dominique Pozo: Like Prince that shows up and takes care of her, and

236
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.160
Martin Price: Yeah, the Savior.

237
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.510
Dominique Pozo: So that

238
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:37.050
Martin Price: I realized that's what it was all about. And I just felt, you know, always. I was always like when we talked. I was always trying to like crazy, sir, for being a single mom and working so hard and you know

239
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.820
Martin Price: Like almost like comparing her to, you know,

240
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.410
Martin Price: You know the Virgin Mary, or something, you know, because she's like

241
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:52.740
Martin Price: From a Catholic family and I was always really building her up, you know, and

242
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:06.300
Martin Price: I think there is a part of her that really like that, you know, like my friend George just thinks it was just this huge scam. But I think there was there was a bit of

243
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.980
Martin Price: You know, I was

244
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.580
Martin Price: Like feeding or ego or something like that.

245
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:23.610
Dominique Pozo: Totally. That's what came to my mind, it seems much more complex to me that you know her ego is getting stroke than your you know how playing your part.

246
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.470
Martin Price: Yeah, and I

247
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:33.270
Dominique Pozo: Guess I guess the question which I'm going to invite you to think about this week two is you know what beliefs. Do you have around

248
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:44.790
Dominique Pozo: Money and what's right do with it, or what's the right thing and then if you if you really check in with you know what's, what's your way. What is your

249
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.530
Dominique Pozo: What feels most natural for you in the way that you manage your money. So I guess what

250
00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:08.580
Dominique Pozo: When I look at your chart and I see the wound there in that house and that sign what it makes me think of is getting more familiar with what is my way, regardless of what anyone else says what anyone else may expect you know what feels best to you.

251
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.010
Martin Price: And when you say to wound. What do you mean like it's something that I fear.

252
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:28.800
Dominique Pozo: It's kind of the place where we're most vulnerable. That's what it is like you know when a wound is like open and raw it's vulnerable that there's a myth. This cairon was, I believe, was one of

253
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.450
Dominique Pozo: The Centaurs in in the Greek mythology.

254
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.410
And

255
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:44.340
Dominique Pozo: He's the Centaur that I believe shot Achilles heel and so it has to do with this notion that we have this week.

256
00:29:46.020 --> 00:30:00.030
Dominique Pozo: It's, it's about our wound and it's also our strength. It's like from the wounds. We get taken down and we we get a lot of insight. If we really, if we're with them and stick with the places of pain and

257
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.780
Dominique Pozo: Difficult difficulty we we learn more

258
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.990
Dominique Pozo: We learn we can learn more. It's kind of like, you know, this journey that you're on with

259
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:19.320
Dominique Pozo: The Suboxone and and really getting off it. I imagine you're going to come through this with a lot more self awareness and this was a big hit in your life story.

260
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.720
Martin Price: What the thing with Michelle or

261
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:35.400
Dominique Pozo: No, no, taking, you know, getting been having an addiction to the pills and then getting on the Suboxone and get going through this recovery program and coming out, you know, that's

262
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:44.610
Dominique Pozo: That's kind of like a wound or a hit in your life story and I imagine you're going to come out of this program and through this with a lot more self awareness so

263
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:53.370
Dominique Pozo: These wounds in our chart. They're not only wounds, but they're there, they, they can be our strength if we learn how to turn them around.

264
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.660
Dominique Pozo: Does that make sense.

265
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:06.540
Martin Price: Yeah, I guess I kind of got my wound or my vulnerability was the whole being loved thing. You know, like

266
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:06.960
Wow.

267
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.730
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's huge. I mean, so, so the Kira on here. I'm going to share this. Again, it's not the only wound in the chart.

268
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:25.080
Dominique Pozo: Leo's Leo's love to be loved. They want to be stroked, they want to be told. They're the best. Yeah. And look at all. You have and Leah.

269
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:39.750
Dominique Pozo: You've got your ruin your Sun, Mercury this here. This is you're honest, it looks like you're Pluto's in Virgo here, but you've got four really huge thing. So there's definitely a natural

270
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.920
Dominique Pozo: inclination to want to be appreciated adored stroked, all these things.

271
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

272
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.130
Dominique Pozo: We love that they love to be told how wonderful they are

273
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.890
Martin Price: Yeah, I guess we all do, but

274
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.940
Dominique Pozo: Sure.

275
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.640
Martin Price: When somebody tells me that I don't

276
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.220
Martin Price: I'm not able to internalize it. You know, I'm not able to accept that.

277
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.280
Martin Price: But, you know, anyway, it was really nice to

278
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.920
Martin Price: Hear my older daughter actually talking about

279
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.870
Martin Price: You know, ways to keep the house and ways to

280
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:38.790
Martin Price: Help me out and stuff like that. I just can't because I'm man, I just feel kind of like drained, you know, was

281
00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.070
Martin Price: Like taking care of three kids and

282
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.190
Martin Price: You know, getting them all through college and everything like that. And sometimes it just feels like

283
00:32:52.320 --> 00:33:02.940
Martin Price: There's never any reciprocity, you know, they never turn and look at you and say, oh boy, because I think they've always seen me is like,

284
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.480
Martin Price: Very strong and independent and

285
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.900
Martin Price: And, you know, in a way, it's good because it actually kind of brings your family together.

286
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.750
Martin Price: You know, it's like the American dream or whatever is to be you get retired and your self sufficient everything like that and

287
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:37.710
Martin Price: And lots of times the kids, they're going to go do the same thing, right, and they're, they're going to be working while you're retired and they don't have time to see it. And, you know, kind of the way my family was is we all scattered to the four winds

288
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.300
Martin Price: Right and

289
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:50.910
Martin Price: There was never this idea that we were going to take care of one another, you know, and it was funny because my ex wife, my second wife.

290
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:59.250
Martin Price: Her family was so kind of traumatized and destroyed by their dad. He like lost the house and

291
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.190
Martin Price: You know, ran off and you know they had to get Section eight housing and everything that it

292
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.680
Martin Price: pulled them together so they're a very tight.

293
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.640
Knit family.

294
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:19.080
Martin Price: And my family is just the opposite. You know, I think because my dad was all about being independent and financially.

295
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.520
Martin Price: You know together and

296
00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.760
Martin Price: So this is going to be a kind of a new realm. For me, it's like either trying to accept.

297
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.180
Martin Price: Either one of my daughters help or

298
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.200
Martin Price: Or having a roommate or something like that or

299
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:43.380
Dominique Pozo: So when you say that your daughter and her husband are thinking of coming to live with. They help pay the rent.

300
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:51.450
Martin Price: For this, it's a boyfriend. I mean, they're talking about. We could build a casita or something like that, you know, or

301
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.280
Martin Price: You know, they want to build a

302
00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.930
Martin Price: What are they, tiny house or whatever.

303
00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:58.800
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Yeah.

304
00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.700
Martin Price: kind of idea.

305
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.890
Martin Price: Uh huh. What I'm

306
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.910
Martin Price: Gonna do is they'd probably stick me in it and they take

307
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:08.910
Dominique Pozo: Well,

308
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.940
Dominique Pozo: I like I like just hearing what

309
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:20.550
Dominique Pozo: It seems to me that it's a good feeling, you know, when you think about your daughter and her boyfriend maybe coming. It seems like that's positive. Yeah.

310
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.280
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

311
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.270
Martin Price: I don't know how well we've lived together, but it's just like

312
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.030
Martin Price: You know, the plan is like

313
00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.580
Martin Price: I was going to be

314
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.150
Martin Price: financially well off, you know,

315
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:46.140
Martin Price: And it doesn't. And I guess what I'm saying is I'm opening up my mind to this idea that

316
00:35:47.490 --> 00:36:05.190
Martin Price: You know, opening up to, to help from your daughters or siblings or whatever is is sort of a way to help bring a family back together rather than this kind of siloed deal where everybody like my brother, you know, his whole goal is just to be financially.

317
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:25.740
Martin Price: Together and he just never he's pretty shut behind you know he doesn't want him to talk to my sister and he's just like very antisocial and just wants his little empire, you know, on doesn't want to deal with anybody else except for me. He's always like felt bad about

318
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.070
Martin Price: taking it out on me when I was young, because my dad would take it out on him, you know,

319
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.950
Dominique Pozo: Just pass it down to you.

320
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.400
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. So he's always been trying to make it up to me.

321
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:53.610
Martin Price: Because he did a lot of crappy things, you know. And so finally, the opportunity came where I said, well, if you'll pay for. If you can start paying for Wiley's treatment center. Cause that would be a huge help you know

322
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.270
Martin Price: And so he's been doing that and that's been pretty cool.

323
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.530
Martin Price: But that whole financial

324
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.910
Martin Price: Privacy or whatever that my dad drove into our heads, you know,

325
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.000
Martin Price: Yeah. In the end it.

326
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:21.750
Martin Price: You just create like these little everybody's got their little empire, and there's no driver to bringing us together, you know,

327
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.780
Dominique Pozo: There's no connection. Yeah, I mean, the sense I get is that there's a lot of kind of individualism, which is a

328
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:35.460
Dominique Pozo: Cultural thing. It is the American Way to just do you do well get the kids out if they are able to do it on their own. They're great and

329
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.460
Dominique Pozo: It does create a lot of separateness

330
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.110
Martin Price: Yeah, and

331
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.160
Martin Price: You know, I've taken care of my youngest

332
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.820
Daughter

333
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.330
Martin Price: You know she's almost 30 now and

334
00:37:49.500 --> 00:38:01.980
Martin Price: It's just been very expensive, you know, got all the treatment centers and it just went on and on. And, you know, and I helped my older daughter get through.

335
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:10.170
Martin Price: Graduate School and even hams daughter. You know, I spent a lot of money on her to, you know, and

336
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.550
Martin Price: She wasn't even my kid.

337
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:20.400
Martin Price: And so like you can't get to age 60 and like you're scrambling and trying to put it all back together and

338
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:29.610
Martin Price: You know, I think maybe it'll be good for me to like Accept helpers, ask for help and accepted.

339
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:37.800
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean, if anything, would I. The be an insight from what you're saying and then it seems validated in the chart is that that wounded there.

340
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:50.160
Dominique Pozo: Is, you know, is rethinking your beliefs around the way that you need to be with your money. Just, just think about it, you know, it's something to consider. And think about what, what, you know, what did your dad.

341
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.240
Martin Price: Have been so generous with it or no already learned that lesson.

342
00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:02.100
Dominique Pozo: No, I mean what I'm hearing from your story is, it seems to me there's this belief that you need to be the provider.

343
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:03.030
Martin Price: Yeah.

344
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:07.050
Dominique Pozo: You know, you need to provide for everyone, your kids, your girlfriend's their kids, everyone.

345
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:07.800
Martin Price: Yeah, right.

346
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:20.250
Dominique Pozo: I'm not saying that that's a bad thing. I'm just saying to think about it. And, you know, maybe there's there's another way that maybe feels more supportive to you, you can still be generous, but maybe there's more balanced more reciprocity in some way.

347
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.540
Martin Price: Or yeah yeah

348
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.110
Dominique Pozo: You know,

349
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.800
Martin Price: I just

350
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.790
Martin Price: I don't know man, like, especially after my second marriage is just like I was

351
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.460
Martin Price: As soon as I

352
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.020
Martin Price: wasn't working, you know, the whole dynamic change, you know,

353
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.790
Martin Price: I was no longer the provider, you know,

354
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.440
Martin Price: She really wasn't into me.

355
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.800
Martin Price: Not working. And she was working, I guess.

356
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:58.470
Dominique Pozo: So what could you do different with both your daughter potentially coming to live with you with her boyfriend and

357
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.410
Dominique Pozo: April. What could be

358
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.920
Dominique Pozo: Just like a

359
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:15.960
Dominique Pozo: slight adjustment in your way. Your the way you have been with money and and women and their children. What could be different.

360
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.380
Dominique Pozo: So that you don't repeat a pattern that something, you know, clearly it's something you're not satisfied with I heard it.

361
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.380
Martin Price: I mean, I was satisfied with it when things were going well, but

362
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:35.340
Martin Price: Now, and money's an issue. It just can't, it's not realistic.

363
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.110
Dominique Pozo: Were you satisfied with it with Michelle bow. I'm, I'm wondering

364
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.960
Martin Price: I was for quite a while until I

365
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.830
Martin Price: Just started realizing that it just become all about that, you know,

366
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:53.760
Dominique Pozo: All of the money.

367
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.210
Martin Price: I mean, in the beginning, it was really fun and

368
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:03.540
Martin Price: But then this whole business loan thing happened about halfway through our time together and

369
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.320
Martin Price: It really soured the whole relationship. I think she felt like it was, it wasn't supposed to be alone, you know,

370
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:11.250
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

371
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.550
Martin Price: And I was making it very clear that it needed to be alone and yeah

372
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.090
Martin Price: So anyway.

373
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:34.170
Martin Price: Yeah, I'd have to like think about it. I, I just, like, right now I just feel like I have to focus on myself and take care of myself and I can't, I'm not in a position to help anybody right now.

374
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:40.770
Dominique Pozo: Well, that sounds very reasonable and it sounds like it's really supporting

375
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.000
Dominique Pozo: A new way of being a thinking of yourself and it's

376
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:53.970
Dominique Pozo: What I hear is that you've thought about everyone else for so long and so this is this is a new new to actually

377
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:58.680
Martin Price: If you like it'd be interesting to hear how they all about it, you know.

378
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:00.960
Dominique Pozo: Like who and

379
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.440
Martin Price: Thought about my daughters are my ex wife, you know, it's like

380
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.620
Martin Price: If they felt like I was provider for them or if they

381
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:21.330
Martin Price: Thought that I, that was what they deserved, you know, or if they felt I was being generous or or why you know

382
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:27.210
Martin Price: Or if I just like had such a pattern of doing it. It just seemed like why not go along with it.

383
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:34.620
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. I mean, are you in good enough terms with these folks to ask them and

384
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.630
Martin Price: Not Pam, not my second wife, obviously not. Michelle, but you know

385
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:47.160
Martin Price: Honestly, just hearing my daughter talk today, my older daughter talk about helping me

386
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.320
Martin Price: A house, really. I was like, wow, and this is like

387
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.410
Martin Price: Sure, nice to hear you.

388
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.650
Dominique Pozo: That's great. Well, I'm noticing.

389
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:12.690
Dominique Pozo: The good feelings that are coming from seen and I and I wonder how how much more satisfying. It could be in the future if you do approach these relationships and and

390
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.260
Dominique Pozo: You know request more reciprocity name.

391
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.390
Martin Price: Yeah, I'm not trying to be the Savior again.

392
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:24.690
Dominique Pozo: I wonder, I think it would be a curious thing to try something different out and see how that feels.

393
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.300
Martin Price: Right, yeah, I remember in the beginning with Pam. It was very

394
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.220
Martin Price: You know I

395
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:49.020
Martin Price: You know, from we lived together for a year and it was always like once a month we come together and I had to pay per 60% and she based she had to pay for 40% based on the kids and it went really well. It was fine.

396
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.400
Martin Price: I don't know when it changed it seemed like

397
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:58.830
Martin Price: I don't know, you know,

398
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.650
Martin Price: It was just a point in time around.

399
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.570
Martin Price: 2006 or something. When we got back together after a breakup that

400
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:16.740
Martin Price: I had to really start helping her out financially because their businesses failing and I just kind of accepted it, you know.

401
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.210
Martin Price: So anyway, I'm

402
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.200
Martin Price: You know, I'm trying to not just dwell in the past and

403
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.690
Martin Price: Trying to look at every day is a little victory, you know, because I'm working and

404
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.840
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely. And I think

405
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:48.480
Dominique Pozo: I don't see that you're dwelling on the past. I see that you're looking to the past to get some insight and do things different. And I want to go over a bit because we started late. I just need to call in the next number for my next client who that

406
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:49.770
Dominique Pozo: Seven.

407
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.580
Dominique Pozo: See I'm

408
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.860
Dominique Pozo: See

409
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.370
Martin Price: I'm going to go the bathroom.

410
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.900
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Sounds good.

411
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

412
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.890
Dominique Pozo: So I have another like five minutes, um,

413
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:35.070
Dominique Pozo: So let's, let's do a bit of a recap takeaway. What, what, what are you walking away with from this session.

414
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.600
Martin Price: You know, try and like sit with uncomfortable feelings and

415
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:51.720
Martin Price: Try and run away from them.

416
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.960
Martin Price: Lots of times for me like

417
00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:10.500
Martin Price: Kind of mid to late morning I don't have the copy catches up with me or or what but I get very anxious, you know, and you know my go to is exercise so

418
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.190
Martin Price: That sort of

419
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:20.400
Martin Price: I don't know what to say just makes me feel so good for the rest of the day, then it's like

420
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.550
Martin Price: You know, part of me recognizes like, can't you just deal with your anxiety and, you know,

421
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:39.150
Martin Price: Figure out what's causing it and learn to live with that. But the other part of me is like, well, exercise is good. It's good to get out.

422
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:41.730
Dominique Pozo: I don't know.

423
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:47.790
Dominique Pozo: I think it's good. I think maybe you can check in, like, oh, am I doing this compulsively or

424
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.420
Martin Price: Yeah.

425
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.810
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I think it's important to get the circulation. That's great.

426
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.290
Martin Price: I've been doing it a lot lately. Um,

427
00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:59.490
Martin Price: I think that just that whole letter from the lawyer.

428
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:05.970
Martin Price: And everything kind of brought the whole yourself going back to the forefront and then

429
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.880
Martin Price: Now it's kind of wearing off with that.

430
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.690
Martin Price: I don't know. It just kind of rekindled

431
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.990
Martin Price: And more emotions or something, stuff like that. There's

432
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:16.680
More

433
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:18.570
And then

434
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:26.520
Martin Price: You know, like taking a look at my beliefs around money and you know

435
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.750
Martin Price: One lesson is like not to lead with your wallet.

436
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.420
Dominique Pozo: Good one. Yeah.

437
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:34.920
Dominique Pozo: Good one.

438
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:44.070
Martin Price: I kind of had this philosophy that I just felt like God had been very good to me. You know, and I've been. It was like

439
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.290
Martin Price: You know, a lot of material abundance in my life and

440
00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.150
Martin Price: You know, this is trying to share, to a certain extent.

441
00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.200
Martin Price: While not

442
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.050
Martin Price: You know, ruining my own financial security but

443
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.530
Martin Price: Then I just went overboard with it.

444
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.440
Martin Price: After the divorce.

445
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.710
Martin Price: I think that Holly was saying like, you know, and holidays. My niece. And she said, well,

446
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:29.760
Martin Price: You're like, it just gotten divorced from somebody who really loved and you know it's like you're on this kind of rebound thing and you found somebody who had, you know,

447
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:38.670
Martin Price: A good relationship with and everything and then it started to just, you know, became all about money and

448
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.930
Martin Price: You know, so it's just a lesson, you know,

449
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:52.080
Martin Price: So I'm you know kind of turning move past that and

450
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:56.370
Martin Price: Be open minded with April and everything.

451
00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.130
Martin Price: Seems to have her own thing going.

452
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:07.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, sounds like it. So if you're not leading with your wallet. What would be the most ideal place to lead from where you

453
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.200
Martin Price: Just kind of like a

454
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:29.790
Martin Price: Good having given up on life you know for, like, at my age, I still want to be adventurous and do things. And, you know, be kind of open hearted and open minded still

455
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:42.180
Dominique Pozo: So, so if you could plug something in to this phrase I no longer lead from my wallet. I lead from blank. What would that be

456
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.410
Martin Price: My personality or my outlook.

457
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:47.820
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

458
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.990
Martin Price: Which is the way it's supposed to be any rain.

459
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.740
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, let's let's keep

460
00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:10.980
Dominique Pozo: Checking into that. That seems like a good anchor to keep checking in, like, okay, when you made that movement or that decision or that proposal or invitation. What, where are you leading from, you know, where you leading from your personality and your outlet

461
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.510
Martin Price: Like insecurity. You mean

462
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:30.480
Dominique Pozo: You know I'm I'm using your phrase of, you know, leading from your personality and your Outlook. That's what you said you would replace leading from the wallet.

463
00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.700
Dominique Pozo: You no longer that

464
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:34.140
Martin Price: You're leading your person.

465
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:46.080
Dominique Pozo: So this seems like a good anchor to keep coming back to and asking yourself when you make when you are making decisions and movements in your life, checking in. Oh, was I reading from the place I really want to be leading from

466
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.440
Dominique Pozo: And if not, what was I doing

467
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:50.760
Okay.

468
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.820
Dominique Pozo: So it's kind of keeping yourself accountable for, you know,

469
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:16.830
Dominique Pozo: I mean, that's another Leo tendency. I know that is that generosity, you know, it's, there's, there's this big, big heart that I I have, you know,

470
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:32.460
Dominique Pozo: Read and learned and witness that that is a tendency in Leo's way to to be generous and very giving them. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just really looking at, okay, what's the motivation here. And does that feel

471
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:42.780
Martin Price: Right, yeah. It's kind of like service not sacrifice or right. Yeah, something like that. You don't have to sacrifice yourself.

472
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.390
Dominique Pozo: And worthiness to, you know,

473
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.320
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, really believing that your personality and your

474
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.540
Dominique Pozo: Your values are enough

475
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:56.400
Martin Price: Yeah, okay.

476
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.010
Dominique Pozo: My turn. I gotta get ready for my next sentence.

477
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.890
Dominique Pozo: They're coming in a few minutes. So let's look at our calendar really quickly just to be on the same page so

478
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.560
Dominique Pozo: Let's see. I don't have you infer anything when would you like to come next.

479
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.810
