00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.730
Dr Jameson: Yes, I can. How are you

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.210
David Dusseau: Breathing.

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.140
Okay.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.150
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I just want to talk to, because your screen came back a little.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.860
Dr Jameson: Unexpected

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.270
Dr Jameson: So,

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.100
David Dusseau: I saved it.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.640
David Dusseau: And Chase. I'll even pay for

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.100
David Dusseau: That math.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.260
David Dusseau: Uh huh. Yes, it said, I mean, T. H. I have ever ever touched us ever

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.300
Dr Jameson: Okay, man.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, are you, are there people using it in the house.

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:09.300
David Dusseau: No, no known here. It's weird because I've never even touched the stuff back in the 80s and 90s. I was buying crank offer truckers

16
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
David Dusseau: That I knew that ran east coast, west coast.

17
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.630
David Dusseau: And I got to know this one guy named rusty and I would buy the powder trying. I guess that's

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.020
David Dusseau: Crystal Meth, but it's not made like it is today and to, I guess, a crystal on

19
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.040
Dr Jameson: I guess.

20
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.900
David Dusseau: I'm surprised. I've never used it.

21
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
Dr Jameson: Yet, well I guess if it was around. Back in your day. You probably would have

22
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.590
David Dusseau: Why would you be on there.

23
00:01:44.610 --> 00:02:00.870
Dr Jameson: Well, I don't know. I'm I had one lady that walked into a house one day and realized, people were smoking and like left after five or 10 minutes cuz she just didn't want to be in there and she tested positive for it.

24
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.690
Dr Jameson: So that's why I was

25
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.610
Dr Jameson: Really else was smoking it

26
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.650
Dr Jameson: I mean,

27
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.690
Dr Jameson: You're not on any

28
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.140
Dr Jameson: Stimulants or anything. Right.

29
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.850
Dr Jameson: You know,

30
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.420
David Dusseau: The people that live here that could be. I know the one guy doesn't rather

31
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.740
David Dusseau: As tried it, as I know

32
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.550
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

33
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.760
Dr Jameson: I'm looking at it. I mean, it's sometimes you feel trying to decide if you think you're hallucinating. Or if you see a very, very faint line.

34
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.830
Dr Jameson: But I guess, I guess the

35
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.050
David Dusseau: Room with them.

36
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.340
David Dusseau: But

37
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.070
David Dusseau: Okay Close borders around here.

38
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.300
Dr Jameson: And you don't take any like Adderall or anything like that. Right.

39
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.670
David Dusseau: I've took one

40
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.590
Dr Jameson: Recently,

41
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.200
David Dusseau: Should that be it.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's what it is. Sam frenemy

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.630
David Dusseau: Know I got hurt.

51
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.000
Dr Jameson: When

52
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.760
David Dusseau: It is one to one and doorbell rings. The dog is crazy and once

53
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.770
David Dusseau: You know, just

54
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.980
David Dusseau: Just saw you don't bite the big rock while

55
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.130
Dr Jameson: Sorry, I didn't hear. When did you take the Adderall.

56
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.760
David Dusseau: It was last week. Okay.

57
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.560
Dr Jameson: Yeah, maybe 10 days ago.

58
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.120
David Dusseau: But, you know, dog.

59
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.290
Dr Jameson: I don't think that's a good idea for your heart.

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.250
David Dusseau: Oh, that's for sure. But immediately after taking I took a couple extra

61
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.320
David Dusseau: Dime

62
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.110
David Dusseau: There I know out of

63
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.110
Dr Jameson: Well, I told you last time I want you to get that refilled from your heart doctor going forward.

64
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:28.440
Dr Jameson: Clonidine doesn't really block and it doesn't really block at all. So I, it makes me very nervous for your ticker.

65
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.060
David Dusseau: I know I was always told don't ever take it. I never liked it much.

66
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:49.320
David Dusseau: But I had to get to two flat tires fiction. My pickup and get it out of the backyard, and I did and cleaned him back without as so much stuff and all Robbins clothes that were in bags overland

67
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.050
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think you could have done that without all

68
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.890
David Dusseau: Somebody offered it to me like a cool

69
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.540
David Dusseau: Man.

70
00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.850
Dr Jameson: Well,

71
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.800
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Well, lucky for you. We don't like kick people out for taking something they're not supposed to take, but

72
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.240
David Dusseau: I don't

73
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.560
Dr Jameson: I don't want to see.

74
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.090
David Dusseau: The word

75
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.650
Dr Jameson: No, I don't want to

76
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.360
David Dusseau: Be worried about it.

77
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.140
Dr Jameson: All right.

78
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.970
David Dusseau: You won't see it ever again.

79
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:28.200
Dr Jameson: I'm worried about your heart as much as anything and I don't like the idea of you just taking things that you don't know what's in them. And if it's safe. Once I like you know

80
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.710
David Dusseau: I could count on my fingers on my time, but thank you. But before when I took it.

81
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.740
David Dusseau: Made me real nervous.

82
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.640
Dr Jameson: And

83
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.370
David Dusseau: My blood pressure went up real high

84
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.360
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm.

85
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.380
David Dusseau: But I was

86
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:54.840
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but I probably it's still raises your blood pressure, maybe not as high, but you're already on a very high level so quantity quantity and you shouldn't be taking any extra that stuff.

87
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.090
Dr Jameson: You're already

88
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.330
David Dusseau: Covered all was supposed to take place and

89
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:09.960
David Dusseau: Yeah, that's why they got me off and get them from you because I couldn't get off home well

90
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.990
Dr Jameson: I was trying to be helpful but but sometimes being helpful, you end up

91
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:27.990
Dr Jameson: You know prolonging the situation. So like I said last time, you need to get you any more refills from your heart. Doctor, I want them knowing exactly how much you're on and how much you're taking because I don't think they are going to like it.

92
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.750
Dr Jameson: But I don't want to be. I'm not the one that's given it to you and something goes wrong with your heart.

93
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.060
Dr Jameson: All right.

94
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:47.670
David Dusseau: Amen. I would never ask for even though I got my blood pressure under control, but that day that I took it, it actually put me to sleep.

95
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.390
David Dusseau: After we got done working and I had

96
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.930
David Dusseau: I was so mad because when the doorbell rang. I went out.

97
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.020
David Dusseau: You know, as you know how slowly, a guy with the mad hip goes down stairway.

98
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:16.560
David Dusseau: And a dog. You know, he heard that buzzer. He common right let's turn the corner of the stairs, just to set system stairs one, you know, I mean, like an L shape.

99
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.370
David Dusseau: And he's been 120 pounds. He hit me. And I went

100
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560

Dr Jameson: Okay, well,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.840
Dr Jameson: You got

159
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.340
David Dusseau: It, buddy.

160
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.510
You need

161
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.150
Dr Jameson: Your leg, your lungs need to heal. Like, it takes time where there's no more.

162
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.950
Dr Jameson: Smoke in there for them to actually heal so you really gotta knock that out.

163
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.800
Dr Jameson: Maybe, maybe.

164
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.330
David Dusseau: Try meditating.

165
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.890
David Dusseau: This thing a lot

166
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.780
Dr Jameson: Of you. Okay, good.

167
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.950
David Dusseau: Use it.

168
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.190
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And then maybe the yoga will help a little bit

169
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.330
Yeah.

170
00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.220
David Dusseau: And

171
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.510
David Dusseau: I don't know. I was smoking two packs a day.

172
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:12.630
Dr Jameson: Oh, I know you're doing so great. But, you know, one or two isn't even like doing anything for you, other than making your lungs unhappy again.

173
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.370
David Dusseau: I know guys

174
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.750
David Dusseau: Are tapping my

175
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.740
Naked

176
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.930
David Dusseau: Three. A day

177
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:26.100
David Dusseau: For the last five years that change is little reward one morning

178
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.710
David Dusseau: Yeah, one afternoon.

179
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.630
David Dusseau: Listen, one before it goes to sleep.

180
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:43.020
Dr Jameson: after your surgery is done. If you want it and you're all healed up and you want to do that, then I guess that'll be up to you but I'm telling you, I think it's a bad it's, it's an unnecessary unnecessary risk.

181
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:55.950
Dr Jameson: That you're any you won't heal as well, like your blood cells need to recalibrate without the carbon, the carbon dioxide that carbon monoxide. Actually, that's in cigarettes that gets in your blood. So

182
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.940
Dr Jameson: I really

183
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.170
Dr Jameson: If you need nicotine use a nicotine gum and nicotine spray

184
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.360
Dr Jameson: How are you doing,

185
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.190
Dr Jameson: To

186
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.810
David Dusseau: Fix what legacy under flavor June.

187
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.590
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's just inhaling anything. It's just a

188
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.680
David Dusseau: Pattern Jared is if we can see it.

189
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.240
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I got

190
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.300
Dr Jameson: Good. I didn't know they made those, that's cool.

191
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.440
David Dusseau: Yeah, um,

192
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.000
Dr Jameson: Yeah, please.

193
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.170
David Dusseau: Jason negative

194
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.310
David Dusseau: Yeah, there's also like a sermon flavor.

195
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.250
David Dusseau: But oh

196
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.190
Dr Jameson: No, it's not the same as smoking. I know it isn't. But

197
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.080
Dr Jameson: I just I want. I just want you

198
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:45.330
Dr Jameson: We need every little thing we can do to maximize your survival rate and, you know, thriving through a surgery, you know,

199
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.750
David Dusseau: Yes. But do you think that

200
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.450
David Dusseau: Vegas region. I'm in high risk because of my lungs.

201
00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:08.580
Dr Jameson: Well, listen, I don't know, I haven't seen all your records. So I really can't comment on what exactly is happening with your heart. I don't, I don't know what your, you know, ejection fraction house and all that stuff.

202
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.410
David Dusseau: I know like

203
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.150
David Dusseau: Know about my heart.

204
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.210
David Dusseau: Is about leaky

205
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.200
Yeah.

206
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.020
David Dusseau: My muscle strength is that 40

207
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.380
David Dusseau: Okay, and low, lower the last EKG, I guess, or whatever.

208
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.520
Dr Jameson: ECHO.

209
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.160
David Dusseau: Then when I went to go get operate on

210
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.760
David Dusseau: Or when I talked to the NCL just I got my new art. Dr. Mm hmm. They're going to sketch me for

211
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.390
David Dusseau: Ratio. Remember, but then they said, wait a minute. We're gonna we got to give you a hard cap.

212
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

213
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.300
David Dusseau: So they did that.

214
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.980
David Dusseau: And I thought dollars on hats have stents put in

215
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.970
Dr Jameson: But you didn't

216
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.100
David Dusseau: They said, No, you're good to go.

217
00:14:59.460 --> 00:14:59.670
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

218
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.650
David Dusseau: And that's how I got cleared for sure. April 2

219
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I mean that sounds encouraging to me what I have heard orthopedic surgeon say

220
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:20.970
Dr Jameson: In at conferences, I've gone to is that as soon as you're a smoker. Your anesthesia risk goes up to the highest level.

221
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:33.570
Dr Jameson: So you can be 21 with nothing wrong with you, but when you're a smoker you they have more complications and problems with anesthesia and breathing and that stuff. So it also interferes with the feeling

222
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.760
David Dusseau: To have COPD.

223
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.420
Yeah.

224
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.190
David Dusseau: I have

225
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.080
David Dusseau: I believe, just in the last year because I've been sitting doing nothing.

226
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:53.280
Dr Jameson: Well, that's just listen art our bodies degrade over time. Right. You know that even if you don't do any harmful, you know, if you

227
00:15:53.730 --> 00:16:06.510
Dr Jameson: Eat and drink. Perfect. And you only vegetables and exercise. Everything we still lose function gradually of our kidneys and our lungs and our on our wrinkle you know everything gradually declines so

228
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.160
David Dusseau: Worn out, you know,

229
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:22.290
Dr Jameson: What I'm saying is, over time, your lungs are going to decline. When you're a smoker, they decline a lot faster. But what I'm trying to say is I don't think you just got COPD. In the last year. I'm sure it's been gradually developing

230
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:29.940
David Dusseau: Yeah, oh yeah, I've started at nine years old, nine leered cheese and meat. Inhale.

231
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:30.840
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

232
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.600
David Dusseau: My older friends and then I

233
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:40.470
David Dusseau: coughed up for about a week and then boy I was getting caught by the nuns.

234
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.170
David Dusseau: My third and fourth

235
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.930
David Dusseau: Fourth grade.

236
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.490
David Dusseau: Fifth,

237
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.340
David Dusseau: My daughters and my but

238
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.440
David Dusseau: It was purple.

239
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.300
David Dusseau: That noon time

240
00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:01.050
David Dusseau: Instead of going to lunch I eat real quick. Then go behind a cafeteria like

241
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:08.520
David Dusseau: On cross feed from the church and the school and go down a trick and

242
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.100
Dr Jameson: When I got back

243
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.150
David Dusseau: Some girl had told on me that he means smoking.

244
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.840
Dr Jameson: Good.

245
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.120
David Dusseau: I had to go to the principal's office.

246
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.700
David Dusseau: He smelled it on

247
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:28.290
Dr Jameson: I know you've done such a good job of cutting, way, way, way, way back, and I can't, I don't, I don't want to take away from that because that's really

248
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:38.310
Dr Jameson: Remarkable that you've done that, I just when you're so close. And we have this big, you know, you're going to like run a marathon during this surgery basically your

249
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.860
David Dusseau: Other people's vote. Dr.

250
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.430
David Dusseau: James I think it's ugly. It's

251
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.900
Dr Jameson: It's kind of

252
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.400
Kids

253
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:50.790
David Dusseau: And I

254
00:17:51.810 --> 00:18:01.980
Dr Jameson: Just want your logical says as good as they can possibly be. Before you get in there on that operating table. Right. And that's, that's why I am picking that being that picky.

255
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.970
David Dusseau: Mine lungs.

256
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.840
David Dusseau: Because I never used to get out of breath going up and down the stairs carrying

257
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:17.160
David Dusseau: groceries and I get out of breath. Well, they heal themselves by quit.

258
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:26.760
Dr Jameson: To some degree, you can't. You don't like reverse all of the damage that's done if you stop quitting. If you stop smoking, but

259
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:43.770
Dr Jameson: There is some healing that can happen and then instead of the your, your lungs declining at this speed going forward, they declined. More like everybody else's at the like normal declined path. But if you keep smoking, then you're going to get to the oxygen point much faster.

260
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.100
David Dusseau: So, you know, that's why. Every insurance company. I just filed

261
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.620
David Dusseau: Or another one person there.

262
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.970
David Dusseau: Are your smoker.

263
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.060
David Dusseau: Yeah, well, and I realized how much

264
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.500
David Dusseau: Eight people smoke 988 does

265
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:08.040
Dr Jameson: It's just frustrating. So like, why are you don't worry about that so bad for you, but

266
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.000
David Dusseau: When I grew up, I thought everybody did

267
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.130
Dr Jameson: Well, they did. They did.

268
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.060
Dr Jameson: No.

269
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.280
David Dusseau: Yeah, I thought everybody drink.

270
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:27.180
Dr Jameson: Some, some, you know, some people listen to the memo that came out from the Surgeon General in the 70s right away. And some people needed a lot of convincing. Some people don't care.

271
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:36.030
Dr Jameson: Right or anyway but and you have done. You've done remarkably well. So I'm just, I'm glad you have those toothpicks, hopefully you can

272
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.280
Dr Jameson: Chew on those instead of

273
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.550
David Dusseau: Yeah.

274
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.500
Dr Jameson: Feeling anything else that's dirty.

275
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.150
David Dusseau: I even got literature on now bad smoking is bad for you.

276
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.780
David Dusseau: Good Day, the day you quit automatically your blood pressure.

277
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.070
Dr Jameson: Jobs through

278
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.450
And your heart.

279
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.810
Dr Jameson: Your body can better you can heal better your body can heal better your animal. Yes.

280
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:15.510
Dr Jameson: And, you know, shortness of breath, it can be coming from a combination of bad lungs in a bad heart. So which one is called shortness of breath. I don't know. But you can also you're out of shape now, right, because you don't really move much because it hurts so that

281
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.400
David Dusseau: Badly out of shape.

282
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.260
David Dusseau: I could

283
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.610
David Dusseau: I could split and cut a quarter would in six hours.

284
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.090
Yeah.

285
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:34.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm glad you're doing the yoga, I think. Little bit. Little bits, within reason, but giving yourself a little workout so you, you know, you get a little bit out of breath.

286
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.850
David Dusseau: Or what

287
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.770

Dr Jameson: I think you want to try to get your shape as good as your fitness as good as it can.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.100
David Dusseau: Yeah, and how much time he must have spent because he wasn't the best writer.

297
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:06.240
But

298
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:26.820
David Dusseau: That letter is so awesome that my sister made a copy and putting a brain minute this is it is writing at 12 years old. Yeah. And it was real bad. I don't know if you can read it.

299
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.190
Dr Jameson: Will you read it to me a couple months back, I

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.910
David Dusseau: Remember doing that. I remember doing nothing.

David Dusseau: That letter.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.790
Dr Jameson: Good. I have another patient waiting now so

Pixel 3a XL: I work at a place called Nashville plumbing and I make toilets.

442
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.250

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.470
Dr Jameson: Assembly sort of thing.

444
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.460

Okay.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.540
Dr Jameson: Plumbing factory. Okay. And that's considered essential, I guess.

449
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.340
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you're still working now with all this stuff.

450
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.600

452
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.590

453
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.640
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess, yeah plumbing is also good.

454
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.440
Pixel 3a XL: toilets. I don't think that's really essential.

455
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.530
Dr Jameson: Running out of toilet paper. I haven't heard about toilet shortage

456
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.710
Pixel 3a XL: No think people really need toilets right now.

457
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.190

458
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.920
Pixel 3a XL: Anyway, that's just that's got to be

459
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.530
Pixel 3a XL: People you know yeah

460
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.640
Dr Jameson: Well, we won't argue with it since it keeps you with an income. That's good.

461
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.000
Dr Jameson: So, okay, and then who you are, where you live in with these days.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:02.580
Dr Jameson: Most people. That's a very few that own outright their residents that would be good.

467
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.670
Pixel 3a XL: Bad reception or something.

468
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.370
Dr Jameson: Oh, can you hear me now.

469
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.290
Pixel 3a XL: Have you been hearing me fine.

470
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:17.640
Dr Jameson: Pretty much, yeah, I think, I think, and I mean it's possible is on my end, although I'm hardwired so I don't think so, but

471
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.070
Dr Jameson: Zoom is very

472
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:29.010
Dr Jameson: You know, extended these days. They've got a lot of customers. So the bandwidth is a little shorter than usual.

473
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.740
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So are you a smoker sign up anything

474
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.440
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, smoke and I chew.

475
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.450
Dr Jameson: Alright, so how much do you smoke.

476
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.910
Pixel 3a XL: Don't smoke too much probably

477
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.600
Pixel 3a XL: Like maybe five cigarettes a day.

478
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.980
Dr Jameson: And you to you said

479
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.170
Pixel 3a XL: Only to work.

480
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.500
Dr Jameson: Because you can't smoke. Right.

481
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.370
Mm hmm.

482
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.090
Dr Jameson: OK. And then these anything else. Sometimes time

483
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.500
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah. Time to time not often

484
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.280
Pixel 3a XL: The last time I did would have been

485
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.130
Pixel 3a XL: Probably more than a month ago.

486
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.030
Dr Jameson: Are we talking about now on our

487
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.960
Dr Jameson: Okay, so it's an occasional thing really

488
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

489
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:41.940
Dr Jameson: All right, more than a month ago. Anything else that you've experimented with are using the past

490
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:45.960
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I've tried a lot of things.

491
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:47.940
Pixel 3a XL: Um,

492
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.560
Pixel 3a XL: Tried like acid.

493
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.620
Pixel 3a XL: Mushrooms.

494
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:04.650
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I mean, I've had

495
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.660
Pixel 3a XL: A you know bike again and stuff like that.

496
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.590
Dr Jameson: uppers. I don't like math.

497
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.630
Pixel 3a XL: And I've tried mess.

498
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:26.940
Dr Jameson: Pretty much everything more or less sounds like okay okay but none of that has been sort of regular use or

499
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.010
Dr Jameson: No. No. Okay.

500
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:30.630
Dr Jameson: All right.

501
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.500
Dr Jameson: So, mainly the alcohol is the the sort of

502
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:42.750
Dr Jameson: Yeah, common denominator, it's not the way I mean it. But that's the thing that you didn't, most likely, they

503
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.030
Pixel 3a XL: Had a problem, I guess.

504
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:51.870
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that so you went like cold turkey before. Did you do meetings like what happened. How about that.

505
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.460
Dr Jameson: Oh, yeah.

506
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.740
Pixel 3a XL: Um, I just stopped.

507
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.150
Dr Jameson: Okay.

508
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:04.320
Dr Jameson: And you said you went quite a while or you were just drinking socially for a while. Is that right,

509
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.550
Yeah.

510
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.690
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And then, and then, when was this

511
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.060
Dr Jameson: Let's pick the spike or the breakup and all that time that was

512
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.110
Pixel 3a XL: Last October. Okay.

513
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.250
Dr Jameson: And you've been drinking since then still or not so much or what

514
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.730
Pixel 3a XL: I've drank like twice since the

515
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.020
Pixel 3a XL: Last time I drank was on my birthday January.

516
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.150
Dr Jameson: Okay, so pretty, pretty occasional at this point again.

517
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:45.750
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and then an F. You just, you haven't done any meetings or talk, you know, like sought counseling or anything like that. Just kind of on your own.

518
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.580
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, okay.

519
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:53.160
Dr Jameson: And when you had your birthday. How did you do tend to binge. Then when you do drink or

520
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.450
Pixel 3a XL: Not, not since the accident.

521
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.950
Pixel 3a XL: And I

522
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:07.260
Pixel 3a XL: The only time I binge drink since my last DUI 10 years ago was the night I got this DUI.

523
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.480
Dr Jameson: Okay.

524
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.540
Dr Jameson: All right. And then, so then since then it's been almost non except on your birthday.

525
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.100
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

526
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.160
Dr Jameson: Do you think about it like does it seem like it's, I mean, is it an ongoing struggle for you, or how do you

527
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.540
Pixel 3a XL: Know it's not it's not really a struggle, just for

528
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.050
Pixel 3a XL: It, you know, I used to drink a lot, especially when I was younger.

529
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:45.330
Pixel 3a XL: But uh it destroyed a lot of things for me and like at this point is pretty easy to just

530
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:56.880
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I mean I can, I can drink, but is going into always at this point, always have that self control to keep myself from

531
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:05.580
Dr Jameson: Well, we call that replaying the tape where you think back about, okay, this is all the things that happened last time I did this too much.

532
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:16.650
Dr Jameson: Kind of your content you can recall the consequences and sort of predict them and therefore make a different choice which is definitely

533
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.460
Pixel 3a XL: The law.

534
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.630
Yeah.

535
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.350
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I mean I did you know I slipped up you know

536
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:32.730
Dr Jameson: Well, I think. I mean, the other thing is, is coping skills, you know. Well, first of all, maybe, depending on how significant Lee are

537
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:44.280
Dr Jameson: Affected by things like anxiety and depression, sometimes having those formally addressed in some, you know, other way so that you can be relieved of some of that, you know,

538
00:38:44.790 --> 00:39:00.540
Dr Jameson: In a day discomfort. Right. And then secondly, working on which you probably have if you've been as mostly successful as you have it sounds like you have been figuring out learning, either with help or on your own. Other ways to cope with.

539
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.550
Dr Jameson: You know, trouble trouble troubled things happening or

540
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:12.600
Dr Jameson: Grief or sadness or anger, you know, whatever strong emotion you might might be that day like

541
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.560
Yeah.

542
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.770
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I know, I know that drinking. There's no

543
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:30.810
Pixel 3a XL: Solution. It's almost like a step backwards like there's no answers or solution.

544
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.340
Dr Jameson: To do here. Yeah.

545
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.610
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we don't cure people of it, I don't think, but we

546
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.070
Dr Jameson: We help people.

547
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:50.610
Dr Jameson: figure themselves out enough to know where their triggers are and where they're at risk and then have alternatives, you know, baked in, so that it, it becomes less and less of even a

548
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.260
Dr Jameson: Year.

549
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.030
Dr Jameson: For a risk, you know,

550
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.750
Dr Jameson: So,

551
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:17.160
Dr Jameson: So it sounds like you're. I don't want to put words in my you tell me, but it sounds like I would say you would acknowledge that you have up an issue with alcohol that it can get you into trouble. And you're 99% of the time able to make sure that you don't

552
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:18.690
Go there.

553
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.910
Dr Jameson: Does that sound.

554
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:23.370
Dr Jameson: Fair.

555
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.780
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah yeah

556
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:37.860
Dr Jameson: So our program here is mainly well we deal with substance abuse of all sorts. But as you probably could guess the, the vast majority of our patients are opiate

557
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:39.900
Dr Jameson: Addicts

558
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:51.960
Dr Jameson: There are definitely things. I mean, there are certain like what I've been taught what we've been referring to the dealing with anxiety and, you know, dealing with life crap for

559
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.100
Dr Jameson: better word.

560
00:40:53.310 --> 00:41:05.100
Dr Jameson: Like, those are all you know we can all talk about that in the same. It just happens to be a different chemical that that has been apparently you know sort of the

561
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.730
Dr Jameson: dodo of choice, but

562
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.050
Dr Jameson: I mean there's certainly theme.

563
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:21.900
Dr Jameson: There's a medication, we use for the opiate addicts, which wouldn't be relevant for you, but it is true, just so you're aware, and I don't know whether you have cravings. At this point, do you

564
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.780
Pixel 3a XL: Know,

565
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:30.660
Dr Jameson: There are some medications that can be used as sort of an it

566
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.430
Dr Jameson: We call it an adjunct or an additional sort of help.

567
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:45.390
Dr Jameson: Depending on the situation, how much at risk, a person feels like they are like, how much of a daily, you know,

568
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.930
Dr Jameson: clenched fist. You feel like you are dealing with.

569
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:59.010
Dr Jameson: There's things like anti abuse, which is more of a. Now I know if I drink. I'm going to get really sick. So I'm taking you know but you

570
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:08.700
Dr Jameson: It can be a deterrent for some people. There's other drugs which sort of seem to decrease the amount of craving, and desire to drink that people might have

571
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:22.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And then there's there's a drug called Wellbutrin. Well, we'd have to talk more in detail. There's a drug called Wellbutrin which you may have heard before. We use it actually for smoking cessation, but it's all it was originally, it is a an antidepressant actually by

572
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:38.880
Dr Jameson: Like definite you know it's mean kind of FDA approval was for depression. They happen to notice in the study subjects when they were doing the studies that randomly. There were more people quitting smoking in the test group. So that's how that's how that happened.

573
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.780
Dr Jameson: But it can also for some people, be a help for

574
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:50.250
Dr Jameson: Anyway, it's an antidepressant, but it can also sort of discourage that actually using some of the weight loss.

575
00:42:51.690 --> 00:43:03.060
Dr Jameson: It just seems to help help dopamine levels without, you know, sort of bypass with allowing people to bypass. Some of the other means by which they're so for me levels, if you know what I mean.

576
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:12.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I'm happy to talk about anxiety and depression. Specifically, if that's something you'd be interested in

577
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:22.260
Dr Jameson: I'll come back to that one. Second, the way our program works, and I have to be honest, it's not 100% clear to me when people are referred to us by the courts.

578
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.790
Dr Jameson: What they're

579
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:37.050
Dr Jameson: If they are expecting us to just decide, okay, you just need some individual counseling and you're going to go do that or if they expect you to be participating in our standard program which is weekly kind of support groups base.

580
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.680
Dr Jameson: So I need to find out more about about that they, I mean,

581
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:54.060
Dr Jameson: I think our patients actually find them helpful because it's a group of people that kind of just get get where you're coming from on a certain level that maybe other people wouldn't

582
00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.300
Dr Jameson: And we talk about coping skills and

583
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:04.680
Dr Jameson: relapse prevention and we just talk about whatever is going on and for people so they have a workplace event.

584
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.990
Dr Jameson: And it's just sort of mutually encouraging, I think.

585
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:22.620
Dr Jameson: Our that people spend and, you know, we usually still recommend people do some potentially some, you know, outpatient regular kinds of meetings and things for additional support.

586
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:36.450
Dr Jameson: You know, we usually encourage people to try to do that and get us to publish with somebody who can kind of be a sponsor or a mentor for them. So you have someone to call when you're having a bad extra bad day, you know, that sort of thing, but

587
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:46.410
Dr Jameson: At the bare minimum will do this evaluation with me. We can come back to that question about anxiety, depression, which I just raised and then change the subject, but

588
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:54.390
Dr Jameson: You have an initial evaluation with a counselor. At which point, they'll kind of delve into more detailed stuff about

589
00:44:54.870 --> 00:45:08.880
Dr Jameson: You know some of the the whether there are any or not, I don't know, demons and past traumas and that kind of stuff. And then determine if it seems like counseling, which it usually is would be recommended almost always a test.

590
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:15.600
Dr Jameson: And then at what frequency. So do they think every week or every two weeks, or what do they recommend

591
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:16.950
Yeah.

592
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:27.870
Dr Jameson: So I don't know if that's been scheduled for you yet. Do you know, has anybody said anything about a they call it a bio cycle, social, sometimes I bps that sounds

593
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.150
Pixel 3a XL: No, nobody said I can

594
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:38.220
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I can look in and see. Anyway, um, so we we do that there's generally

595
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.580
Dr Jameson: A set of initial labs that we do.

596
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.410
Dr Jameson: Just to kind of scream. You never did you ever inject anything

597
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:57.240
Dr Jameson: Depending on, you know. There can be various risk taking back behaviors that come along with

598
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:08.340
Dr Jameson: substance use issues. So we tend to screen for some of the infections and then and, you know, obviously, I guess, in your case, liver function testing would be

599
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.300
Dr Jameson: potentially relevant hopefully it's normal at this point but

600
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.620
Dr Jameson: Nobody ever said anything yet, you had any issues with

601
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.610
Dr Jameson: Liver testing that you've heard about

602
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.870
Dr Jameson: Are you there.

603
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.400
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

604
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:33.810
Dr Jameson: Oh, sorry. You know what you've never been diagnosed with any liver problems or hepatitis or any Titus or anything like that. Okay.

605
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.100
Right.

606
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.170
Dr Jameson: Have you

607
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:44.760
Dr Jameson: You mentioned that alcohol destroyed a lot of yeah I don't see any appointments coming up for you. So that answers that question.

608
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:54.300
Dr Jameson: Back in the day, I guess the first go around with this, what sorts of what sorts of things did alcohol sort of mess up.

609
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.330
Pixel 3a XL: Whoa.

610
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:15.870
Dr Jameson: You don't have to get it. I mean like general like did you lose the job. Did you, you obviously had legal problems because you got to do. I did it affect family relationships that it's like that, you know, Justin, you don't have to get into details, you can

611
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.250
Pixel 3a XL: Do it.

612
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.370
Pixel 3a XL: I was my freshman year I was going, I went to college to play football.

613
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:32.790
Pixel 3a XL: Scholar scholarship to Gary college and before I was gonna head back for my sophomore year that somewhere I ended up

614
00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.530
Pixel 3a XL: Getting a DUI and totaled my car and I didn't go back to school after that so that that was a big change and

615
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.030
Pixel 3a XL: Your path and I will

616
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that was definitely a big thing.

617
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.450
Dr Jameson: Okay.

618
00:47:53.130 --> 00:48:04.080
Dr Jameson: And how about family. I didn't ask you actually about family history of I meant to anybody in your family suffer with our struggle with substance abuse or alcohol or

619
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.320
Pixel 3a XL: Oh,

620
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:15.810
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I think I don't know how diagnosis is racing. But my dad.

621
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.430
Pixel 3a XL: He's he Yeah he had problems with alcohol when he was younger.

622
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:24.390
Mm hmm.

623
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:27.720
Dr Jameson: Let's see, he's sober now.

624
00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.040
Yeah.

625
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.980
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there are talking about it.

626
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.010
Pixel 3a XL: Oh yeah, he always talks about it. Yeah.

627
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.180
Dr Jameson: Let's see, supportive of it, like, what is this what is the

628
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.670
Dr Jameson: General

629
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.330
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, he supported you know i mean

630
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.430
Pixel 3a XL: He made a lot of bad decisions while he was drinking what not to say.

631
00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.430
Pixel 3a XL: He understands

632
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:06.300
Dr Jameson: I don't know about you, but I'm not too many people make particularly good decisions on this.

633
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:07.830
Dr Jameson: I know

634
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.630
Pixel 3a XL: One thing that I've learned

635
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:26.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. When your alter your mental status to a certain degree. Yeah, things are priorities can shift. And then, yeah, just things seem like good ideas are not good ideas and vice versa.

636
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.770
Pixel 3a XL: So, yeah.

637
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:32.430
Dr Jameson: OK, so

638
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:41.520
Dr Jameson: I guess, let me take up let me back up again for a minute about the whole anxiety, depression thing. I mean, do you want to talk more about that.

639
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:45.810
Pixel 3a XL: Sure.

640
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.710
Pixel 3a XL: So,

641
00:49:50.820 --> 00:50:05.100
Dr Jameson: What would help me. I guess would be to get a little bit more of a sense of like sort of on a daily or regular basis, what sorts of how what sorts of symptoms do you experience or what are you what's going on that sort of in into intruding into your

642
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.100
Dr Jameson: Into your, you know, peace of mind. So to

643
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.660
Pixel 3a XL: Have a hard time

644
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.440
Pixel 3a XL: Being like in groups of people.

645
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:24.900
Pixel 3a XL: I don't know.

646
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:30.360
Dr Jameson: Do you feel physically like what happens, you feel physical symptoms when that happens.

647
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.130
Pixel 3a XL: Sometimes I do. Yeah, I feel like in my eyes.

648
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.820
Dr Jameson: Tell me more about that.

649
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:47.220
Pixel 3a XL: Like hard to look people in the eye. Sometimes

650
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.240
Mm hmm.

651
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:52.080
Dr Jameson: I can kind of relate to that a little bit. I think actually

652
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.070
Dr Jameson: avoiding eye contact, sometimes to force myself.

653
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:58.140
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I don't know.

654
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.480
Pixel 3a XL: You

655
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:05.070
Dr Jameson: Get like sweaty or breathe faster heart racing or that kind of stuff, or

656
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.060
Pixel 3a XL: I think sometimes there's like a

657
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:16.410
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, like a maybe a pit in my stomach or something.

658
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.280
Mm hmm.

659
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:22.230
Pixel 3a XL: Feeling a weakness.

660
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:34.140
Dr Jameson: Do you mean like your legs feel you feel physically weak or you you are saying that you judge yourself as being weak because you feel these ways

661
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.960
Pixel 3a XL: I think I do do that.

662
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.500
Pixel 3a XL: Physically is I guess I'm not affected too much physically. Okay.

663
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.440
Dr Jameson: So it's more, it's more

664
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.860
Dr Jameson: In your head and I mean that, like, no pun intended. But it's more like an in your head, sort of,

665
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.300
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

666
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:06.210
Dr Jameson: The thing is, as much as people like make jokes about that, like the brain in our head is like so amazingly

667
00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:08.940
Dr Jameson: Powerful

668
00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:18.630
Dr Jameson: A lot of things are actually in our head, and we can reset, we can harness that or we can we can fall victim to it, depending on how we

669
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:29.670
Dr Jameson: Put but for sure. I mean, there's also really interesting, you know, you hear stories of people that like pickup trucks to get their kid out from underneath.

670
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:37.860
Dr Jameson: That's all in your head, you know, I mean, it's so it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a question of

671
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.260
Dr Jameson: Okay, where, where we were at Lisa

672
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:42.900
Dr Jameson: How do you sleep.

673
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.750
Pixel 3a XL: I sleep. Okay.

674
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.100
Dr Jameson: Good.

675
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.460
Pixel 3a XL: I sleep. Pretty good. I mean, I, I work a lot

676
00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:56.370
Pixel 3a XL: And I think that's why i mean i don't have any trouble sleeping, because I'm usually pretty tired.

677
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:57.330
Pixel 3a XL: Good.

678
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.450
Dr Jameson: That's great and things like appetite.

679
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:02.820
Pixel 3a XL: Yes, fine.

680
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.090
Dr Jameson: They probably asked, you know what, you probably fill out a survey.

681
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.640
Dr Jameson: Questions. You've already

682
00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:13.410
Dr Jameson: I just remembered I like wait, they asked these questions. Hold on, let me look

683
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.090
Dr Jameson: It'll save you.

684
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:16.890
Dr Jameson: Time.

685
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:31.380
Dr Jameson: Do other people in your like family members have. So there's a thing. I don't know. I've only talked a little bit, but there's a thing called social anxiety disorder where

686
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:46.860
Dr Jameson: Being crowds of people or just interacting with people is kind of uncomfortable, which is actually extremely prevalent. As it turns out, in the substance use population. Yeah. Very, very prevalent.

687
00:53:48.390 --> 00:54:05.670
Dr Jameson: And we probably see even more of them because people who are uncomfortable going into meet you know in a group are going to be drawn more to this sort of setup where they're at home, but on a video, you know. So we probably see even more of a pop up percentage

688
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.760
Dr Jameson: No trouble sleeping.

689
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:18.180
Dr Jameson: So the depression. The score is kind of mild and then

690
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:30.390
Dr Jameson: Anxiety, really. So, it is it is it mainly in sort of social context that you find your Hanks anxious or

691
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.020
Dr Jameson: Other times, too.

692
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.710
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I think.

693
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.430
Pixel 3a XL: Mainly social yeah

694
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.900
Dr Jameson: I know a lot of times people

695
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:55.080
Dr Jameson: You know, you just feel more relaxed when when you had a couple drinks and that turns into, you know, wanting that all the time. And that's what yeah

696
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.990
Pixel 3a XL: Definitely, I definitely used to use

697
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.190
Pixel 3a XL: social settings out i'll be drinking

698
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.420
Dr Jameson: Now do you avoid social settings. Now, are you gotten better at

699
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.370
Dr Jameson: being present in those those settings without alcohol.

700
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.570
Pixel 3a XL: Kind of losing. Yes.

701
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:24.360
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me now. I'm happy to repeat. I just want to make sure you can hear me.

702
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.220
Dr Jameson: That

703
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.540
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me right now.

704
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.510
Dr Jameson: That any better.

705
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.400
Dr Jameson: Hello.

706
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.120
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

707
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:43.410
Pixel 3a XL: I can hear you.

708
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:53.460
Dr Jameson: Better. I was, I was just asking if you find that you're more comfortable in social settings now than you used to be, or you're just

709
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.460
Dr Jameson: avoiding them, I guess, more

710
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.400
Pixel 3a XL: No, I don't. I mean, I do. Avoid

711
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.070
Pixel 3a XL: So,

712
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.450
Dr Jameson: Okay.

713
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:08.760
Well,

714
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.000
Pixel 3a XL: I don't know. I think I'm

715
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:17.880
Pixel 3a XL: It's not something that prevents me from doing what I need to do.

716
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.170
Good.

717
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:20.850
Dr Jameson: And that's

718
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:28.890
Dr Jameson: Exactly where the distinguishing that's the criteria right there. Like, if this is interfering with your life, then it's

719
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:29.970
Pixel 3a XL: Oops.

720
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:30.540
Are you there.

721
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.330
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I'm losing you

722
00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:39.030
Dr Jameson: That's it dropped out and dropped in I don't know, maybe the wife.

723
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.040
Dr Jameson: Network, there's

724
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:42.900
Dr Jameson: Flaky

725
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.480
Pixel 3a XL: Me.

726
00:56:46.080 --> 00:57:03.870
Dr Jameson: That's, that's kind of our distinguishing criteria right there for whether or not something is like a quote unquote disorder or worth worth talking about medication or intervention of some kind or if it's just something that we kind of work on with counseling and

727
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.050
Dr Jameson: You know practice kind of

728
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.240
Pixel 3a XL: Exposure

729
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.260
Dr Jameson: That sort of thing.

730
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:23.550
Dr Jameson: So I guess I'm not getting a sense that it's necessarily at the level that we might necessarily, you know, automatically recommend a medication. I do think you know maybe

731
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:26.850
Pixel 3a XL: I would like to try to not

732
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:28.410
Dr Jameson: Okay.

733
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.880
Pixel 3a XL: You're on medication.

734
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.290
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

735
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:46.230
Dr Jameson: There are techniques that the counselors can help help you with that sometimes can help with with grounding exercises and breathing. I don't know. They're the counselors, not me, but I know there are ways to kind of help people work through some of that.

736
00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.120
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

737
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:53.280
Dr Jameson: I don't know if trauma has been a factor in your life at all.

738
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.610
Pixel 3a XL: I mean much.

739
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:08.280
Dr Jameson: Well, like, if any, any significant losses or traumatic events that you know still are things that you kind of think about on a regular basis in a kind of a

740
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.780
Pixel 3a XL: Negative

741
00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:10.350
I'm

742
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:12.930
Pixel 3a XL: Saying

743
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:19.920
Pixel 3a XL: The relationships that I've had with people and the way that they've ended.

744
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.630
Pixel 3a XL: I think has a big part

745
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:25.920
Yeah.

746
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:38.940
Dr Jameson: So the counseling can definitely help with that because I saw a lot of what we end up tormented by our own sort of our own internal narrative that we assign

747
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:58.080
Dr Jameson: To our world and our experiences around us and people in the same exact situation, one can be a real pessimistic person and negative about themselves and come away feeling a whole different way than someone who's, who's much more pessimistic. I mean, much more optimistic and kind of

748
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:10.410
Dr Jameson: You know, positive about themselves and you know self esteem and self image and stuff like that and you kind of end up sort of like snowballing sometimes because it

749
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:17.400
Dr Jameson: feeds itself. I think so. That's what I was what I was thinking about was that some people who have had

750
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:29.250
Dr Jameson: You know, Billy significant either abuse or, you know, things that have happened to them that have colored their, their approach to the to the world, there's a specific type of therapy or a

751
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:41.640
Dr Jameson: Memo dalbeattie of therapy that has to do with it kind of sounds so cookie, but it actually seems to be very effective with it any way you can help people kind of re catalog their memories in a way that doesn't

752
00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:50.850
Dr Jameson: Keep bringing up a lot of emotional stuff. So anyway, we have somebody that does that count that type of counts that type of therapy as well.

753
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.600
Dr Jameson: Probably I would that might not be necessary for that may not be relevant for you, but maybe as you

754
00:59:59.130 --> 00:59:59.550
Pixel 3a XL: Can hear me.

755
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:01.620
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

756
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:12.690
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And then maybe as you meet with a counselor, they may or may not say hey you know this might be something that might help you. So anyway, we have we have that available to for now, I guess.

757
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.160
Dr Jameson: If it doesn't seem like you're having a daily sort of

758
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.210
Dr Jameson: Fight with yourself to avoid drinking. If it's not

759
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.900
Dr Jameson: At that level.

760
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:30.180
Dr Jameson: anymore. I don't know that I would say we need to talk about specifically medication for the alcohol piece, either.

761
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.490
Dr Jameson: Unless it's something you're interested in which you've already said you're not so

762
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:48.930
Dr Jameson: The group. So for now, let me just double check with the staff about what the structure is intended to be or if I get to pick or we know how that works.

763
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.410
Dr Jameson: For the as far as the courts go

764
01:00:52.800 --> 01:01:12.750
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I definitely think me with a counselor and hopefully if you're open to that taking advantage of this opportunity to maybe do some a series of sessions. So see if you can just tweak things a little bit on how your how you're reacting to situations in your, in your life, and

765
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.940
Dr Jameson: Hoping and relaxation and stuff. Things that any

766
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:27.990
Dr Jameson: human adult really can benefit from it doesn't, it's not a sign of some sort of weakness. It's just we don't we don't all

767
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:38.730
Dr Jameson: Come to the, you know, some people have really amazing role models of kids and they kind of get all they kind of take all this in just from growing up and some people

768
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:53.700
Dr Jameson: You know, it's not, if that kind of stuff isn't modeled for you. You're good. You don't necessarily you kind of learn to cope with the things the way that people around you cope with things. And if that happens to be positive. Good ways that great, but if it doesn't, you're kind of

769
01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.870
Dr Jameson: Sort of left to figure it out yourself. So we can

770
01:01:59.400 --> 01:01:59.910
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

771
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:05.040
Dr Jameson: I don't see me again. So I would, I would definitely

772
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:11.910
Dr Jameson: Recommend that and when the counselor says one and I'm not going to get much else to talk to you about then.

773
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:13.830
Pixel 3a XL: Great. Yeah.

774
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.040
Dr Jameson: And then

775
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:30.000
Dr Jameson: I'm going to leave it as a to be determined about the groups. I mean, I think the groups are great. And if you're if it sounds interesting to you anyway. Then if we can just pick a time and you can you can come in. Some of it will be slightly

776
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:48.540
Dr Jameson: Irrelevant. In a way, because we might talk about medication that you don't take, but as far as dealing with life and talking about looking for good things and gratitude and you know those sorts of other subjects. I think a lot of that would be relevant.

777
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:51.270
Dr Jameson: So,

778
01:02:52.530 --> 01:03:01.020
Dr Jameson: What are your, what is your kind of general opinion about about going and doing a weekly support group meeting.

779
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.500
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I'd be open to it.

780
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:05.670
Yeah.

781
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.620
Dr Jameson: We can always reassess as time goes on, and depending on what your probation folks are looking for.

782
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:15.690
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

783
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.320
Dr Jameson: I have your in Ohio. What's your work schedule like

784
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.070
Pixel 3a XL: It's pretty crazy.

785
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.880
Dr Jameson: So not not consistent, really, is that what you mean.

786
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:35.580
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, not really. I mean there is, I do have a set schedule. But there's a lot of overtime and

787
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.450
Dr Jameson: Do you work first. And what shifty work usually

788
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:41.880
Pixel 3a XL: I can give you. I can tell you my

789
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.440
Dr Jameson: Schedule I work

790
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.540
Pixel 3a XL: I can do it like every other Tuesday.

791
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.050
Pixel 3a XL: I can do anytime after I get off at four.

792
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:52.980
Okay.

793
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:57.780
Dr Jameson: So after four would be better. Okay.

794
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.110
Pixel 3a XL: Do I

795
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.220
Dr Jameson: Need millions. Yeah. Okay. Well, I have

796
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:08.370
Dr Jameson: I have groups on on Tuesday evening for. Fortunately, that's the

797
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.040
Dr Jameson: I think

798
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:16.260
Dr Jameson: I think the 919 15 me too late.

799
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.880
Dr Jameson: To start

800
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:19.140
Yeah.

801
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.720
Dr Jameson: The other one is an eight I

802
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.000
Pixel 3a XL: Go to bed because I have to be a while before

803
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:25.620
Pixel 3a XL: Bed.

804
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:27.540
Dr Jameson: Oh wow, what time you go to bed.

805
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:29.880
Pixel 3a XL: Around eight

806
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:35.070
Dr Jameson: Okay, so they're asking me to it. So then you said what happens every other week. You don't work very

807
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.050
Pixel 3a XL: Well,

808
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.590
Dr Jameson: That there's an API. So it would be great when you're usually going to bed.

809
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.180
Pixel 3a XL: hour long

810
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:45.870
Yep.

811
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.290
Dr Jameson: How

812
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.180
Pixel 3a XL: Are you probably I could probably do.

813
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:57.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, the other option would be to do that every other week during the day on Tuesday. If that sounds

814
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:02.640
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

815
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.790
Pixel 3a XL: Okay, yeah, we can do that.

816
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.500
Dr Jameson: What time, I guess you get up pretty early, even when you're not working that day.

817
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.930
Dr Jameson: If it's 10:30am to okay

818
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.460
Pixel 3a XL: Yes. Okay.

819
01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.940
Pixel 3a XL: It might actually be tougher to do

820
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.290
Pixel 3a XL: This I'll have my daughter.

821
01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, do you want to stick with the eight o'clock, then

822
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.010
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, let's just

823
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:35.370
Dr Jameson: All right, I will pencil you in there.

824
01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:37.170
Dr Jameson: And then

825
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:54.120
Dr Jameson: My, my pages full but people have moved and some people only come something not everybody comes every week, so it'll be fine. Do you, you go by Caleb right

826
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:56.430
Pixel 3a XL: Yes. Okay.

827
01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:58.080
Dr Jameson: Alright.

828
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:06.150
Dr Jameson: So hopefully now you've you've kind of travel you travel shot if that's the word

829
01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:07.380
Today,

830
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:17.370
Dr Jameson: She did with the zoom. So the way that any appointment, you have with us. I've always going to start with virtual clinic.

831
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:23.520
Dr Jameson: Is a change the process at some point but hope that's right now. This is how it works. You go to virtual clinic, you check in.

832
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:36.480
Dr Jameson: And then they once they've satisfied. You've had your labs or your drug screening or whatever it is that you know their surveys, they asked people to fill out every day, the various steps co pays if there were one, that kind of thing.

833
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:43.740
Dr Jameson: Then they'll email you the the ID number for the meeting that week which changes every week. So you do have to check in.

834
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.610
Pixel 3a XL: The email.

835
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.090
Dr Jameson: Maybe they can text.

836
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.430
Pixel 3a XL: My email I

837
01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:53.880
Dr Jameson: Know,

838
01:06:53.910 --> 01:07:04.530
Dr Jameson: So, okay, that's a good question. But when you're checking in, you can talk to them about that if you email isn't going to work. Me, they say, I assume they can text you too, I would think, but

839
01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.350
Dr Jameson: I have no I'm not sure exactly

840
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.400
Dr Jameson: And that's not in my immediate

841
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.920
Dr Jameson: Like sphere of what I'm, what I'm where I'm working so

842
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:18.570
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

843
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:31.530
Dr Jameson: And then that. So anyway, then subsequently you type in the new meet the meeting ID, just like you did with me. You know, so it was like a second number right so that it's the same processes just

844
01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:44.550
Dr Jameson: The, the group meeting and said, it can take a little time. I don't know how long it took today for you to check in. But when we are going to match it will be a 15 people checking in simultaneously somebody's going to have to wait.

845
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:55.110
Dr Jameson: So we, we generally ask people to check in at least no less than a half an hour before the group actually starts. And honestly, you could check in.

846
01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:04.350
Dr Jameson: Two hours before. If you have a minute. And once you've got that meeting ID, then you can go be doing what you're doing, until eight o'clock comes around. Okay.

847
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:16.680
Dr Jameson: We asked people to wear earbuds or earphones for privacy HIPAA reasons like there really should ideally not be anybody else in the room actually make exceptions for people's children.

848
01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:17.880
Dr Jameson: And

849
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.290
Dr Jameson: You can't just

850
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.910
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so when I really worthy or two year olds going to go blabber. Hey, he said that, you know,

851
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:36.810
Dr Jameson: So that's, that's okay. We asked people not to smoke during group because some people are trying to quit or have recently quit and we don't really want to

852
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:38.790
Dr Jameson: Figure people

853
01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:53.040
Dr Jameson: And then I mean I think it goes without saying. You would not be drinking or under the influence of anything else. During group and and you know as it sounds like you'll probably be on your bed, if not in your bed.

854
01:08:54.390 --> 01:09:02.760
Dr Jameson: You know, focused on this for that, like, this is your primary activity for the hour, not in the grocery store or doing 17 other things.

855
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.250
Dr Jameson: And then

856
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:14.550
Dr Jameson: I think that's the main sort of just have it Rochelle is the counselor that kind of runs the meeting. I'm there too.

857
01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:26.760
Dr Jameson: So if you were on a medication, I would be, it would be like a double a twofer. You get your refill. You know, if you need a refills and and meet but accounts and then have the support group at the same in the same hour

858
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:30.480
Dr Jameson: And

859
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:40.770
Dr Jameson: I think that's that pretty much covers my end of things. Any questions on your end, or

860
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:43.020
Dr Jameson: Wonders or

861
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:47.550
Pixel 3a XL: Know,

862
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:51.840
Pixel 3a XL: What's next,

863
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.980
Pixel 3a XL: So that means tomorrow. Yeah.

864
01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.030
Dr Jameson: The first one will be tomorrow night. So if you think of it as 730

865
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:09.390
Dr Jameson: At little later than I don't know if they send you the surveys. The so I know you did a bunch of surveys, when you were just doing your intake, but they have

866
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:14.160
Dr Jameson: I think it's a good thing, but it does require some some of

867
01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.230
Pixel 3a XL: The patients time every week to

868
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:26.820
Dr Jameson: Complete them. They're really the leaders like the chief medical officer and they're really into data. And if I do, I think ultimately they're looking at AI and

869
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:38.250
Dr Jameson: They will, they're really interested in tracking the factors that seem to go along with people either doing well or not, not, not having a good, you know, having a relapse or something. So they asked, they asked

870
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:41.130
Dr Jameson: A series of questions every week to everyone, fill out.

871
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.100
Dr Jameson: And we can kind of use that to track generally

872
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:54.060
Dr Jameson: How your how you're doing. And hopefully, you know, intervene if we need to. If we identify something that's show starting to show up. So

873
01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:09.120
Dr Jameson: They send you a link, I believe, and I, I always thought they send it to you every week, but I'm actually not sure that they do and I you're expected to fill these out every week. So that's one of the checklist items and then checking in process. So if you can

874
01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:17.100
Dr Jameson: And you said you're having a problem with your email so. Alright, well, we'll have to. We'll have to figure that out. And if you don't have a working email right now.

875
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:25.530
Dr Jameson: We can, we'll let that slide for for a list, at least initially, till they get sorted out. But did they did they talk to you about labs.

876
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:28.380
Pixel 3a XL: They mentioned at

877
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:30.060
Dr Jameson: The lab. Okay.

878
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.500
Dr Jameson: So another question I

879
01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:40.650
Dr Jameson: Have we normally do a set of labs, which I know I mentioned, which I'm sure you heard me say

880
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:44.880
Dr Jameson: Let me see if they have an order in here for you or not, what's

881
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.690
Dr Jameson: Clicked on the wrong.

882
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:52.770
Different patient

883
01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.960
Dr Jameson: Yes, they do have them in here so I don't know why you weren't invited to this, but we generally, like I said, I was saying earlier, we

884
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:04.830
Dr Jameson: Usually people know about it before they get to me, which is why I was

885
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:10.140
Pixel 3a XL: Just something, but there was okay. It wasn't very formalized okay

886
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:20.190
Dr Jameson: So we there's an order in here, we typically use the quest lab, unless you live somewhere where there's no quest around you and which case we find like a local hospital or something.

887
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:24.750
Dr Jameson: But we do a series of blood tests and then a urine drug screen.

888
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:36.990
Dr Jameson: Just as a baseline and whatever. It shows it show like it's not a you don't get in trouble if something's in there that's not supposed. You know what I mean, we don't we don't use it like that. It's really more just to

889
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:38.940
Dr Jameson: Assess

890
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:51.450
Dr Jameson: And in general, week kind of take that approach in general to, you know, like if somebody has like I just had a meeting right before. That's what I was talking to you before, before your appointment today and

891
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:52.740
Dr Jameson: Hit

892
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.490
Dr Jameson: Can you hear

893
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.960
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

894
01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:58.920
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

895
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:10.380
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no address um you know his. He had something in there that wasn't expected to be in there. And we've just had a conversation like what's going on and you know you don't get kicked out. I mean, if it keeps happening.

896
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:21.300
Dr Jameson: Or you know your person we're prescribing something for a patient and they keep testing negative for it and they're missing their medicine is apparently you know disappearing.

897
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:34.530
Dr Jameson: Somewhere else that's the problem right but but if you know we don't really. I know a lot of programs will actually like dismiss people if they have a relapse. And that's just not very realistic. I don't think to the way that

898
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:46.350
Dr Jameson: Is no addiction works. So it's not helpful. I mean, we don't want you to relapse. But we also realize that that's certainly like

899
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:56.250
Dr Jameson: The norm as opposed to, but as opposed to the exception, you know, most people over the green light. You know, you have not recently but anyway.

900
01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:08.910
Dr Jameson: We rather work with you. And so it's like what happened what was going on. What were you thinking about what was your mindset. What were you know like, let's talk about it. So we can learn from this. Not all right, you're out.

901
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.920
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of how we approach that just so you know.

902
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:15.720
Dr Jameson: I think some

903
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:30.120
Dr Jameson: I think sometimes people avoid their test because they know that something's going to be in there. That shouldn't be. And it's not, that's not helpful. I mean, we'd rather know what's like what's be upfront and open about it so we can

904
01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:31.860
Dr Jameson: Work on

905
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.280
Yeah.

906
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:41.340
Pixel 3a XL: My. I don't know if I'll be taking tests through my probation officer is that

907
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.380
Pixel 3a XL: It may well know that to you guys.

908
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:52.170
Dr Jameson: Well, sometimes we can coordinate and sort of share information. I'm sure you sign something because I'm sure you had to

909
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:59.940
Dr Jameson: And we can we can consider and. Yeah, the thing is, is I don't know if they're wanting to do blood alcohol levels. We don't typically

910
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:13.290
Dr Jameson: We don't usually check that. What the what we usually do after the initial bloodwork where you go to the lab. After that you do a monthly drug screen, but we mail a cup to you at home that you can just on

911
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:19.860
Dr Jameson: You do a little visit with the virtual clinic again. But you, you know, you put, put your sample in the cup and then you show you

912
01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:31.740
Dr Jameson: You put it up to the camera so we can see what show so you don't have to keep going back to the lab every month, but we can we can coordinate. We've done that before where. Okay, well, they're going to do it anyway so that

913
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.970
Dr Jameson: May just for us the information you know the test results or vice versa.

914
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:38.520
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we can work together. Yeah.

915
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.690
Pixel 3a XL: I'm doing this to them. I didn't know if it'd be necessary for me to do it.

916
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:45.030
Dr Jameson: As long as we can see the results.

917
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:53.730
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I know. As long as we have the information available to us, then I don't I don't feel the need to make you do it twice. Do they have you like

918
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:56.550
Pixel 3a XL: Flowing and this is our newest model.

919
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:57.930
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

920
01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:04.470
Pixel 3a XL: What's going on my probation just started so I mean I'll meet with her on Friday.

921
01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:19.920
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, you can ask her, you know, say we mean they they normally do monthly drug screens. If you know what do you want to do you want me to just do them have them for them to you. Do you want me to do them here and then we could, would you be able to forward them to them, you know,

922
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:26.670
Dr Jameson: We can also have staff members reach out to them to if you don't have to necessarily be the monkey in the middle.

923
01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.510
Dr Jameson: And then do they have you like blowing into your car or anything like that, you get your

924
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.350
Dr Jameson: No. Okay, that's good. So please

925
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.310
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, I had that the last time this. Yeah.

926
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.280
Dr Jameson: They make you pay for it, too. Right. Yeah.

927
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.520
Dr Jameson: Like expensive little fucker.

928
01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:50.550
But

929
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:56.040
Dr Jameson: I wish they had something like that for other substances, they don't

930
01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.020
Dr Jameson: Doesn't exist, though.

931
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:09.210
Dr Jameson: Anyway, okay, so we'll PLAN ON. SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT. For the first group. And then is there a do you are you aware of whether there's a quest lab in your

932
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.430
Dr Jameson: Area there somewhere.

933
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:12.840
Pixel 3a XL: I don't know.

934
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.330
Dr Jameson: You can just Google quest.

935
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.110
Dr Jameson: You know, I'm talking about. There's lab born on this quest.

936
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:21.450
Pixel 3a XL: Before

937
01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:33.060
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay, well you it's a it's a national chain of of labs and it depends where you are. But, but most places. There's a quest lab within a reasonable radius.

938
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:39.180
Dr Jameson: The question will be, if they're just taking patients right now because of this whole

939
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:57.120
Dr Jameson: Situation, I would call if you can find one. I would call them and just say, Hey, I'm supposed to get blood work done, they said they submitted it an order for me. Are you able to double check that you see it in there and what are your hours. Can I come like what you know.

940
01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:04.950
Dr Jameson: What should I do before you slept over there and then find out one or two of those things are not not working out.

941
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:10.290
Dr Jameson: If, if they're closed. They're closed. I mean, we can't

942
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:22.710
Dr Jameson: Undo the quarantine for you. So we'll have to see, but I think, you know, more and more people are wearing masks. Now I think things are starting to get a little bit less.

943
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.030
Pixel 3a XL: Was a lot of people out today. Just use normal

944
01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:42.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and I get, you know, like if you're wearing a mask and everyone has access to masks. Now, I think it was that that wasn't true for a while. And I'm hoping that things like doctors offices in labs are able to kind of get back to mostly normal business.

945
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:52.140
Dr Jameson: So we usually ask people to get the blood work labs done because it's blood and urine actually labs done within the first week just to get it out of the way so there

946
01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:56.850
Dr Jameson: Seems to get harder and harder to remember to do it if you let it go. Very long so

947
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:01.500
Dr Jameson: If you can see if you can figure out a way to get that done this week, then

948
01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.510
Dr Jameson: cross that off.

949
01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:09.330
Dr Jameson: The list and double check everything looks normal there.

950
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:19.380
Dr Jameson: Is not a bad thing, we get a little bit of blood work done. Check your kidneys and liver and stuff like that. Anyway, it's been a while. I bet.

951
01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.020
Dr Jameson: Okay.

952
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:24.090
Dr Jameson: Well,

953
01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.670
Dr Jameson: Maybe someday when your kid or something.

954
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:28.650
Dr Jameson: Okay.

955
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:29.970
Dr Jameson: So I think

956
01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.250
Pixel 3a XL: That's that just tells you if your livers healthier.

957
01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:41.010
Dr Jameson: Right, so we just do a little screening for basic blood counts. I mean, it's

958
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:54.210
Dr Jameson: Much of it is probably honestly not that relevant to you because you're not actively using anything and you haven't injected things where you could have contracted hepatitis or HIV or something but

959
01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:58.200
Dr Jameson: In general we we screen for those we screen for

960
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:07.290
Dr Jameson: STDs. So hepatitis C hepatitis B and C and HIV and civilized actually which is making a comeback so

961
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:19.560
Dr Jameson: And then we do some just basic blood counts and liver and kidney stuff because most of our patients were prescribing medication. So we kind of want to know what what the landscape is before we start introducing

962
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:30.930
Dr Jameson: The medication so so mostly it's kind of more just a routine kind of protocol thing for you, but not a bad thing. Anyway, since you haven't had blood work done in a long time. Yes.

963
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.460
Dr Jameson: Okay, you have insurance.

964
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.020
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah.

965
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:37.560
Okay.

966
01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.250
Dr Jameson: Unless you have to pay for it outright and then maybe it would be a bad

967
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:57.540
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow night, and then I'll just say you know Michelle is the counselor, she'll invite you to know like if you'd like to contribute or participate, but just be you're totally

968
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:05.250
Dr Jameson: Entitled to just sit and listen when you haven't done this before you. Nobody's gonna, you're not going to be forced to

969
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:16.590
Dr Jameson: Give some sort of speech or something like that. So, don't stress about don't stress about the group, necessarily. I know it'll you know it's something new. So it's always a little

970
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:22.890
Dr Jameson: What's this going to be like. But generally, we just like the only time where someone might really kind of

971
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:37.020
Dr Jameson: Ask you to answer the question would be, we usually go around and everybody says something they're grateful for. I think Rachelle tends to start with that other groups they end with that. But it's kind of a general general theme. So just so you, you know, have

972
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.150
Dr Jameson: Only put on the spot. You can

973
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:42.570
Dr Jameson: Have have a preview of the test question.

974
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:50.700
Dr Jameson: But other than that, you can I rather wait till next week, I'm not really sure. I

975
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.310
Dr Jameson: You know you can you can Ponte don't don't feel obligated. If you're not comfortable

976
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:58.440
Dr Jameson: Okay.

977
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.290
Pixel 3a XL: Okay, I lost you a little bit

978
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.990
Dr Jameson: Oh, I was just saying I was just saying that

979
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:11.490
Dr Jameson: If you, you do not need to feel obligated to participate very much tomorrow if you'd rather just listen or you're not comfortable

980
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:26.490
Dr Jameson: No one will think anything if you say, I will. I'm not sure if I have anything to say to that or I'm not really comfortable, yet you know you. I'd rather wait a week I'd rather just listen. Today, you don't have to

981
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:33.690
Dr Jameson: You know, even if someone asks you a question. If you don't really want to answer it. If you're not comfortable, you can just say,

982
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:35.940
Pixel 3a XL: You know,

983
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:38.280
Dr Jameson: You don't have to answer some if you don't want to

984
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.180
Dr Jameson: Hopefully soon enough, you'll feel comfortable but but

985
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:54.750
Dr Jameson: We don't expect you to just jump in and necessary. Some people are fine. Some people are, you know, chit chatty talkers. Some people, not so much. And that's okay.

986
01:22:58.230 --> 01:22:58.560
Dr Jameson: Okay.

987
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:03.090
Pixel 3a XL: Yeah, really been been a big talker.

988
01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:14.730
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but you know, you still get plenty out of hearing what other people are having to say. And usually people find that there. Oh, like you know I exactly know what

989
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:18.240
Dr Jameson: What you're saying, you know, you just kind of get some some

990
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.560
Dr Jameson: Comfort for or, you know, just encouragement or

991
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:25.680
Dr Jameson: Validation, you know, like that.

992
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:28.200
Dr Jameson: I'm not the only one that things like this or

993
01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:44.280
Dr Jameson: And what somebody else. Well, this is how I was. And this is what I did or this is how I started thinking about it, or I started watching this blog or I use this app for meditation or I do this, that, you know, like you get ideas of, say, oh, maybe I should try that, too, and

994
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:48.060
Dr Jameson: So you can still get planning out of the

995
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:48.780
Listening issue.

996
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:55.530
But

997
01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:07.470
Dr Jameson: Hopefully we can tweak a few little things for you but sounds like mostly you've kind of figured out what where the problem is, at least, to a large extent, so

998
01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:13.680
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, can

999
01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:16.140
Pixel 3a XL: You go ahead. I

1000
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.240
Dr Jameson: Mean you haven't continued to drink.

1001
01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:25.890
Dr Jameson: And, and, you know, regularly and in great quantity and like you've identified that this is probably better

1002
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.230
Dr Jameson: Left on done right.

1003
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.290
Dr Jameson: So, I mean, I think you're you're already

1004
01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:36.150
Dr Jameson: well on your way. You know what I mean.

1005
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:37.620
Dr Jameson: Don't have

1006
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:41.520
Pixel 3a XL: I don't feel like drugs and alcohol.

1007
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:44.730
Pixel 3a XL: Or my problem.

1008
01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:46.860
Pixel 3a XL: You know,

1009
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:49.830
Dr Jameson: Well, because you're not using them right

1010
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.670
Dr Jameson: And I'm saying, like, you realize that you needed to stop.

1011
01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:55.620
Pixel 3a XL: Like

1012
01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:57.330
Pixel 3a XL: Start before that, you know,

1013
01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.700
Pixel 3a XL: Those are just like those were. I mean, or alcohol, you know,

1014
01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:03.780
Pixel 3a XL: Was just like

1015
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.340
Pixel 3a XL: A medication.

1016
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:06.810
Pixel 3a XL: I'll tell you, just like

1017
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:08.970
Pixel 3a XL: That's, yeah.

1018
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:30.930
Dr Jameson: That's usually true for just about every like Okay, somebody might have gotten prescriptions for opiates for some operation or something. But there's always some other factor that leads them to being unable to stop taking them like most other people do. So that's 100%. Yes, exactly.

1019
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:45.960
Dr Jameson: And and right so that's where we try to help people. And most of that a lot of that we do individually, because we don't need to talk about that in the group necessarily some minor, you know, broad strokes generalizations, maybe, but

1020
01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:56.790
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you don't want to get into the weeds. Right now, the group, probably. So that's where the counseling comes in. Have you, and you've never done counseling before ever like back in the day.

1021
01:25:56.970 --> 01:26:03.030
Pixel 3a XL: Um, I did on the last DUI got I think

1022
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:08.790
Pixel 3a XL: I did a few sessions, but nothing that

1023
01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.120
Pixel 3a XL: Lasted stuck was

1024
01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:12.690
Dr Jameson: Did it

1025
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:20.640
Dr Jameson: Help were at all, or was it just mandated or like what it's okay with whatever whatever you say it's fine. I'm just curious.

1026
01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:24.270
Pixel 3a XL: No, I don't think it really helps.

1027
01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:38.760
Dr Jameson: Well, sometimes the counselor wasn't very good. Sometimes they just, they're great counselor, but they don't really mesh with you. Sometimes you're not really in the right mind frame or mindset to kind of

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.030

Dr Jameson: He's not had any overdoses. He does have legal issues now.

1104
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:37.170
Dr Jameson: I don't. He didn't mention financial problems does feel guilty.

1105
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:44.190
Dr Jameson: So past medical physics I filled in.

1106
01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:51.420
Dr Jameson: I filled in his History fairly extensively review systems.

1107
01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.230
Dr Jameson: Some mild anxiety, but otherwise.

1108
01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:03.120
Dr Jameson: Sorry, I sort of forget what I was that I got suddenly interrupted.

1109
01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:12.090
Dr Jameson: Review systems, anxiety, but otherwise negative

1110
01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.880
Dr Jameson: Physical exam.

1111
01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:37.920
Dr Jameson: Mental Status and physical are both my normal template assessment.

1112
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:51.360

1113
01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:58.830
Dr Jameson: And then back up in the API somewhere. If you could

1114
01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:20.250
Dr Jameson: Audit score was 810 scored zero

1115
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.060
Dr Jameson: His

1116
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:29.730
Dr Jameson: PH q nine score was seven.

1117
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:33.570
Dr Jameson: And seven score was five.

1118
01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:40.290
Dr Jameson: So I guess the third assessment would be mild depression.

1119
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.250
Dr Jameson: And then plan.

1120
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:52.800

Dr Jameson: Period.

1122
01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:03.690
Dr Jameson: Comma, at least since his most recent DUI incident period.

1123
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:10.380
Dr Jameson: I do think you could benefit from some individual counseling, as well as group support.

1124
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:19.440
Dr Jameson: Period. We will. He will join our 8pm Tuesday evening groups going forward, period.

1125
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:25.200

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:35.190
Dr Jameson: Participation in na or a meetings for supplement further period. Number two.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:43.380

1128
01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:57.900
Dr Jameson: His employment and social relationships, period. He's not interested in medication, per se, period. He might benefit from a low dose SSRI.

1129
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:02.910
Dr Jameson: But at this point, we will focus on counseling.

1130
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:05.370
Dr Jameson: Period.

1131
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:11.010

Dr Jameson: I did.

1134
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:27.510
Dr Jameson: review briefly the various options for medication assisted treatment but patient is not

1135
01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:39.150
Dr Jameson: Interested in medication and given the fact that he's avoided alcohol use for months on end, I think.

1136
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.280
Dr Jameson: He does not necessarily it's not seem that he's a high risk.

1137
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:53.490
Dr Jameson: at high risk for the laps at this time period. This can always be revisited in the future period.

1140
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:22.380
Dr Jameson: schedule for individual counseling going forward.

1141
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:41.190
Dr Jameson: Previous records are not really relevant since he hasn't participated in any previous treatment programs and hasn't seen a primary care doctor many years and I guess that should go an epi as well. He's not

1142
01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.250
Dr Jameson: had participated. He's not

1143
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:51.300
