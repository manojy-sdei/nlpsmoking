iPhone: Yes. Okay.

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.290
Dawn Abriel: It usually doesn't take the whole hour, but I just like to make sure that we have enough time.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.470
Dawn Abriel: The next time.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.410
Dawn Abriel: You go on to zoom

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:37.020
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. After you enter the zoom ID number, you'll see a space where you can say I where it says iPhone.

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.930
Dawn Abriel: That's for you type in your name.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.030
iPhone: Okay.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.240
Dawn Abriel: Thank you can't do it right now. I

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.640
Dawn Abriel: Forgotten that your phone because when you come into group and you come into individual therapy. They need to see, it's you.

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.870
Dawn Abriel: And to give you credit for attending. So, um,

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.050
Dawn Abriel: After you're done with me, you'll be going back to the virtual clinic and

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
Dawn Abriel: So do it when you do change your name. When you do that, okay.

18
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.130
Dawn Abriel: Okay super.

19
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.080
Dawn Abriel: So,

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.480
Dawn Abriel: I, I kind of just have to haul through these questions because I have a commitment right after this.

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.260
Okay.

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.450
Dawn Abriel: I usually like to

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.530
Dawn Abriel: Get to know people a little bit, but that's not really possible today.

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.360
Dawn Abriel: Um, tell me the last time you did any opioid

25
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.130
iPhone: And last night.

26
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.800
Dawn Abriel: Okay, about what time

27
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.530
iPhone: 10 o'clock. Yeah, it was 711 30

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.690
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And have you done buprenorphine before

29
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.770
iPhone: Yeah, but not, it wasn't prescribed

30
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.730
Dawn Abriel: Okay, but you kind of have a feel for what what it takes for you to feel normal.

31
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.900
iPhone: Yeah.

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.550
Dawn Abriel: What was that

33
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.080
iPhone: And it took about five days, I guess.

34
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.490
Dawn Abriel: So how many you were taking like a half a strip an eight milligrams strip or

35
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:29.670
iPhone: Yeah, so I let's see. I'd usually take like a four milligram EES around 10 o'clock at night or right before bed and then I would take another one in the morning when I woke up.

36
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.050
And

37
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.240
iPhone: Yeah.

38
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.450
Dawn Abriel: The medicine is not meant to be taken that way.

39
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.550
Dawn Abriel: It's a very

40
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.320
Dawn Abriel: LONG ACTING medicine. So what you want to do is you have to give it a good 12 hours from the last time you used

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.860
Dawn Abriel: So,

42
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.170
Dawn Abriel: By the time we're dying and you get to the pharmacy, you should be in some withdrawal.

43
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:10.020
Dawn Abriel: Right and and when you're in withdrawal, then we know that you've got some empty receptors and we're not going to throw you into big withdrawal. If we give you the buprenorphine because the buprenorphine.

44
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:24.120
Dawn Abriel: Has a stronger ability to attach to the receptors than the short acting opioids. The buprenorphine WILL WILL KICK THE SHORT ACTING ones off your receptors and putting them into withdrawal so

45
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.560
Dawn Abriel: But

46
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.140
Dawn Abriel: What I'm going to want you to do is to take the four milligrams today and tomorrow. And I want you to notice how long the medicines lasting.

47
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.700
iPhone: Okay.

48
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.140
Dawn Abriel: Because

49
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.430
Dawn Abriel: You're going to want to take it once a day, you might end up needing six milligrams to last 24 hours.

50
00:03:48.030 --> 00:04:01.560
Dawn Abriel: Okay, we really don't know because you're right, it takes about two or three days before you get what we call the blood level, you get a full blood level up, and we know the middle sustain you for the 24 hours.

51
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.640
iPhone: Yeah, okay.

52
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.590
Dawn Abriel: All right, so

53
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.990
Dawn Abriel: About. So what did you use heroin, you did last night.

54
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.010
iPhone: Yes.

55
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.840
Dawn Abriel: And about how much

56
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.690
iPhone: Kind of a half grand

57
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.030
Dawn Abriel: Okay and so total for a day. What's usual for you.

58
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.120
iPhone: anywhere from one to two grams.

59
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.540
All right.

60
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.370
Dawn Abriel: And is this ID snorting, how do you do it.

61
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.160
iPhone: I smoke it and start it.

62
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.280
Dawn Abriel: Right. Have you ever used IV.

63
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.300
Never

64
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.210
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and you've noticed

65
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.050
Dawn Abriel: You've had to take more and more just to even stave off the withdrawal symptoms.

66
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.770
Yeah.

67
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.970
Dawn Abriel: And have you had an overdose.

68
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.870
No.

69
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.060
Dawn Abriel: That's wonderful. And any medical complications.

70
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.660
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and any legal issues related to your drug use.

71
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.500
No.

72
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.750
Dawn Abriel: Super

73
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:37.800
Dawn Abriel: Most people tell me that their, their day ends up being Centered around thinking about the drug finding the drug using the drug than thinking about it some more is that in your life.

74
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.040
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you first started using any illicit drug

75
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.080
Dawn Abriel: And was that marijuana

iPhone: And mushrooms.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.420
Mushrooms.

78
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.710
Dawn Abriel: I haven't heard of very many people starting with mushrooms you just sort of went for it then. Yeah.

79
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.950
iPhone: Yeah, and

80
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.520
Dawn Abriel: How old. How old were you when you first started using opioids.

81
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.230
iPhone: 18

82
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.020
Dawn Abriel: Has the drug use resulted in problems with relationships and work.

83
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.200
iPhone: Yes.

84
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.740
Dawn Abriel: And is bright heart health, your first program.

85
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.750
iPhone: As

86
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.790
Dawn Abriel: Well, let's hope it's your last

87
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.750
Yeah.

88
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.360
Dawn Abriel: And our sleep and anxiety issues for you.

89
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.070
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Now I know anxiety is because I just looked at your evaluation.

90
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:59.670
Dawn Abriel: And according to the survey that you did your depression score indicates that you should be hospitalized.

91
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.770
iPhone: Okay.

92
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.320
Dawn Abriel: Does that feel like it.

93
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.390
iPhone: Yeah, sometimes.

94
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.900
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so, you know,

95
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.800
Dawn Abriel: This is an amazing program. I've worked for other programs. I would never work for another one besides this one.

96
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.960
Dawn Abriel: And partly, it's because of

97
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:45.840
Dawn Abriel: The incredible services that are possible and the quality of therapy that you get with this program is really outstanding and the fact that the insurance pays for it. If you're thinking about this being a time in your life when you want to just be done with some old stuff.

98
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.540
Dawn Abriel: This, this is the place to do it.

99
00:07:48.960 --> 00:08:05.190
Dawn Abriel: I strongly recommend because, you know, especially in the beginning, you can go to therapy, two, three times a week and really get a handle on what it is. It feels so good about numbing out why. Why do you want to numb out

100
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.440
iPhone: Yeah.

101
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.990
Dawn Abriel: It's those kinds of issues that that they're kind of almost to the consciousness, but not really there yet and

102
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:35.340
Dawn Abriel: You know having that aha experience of oh yeah of course I would want to numb out i i don't like thinking about conflict or I don't like thinking about, you know, arguments. Anyway, I'm getting off the track. I'm just encouraging you to, you know, take full advantage of our program.

103
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.090
Dawn Abriel: So have you ever been hospitalized for mental health issue.

104
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.740
iPhone: No.

105
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.690
Dawn Abriel: And what would you say your stress level is right now.

106
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.420
Dawn Abriel: And your self esteem.

107
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.450
Dawn Abriel: At those two usually go together pretty well.

108
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:15.210
Dawn Abriel: I'm gonna ask you some medical problems now. So, stop me if any of them apply to you. Do you know what your blood type is

109
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.440
No.

110
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:29.250
Dawn Abriel: Have you had any head trauma any diseases of the eye, ear, nose or throat any breathing difficulties with asthma or bronchitis. It's long, long standing

111
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:51.390
Dawn Abriel: Bone joint or muscle diseases thyroid problems, diabetes, anemia, cancer, HIV sexually transmitted diseases or tested positive for tuberculosis any skin problems with new rashes, or new moles epilepsy seizure headaches. Migraines stroke.

112
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:07.590
Dawn Abriel: cirrhosis gallbladder disease heartburn hemorrhoids hepatitis ulcers hearing aids allergic chronic allergic problems dentures. You weren't born with a heart murmur.

113
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:19.860
Dawn Abriel: Or have high blood pressure or blood clots and your kidney and bladder and penis work the way they're supposed to. And were you ever diagnosed as bipolar.

114
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.140
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

115
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.890
Dawn Abriel: And the depression, when do you think the depression started

116
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.070
iPhone: I don't know. It's probably always been there.

117
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.960
Dawn Abriel: You were born with it.

118
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.680
iPhone: Yeah I don't you know probably teenage years. I probably noticed more

119
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.660
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. And did you

120
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.120
Dawn Abriel: Ever take medicine for it.

121
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.170
No.

122
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.910
Dawn Abriel: So here's the crazy thing Nathaniel.

123
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.320
Dawn Abriel: Opioids cause depression.

124
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:08.340
Dawn Abriel: Right. So when you start off with some depression and then the opioids make you not make serotonin. That's the drug that is attributed to low mood.

125
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.050
Dawn Abriel: As the

126
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:18.360
Dawn Abriel: buprenorphine or the opioids go up the serotonin goes down. So then it's even a bigger problem.

127
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:41.250
Dawn Abriel: So you will find that once you're at a really low dose of an opioid some of that depression will just naturally come off the combination of the therapy and getting low on the opioid will help a lot. Any you're not seeing or hearing things that other people don't know hallucinations.

128
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.970
Dawn Abriel: Know, and have you ever tried to commit suicide.

129
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.690
iPhone: Yeah.

130
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.330
Dawn Abriel: And do you have suicidal thoughts.

131
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.440
Dawn Abriel: Anything you have that I haven't asked you about

132
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:56.940
iPhone: No.

133
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.390
Dawn Abriel: Well, then we will move along.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:35.880
Dawn Abriel: Okay. I try not to let it, but when it does, what does it interfere with

321
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.100
iPhone: Yeah, I guess, personal relationships.

322
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.020
Dawn Abriel: Yep. There are some of the first things to go

323
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.740
Dawn Abriel: Your sleep disturbance is it getting to sleep or staying asleep.

324
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.350
iPhone: It's usually staying asleep.

325
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.990

326
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:22.950

328
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:38.370
Dawn Abriel: You know, people think, oh, it makes me drowsy out. I'll go to sleep, but it only lasts a real short time and then it just really screws it up.

329
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.030
Dawn Abriel: And any easy bruising.

330
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.820
iPhone: Not that I noticed

331
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.160

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.000
Dawn Abriel: Well, good.

337
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:13.800
Dawn Abriel: Now, this question is meant to rule out dementia and it sounds pretty silly. But I have to ask you, you

338
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:20.100
Dawn Abriel: Know you bathe yourself and dress yourself and go to the bathroom by yourself and you can get from one place to another.

339
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:31.380
Dawn Abriel: You know who you are, where you are. What time of the day and week it is you make your own decisions. You have a memory that's appropriate to your edge. You can focus your attention and you can read

340
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.300

341
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.930

410
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.570
Dawn Abriel: You're signing up for two hours a week.

411
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:51.780
Dawn Abriel: That's what the initial commitment is one hour of group one hour of individual therapy. So what we first need to do is figure out your work schedule so we can figure out a group, you can go to

412
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.210
iPhone: Okay.

413
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.070

414
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.460

415
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.740

Dawn Abriel: So,

419
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.860
Dawn Abriel: That means you need a night group unless

420
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:33.360
Dawn Abriel: We have a Tuesday at 7am it has the fewest number of people in it. I think you'd be a match for that. But if that doesn't let you get to work on time, then, that wouldn't work.

421
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.820
iPhone: How long our meetings, usually

422
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.110
Dawn Abriel: An hour one

423
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.880
iPhone: Okay, yeah, I don't know if that would work.

424
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:48.900
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and does your workplace, know that you have an addiction problem.
