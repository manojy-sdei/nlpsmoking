93
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.980
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Good job. So going back to the heroin use and the Suboxone um, when did you get started on heroin.

94
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.670
Chris Alliman MD: It was 2017 2017 and you said it was to kind of kick the math us right

95
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.660
Yeah.

96
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.250
Chris Alliman MD: And

97
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.920
Chris Alliman MD: When did you get started on math.

98
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.380
Jay: Oh god 2001

99
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.970
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and what brought you, how did you get into math. What was the intro for you.

100
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.310
Jay: Or France or okay

101
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.610
Chris Alliman MD: Wasn't a pain issue or depression issue. It was just friends were doing it.

102
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.850
Jay: I mean, I might have been self medicating

103
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.310
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, fair enough.

104
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.910
Chris Alliman MD: And when was the last time to use net

105
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.450
Jay: Two months. Okay.

106
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.670
Chris Alliman MD: How are you staying away from that. That's pretty awesome.

107
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:08.610
Jay: I'm trying to, I got my week card. I'm trying to get everything I can just so I don't because of cravings, or hell yeah it's, it's an everyday battle.

108
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:25.320
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So as we talked through this. I am going to get you a Suboxone prescription today just to kind of put your mind at ease, and we'll talk about how to go about that. Unfortunately, we don't have anything great for math right yeah

109
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.290
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that one's a struggle for a lot of people

110
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:36.660
Chris Alliman MD: The medication that we could potentially use however blocks the effectiveness of Suboxone so we can't use both of them.

111
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:46.560
Chris Alliman MD: So we're, we're, you know, scientists are working on coming up with something for method, but we don't have it yet. Okay. So there's that. Have you tried Suboxone at this point.

112
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.560
Jay: I have. I did something crazy.

113
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:58.080
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that's pretty common people give it a try, you know, or when they get out. They find somebody that has it may give it a try. What was your experience with the Suboxone and present in prison.

114
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.950
Jay: I'd rather do that than heroin amass

115
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:11.790
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, for sure. For sure. Did it often if you take it too soon after taking heroin or other short acting opiates, it can kick you into severe withdrawals. Did that happen.

116
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.250
Jay: Yeah, it happened to me the county jail.

117
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:23.910
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so, and we'll talk about this more at the end. But we have to wait to start the Suboxone until you're in moderate withdrawals already

118
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:36.120
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so that would be like feeling like you're sweating a little bit of stomach upset SOME OF THOSE RESTLESS LEG issues, little bit of anxiousness not to where it's full blown. That's not what we're after.

119
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:46.080
Chris Alliman MD: Right more when it's in the middle, what we what the literature says what research says is it typically takes about three days 72 hours to get to that point.

120
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.790
Chris Alliman MD: To moderate withdrawals.

121
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:55.500
Chris Alliman MD: But, you know, people are different and often have different experiences. Do you know how long it would take you to get into moderate withdrawals.

122
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.640
Jay: If it's only been a couple weeks that I've been doing it so it shouldn't be.

123
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.770
Jay: Okay, that's

124
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.790
Chris Alliman MD: Normally when you come off of it. Can you kind of think about when how long it took.

125
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.730
Jay: God just in between about three days, five days.

126
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.590
Chris Alliman MD: Somewhere around there. Yeah.

127
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:23.850
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Fair enough, fair enough. You'd mentioned that you tried to overdose. So it sounds like you've got had some emergency room visits at times because of the heroin use. All right.

128
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.780
Chris Alliman MD: Have you gone through rehab or through detox previously.

129
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.150
Jay: I've been to rehab. A couple of times. Never been to detox.

130
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.370
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And would you think of rehab.

131
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:45.480
Jay: Ah, I think all out for the money, personally, but they do have some, there's some programs and some people that

132
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.620
Jay: They can really touch base with you. Yeah.

133
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.730
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. So it sounds like maybe there was a little bit that you got out of it, but not

134
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.580
Yeah, not super, super much

135
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:05.340
Chris Alliman MD: And we've kind of beat around the bush. A little bit of this. But what's your reason for wanting to get off the heroin and the matter.

136
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.090
Jay: It's just destroyed my life and I just did nine years in prison because of it.

137
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.020
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

138
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.750
Jay: Well, I think that's a big enough reason

139
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.010
Jay: Oh, absolutely.

140
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.140
Jay: Seeing what it's done to my family. Once you're not me. Yeah, absolutely.

141
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.700

Jay: I live at my mom's house.

143
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:26.820
Okay.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.970
Jay: Yeah, she knows I'm trying to get help. Good.

147
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.750
Chris Alliman MD: Good. It's good to have that support and open with the people that you're around because they're, you know, it's so hard to try and hide this stuff, you know,

148
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.590
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah no absolutely are there other people that are supports.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:57.600
Okay.

153
00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.970
Chris Alliman MD: How old are they

154
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.730
Jay: Well, once for once tan.

155
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:17.070
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so more worried about the four year old but potentially the 10 year old. The reason I ask is because the residue that gets on your fingers or around your mouth from the Suboxone or is in the packaging from the Suboxone is enough.

156
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.520
Jay: Because

157
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:25.320
Chris Alliman MD: It can kill them. It can cause them to stop breathing. Basically, they would overdose on the residue right so

158
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.680
Chris Alliman MD: You need to keep it in a place where they're not gonna

159
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.910
Jay: She's in the back. Sorry. Hold on.

160
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.990
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, it's all

161
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.300
Jay: Back here.

162
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.580
Jay: I'm at my mom's work.

163
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.080
Jay: Okay, she has

164
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.890
Jay: I don't know where she's at

165
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.820
Jay: I'm sorry.

166
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.460
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, man. Take care of what you need to wear. All right.

167
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.310
Jay: I'm on a phone appointment.

168
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.340
Jay: And people are so rude.

169
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.790
Jay: Sorry about that.

170
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.070
Chris Alliman MD: So all right, sorry, things happen.

171
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.540
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so

172
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:19.530
Chris Alliman MD: We were talking about the kids and how they can overdose. So you need to keep the Suboxone in a really safe place apply

173
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:26.940
Chris Alliman MD: They shouldn't know where it is. We also send in the nerd can nasal spray were required by law to send that in

174
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:35.340
Chris Alliman MD: But you should have went around the house and your mom should know where it is. Your sister, everybody should know where that's at. God forbid something happens, right.

175
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:49.710
Chris Alliman MD: From the packaging when you're done with the Suboxone film for that day, you should throw it outside a place where the kids aren't going to get into it and you should make sure you wash off your mouth and wash your hands soap and water really well to get the residue gone

176
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:50.820
Jay: Okay.

177
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.470
Chris Alliman MD: That sounds good. Okay. Glenn.

178
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.940
Jay: Yeah, that'll work.

179
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.030
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, well what do you how do you spend the time it looks like you're at your mom's house are you working or you student

180
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.390
Jay: I just work all day. That's all we do is work and okay

181
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.250
Good.

182
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.430
Chris Alliman MD: And kind of an awkward question. Were you abused as a child.

183
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.020
Jay: No. Okay.

184
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.620
Chris Alliman MD: Good. We know that can play into addiction issues. So we just like to check to make sure

185
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.720
Jay: We where things are at that way.

186
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:25.260
Chris Alliman MD: It's got a bunch more questions that will work through here. Um, what do you know about our program.

187
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.620
Jay: Oh really, I don't know too much.

188
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.800
Jay: I just know that a buddy of mine went through, you guys. And it's really helped him.

189
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.830
Jay: Good. He's doing good.

190
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:49.470
Chris Alliman MD: Good. So basically, what we do is we have group meetings on zoom just like this once a week. And then we also have you do counseling once a week. So there are two meetings a week.

191
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:59.370
Chris Alliman MD: Now you're doing outside counseling and you're doing that frequently and that's great. What we would ask is that you meet once with our counselors to do the intake.

192
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.580
Chris Alliman MD: And kind of talk with them about what you're doing. The want to get records from your therapist, just to see what's going on.

193
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:15.060
Chris Alliman MD: And make sure that things are all good. I don't expect that we would have you following up all the time with our counselors and your counselor that just doesn't make sense.

194
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:15.990
Jay: Okay.

195
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:25.470
Chris Alliman MD: But we do want to have you do an intake, the way it generally works out is that we have you do when you come to group, you get a prescription

196
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:39.150
Chris Alliman MD: And usually, that's for about three or four days until generally a person comes back to their therapy appointment. Then I hear that they went to therapy and then I send in another prescription to get them back to group. So there's generally two prescriptions, a week.

197
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:40.740
Chris Alliman MD: We generally

198
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:49.170
Chris Alliman MD: Do this for the first 30 days to get a person invested in therapy. We found out that if we do once a week prescriptions. People don't go to therapy.

199
00:14:50.880 --> 00:15:04.020
Chris Alliman MD: And therapies really extremely important, right. So in your situation. We just have to work that out. Make sure that you're following up on things, but we can we can work it as we need to. That's totally fine. So

200
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.240
Jay: Good. All right.

201
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.080
Chris Alliman MD: I'm going to jump into another group of questions here.

202
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:21.150
Chris Alliman MD: These are just yes or no questions, thinking about when you've been using heroin and kind of the, the effects that it's had on your life. This can go back as, as long as you want to think with it.

203
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.390
Chris Alliman MD: If you don't understand the questions, let me know I can either repeat them or rephrase them for you.

204
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.350

Jay: I think so.

281
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.020
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so what I'm going to do is use my phone to time six seconds.

282
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:56.430
Chris Alliman MD: During that time, you're going to check your pulse and when we're done with I'll tell you when to start when to stop. And then you just tell me the number at the end of that six seconds.

291
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.340

Jay: Yeah, gotcha, gotcha.

313
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.980
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so

314
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:57.270
Chris Alliman MD: The next thing we have to do is figure out what group meeting time would work for you.

315
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.000
Jay: Morning better for me.

316
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.510
Chris Alliman MD: Mornings are better for you. What time in the morning is better for you.

317
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.120
Jay: I'm usually up by seven.

318
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:18.990
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so we've got a couple groups. Let me pull those up really quick, so I make sure I give you the right time. I have a Monday morning group said 9am. Is that too late for you.

319
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.730
Jay: Well, that'll work.

320
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.600
Okay.

321
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.600
Chris Alliman MD: I think that one would be a really good one.

322
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.700
Jay: Let me write that down.

323
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:34.320
Chris Alliman MD: I'm going to send you an email with this stuff in it. Also, so definitely write it down. Put it in your phone. This is when you get medication.

324
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.940
Jay: Okay, okay.

325
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:42.750
Chris Alliman MD: I'll send you a reminder email with my information and virtual clinic information. Yeah.

326
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.980
Jay: It's because it doesn't give me notifications on my email, can you do text.

327
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.960
Chris Alliman MD: And I'm going to send it here right after we're done.

328
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.000
Chris Alliman MD: So you can just go in and look at it.

329
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.750
Jay: Okay.

330
00:22:54.930 --> 00:23:11.550
Chris Alliman MD: I don't have a work phone. I've only got my personal phone on that. Um, so then you can you can look at the information you can certainly put it in your phone to get those reminders on your calendar, but I can tell you again. And so Monday mornings at 9am will be the group meeting.

331
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.500
Jay: One day, is it nine

332
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.850
Chris Alliman MD: Every Monday.

333
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.590
Chris Alliman MD: And it's an hour long

334
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.060
Jay: One hour.

335
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:31.530
Chris Alliman MD: Now before you get out of that there's a call. So what you do is you call to the virtual clinic, like you did today.

336
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:38.760
Chris Alliman MD: And then they'll give you the zoom room number and that changes every week. So you have to call in to the virtual clinic to get it.

337
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.970
Jay: So how do I call the virtual clinic. What's that number.

338
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:47.130
Chris Alliman MD: I will send that to you in the email. I don't have it memorized right off hand but it'll be in the email for you.

339
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:57.000
Chris Alliman MD: Sounds. Um, now the virtual clinic is just like calling the doctor's office or going in the front door. There's always align and there's always paperwork to do

340
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.210
Chris Alliman MD: also recommend that you call in 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time and go through that paperwork.

341
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.030
And then

342
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:16.200
Chris Alliman MD: Once they once we give them the zoom room number after you've checked in. They'll send that to you either by text or by email, so you'll be able to check in.

343
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.370
Okay.

344
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.790
Jay: Sounds good, good, good, good.

345
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:27.120
Chris Alliman MD: So we'll do the Mondays at 9am the therapist with that group. Her name is Gwen Gwen of your

346
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.570
Jay: Life just going

347
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.150
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, when will be fine. Okay.

348
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:46.860
Chris Alliman MD: She will be at those meetings with us and we do a very quick medical check in to see how people are doing. And then she leads a therapy session for the whole group, there's usually anywhere from like three to 10 people in the group.

349
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.500
Chris Alliman MD: And we were there at different stages of the recovery process and we work through things

350
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.950
Chris Alliman MD: Um, let's see.

351
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.390
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

352
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:09.000
Chris Alliman MD: We'll work that out you she will not be in touch with you before that group time you will meet her at that group time and talk about doing that intake that I talked about.

353
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.220
Jay: So she'll talk to you about that. Good.

354
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:18.750
Chris Alliman MD: So like I said, I'm going to get some medication sent in for you the nerve can the overdose nasal spray and then also

355
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:27.870
Chris Alliman MD: The Suboxone okay now when we have to kind of let me check your pharmacy here. What I've got listed

356
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.990
Chris Alliman MD: I have Walgreens on East 21st Street.

357
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.760
Jay: Yes, sir. Okay.

358
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.230
Chris Alliman MD: Good. So that's where I'm going to send this stuff to okay so

359
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:49.290
Chris Alliman MD: Then the nasal spray the Narcan I'm going to send in with like a bunch of refills, if you use it just go get another one. And you'll be so

360
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.110
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so I'll just make sure you've always got that around.

361
00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:04.050
Chris Alliman MD: The Suboxone we talked about how you have to wait until you're in moderate withdrawals to get that started. So that's going to be so if you took heroin today, then we're waiting for the rest of today.

362
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:10.740
Chris Alliman MD: Then, Saturday, Sunday, so probably sometime on Sunday, you're going to get started with the

363
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.010
Chris Alliman MD: Suboxone I'm going to send you some instructions on how to get started on it.

364
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:17.970
Jay: Okay.

365
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:26.160
Chris Alliman MD: And that'll be by email, but I'm going to talk through it with you also here so you understand it but then it'll be written down so you don't have to try and remember it.

366
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.180
Jay: OK.

367
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:34.650
Chris Alliman MD: So the way it goes is when you're in moderate withdrawals. You start with half of the eight milligram film.

368
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.090
Jay: Okay.

369
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.960
Chris Alliman MD: Well, let me make sure I'm getting that right because I think I'm confusing myself.

370
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.060
Jay: For one

371
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.840
Jay: Yeah, I want to double check that I'm telling you correctly.

372
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.510
Jay: Can I get it out to a day.

373
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.080
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, we'll get there. Hold on just a second.

374
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:12.180
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so you're going to actually the first film that you take when you're in modern withdrawals will be a whole film.

375
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.010
Chris Alliman MD: One whole film.

376
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.120
Chris Alliman MD: And then two to four hours later if you need to. You take half a film.

377
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:31.410
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and then two to four hours after that you take another half of film, if you need to. If you don't need to. Don't take it and if you can put it off, put it off. That's all right. That would be a total of two films on the first day.

378
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:45.480
Chris Alliman MD: The second day, you start with your total from the first day. So if you only took one film. The first day that's what you start with the second day, but that first day if you had to take two films. That's what you start with on the second day

379
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.970
Jay: Start with two

380
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.760
Chris Alliman MD: If that's what you took the first day. Yeah.

381
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:59.610
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and then half an hour later, you can take another half of the film, and then half an hour later, you can take another half of a film for

382
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.030
Jay: Three times right in the day.

383
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:12.270
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, but nothing beyond that. Okay. They day three, you start, you take what you took day to but there's no extra films.

384
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.700
Jay: No extra k, right.

385
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:27.870
Chris Alliman MD: So if you took only two of them on day two, then that's what you take day three. If you needed three on day two. That's what you take on day three. Okay. On day four, you go back to two films a day.

386
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:34.770
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and then we'll continue a continuous kind of at two films a day.

387
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.570
Chris Alliman MD: Or see where you're what you're needing and kind of work it from there.

388
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.220
Jay: Okay. Sounds good.

389
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:47.850
Chris Alliman MD: So the prescription is only going to be for four days. I'm going to send it in today for you so you can pick it up and then you get started.

390
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:58.110
Chris Alliman MD: When you're in that moderate withdrawals. If it's not till Sunday. That's great. If it's earlier than that. That's your judgment call. We just don't want to throw you into severe withdrawals.

391
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:05.310
Chris Alliman MD: OK. And then on Monday we'll kind of check in, see how you're doing and make some plans from there.

392
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.270
Jay: Okay.

393
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.270
Chris Alliman MD: And we'll bet check in will be during the group time

394
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.270
Jay: Okay, so the meds won't be ready till Sunday.

395
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.950
Chris Alliman MD: Know the meds. I'm going to send in today. So you can pick them up and have them ready for when you're ready.

396
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.980
Jay: Okay, but I shouldn't start it until Sunday. Okay.

397
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.000
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so I'm kind of qualifying that saying moderate withdrawals.

398
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.350
Jay: Right, okay.

399
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.290
Chris Alliman MD: So it sounds like that's probably going to be Monday.

400
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.250
Jay: Right.

401
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.920
Chris Alliman MD: But I'm leaving that open to you. Okay.

402
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.640
Jay: Sounds good.

403
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.620
Alright, so

404
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.050
Chris Alliman MD: That email with those instructions is coming to you right now.

405
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.840
Jay: Okay. Should I check it now.

406
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.410
Chris Alliman MD: If you want to. That's fine. And you can read through

407
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.810
Chris Alliman MD: It and I can walk you through it if need be.

408
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.610
Chris Alliman MD: If you just want to wait and you feel like you understand it. Well, that's fine too.

409
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.030
Jay: I just don't want to close this out and we lose a

410
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.920
Chris Alliman MD: Oh yeah, no, I got you on that I hear you. So, just leave it where it is. OK.

411
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:10.890
Chris Alliman MD: If you do have any questions or you don't understand things along the way the virtual clinic is definitely where you go. Okay.

412
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:21.060
Chris Alliman MD: I'm not readily available, but the people in the virtual clinic are available to be in touch with you to help answer the questions that you have.

413
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.430
Chris Alliman MD: So that's, that's where you go.

414
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.140
Jay: Okay. Sounds good.

415
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.870
Chris Alliman MD: Oops.

416
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.960
Chris Alliman MD: All right. What questions do you have

417
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.300
Jay: I'm really at the moment. I don't really have nothing.

418
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.010
Chris Alliman MD: It's often hard because I hit you with a lot of information at one time, you know,

419
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.560
Jay: Well, I mean, I've spent the last two months trying to get on this. And finally, it's like

420
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.080
Jay: You know, not funny start

421
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.240
Jay: making some changes.

422
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.590
Chris Alliman MD: You're there. That's awesome. I'm glad that we're able to help you out and get you taken care of, man.

423
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.960
Jay: Quicker than anybody.

424
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.020
Chris Alliman MD: And that's our goal is definitely

425
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.110
Jay: Will see in prison told me that I could go in any department of health. Oh.

426
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:07.830
Uh huh.

427
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.410
Jay: And that was a lie.

428
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.750
Jay: Oh really, yeah.

429
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.600
Jay: Go ahead. I went to the department health down here. And they looked at me like, like I was crazy.

430
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.530
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, are you doing probation or parole.

431
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.150
Jay: Yes, I'm on probation.

432
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:34.710
Chris Alliman MD: So I would recommend if you're willing that you mentioned, our organization to your parole officer, because I'm sure that they come up with the with these issues, all the time, right.

433
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.470
Jay: I'll definitely send them your way.

434
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:47.160
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that'd be really helpful. We're always looking for new patients to get folks involved and we we know that those first few weeks of getting out of prison. That's when people are at the highest risk of issues.

435
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.470
Jay: Of, well that's whenever I started again.

436
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:58.680
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, exactly. And we want to be there to into, you know, get you guys taken care of, right away. So if you can help your fellow folks out with that. That'd be awesome.

437
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.480
Jay: Right. Gotcha. I could do that.

438
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:11.700
Chris Alliman MD: Cool, man. All right. I also sent you another email just with all the information with the virtual clinic information when your group is my name. The therapist name, all that stuff.

439
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:12.690
Jay: Okay.

440
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.840
Chris Alliman MD: So make sure you take a look at at all of that. Okay.

441
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:16.890
Jay: Sounds good.

442
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:31.440
Chris Alliman MD: You've got the promethazine to help out with the nausea. That's good. You're going to avoid ibuprofen because of those issues that you have with it Tylenol with your liver. You should keep Tylenol under 2000 milligrams a day.

443
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.930
Chris Alliman MD: And take it, but not above that.

444
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.570
Jay: Yeah I don't take I don't take nothing

445
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.590
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I'm just, you know, as you get into these moderate withdrawals. I'm just

446
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.020
