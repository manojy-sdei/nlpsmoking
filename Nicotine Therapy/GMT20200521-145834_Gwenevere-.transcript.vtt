00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a little chattering teeth. I'm

2
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.240
Sorry. Oh.

3
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.930
Jen: No, we're

4
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Out a couple layers.

5
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:45.240
Jen: It's kind of that weird time of year where it's like hot enough here to need the cooler. But then when you use the cooler, it gets cold very fast. And so it's, yeah. I've been experiencing the same thing.

6
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, ours is

7
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The on air conditioning, right, because we're and everything's air conditioned

8
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600
Jen: And we have a seat. Thank God. So swamp cooler. Yeah.

9
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's set for

10
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

11
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A really low temperature and it's set. So every time I go and I like oh I want it up like 75 to warm up the house.

12
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.300
Jen: Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes right back down to 72

14
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.890
Jen: It just did someone schedule it for you.

15
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.750
Jen: Yeah. Oh, gotcha.

16
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I like it at night. I'm like,

17
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.010
Jen: Sure. You know, it's all coming I

18
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.820
Jen: Liked it. Yeah.

19
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.100
Jen: Yeah, my husband and call it, I call it

20
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.720
Jen: We need to be cold to be warm.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

22
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is this awkward moment where I'm going to open a note and

23
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, just aired

24
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Time that you know you could maybe be watching, but instead it feels awkward like Ron the phone.

25
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.810
Jen: Oh, no worries. I actually I'll go very awkward.

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.850
Jen: You so many of these now.

27
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.080
Jen: It doesn't faze me anymore.

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.790
Jen: Yeah.

29
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.420
Oh,

30
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I did another one of those all speak slowly because I have divided attention. I did a another one of those get together things. And I thought, Oh, I'll do a better job. A better job.

31
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.180
Jen: But

32
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A completely different group of people and I had a kid in there and had like

33
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A 19 year old.

34
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.380
Jen: Oh, interesting.

35
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it was intentional because she wants to host right because I'd like to have a Friday night where I can cut loose and and I

36
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.060
Jen: Lately,

37
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Be bossy, and yeah.

38
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But she, you know. So I said, Okay, we'll just, you know, kind of take notes or whatever.

39
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, the composition was so

40
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: clunky and so and so this one shares a video with Conan O'Brien or something. And I thought, Wow, my sense of humor is not the same as everybody

41
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.680
Jen: Yeah, no, I feel that often.

42
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't find what she shared funny, I was waiting for it to be funny because Conan did where he he blasted into a zoom meeting.

43
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was born, I was, I was like,

44
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.240
Jen: Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This is one

46
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.570
Jen: Boring. No, don't really. It's like this is our lives right now dude. I know what to you. But, like, a lot of us like

47
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.950
Jen: No. Yeah.

48
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I'm wanting so I you know I tried and did a couple of jokes or whatever. But then one. And once I did what I did before, which was

49
00:03:49.800 --> 00:04:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's focus on a topic, once I did that. Then again, we all were cohesive and we were able to focus, but I didn't want to do that. I mean, these were kind of like they were kind of family and I was like, and I really want to do that. But I had to, because there were crickets. It was awful.

50
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.490
Jen: That's so awful. Oh my god. Oh, I can't stand it when I get clients like

51
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

52
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.800
Jen: Have you ever had a client that came in and I've had a client that has come in and says, I say so. But what brings you here and they're just like, I just felt like it was time

53
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.450
Jen: And I'm like, Okay, so what's going on. And they're like nothing. I just felt like it was time

54
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.260
Jen: Said, I was like okay

55
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.000
Jen: Start when you were young. I don't know.

56
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how earlier I said it's this awkward moment. Right. Well, that's what I'm referring to that in face to face. I can sit with that silence.

57
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.980
Jen: Clinically,

58
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot more effectively.

59
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:08.970
Jen: Yes. No. Actually, it's interesting. I've been. I've been noticing. Um, I've been being more contemplative about trying to let the silence be because I feel the same. Yes.

60
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How long can you pull it off.

61
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:26.610
Jen: That's a good question. That's a good question. Well, I have this terribly irritating thing where, when a client says, I don't know, to a question I asked. I say that is ok we have 35 minutes left in this session. And you think about it as long as you want.

62
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

63
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.030
Jen: I just sit there and I'm like,

64
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.410
Jen: Mostly with my teens. They're adorable and they can't take it. They're just like, Okay, let's talk

65
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. I haven't been able to pull that off.

66
00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wonder if it has something to do with this particular organization. I don't know. You sure you're getting them. They these little evaluations and things like that. And I know I shouldn't care.

67
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.160
Jen: Oh, great. Hurt healthy mean

68
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're, they're just inconvenient for me when anyone puts a number that isn't fantastic. Then I gotta, I gotta here.

69
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.990
Jen: I gotta

70
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta get, you know, so anyway, and a lot of you guys, what you do is you just you straight, just put a number in your you're irritated with them. And so you don't know that.

71
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.950
Jen: People make them are right.

72
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: making a fuss. So, whatever. So I guess it's like

73
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Eventually I'll have to explain what that is to someone that doesn't get the clinical nature of the silence because the person that doesn't get the clinical nature of the silence is the one that's going to file a complaint.

74
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.790
Jen: Yep.

75
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's that same person. So it's like, Well, fuck it.

76
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.570
Jen: I got it.

77
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.400
Jen: I completely hear that I can hear about

78
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A poster and we'll talk about boundaries and will

79
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.310
Jen: Completely

80
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.400
Jen: Oh God, that's funny.

81
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're missing out. They miss out. And there is and I'm learning over time, all the pieces that huge ones around the somatic transformation work that i don't i don't really

82
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't really get to do i get i mean you got you can because you'll take my leads so well. But most people they can't

83
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do the body. I can't do the body work as well.

84
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.900
Jen: Yeah, no. That makes sense.

85
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That sucks. Anyway,

86
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you want to hear about you.

87
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.720
Jen: And me, me, me, me, me, me.

88
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, you, you, you.

89
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.440
Jen: Um,

90
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:55.830
Jen: I had I've had a hard week it was weird because, um, I took tomorrow off conclusively because I wanted to have a four day weekend, just chill out and then Tuesday, I believe it was, um,

91
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:05.490
Jen: I can't remember what I woke up and I did not feel well what's weird is that now that I'm thinking about. I can't remember what I didn't feel well about

92
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:17.700
Jen: But either way, yesterday, so basically I canceled my morning and then saw clients in the afternoon, yesterday I woke up with this intense headache at four in the morning.

93
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:31.350
Jen: And horrible nausea and so I managed to like take Advil for the head and then I was like, I went to the bathroom and I was positive. I was going to vomit. Like I was like it was like that water that's

94
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.560
Like

95
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:45.780
Jen: But then it passed. I did not grow up, but I felt not well. And so again I canceled my morning and then around two, I was fine. And so this morning.

96
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.910
Jen: I was ready.

97
00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:01.350
Jen: And so I put Dramamine and Advil, and water next to my bed, just in case. And I did wake up at 630 with a pretty intense headache.

98
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:15.840
Jen: But I took the Advil, and it disappeared and then I took a bath and then it was gone within 45 minutes. No, nausea, I'm feeling much better. So I did not have to cancel anything today. Um, but yeah, it was just weird. I think that

99
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.680
Jen: When my body feels not right.

100
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.740
Jen: Because of everything that's going on I automatically go I have beloved

101
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.340
Jen: Beloved 19 it's and I know that I do not

102
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:37.710
Jen: I but I think that that there's this like constant fear when anything feels wrong with my body. Yeah, and

103
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:54.390
Jen: So then I kind of freak out. But I feel like I'm learning. And so I feel like, even though it was a hard week I felt like I learned a little bit more about my body. I'm specifically I feel like I need to give myself time

104
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:04.020
Jen: In the morning to wake up and get going, as opposed to waking up not feeling well, assuming it's going to last forever and canceling my day.

105
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, I see it. Yeah.

106
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:20.790
Jen: And so, so this morning because I knew I had you at nine. And I was like, Honestly it's over 15 I almost text to do it was like I have a terrible migraine. I don't think I can do it, but I was like, No, I'm going to give it time

107
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.790
Jen: And he did and it passed.

108
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that

109
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.750
Jen: Is so important.

110
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.850
Jen: It was so cool, like the last

111
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.660
Jen: Group that we did a we could go Monday. Um, when you had me talk to, I want to say that call.

112
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:45.240
Jen: Um, and she was having pinging and I was talking about like turning in are leading into the pain.

113
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:56.040
Jen: And it's amazing how with the pain is different. You forget the strategies that you use for the other pain.

114
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.160
Jen: I don't know if that makes sense. But it was like

115
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:16.650
Jen: Yeah, like what the game is in my head that my leg legs like I got used to that. And so I understood. Like when I would happen. There were things I could do, and I knew that it would last forever. Whereas the risks were like new symptoms that I was not used to having and that threw me

116
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.700
Yep.

117
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How have your emotions been over the last week.

118
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: downs and

119
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.480
Jen: The ups and downs.

120
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.040
Jen: I would say that

121
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:57.030
Jen: There's something about works. It's really exhausting me right now. And so when I get to the weekends.

122
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.440
Jen: It can be hard to do anything.

123
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:16.470
Jen: Like I'm doing a lot of just like staying in bed and reading or like I've had a couple of I've had a couple of zoom sessions with other friends who play guitar. I told you this already that we swapped songs

124
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.780
Jen: And so

125
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sounds awesome.

126
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:35.250
Jen: Yeah, no, it's amazing. Especially if people haven't seen in a really long time. I'm in person. Um, so I feel like I've done that and that like wipes me. I feel like I've been very productive, but it also like seems just

127
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.820
Jen: Take a lot

128
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:47.040
Jen: And I was feeling that before all of this happened, I would. I don't know if I've talked to you about feeling like I have person fatigue.

129
00:12:50.340 --> 00:13:03.480
Jen: Like I so I really, I wanted to make a little card that I could. So basically, I'll be in a conversation with someone and it could be my best friend. And in the middle of it. I just want to start, I just want to walk away.

130
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha

131
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:24.840
Jen: I want to stop listening. I just want to walk away. And so I wanted to create a card that said that I could give someone before I walk away that says, I apologize if what just happened seemed rude. I am suffering from person fatigue and need to take care of myself.

132
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.960
Jen: I have not done this, but I'm

133
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.930
Jen: And you really

134
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to get the nature of you and that that fits. And that wouldn't be a surprise. Right.

135
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.990
Jen: Absolutely, yes.

136
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Great your friends. Yeah.

137
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:54.300
Jen: I didn't get they're probably some of them who would be like okay, it might be a little like snippy at all, but none of them would drop me if you say, if you will.

138
00:13:54.510 --> 00:14:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. All right. What's the difference between person fatigue. I do need education. This is a genuine question.

139
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.080
Jen: It's not really

140
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.180
Jen: And and I made it up so that makes sense.

141
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the difference between that and the compassion fatigue that sense of just consistently having to feel what other people are feeling

142
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And

143
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What's sort of distinguishing those two. What's the difference

144
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:33.660
Jen: Maybe it is compassion fatigue that I am talking about. I guess that the reason that I put person on it.

145
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:45.510
Jen: Is because sometimes it's during its during a completely banal conversation where I don't need to happen to any compassion.

146
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let me ask you about right there.

147
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.420
Jen: Please, yeah.

148
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.320
So,

149
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder

150
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever get exhausted from being on as in charming intelligent and entertaining. Do you ever get tired of that.

151
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.140
Jen: I did and I do still sometimes I think I've gotten better about

152
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.500
Jen: Putting up boundaries for myself.

153
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.040
Jen: And making sure that there are that

154
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.790
Jen: Like I don't feel compelled or responsible to do it anymore.

155
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.260
Jen: But I definitely do feel it at certain times.

156
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That one, that sort of you said banal moment with even a friend.

157
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't use that word very often. So is that where it's not. No one's angry. No one's crying. There's really no intense thing going on.

158
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious, um,

159
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What's another word that maybe I'd be more familiar with, like, what's the emotion. You're having

160
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When that's going on. I mean, I'll look it up to, so I can ask you

161
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.040
Jen: Know, I think that um

162
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.000
Jen: You sound a bit been all sort of like

163
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.710
Jen: Every day, run of the mill like yeah like very like

164
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.600
Jen: Looking for another word to describe it. Like I'm

165
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: trite hackneyed cliched planning to tennis. Oh, dude. That's a word. That's amazing. That's so

166
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.780
Jen: Tunis. I love that.

167
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, that's a platitude. And it's platitudinous. Oh. How fun is that

168
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.750
Jen: Why I'm so excited.

169
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

170
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:50.640
Jen: Know we platitudinous banal would be a great band's name, it would be productive. But, I mean, it would be

171
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.770
Jen: Redundant redundant. Thank you. And like, what's the other retail worth

172
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what

173
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's a use this in a synonym.

174
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.460
vapid

175
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:04.590
Jen: Go.

176
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.120
Jen: So go

177
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And what

178
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:16.920
Jen: Why was just realizing I think that's actually the purity of conversations that is triggering

179
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We just got it. So I was wondering about that. So I had wondered if it was that you were bored.

180
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.170
Not

181
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.340
Jen: Yes, and I think that the boredom leads me. Oh.

182
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.200
Jen: Oh, I feel sick of it leads me to anger.

183
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: My time with this and I still want to be your friend. But you're. This is a waste of my time.

184
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:52.410
Jen: Yes, yes. And I'm like, in this day and age and everything we're dealing with and everything right now. Like, I don't care. Talk about this. I don't care who Jennifer Aniston is eating.

185
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, hell.

186
00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:01.050
Jen: Oh, like no interest. I don't care. Like, who got a boob job and who did again like

187
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.060
Jen: This is like

188
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.400
Jen: Completely vapid

189
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Oh.

190
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.210
Jen: Totally. That's it.

191
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:20.430
Jen: Because yeah, honestly, like when a friend or even someone I barely know comes to me and they are not okay. That feels way easier to deal with.

192
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what to do when the person you love

193
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is shallow

194
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.400
Jen: Yeah.

195
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.510
Totally

196
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.970
Jen: Uh, yeah.

197
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:41.880
Jen: Well, and it's funny because I feel like it actually is happening with my best friend that I feel like it's just, resulting in us not really hanging out anymore.

198
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:52.470
Jen: Because it's just uncomfortable. And also, I just end up coming away from this situation just not happy and feeling irritated and yeah

199
00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Something just struck me and this may have zero relevance, but it might be a fun place to just sort of counter counter point maybe volleying just maybe it's so different. It'll be interesting. I recognize what we're talking about right now as how your, your sweetheart views. People sometimes

200
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.110
Jen: Yeah.

201
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was all of a sudden I just kind of remember that. And I thought, How interesting. You're in that position now.

202
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.030
Yeah.

203
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.410
Jen: Hmm.

204
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So in

205
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like since there.

206
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have an option to address it directly with a friend.

207
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to use a card and is that friend going to get that card. Are they going to get it. Is that going to work with that friend right, kind of, is that going to be the one that's going to go. Okay. Yay.

208
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.480
Jen: Yes. You know, I think that if I were to use the card with that friend.

209
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.770
Jen: It would be a pretty big deal.

210
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Member how I was telling you it's the same person that I

211
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Have this silence. With that, I need you to silence the one that would end up saying this therapist sucks.

212
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.020
Jen: Right.

213
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of like that. It's like

214
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Every person that

215
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of kind of needs it.

216
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But instead what kicks into gear is

217
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to waste my time.

218
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.870
Jen: Right.

219
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can play with that.

220
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of doesn't have to be a big sort of confrontation.

221
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if if is it kind of discussed that.

222
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes it possible to bridge.

223
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. Yeah.

224
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.900
Jen: It is little yeah

225
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.040
Hmm.

226
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.580
Jen: I think about it. I think that I could

227
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.770
Jen: Have the very least, change the subject, and she would be receptive to it.

228
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, very least change the subject.

229
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.040
Jen: May I tell you that when you said that

230
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.460
Jen: clients have said that you're, you're a bad therapist or they have given you bad marks.

231
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.470
Jen: You've made me feel really good.

232
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.210
Jen: Only because I think that you are a brilliant therapist.

233
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.990
Jen: And I think that everything that happened with my prior employer.

234
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:43.020
Jen: It like it's been hard to let go of a little bit like I'm doing good. You know, I'm two months out, I'm making more money than I've ever made in my life, my boss is phenomenal.

235
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:57.930
Jen: She actually sent me an email asking if I could just go through my client database and make sure that all of the insurance was entered correctly and blah, blah. And she was like, I'll add two hours of where did you say

236
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Straight of time.

237
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:11.010
Jen: Thank you. You're so good. You know what I mean to your check and it literally took me like 15 minutes and it and she was like, because I really appreciate you doing that and

238
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:20.130
Jen: Just feeling appreciated and just like every week to two weeks. I have another client from the past.

239
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:30.210
Jen: Who reaches out and is like, hey, I'd like to start again. And so it's kind of nice because like I haven't had to do any ad marketing or anything, because I'm just constantly full I've got a waiting list.

240
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:48.570
Jen: And so I know that, like, I know. So I do good work. I think that there was something about when in one of the texts exchanges, we had the very end, in which he said, I've never known a therapist who had as many problems with their clients as you

241
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

242
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.480
Jen: And I know that you was trying to hurt me.

243
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.150
Jen: Know that that's what that was about.

244
00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:10.200
Jen: Because I don't think that that's true. Um, I think that we work in a fields where sometimes people are upset and sometimes we become the receptacle for their anger.

245
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And hearing that someone that you respect. Right. It sounds like you respect the work you and I are doing. Yeah. And then to hear that. Like even she gets bad marks like yeah, that was a bolster that felt good.

246
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:43.080
Jen: What which makes me feel bad because I don't want you to fail, feel it, but but just but also because like I can tell that, or at least I would assume it seems like you don't let it bring you down as far as thinking that you're a bad therapist as a results and

247
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You. Yeah.

248
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.620
Jen: But that's what it's about. But yeah.

249
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm glad.

250
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad.

251
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.940
Jen: I appreciate it.

252
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

253
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The. Do you want to know more about how I overcome it.

254
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.350
Yes, please.

255
00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So receptacle isn't what I use. You know that word, we end up being a receptacle. I am a very intentional.

256
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe in transference 100%

257
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a thing.

258
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I use it intentionally I introduce it I name it. I say it's happening. I'm not like kind of coy about it. Um,

259
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:40.410
Jen: And like if a client because starts becoming combative like with you or you can tell that they're not into it. You say, I feel like you

260
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:48.270
Jen: Are directing this towards me when you're actually upset with someone else, or is it even something that you can

261
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I be a little, a little

262
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.360
Jen: Okay, you just said that.

263
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy there that I not coin, I would be

264
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If I think if I said it like that. They would say, Oh, you're going to psychoanalyze know it's you don't don't blame it on my friggin mother. I think I wouldn't be able to get away with that some people

265
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would want to see ghosts and tonic. But most people if they're doing that if the transference is happening. They're going to be very defensive and so I will quite be able to pull that off. But I might do an intervention that is the repair work as that person that originally wounded them.

266
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because now when I say intentional what that looks like is the first time I need someone and presenting with if I get a chance at first assessment.

267
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The bio psychosocial I don't have much time. Yeah. Zero time. But if I can very early on, it's very likely, given the the wounding that you've experienced that may play out in here, you're probably going to get really mad at me.

268
00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And

269
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might be justified I I'll make a mistake, and I'll screw up because I am human. I'm going to drop the ball promise you I'm human, and going to fail.

270
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But

271
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little different in here because no matter what, I'm not going to make it about me.

272
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So in here that anger will play out differently. And I encourage you to do it.

273
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I encourage you to risk being angry at me. But the difference is is that I'm not going to defend my position as long or as much as I am going to be interested

274
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: In how it feels for you and what coping skills you have available to you in the moment and what it's like in here to be telling me about that anger and how you're hanging on to yourself. That's what I mean. So

275
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Audit

276
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.350
Wow. That's phenomenal.

277
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's a lot of work, because I haven't yet.

278
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.430
Jen: Yeah no absolutely yeah

279
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.120
Jen: Yeah.

280
00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll see it now and again, you'll see it in group, people will get angry with me and and very disappointed me but I'm expecting it. So,

281
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:18.240
Jen: Absolutely, yeah. Well, it was interesting because I you actually said something to me during session at one point where I was talking about the him bribing for reviews and we were talking about reviews in general and you were like,

282
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:25.920
Jen: Why, what, why do I need reviews for myself. I like, you know, if I yell at people all day or something like that.

283
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:27.330
Jen: And if

284
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody cry. Why would I want

285
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.250
Jen: Right. Right. Exactly. And, um, and that made me feel good as well because I cannot be

286
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.470
Jen: I find that I am different therapists for different individuals.

287
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, I'm on I'm unrecognizable from from 8am. If you met me as I was for for my ATM client, you'd have left the session.

288
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.570
Jen: Oh,

289
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I wouldn't want me

290
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.270
Yes.

291
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like, oh, I want my money back.

292
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure pitch.

293
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.260
Jen: But does it work for them.

294
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know what's funny is this individual has said, yeah, the you're the only person that is honest with me and a lot of counselors and everybody else gives me bullshit and you're the only one that shoots it straight. So yeah, and

295
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm very uncomfortable with it.

296
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I have

297
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: warm and fuzzy warm and fuzzy warm and fuzzy

298
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. But me, I want

299
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.430
Jen: Yeah.

300
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't for everyone so

301
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:57.600
Jen: Absolutely. Yeah. And I think that that's what is actually kind of cool about our job is that like I get to use like different skills from my own even like personality.

302
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.240
Jen: Depending on the plan.

303
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:01.680
Yeah.

304
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.000
Jen: And I am. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

305
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In a lot of ways.

306
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, some of our sessions sort of zero in on a bit of a supervision role like almost like it shifts back and forth from there.

307
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.420
Jen: I apologize. I hope I don't do that too.

308
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's okay. Our this particular job is, you're, you're the product. So it's not it's not the same as I've got the sales pitch and I've got this PowerPoint and it's this widget.

309
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:37.380
Jen: Right.

310
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a widget so

311
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:41.970
Jen: Yeah.

312
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.410
Jen: You. Yeah.

313
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.010
Jen: It's weird. I've been thinking about my mother a lot lately.

314
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

315
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.010
Jen: Um, the anniversary of her death is coming up in July.

316
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:12.930
Jen: And and it'll be 16 years in July, and it has gotten much easier. In fact, like the past few years, my brother and I will forget it. Sometimes I will call each other on like July 10 and be like, Oh my God, we forgot

317
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:19.290
Jen: To like do something like drink a Diet Pepsi and Bourbon link, she did, um,

318
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.840
Jen: Hold the Bourbon, but um

319
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.950
Jen: Yeah, uh, I feel like

320
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:44.010
Jen: What was it. Oh, it was Mother's Day. I'm all, what was it that made me think of her. Um, and so, Mother's Day, it's just always everyone posting their moms or what have you, which is great, which I love, I love that for people

321
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:53.760
Jen: Um, but this year and I haven't done this before, but I posted a picture of my mother from where I was born.

322
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.860
Jen: When she and my dad moved down here from Florida and uh

323
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:06.540
Jen: Oh, no, no. I was born. So this must have been in Florida. Okay, so, but my mother's just looks

324
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.640
Jen: Happy

325
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:18.270
Jen: Which was not something I I remember my mother being very often when I as I grew up and

326
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:26.190
Jen: I put something like, you know, this was my mother before I was born, um,

327
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:32.220
Jen: I, I still miss her. And I still just wish I could have one damn conversation.

328
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:33.660
Jen: Like

329
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.330
Jen: I think that's what sucks when people die suddenly

330
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:45.780
Jen: Is that you don't get that. I also can't imagine how it would feel to watch someone die very slowly. Like, I think that that would be awful do

331
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.650
Jen: I don't think there any good ways to deal with somebody love dying, but

332
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.210
Jen: Yeah, and I think I think I just

333
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.540
Jen: I was not very kind to her in her last year's

334
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:04.470
Oh,

335
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.120
Jen: Because she needed a lot. And I'm sorry. Is it okay if I go here, is it

336
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, listen to

337
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of asking permission about your own therapy.

338
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.600
Jen: I know that I do.

339
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing,

340
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.050
Jen: I don't know.

341
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Have taker, you are in your taker right now. So just take, take, take, take, take

342
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.720
Jen: She had rheumatoid arthritis fibromyalgia.

343
00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:00.180
Jen: Other various things she was taking she introduced me to oxy a

344
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:09.960
Jen: Not on purpose and give it to me. I just stole it from her, but she would she took 80 milligram oxy four times a day.

345
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:11.370
Oh,

346
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.490
Jen: Yeah, it was such an intense dosage.

347
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.080
Jen: Um,

348
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.000
Jen: And

349
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:28.380
Jen: She just always needed things she always needed us to go to the grocery and get things done.

350
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.050
Jen: She like

351
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.430
Jen: Drink like a fish smoked like a chimney.

352
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:56.220
Jen: Was on so many of these medications and it was frustrating sometimes because my brother and I would just be like, you're not doing anything to try to get better. Like, I know that your RA hurts. But like even like she lived in an apartment complex that had a pool.

353
00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.350
Jen: And like I would even just

354
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:10.410
Jen: encourage her to just we could go together and just like move in the pool little and it was just, she just wouldn't and she was just this teeny tiny LIKE IT MAY SEE A BIRD of a woman.

355
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.870
Jen: When she died and

356
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:22.230
Jen: Because she just like lived on diet coke and fat free cheese and fat free Turkey like that was really all the gap no water.

357
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.570
Jen: All right, and

358
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:27.780
Jen: I think for

359
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:41.430
Jen: If I had to do over again. I just feel like it would have showed her more kindness and work race. Oh, because I was in my 20s, that I didn't want to deal with her.

360
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:51.930
Jen: I wanted to go have fun with my friends, I wanted to go create theater. I wanted to go to school of work and I was doing that and because you know in your 20s going to work and

361
00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:03.060
Jen: And have and being in schools like fucking nightmare. You know, it's like you're working all the time. You're not making much money you're trying to make the work and then I'm having to deal with my mom and

362
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:09.870
Jen: Yeah. And so there was this woman who lived down the hall from hurting Andy, who was just so annoying.

363
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:21.630
Jen: And she was gone, she was even worse than my mom is far as constantly being crisis comes, everything is always happening to her, you know, it's always everyone else's fault.

364
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:38.520
Jen: And after my mom died I owe a bottle of her bills went missing. And I knew that Andy had a key. And so I went to her door. And I was like, I need the pills that you talk. And she said, I didn't take any but I was like okay, I need the key.

365
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:48.180
Jen: And she was like, okay, is she came back and gave it to me and she said, your mother always said that you were the scariest person she knew

366
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

367
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:59.880
Jen: And my mother also before she died told me that there were times that I reminded her of her mother who is horribly emotionally abusive as she said

368
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:09.120
Jen: And I realized that, like, what happened was I began to find my backbone.

369
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:27.750
Jen: And I began to use it and I began to, you know, I would say to her, I was like, Mom, there are actually people who have it worse than you like and things like that. And, but, but to her that was horribly treacherous

370
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.120
Jen: Trader us

371
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:44.310
Jen: It. I was being a traitor, by, by saying that to her, and that's how it felt all the time going up. If we ever called attention to anything that she did that might be unhealthy that we were the bad person, because we made her feel bad.

372
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.770
Jen: The more I saw it, the more I started to call it out and

373
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:23.430
Jen: The more I saw her spirit shift in that it was like she didn't feel safe around me anymore.

374
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.080
Jen: Because I feel like we used to have sort of a

375
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:46.920
Jen: Very strong bond as I was growing up, because she was always on my side about everything. When you say that I'd be like, I think I had told you that I went to her and I was like I ate all of this sausage and I ate an entire box of snack while cookies and she was just like, that's

376
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.390
Jen: At least, at least you didn't need a bunch of potato chips.

377
00:37:51.930 --> 00:38:06.780
Jen: And while it was like so kind like I look back on that now and I'm like oh my god I was begging for help. I was like, I am over eating I'm bingeing and I don't know why. And it doesn't seem like like it's healthy.

378
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.360
Jen: And she was just like you're okay, you're okay because she she was believing

379
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.240
Jen: Which I did not know until she was dead, but

380
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But she's accessing in a lot of areas, so it's okay okay because it has to be okay okay because she's doing the same thing. So

381
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Making decisions that a piece right the self soothing versus a parenting opportunity.

382
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.560
Yeah.

383
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.450
Jen: Totally

384
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.320
Jen: So,

385
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:45.420
Jen: So yeah, I think I had a lot of baggage with her. By the time she was really say.

386
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.220
Jen: And

387
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.980
Jen: I mean, to this day, like I feel like it's better that she died.

388
00:38:54.750 --> 00:39:01.740
Jen: Like I love her and I missed her and I miss you know, not being able to have that last conversation with her, but

389
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:09.450
Jen: Like even my brother and I were talking about like how having to deal with her with all of this going on, would have been a goddamn night.

390
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, who

391
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been perpetually the worst children that don't love her and

392
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.010
Jen: Oh, yeah.

393
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: No way, you can hit the mark that kind of thing.

394
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:30.030
Jen: Absolutely. Well, and she would want her specific food if she could get her specific food as many of us can't these days. It's like, you know,

395
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.490
Jen: You go to the grocery store, you hope for the best.

396
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Chicken. Oh, like there's no chicken last week there was a shift on a chicken and there was

397
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.330
Jen: A i.

398
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I supposed to stockpile.

399
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.150
So,

400
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.820
Jen: Totally

401
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.850
Jen: Oh, so yeah.

402
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The conversation.

403
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: anniversary is coming up in July. Yeah.

404
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have a sense of wishing you were kind

405
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're explaining

406
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That you you were growing up.

407
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.480
Jen: Yeah.

408
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what 20 year olds to we're supposed to be all wrapped up in play and hard work and industry and I'm

409
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Such a job to take care of her.

410
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.160
Totally

411
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:30.210
Jen: Yeah.

412
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.060
Jen: Truth is, is that

413
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.790
Jen: When I really think about it, look back I did take care of her.

414
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:50.190
Jen: I didn't take care for the way that she wanted me to all the time and I didn't take care of her baby as much as she wanted to, but I did take care of her.

415
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you gave her some honesty. It's the piece you needed to call out poor health behavior.

416
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It was quite on welcomed, but I mean that's the thing you needed

417
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.630
Jen: Yes, yeah.

418
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.400
Yeah.

419
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is there a sense of wanting to still although she's not alive still have that conversation, either with your

420
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Father with your brother with me with a letter with husband with Sarah.

421
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There a sense of wanting

422
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:34.980
Jen: Yes, I wanted to do something ceremonial or ritualistic or something.

423
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:36.870
Jen: Okay, just here.

424
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

425
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, isn't the most creative, but just the brainstorm a plan in place to depart from

426
00:41:49.320 --> 00:42:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been talking with people about this idea of having gathering and everyone bringing a little object that sort of represents

427
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationship with her, or how they've impacted her been impacted by her and that there be this candle making experience and those pieces are embedded in there.

428
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's a favorite sense, maybe there's a favorite color of hers, or something that just kind of really makes tangible. What is just

429
00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: In memory and metaphor, but really making it this tangible thing and then that becomes the ceremony that it gets real it and reviewed and that is kept in some precious on somewhere.

430
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm wondering if there's something that you would want to read or say in that ceremony. I wonder

431
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:48.240
Jen: Yeah, I think I want to sing a song by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

432
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, is

433
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.790
Jen: Or either that or Judy Collins. She was very into both of them. Okay.

434
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.720
Jen: Or maybe Joan Baez but I think. Yeah.

435
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.100
Jen: They all remind me of her

436
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's left over of

437
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Course I wanted to have been more kind, but then when you hear yourself you can hear. I was

438
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.700
Yeah.

439
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:33.930
Jen: Well, it kind of brings me back to this whole idea and I work with clients on this every day and I work with myself on it every day as far as not being responsible for other people's feelings.

440
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:35.610
Jen: I'm

441
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:44.670
Jen: To a point, obviously, you know, if you go up and you're like yeah, shit. Like, you know, people are allowed to feel upset and be like, that was a nice um

442
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:59.640
Jen: But, but when you don't give someone the answer that they want feeling like you're responsible for their pain because they don't get the cupcake you want because you're like, No, it's my cupcake like

443
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.950
Jen: And I feel like

444
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:11.100
Jen: With my mother, she kind of instilled that in us and it took a while to break that away.

445
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:19.050
Jen: And not feel responsible for other people's feelings at least to the degree that I did.

446
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see why you're sharing that with me.

447
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:38.040
Jen: I'm not sure i guess i i guess it seemed like it circled back to

448
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.960
Jen: Something that I feel like keeps coming up for me like

449
00:44:48.780 --> 00:45:03.690
Jen: Symbolically, like recently over the last week or two that that the idea and then just connecting it back to my mother and realizing like understanding how it started. They're

450
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to take on

451
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else's experience.

452
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:29.640
Jen: Yeah, or just basically like having to be very careful with what you say or how you say your truth or if you say your truth because if it's something that someone else doesn't want to hear. Then you have who did them and you're a bad person.

453
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious, this conversation.

454
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If you could only say one thing somehow

455
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The heavens, and whatever is universe whatever opened up and you could squeak out one thing, what would it be

456
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.830
Jen: Just one word or

457
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: One sentence, let's say, what would it be

458
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.760
Jen: Oh, just one sentence.

459
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.050
Jen: Thank you for doing the best that you could

460
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:28.740
Jen: I guess. Yeah. Like, I guess, like if I if I only have

461
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.390
Jen: One sentence. It's just that quick.

462
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So of course, that's not a conversation, right, because I took away the listener.

463
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I took away that its reciprocal.

464
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.290
Right.

465
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I I wonder if you had two sentences. What's the second one.

466
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.410
Jen: I think maybe that would be the second one. But the first one would be

467
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:26.340
Jen: Mom, I feel like your selfishness really hurt me growing up.

468
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.360
Jen: But I love you for doing your best, there we go.

469
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the full thought it has the duality in. It kind of felt like there was some some opposite piece missing, right.

470
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, thank you for doing your best wasn't enough.

471
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.150
Jen: Yeah, no. Totally.

472
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.700
Jen: Well, isn't that funny that I felt the need to take care of her, and she's dead.

473
00:47:55.350 --> 00:48:02.010
Jen: Because I was really, I was just like, Oh, well, I only have one sentence. I don't want to leave her with something need she's our

474
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.470
Jen: That seems me but yeah

475
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.170
Jen: I think that was what was sort of stopping me from it at first.

476
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, how dare you, you know, like once again.

477
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting

478
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

479
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But this

480
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This other part. You know, I wish I was kinder, but I'm glad she's dead. Those opposites exist. So I had wondered if you would kind of put them both in there.

481
00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:37.560
Jen: Yeah.

482
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry that she couldn't hold that duality for you as we grew up, it would have been really convenient if she could see my 20 year old.

483
00:48:54.300 --> 00:49:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure herself out and play and be wrong, and right and screw up and get

484
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.220
Broken a

485
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Crash and Burn just the whole deal and find out where those limits are on her own, and not be busy taking care me why I am sorry that didn't happen earlier, you know,

486
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's it's a real thing. You know, like it's it's got some beauty in it, you know. And I wonder if that's how

487
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How you kind of have come to, I want to sing. You know, I want to sing in the ceremony that

488
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that that's maybe often where you meet and make contact with your clients to is in that struggle that because you've had that struggle, you know the struggle. Yeah, no, not on a deeply personal level.

489
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:53.760
Yeah.

490
00:49:54.930 --> 00:50:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So those songs that you were thinking of singing or they are the words relevant or is it just, this is music that I grew up with her and it brings me close to her.

491
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:10.770
Jen: Definitely music that I grew up with her, and brings me closer

492
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.240
Yeah yeah

493
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's with this moments that we have left turn inward for reflection.

494
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: See what charge is left and where

495
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is that in the body.

496
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But might still have a vibration left that

497
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little wiggling or

498
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Unsettled nervous.

499
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe some excitement

500
00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe there's relief. Maybe there's a calming

501
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tune in and see what messages from

502
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness.

503
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.040
Jen: I feel

504
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.800
Jen: Lighter

505
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.020
Lighter

506
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:35.370
Jen: I felt really heaviness it we tested my arms, which was new.

507
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.660
Jen: And now it sort of feels like my arms are hollow

508
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

509
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:42.870
Jen: Like they just feel

510
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.990
Jen: Easier to move

511
00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now looking to the future with this these arms that are easier to move now looking to the future in July, and that this

512
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is remembered that there might even be some ceremony to it. Some intentional stuff.

513
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How the arms doing

514
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.760
Jen: You feel good.

515
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.910
Jen: The chest. Very good.

516
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:28.680
Jen: Yeah, that was the idea of it feels very freeing like it makes me feel like I'm like running through a field not touching the ground.

517
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

518
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is that

519
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Need for conversation now maybe a level of intensity before, is it the same intensity. Where's that out.

520
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.740
Jen: If the intensity is lessons.

521
00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.970
Jen: I think that I just needed to talk it out.

522
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:16.230
Jen: It's sort of like it was there. And that was, as far as I got because I didn't really have the time or the interest in going deeper. Um, but now that I've gone deeper, I realized that

523
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.070
Jen: There isn't really a conversation that I need to have with her.

524
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:24.810
Jen: Is

525
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of doing conversation within maybe the thing that didn't quite happen with her can be done inside of you, you know, maybe that inner dialogue, making it. Okay.

526
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.280
Jen: Well, I think it already is. Yeah.

527
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.370
Jen: It's funny because uh her

528
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:56.460
Jen: She has this cousin named fish be I sh, which I just love

529
00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:02.700
Jen: That her name is fish. Um, but, uh, she has been such a lovely

530
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:18.600
Jen: Contact for me. Um, she reached out after my mother died, and we've kept in close contact. She sent me a bunch a bunch of stuff that was my grandfather's and um but she she said to be

531
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:26.070
Jen: I'm super Facebook friends so she sees all like the political stuff I post and i'm i'm pretty out there.

532
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:31.020
Jen: And she was like your mom would be so proud of you.

533
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

534
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.820
Jen: It was over. It was over. I was just like,

535
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:52.500
Jen: Almost the exact same age, and like, and she was just like you fight for justice and you're an artist and you help people every day and you're just amazing. And just like filled me with love.

536
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.840
Jen: It was really cool.

537
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm a big fan.

538
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:57.990
Totally

539
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.000
Jen: She my Bish

540
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I was about to say. But there's so much comedy with that name. It's really, it's

541
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.470
I think

542
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.990
Jen: She's old enough, it's just

543
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun. Is this like this face.

544
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: resting bitch face like there's so much material there. I wouldn't know what to do.

545
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.300
Jen: Oh, one so we got

546
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This and so she's older like 16 or

547
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.010
Jen: She's almost 70

548
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:28.170
Jen: Yeah.

549
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

550
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.330
Jen: All right. Okay.

551
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that. And I love that.

552
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:36.390
Jen: You to

553
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You sent that message, right. That's exactly, that's exactly what this needed

554
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there was a lot touching on that very concept. I'm

555
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Really glad what happened.

556
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.150
Jen: Yeah, me too. Just

557
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Soak it up. Yeah.

558
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And

559
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you want to play with that right all of this that you did in here today, you know, this duality this conversation and then being WITH someone trite someone vapid right being around that.

560
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And who you become when you're around it. Yeah, and has the dialogue stopped when you're around what happens to you how familiar, is that right like that just sounded a lot like right you just, it's an either or, and almost wanting to get out of who you are in that moment.

561
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: With the same stuff. You just did here today. You know, you could do with this.

562
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This person.

563
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a thinker.

564
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:50.910
Jen: I like it.

565
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I like your hair, too, by the way.

566
00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.440
Jen: Thank you.

567
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Off.

568
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.950
Totally

569
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.530
Jen: took a bath and washed it and put it up. I feel like a brand new woman.

570
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So shall we schedule an appointment.

571
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:16.350
Jen: Yes, and I would actually I'd like to try three weeks out if you feel okay with that.

572
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so that's what the nature won't be for us, it will be June 11 11th.

573
