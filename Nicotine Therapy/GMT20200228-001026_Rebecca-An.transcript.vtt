Matt Huss III: We

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.610
Matt Huss III: Were

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
Matt Huss III: Not much different than last week.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.650
Matt Huss III: Really, I'm

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.170
Matt Huss III: Just

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.950
Matt Huss III: School

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.740
Matt Huss III: Home writing papers and then going to sleep.

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.560
Matt Huss III: Basically all my, that's what my life consists of

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.540
Matt Huss III: Which sucks.

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.640
Matt Huss III: But

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.710
Matt Huss III: There's some

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.620
Matt Huss III: Oh, I'm

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.630
Matt Huss III: Where

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.960
Matt Huss III: I'm hoping

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.670
Matt Huss III: That

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.460
Matt Huss III: Apparently were selling my dad selling this house a lot sooner than I thought.

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.010
Matt Huss III: And we're gonna go back to Florida where my son and daughter still are.

24
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
Matt Huss III: And I'll plan on continuing school and then 10 doing this program and everything.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.030
Matt Huss III: And going into an A meetings and stuff as well.

26
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.520
Matt Huss III: And I might want to ask you, I can just bring this you and keep on seeing you even there, right.

27
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I believe so. I believe so. I think that we are

28
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Licensed in Florida. I'm gonna have to find out.

29
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.690
Matt Huss III: My doctor said he wasn't able to prescribe anything in Florida. So I'm gonna switch doctors but

30
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.630
Matt Huss III: He didn't know anything about. Yeah.

31
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.680
Matt Huss III: This there'd be no reason why this program doesn't work in Florida. Right.

32
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if we are credentialed in that state and approved it. Are you planning on weight is your insurance. What's your insurance.

33
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.990
Matt Huss III: It's Medicaid Blue Cross Blue Shield.

34
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So would it be covered in Florida, would it be the same. It would actually switch right to a policy out of Florida.

35
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, yes. So

36
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We need to find out if we're credentialed in that state whether or not

37
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right heart can practice in that state. That's what it's all about.

38
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I'll have to find that out.

39
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let you know about it.

40
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so when is this, when are you when is this happening.

41
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.260
Matt Huss III: Um,

42
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.040
Matt Huss III: We're, we're not quite sure about timeframe, because we don't know how fast the House will sell

43
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.580
Matt Huss III: He but we're hoping

44
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.830
Matt Huss III: To be there some point this summer.

45
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:45.480
Matt Huss III: And then I will, you know, go to a university in Florida by next semester instead of it. But if we're not there by the start of next semester. Semester after summer.

46
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.810
Matt Huss III: The Fall semester than I guess we would have to stay here until December.

47
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.940
Matt Huss III: So hopefully it's during the summer. But we'll see.

48
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I'll find out my supervisors out of town right now, but I'll find out when she comes back, whether or not we are able to

49
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work with Florida insurance and out of Florida. I know we do in Ohio. So I know that there are a few states on the east coast that we are working, working with so

50
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll find out that information.

51
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And did you have a conversation with your roommate.

52
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.110
Matt Huss III: Roommate

53
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.700
Matt Huss III: Somewhat. Um, it didn't get as

54
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.890
Matt Huss III: Deep

55
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.200
Matt Huss III: As what we talked about as I would have liked to but

56
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.360
Matt Huss III: We did talk about

57
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.080
Matt Huss III: Some of the financial aid from this semester that I just got, um, and

58
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.400
Matt Huss III: I'm gonna you know it. I got

59
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.620
Matt Huss III: It. We talked about it. And there's a there's a bunch of the month of that money that I'm going to be able to probably save

60
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.780
Matt Huss III: To get a car.

61
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.130
Matt Huss III: Eventually when

62
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.380
Matt Huss III: Well, if we're in Florida. I'll probably buy a motorcycle because there's no insurance so won't be as expensive but um

63
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.200
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

64
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.340
Matt Huss III: You know, I need a new computer for school.

65
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.110
Matt Huss III: But

66
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.310
Matt Huss III: Yeah, we talked about it yeah I you know i don't i don't really get it because

67
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.040
Matt Huss III: You know, he knows I need a computer and I need a car.

68
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.670
Matt Huss III: And it just

69
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.950
Matt Huss III: Doesn't

70
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.660
Matt Huss III: It's like, it doesn't matter. You know, Sam.

71
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was it that you that you did find out about it.

72
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did he showed you the breakdown and where he felt that you owed him.

73
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.710
No.

74
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, that's, that's what I mean I'm there's

75
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.780
Matt Huss III: A bunch of the money.

76
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.870
Matt Huss III: That I still need to find out, you know,

77
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.810
Matt Huss III: How much I do or

78
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.980
Matt Huss III: He thinks I O or, um,

79
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:50.400
Matt Huss III: But at least there's some I found out about like half of the financial aid, where

80
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.980
Matt Huss III: You know, there was like

81
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.820
Matt Huss III: $300 I owed for the trip to Texas.

82
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.590
Matt Huss III: And

83
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.760
Matt Huss III: And then I got

84
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.030
Matt Huss III: Back.

85
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.850
Matt Huss III: About $1,000 not back but

86
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.310
Matt Huss III: Yeah, back, basically. But the other

87
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.630
Matt Huss III: 3000 or so I need to figure out, you know,

88
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.630
Matt Huss III: Yeah, like I said, it didn't get as detailed

89
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.640
Matt Huss III: Basically

90
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.830
Matt Huss III: About 1000 of it.

91
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.710
Matt Huss III: I found I got

92
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.820
Matt Huss III: I figured out, but

93
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.900
Matt Huss III: He is. He is offering to

94
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:09.060
Matt Huss III: When we do move we are getting a three bedroom apartment so that my daughter that I have full time by myself.

95
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.460
Matt Huss III: Well, I did all our life before I came here to go to school and to get clean

96
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.090
Matt Huss III: To move in with us.

97
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.620
Matt Huss III: Um, and then offered to let me stay there for six months for free until I could

98
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:35.130
Matt Huss III: Get a job and income and, you know, things like that.

99
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.630
Matt Huss III: So that was generous.

100
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.690
Matt Huss III: But

101
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.060
Matt Huss III: If I had the money that I've

102
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.830
Matt Huss III: All this money that's gone to him over some many like a year.

103
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:12.720
Matt Huss III: Um, I'd have enough to you know get my own place with my daughter. Yeah.

104
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

105
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.220
Matt Huss III: Which I just thought about

106
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.960
Matt Huss III: So,

107
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.810
Matt Huss III: It's kind of

108
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.940
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and it's kind of like

109
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:36.480
Matt Huss III: He didn't. He's like, making sure that I felt this way long time because he's tried to convince me every time I've because I've tried to go back to Florida myself for a couple times and

110
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:45.270
Matt Huss III: He. It's like he and I wasn't able to yet just for other reasons. But, um, it's like he tried to convince me

111
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.860
Matt Huss III: He was all he would always try like it felt like he was trying to convince me to stay like he needed

112
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.980
Matt Huss III: My income, you know,

113
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.000
Yeah.

114
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.930
Matt Huss III: It was it felt like that before. Um,

115
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.600
Matt Huss III: I don't know if that's the case.

116
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.590
Matt Huss III: Or not, but

117
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.760
Matt Huss III: So that that might be why

118
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.620
Matt Huss III: He's

119
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.950
Matt Huss III: Making it so that

120
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.380
Matt Huss III: It's not just me going back to Florida and

121
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:42.510
Matt Huss III: You know this is going to you know make sure that I'm with staying with him that this new apartment or whatever that we're getting

122
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any wants some kind of clarity of monthly expenses and so that you have a clear picture. You know what I mean.

123
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.590
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Yeah, I definitely plan on

124
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.540
Matt Huss III: You know, like when we get there and

125
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:23.370
Matt Huss III: It's like, you know, I'm going to be financially completely. That's it for me. I'm not giving anything they haven't told on tour to pay back or whatever, it's just going to be my port whatever we make as

126
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.230
Matt Huss III: A range as my portion of the red and the utilities.

127
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.420
Matt Huss III: And

128
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.040
Matt Huss III: That actually

129
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:39.630
Matt Huss III: Might

130
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.080
Matt Huss III: Work out pretty well.

131
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.970
Matt Huss III: Kind of like a fresh start, you know,

132
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.330
Matt Huss III: What and I'm looking forward to the move a lot

133
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.330
Matt Huss III: Back to my kids.

134
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.200
Matt Huss III: Which has been really hard to stay away this long.

135
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.100
Yeah.

136
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.580
Matt Huss III: It was, you know, it's they I know that it's

137
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.860
Matt Huss III: A the right thing and the

138
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.760
Matt Huss III: best outcome for everyone in the long run, but they don't understand that.

139
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:22.650
You know,

140
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.020
Matt Huss III: My daughter is old enough to know

141
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.500
Matt Huss III: What it's really going on. And you know, when I came out here and stuff and

142
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.530
Matt Huss III: Which sucks but

143
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.300
Matt Huss III: My son's like call me. He lives with my ex wife, but I'm supposed to have them every weekend and all summer long and

144
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:59.880
Matt Huss III: He's always asking me, um, you know, when you coming home. Are you still living with PA or whatever you call them.

145
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:09.120
Matt Huss III: Is probably any is probably wondering why I even moved out here. To begin with, you know,

146
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.880
Matt Huss III: But at five.

147
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:24.510
Matt Huss III: Which is, I think it's still okay because I don't remember anything from when I'm five when I was five years old. So I'm, I'm thinking I'm I hope

148
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.600
Matt Huss III: I think I have the chance to not emotionally trauma or damage him like I have my daughter, you know,

149
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.470
Matt Huss III: Like I'm sure she's, she's definitely got some emotional

150
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.420
Matt Huss III: Issues.

151
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How old is your daughter.

152
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.660
Matt Huss III: Now,

153
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.490
15 yeah

154
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.980
So,

155
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.990
Matt Huss III: Me and her still really, really close, you know,

156
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:09.510
Matt Huss III: She's always asking when I'll be back. And, you know, looking forward to live in with me again.

157
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.380
Matt Huss III: So that's good but I'm

158
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.860
Like

159
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.770
Matt Huss III: It scares me because it's at her age as well. Now, you started

160
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:34.470
Matt Huss III: I'm doing stupid things and getting in trouble and experimenting with drugs and girls and

161
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.500
Matt Huss III: Like I I wasn't even I was. I wasn't even a virgin at her age and so

162
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.440
Matt Huss III: She said she still is. But

163
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.250
Matt Huss III: Who knows, you know,

164
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You talk to her.

165
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He talked to her regularly.

166
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.550
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

167
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:09.570
Matt Huss III: There's sometimes a few days ago by where I'm just so wrapped up in

168
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.610
Matt Huss III: In my head that I just I just totally forgot to call, but I'm

169
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.460
Matt Huss III: Pretty good about that.

170
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It happened, that's for sure.

171
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:39.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, as long as you have, you know, consistent relationship with her and she knows you know you're out here, you are going to school, you're

172
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, getting your life together so that you can go back and be the best dad that you could possibly be. You know what I mean. That's all that matters.

173
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.740
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah. She um

174
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.680
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm hoping. So she's she she hasn't had a mother.

175
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.530
Matt Huss III: Her mother left when she was like three and then was like

176
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:14.640
Matt Huss III: And then she had a mother figure when I married my ex wife, but then she disappeared. I'm not in the same way.

177
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.020
Matt Huss III: But still,

178
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:26.550
Matt Huss III: And so I was the only one that was consistently with her, you know, and living with her, you know, for 14 years until I came here.

179
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.180
Matt Huss III: So I think she's she knows

180
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.150
Matt Huss III: That you know i'm not i'm coming back. I'm not gone. You know, I'm not going anywhere.

181
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.140
Yeah.

182
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But who she's saying, without their

183
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.620
My mother.

184
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.960
Matt Huss III: And her boyfriend.

185
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.040
Matt Huss III: And so she's, she's in a good

186
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.320
Matt Huss III: Home.

187
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.130
Matt Huss III: In a good environment, but

188
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.250
Matt Huss III: My mom.

189
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:17.400
Matt Huss III: Uh, let me get let me do anything I wanted you don't basically she like I didn't. I was never disciplined in my entire life.

190
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.710
Matt Huss III: Until I was arrested and charged and went to jail as an adult, you know, at 18

191
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.910
So,

192
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.210
Matt Huss III: Um,

193
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.120
Matt Huss III: That's what worries me that you know

194
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.180
Matt Huss III: Dust is not getting

195
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.900
Matt Huss III: It. Yeah. And, well, I grew up without a father figure because I'm

196
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.950
Matt Huss III: Even my stepfather who

197
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.770
Matt Huss III: You know, raised me

198
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:59.640
Matt Huss III: He was gone, traveling all the time first business was never around but I heard it's more important for daughter.

199
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.240
Matt Huss III: To have a father figure than

200
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.240
Matt Huss III: A guy, a boy.

201
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.580
Matt Huss III: So,

202
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, you know, definitely. I don't know.

203
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is more important, but I know it's important that you're

204
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There, you know that you're available, whether it be by phone, whether it be in person, whatever that they keep that contact with you, you know, no matter what.

205
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, back in. Back in the day, that's just how it was, you know,

206
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dads were gone, and they were working all the time, or they're traveling because of work and, you know, and, you know, the kids had to be with the, the person at home. I mean, it's just part of, you know, part of life.

207
00:18:53.070 --> 00:19:07.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's going to be a big adjustment after you know having this year to get your life together and engaging in school and you know getting you know your life back on track to go back and be a full time parent

208
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Add that to your plate.

209
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.910
You know,

210
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.330
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I realized that

211
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.780
Matt Huss III: When I went

212
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:26.430
Matt Huss III: For Christmas when I went to visit them and the first weekend that I was there.

213
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:43.740
Matt Huss III: This is not a problem. She's my daughter, she's really easygoing laid back and very easy to, you know, we get along so well we hang out and, you know, easy to take care of. But then I had my son for the first weekend.

214
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.610
Matt Huss III: And that like by the end of the weekend I was

215
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.580
Matt Huss III: Just mentally

216
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.340
Matt Huss III: Exhausted, and

217
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Completely

218
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.310
Matt Huss III: Out what it was like.

219
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

220
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.430
Matt Huss III: A little bit, yeah.

221
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are lot

222
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is

223
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, you know, really devising a plan before you go to be able to

224
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get back in and be adjusted. You know what I mean, be secure be adjusted have clarity with expectations on financial stuff with your roommate. You know what I mean.

225
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have clarity on visitation, you know, with your five year old so that you don't become so overwhelmed that turns you right back to the road that you're getting away from you know

226
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's okay. If you take time, you know, for you because you need to you need to put yourself first, you need to put recover your recovery first

227
00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your health. First, those things need to be the priority because everything else benefits when you do that when you put everything else first

228
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It all goes to crap you know when you're not focusing on that core and that core, meaning you

229
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.980
Matt Huss III: I've had that experience many, many times every time because I've gotten clean

230
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.410
Matt Huss III: once in my life for a few years.

231
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.860
Matt Huss III: This time it's Feels Like the First Time for some reason.

232
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.530
Matt Huss III: But

233
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.260
Matt Huss III: I've been, you know, clean, like for a few months, a bunch times

234
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.540
Matt Huss III: And I'll take on school and or work, or both, and parenting and

235
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.730
Matt Huss III: And that yeah and

236
00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.200
Matt Huss III: And I ended up relapsing because I feel like I'm

237
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.380
Matt Huss III: I thought yeah because of that. I don't take care of myself, I end up

238
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:15.300
Matt Huss III: Getting depressed again and my anxiety and the mental aspect of the

239
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.990
Matt Huss III: Withdrawal symptoms is what kills

240
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.650
Matt Huss III: Me every time.

241
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sir, definitely. That's why it's important that you have things set in place clarity on what you know the expectations. Why

242
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you start out slow with, you know, especially with your five year old, you want to start out slow like having him.

243
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: During the daytime for, you know, a couple weeks starting out and not having full weekends, because you're going to be in a new place, you're going to be

244
00:22:50.520 --> 00:23:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, you might consider doing that with your daughter for a little bit to, you know, allowing her to come and get adjusted to the new environment with you. And you know what I mean. Instead of just walking in and have everything like right on top of you. And then you're like,

245
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.830
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

246
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.370
Matt Huss III: That's that's happened. Um, yeah.

247
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.900
Matt Huss III: My ex wife will not let that she will not work with me.

248
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.720
Matt Huss III: It's

249
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.400
Matt Huss III: You know,

250
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.160
Matt Huss III: She's spiteful it's it's weird. It's like

251
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.410
Matt Huss III: She's the reason we got divorced, but it's like

252
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:48.630
Matt Huss III: But I'm the civil one and the, you know, and the one that tries to work with her and compromise and stuff. And she's the Spikeball one and the one that you know does things just to

253
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.020
Matt Huss III: You know, make my life.

254
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.580
Matt Huss III: Harder miserable or

255
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.150
No.

256
00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:16.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is strange, but it's not because I'm, you know, people become resentful. They get frustrated and if she's able to push those buttons on you. She will if she's able to to get what she wants. By acting that way toward you.

257
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She will

258
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that's just, you know, the way that relationship you know exes work you know setting clear boundaries on your expectations asking her to

259
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what it is that she expects in the beginning when you first come back and really having a game plan together so that you guys both know

260
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What it's going to be like when he first. You know, when you go back for the first, you know, three to six months.

261
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got to, and this is where, you know, this is what gets tough because you know you you need to set those healthy boundaries for yourself.

262
00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need to know that you need to come first, you need to know that your recovery comes first, because without that you lose everything else.

263
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're, you just take 20 steps back. And so, you know, being able to say I you know my plan is to be there. I want to be a participant. I want to, you know, but I need to do it in a do it slowly to where I'm not overwhelmed and I don't go back to what I just got out of, you know,

264
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.080
Matt Huss III: She, she doesn't understand because

265
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.970
Matt Huss III: We actually met the reason we met.

266
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:44.310
Matt Huss III: At a university in Florida. We're both going to the same school and we met, and we were both in fairly early recovery actually

267
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.320
Matt Huss III: Which is a problem which

268
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.370
Matt Huss III: You know, apparently is a problem which I didn't learn till later on but

269
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.520
Matt Huss III: You know, so

270
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:07.290
Matt Huss III: And we stayed clean for a few years and then create them came out and we didn't know what it was. And that's what got us back into using and

271
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.350
Matt Huss III: What happened was,

272
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:17.280
Matt Huss III: We it took years and years for the cradle to to

273
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.760
Matt Huss III: Kind of ruin our lives, you know,

274
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:36.270
Matt Huss III: Yeah, um, whereas opiates will do it in like a day, you know, but, um, anyways, so we got to this point where I was so like I was depressed.

275
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:43.440
Matt Huss III: And she became just this totally different person just a complete like

276
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.810
Matt Huss III: She just like

277
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:57.240
Matt Huss III: All of a sudden, she was. She went from like this laid back very cool, you know, easy going down to earth person and then all of a sudden it was like

278
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:08.460
Matt Huss III: Everything pissed her off. And she was so she had to make me pissed off about everything and and she always mad and always, I don't know what happened but

279
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:21.120
Matt Huss III: So, so that, in turn, made me depressed and when I get depressed and anxious I shut down. And so that, in turn, made her worse and anyways.

280
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.420
Matt Huss III: So I

281
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:34.170
Matt Huss III: Said to I agreed to leave the house we had together for a certain amount of time to get clean

282
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:41.700
Matt Huss III: And I like basically locked myself and rented this like trailer basically go, I want to Lowe's

283
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.840
Matt Huss III: Home trailers, you know,

284
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.310
Matt Huss III: Just for myself and locked myself in there and got clean off the cranium and then when I was done.

285
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.510
Matt Huss III: She was supposed to go. And I would stay home with the kids.

286
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.920
Matt Huss III: So I go I get clean

287
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.720
Matt Huss III: And

288
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.920
Matt Huss III: I get back. And, you know, she doesn't want me back in the house. You know, I'm figuring

289
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.790
Matt Huss III: You know she was never actually planning on going.

290
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.740
Matt Huss III: Taking she didn't actually ever want to get a clean you know herself.

291
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:29.880
Matt Huss III: So she never went and tried, and I never even went back to her after that, I don't think, I don't think I lived with her at all after that.

292
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.070
Matt Huss III: So,

293
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.060
Matt Huss III: Anyways, the reason I'm saying that is because so so she's actually still on the cradle.

294
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.500
Matt Huss III: Yeah, um,

295
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:59.280
Matt Huss III: So she she fits. She thinks she's clean, you know, she feels like she's living a normal life and taking care of things. And I guess because she takes

296
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:15.930
Matt Huss III: A small enough amount where it doesn't ruin her life, but she she she bought. She has a bachelor's in economics and could have gone further but got a bartending job.

297
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.190
Matt Huss III: And, you know, she makes crazy, crazy money.

298
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.580
Matt Huss III: Because it's like the only bar in this like redneck

299
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.560
Matt Huss III: Town in the middle of the woods in Florida, you know,

300
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.510
Matt Huss III: And she brings home like 800 bucks on a week Friday night, you know, in cash and

301
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.380
Matt Huss III: But she's still living with her mom.

302
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:43.980
Matt Huss III: And grandmother

303
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.800
Matt Huss III: And so

304
00:29:48.510 --> 00:30:03.630
Matt Huss III: She doesn't see that she could have you know her own place her on, you know, have a real life if she wasn't on it, but because she's on it. She's just, you know, just barely getting by.

305
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

306
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.950
Matt Huss III: But she sees that as normal and fine and okay so it's like I'm always the one

307
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:20.880
Matt Huss III: I'm the messed up one because I'm relying on people to, you know, survive and live and you know

308
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.910
Matt Huss III: But because she

309
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.800
Matt Huss III: Has money and is able

310
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.950
Matt Huss III: Then, you know, I don't know.

311
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just a vicious cycle in it.

312
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.070
Yeah.

313
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.620
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so she she she doesn't know.

314
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:56.250
Matt Huss III: What it's like, I don't think she remembers what it was like when we first met when we were because I don't think I don't think she's, she's ever been truly clean like

315
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:11.280
Matt Huss III: Like I've never been until now really or that one. Yeah. And I don't even even then I think maybe I was on Suboxone or and and Xanax

316
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.090
Matt Huss III: And then

317
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.370
Matt Huss III: The Cray dumb.

318
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.230
Matt Huss III: After that, honestly, so

319
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:32.370
Matt Huss III: Like this is the first time that my brain is it's still messed up. I mean, but there's

320
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.470
Matt Huss III: Nothing in it.

321
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.990
Matt Huss III: It's it

322
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.010
Matt Huss III: I don't know how to explain this like

323
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.970
Matt Huss III: I don't think I've ever been.

324
00:31:46.920 --> 00:32:03.540
Matt Huss III: Clean and straight minded like this since I was 13 years old. Mm hmm. You know, because I've never made it past four to six months clean except for that one time and even that time. You know, I don't know if I was really

325
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:09.090
Matt Huss III: Trying like I wasn't going to therapy. I wasn't doing the meetings I wasn't

326
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:17.130
Matt Huss III: I was still partying. I think every once in a while, I would probably use something, you know, with her.

327
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.060
Matt Huss III: But because it wasn't opiates. It was okay, you know, that kind of thing.

328
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.720
Yeah.

329
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:37.920
Matt Huss III: And I don't think she's ever felt this way and doesn't know what it is to be actually clean and how hard it is to feel this way.

330
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.810
Matt Huss III: She only knows

331
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:59.970
Matt Huss III: And I remember that creative being on it after like five or six years of taking it everyday. It made you mad at everything always at everyone like very irritable, for some reason.

332
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:08.790
Matt Huss III: Which opiates never did that. But there's the cradle. It did that it changed. Both of us it we became like

333
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.610
Matt Huss III: Different people and she's still that very spiteful mean

334
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.860
Matt Huss III: Person that the Creator made her become

335
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.380
Matt Huss III: So,

336
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:29.490
Matt Huss III: On I don't know even why I'm even it's pointless.

337
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:43.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not really pointless because you're where you're aware of what you're walking into you're aware of the potential toxicity. Toxicity of

338
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:56.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The relationship that you have with her. And so knowing that gives you the, the ability to guard yourself from engaging in that warfare wicker you know

339
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.240
Matt Huss III: That's true that, yeah, it has come in handy, a bunch of times.

340
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:07.620
Matt Huss III: Where she's tried to push those buttons and I've actually not responded and

341
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:19.890
Matt Huss III: She did not take it well, but I was okay so use or, you know, it didn't trigger me or anything. Right. Yeah.

342
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what it's about. You know what I mean, because that's what you have control over. You don't have control over her responses or her reactions to

343
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to you but you know setting boundaries with her before you go, or when you get there and

344
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, letting her know what you can do and what you can't do and not allowing her push those buttons to push you over the edge to get you back into that spiral, you know, is really what

345
00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you want to work for, you know, because ultimately, you know, the idea is to be happy. Find out what makes you happy, and to develop and create your own happiness, your own happy life.

346
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever that looks like, you know what I mean, regardless of what other people think or say or do. This is about Matthew

347
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:22.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is about you. This is about what does that look like for you and you're you're doing all this work in schools so that you have this education and you can get this awesome job when it's over with.

348
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have a career and better your life and being in recovery. It's the same thing. It's like that and your education piece sort of side by side.

349
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:41.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you go back into you know that dangerous ground when you go back to Florida. It's going to be important that you do things different than what you've ever done.

350
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.100
Matt Huss III: Everybody out there doesn't know what it's like what I'm going through

351
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.550
Matt Huss III: yellows, you know, my, my father.

352
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:57.480
Matt Huss III: Kind of does because of the addiction to crack, but

353
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.450
Matt Huss III: Coming putting an upper is way different than

354
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.940
Matt Huss III: Quitting opiates.

355
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.680
Matt Huss III: And really

356
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.990
Matt Huss III: You know, few months down the road, or two years down the road, very different.

357
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.140
Matt Huss III: And

358
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:30.480
Matt Huss III: So yeah, that's, that's it. That's a dangerous thing. Yeah. Florida is bad about that everybody there that I that I deal with or have to deal with her knows me or

359
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:41.730
Matt Huss III: You know, they don't have any clue. They're like, so you know that's why every time in the past that I've done. I got clean, I, I've taken on too much because

360
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:48.510
Matt Huss III: Every that's what was expected of me, you know, all of a sudden

361
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to clear away those expectations.

362
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:59.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, really set some boundaries with the people that you're going to be engaging with before you ever get there.

363
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:10.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which really, you know, we can walk through it and talk about it over the next couple months and really help you devise a plan on how you're going to deal with these situations to keep you safe.

364
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so that you can be a productive member you know in your life and in your kids is live without taking on too much, that really causes you to take 20 steps back. You know, that's important, you know, doing things differently than you've ever done.

365
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

366
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's

367
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.770
Matt Huss III: How to do that. Yeah.

368
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, we'll talk about it, you know, the next couple months, and we will devise

369
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know plans around it and some of the work is going to be really easy, but other were other you know like your ex trying to set boundaries with her. It's going to be tough, but if you don't engage in the warfare. She can't fight by yourself.

370
00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got to not engage in it. You know, you've got to say, look at this as I'm coming back. And this is what I know in the very beginning that I'm going to be able to handle

371
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My idea. You know what I need for me is to be able to work into more than that. But in the beginning, this is what I'm going to have to do

372
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and again, not allowing her to set to push those buttons for you to, you know, be detoured from the path that you're on because you're on an awesome path right now. You know, you want to stay there. Yeah.

373
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. And in doing that, the first step is getting, you know, to a point where you can have this conversation with your roommate and set some get some information.

374
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I see you know the when we, when we bring this up. I just want to tell you, I see the stress come in your

375
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Face like

376
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

377
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's just

378
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:54.480
There.

379
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.120
Matt Huss III: And I get it.

380
00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. I totally get it. But if if

381
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The communication, isn't there, and the openness, isn't there, and you're not understanding, it's not going to get any better when you guys move

382
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you just need to need to be able to go and say, I just need to understand this completely

383
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, I know that I had this and I know that I owed for that. And I know that I owed for that, but I'm trying to get myself in order my finances in order

384
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And so being able to do that I need to know what the expectations are financially going to be from me from this point out

385
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what is that going to look like. So that I can get prepared, you know, for the shift that's coming

386
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's it. You know, that's an acceptable request, it's not

387
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something that you know isn't you know it's being an adult and taking control of your life.

388
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's something for you to think about

389
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, it's not what you say, but it's about

390
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:05.400
You know,

391
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:12.210
Matt Huss III: What you just said like take control of your and I'm thinking about it. I've always let

392
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.430
Matt Huss III: Other people

393
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.510
Matt Huss III: Kind of dictate

394
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:28.980
Matt Huss III: What I do with my life or what I do or how I do it so much. Now, I never thought so. Never thought that

395
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.310
Matt Huss III: But now that I'm thinking back about it. I

396
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:40.320
Matt Huss III: Think I feel so guilty about what I've done in the past because of

397
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:48.420
Matt Huss III: The drugs abuse stuff that I'll let them kind of basically control me in different ways.

398
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.330
Matt Huss III: And not stand up for myself.

399
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.790
Matt Huss III: Out of out of guilt and feeling like

400
00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:58.950
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

401
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:17.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to think about, you know, to be able to work on to do something different. Again, with all of this that's coming up and all your changes. It's about taking back control over that all of

402
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those pieces as well and St. You don't have, you know, you've got how long sober right now.

403
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.380
Matt Huss III: Purposely don't keep like track.

404
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:41.190
Matt Huss III: Because I used to, and it, it was the problem for me because I'd be like, I get to like two years. And I'd be like, well, it's two years I get to use once you know it'll be okay.

405
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:53.970
Matt Huss III: I purposely don't keep track now and therefore me, but I think it's about. It's got to be pretty close to a year, almost, you know, summer.

406
00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:05.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like it's it's the next step is, is what needs to happen and that is letting go of the guilt of the past.

407
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.050
Yeah.

408
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Letting go. Yeah, you can. Don't say you can't say I'll work.

409
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, because if you say you can't. It's a definite no I'm not going to do that. And I'm going to stay in the cycle. But if you say, all right, that's something that I'm willing to work on.

410
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then

411
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She said we're open to be able to help you relieve yourself from some of that.

412
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Guilt that you have from the past and you know something else. Matthew is you have to know that who you are when you're under the influence and the behaviors that you engage in when you're under the influence is completely different than who you are at your core.

413
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.190
Matt Huss III: You know,

414
00:42:50.340 --> 00:43:02.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I believe that 100% you know there are things that we do and links that we will go to to get our next hi that we would never engage in when we were when we're sober so

415
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From my past experience. I know that to be true, you know,

416
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And once we we learn to let go of the hurt and the guilt from the past, there's this freedom to be able to take control of your life and you know, be able to set boundaries with people.

417
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:27.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to be able to be okay and setting those boundaries with

418
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:34.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People and asking questions and getting clarity, you know, for your own safety and your own security, you know,

419
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's the path that we're going to be working

420
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.120
On

421
00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's time to take your life back.

422
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:48.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

423
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I see you shaking your head. I don't hear any words.

424
00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.280
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

425
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely you know it's been a great thing that your friend has been there and that he's been helping you. But there comes a point. It's almost like a baby learning to walk there comes a point when those hands have to be off the baby for the baby to be able to walk on its own.

426
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

427
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.410
Matt Huss III: Depressing to metaphorically compare me to a baby.

428
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can put it

429
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We could metaphorically, put it to riding a bike or learning

430
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cycle or

431
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:38.820
Matt Huss III: You know what I mean.

432
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any of those things. But for me, that's what came to my mind is that when I

433
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Started taking back control of my life. I had to, to, to ask the people around me that were helping me to let go of me a little bit so that I could take control of my life a little bit

434
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

435
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:17.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cuz I don't know about you, but I sure felt like a baby for the first couple years that I started changing my life. I certainly did.

436
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

437
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:32.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was, you know, dependent on other people. And they, you know, the same thing. It was like these expectations. These unclear expectations, you know, really.

438
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were were my struggle to. But when I started again setting boundaries and asking questions and really taking control over what was best best for me, what's best for Matthew

439
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You started seeing things and it empowers you. You know, and once you get to that point where you've you're able to have clarity with your roommate and with your ex. And what's going to happen and how it's going to happen.

440
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like the whole world's open this this this whole other level of life that we get to experience. It's kind of amazing.

441
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.440
Matt Huss III: Know, I've ever known is

442
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:26.520
Matt Huss III: Prison behind bars prison because of trying to find my next hit or prison because of

443
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.990
Matt Huss III: Somebody are trying to get clean

444
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure.

445
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.750
Matt Huss III: I feel like I've never

446
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.090
Matt Huss III: Really lived

447
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:51.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you are today. You have to really take a look at you know where you're at today. You know, because in so many areas.

448
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.020
Matt Huss III: Stuck in a house because I can't

449
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.770
Matt Huss III: You know, use my money for a car.

450
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.220
Matt Huss III: Go to school for

451
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.520
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm still I feel so

452
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.710
Matt Huss III: Controlled so like just in

453
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.840
Matt Huss III: The same thing every day and no

454
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.760
Matt Huss III: Nothing different you know I'm just

455
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's work on that. Let's work on getting you empowered. Let's work on you, you know, changing it up and doing something different. You know what I mean.

456
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's how we

457
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how we get ourselves back

458
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing the same thing you've always done is the meaning of insanity.

459
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:50.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, doing things a little bit different every day.

460
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.710
Is freedom.

461
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:05.670
Matt Huss III: That's why I never, I never a big reason I used drugs actually is because I

462
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:15.150
Matt Huss III: Hated like hated it is actually a very euphemistic word for a feeling towards it.

463
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:21.000
Matt Huss III: That monotony of

464
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.860
Matt Huss III: Waking up going to work coming home.

465
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:38.490
Matt Huss III: Dealing with the kids or the wife or whatever you have going on and then doing it again the next day, same thing. And then, then you get the weekend.

466
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:44.640
Matt Huss III: You have money to go do something different.

467
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.270
Matt Huss III: But then it starts over again.

468
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.470
Matt Huss III: And that's just life and and and

469
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.240
Matt Huss III: And that's

470
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.880
Matt Huss III: Oh, okay. For

471
00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:07.890
Matt Huss III: That's I guess that that's what's normal. I feel like that's what people expect of everyone. I feel feel like that's what people expect like think is

472
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.260
Matt Huss III: Is the right way to live.

473
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.240
Matt Huss III: And

474
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.760
Matt Huss III: I would blow my brains out. If I had to

475
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.150
Matt Huss III: Go to work at something I didn't enjoy every day for eight hours and

476
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:26.340
Matt Huss III: Come home to

477
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

478
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:34.770
Matt Huss III: I don't know, whatever. And then just do it the rest for another 50 or 60 years

479
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:40.380
Matt Huss III: You know cuz my generations retirement years probably gonna be like 90

480
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

481
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you could, if you could look at it in a whole different room and think of it as you get to create your life.

482
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For what works for you, whether it be

483
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hiking on the weekends, whether it be, you know, finding new adventures during, you know, during the time that you're not in school, but really living those those moments to the fullest potential.

484
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes the rest not seems the whole routine initially mundane, you know,

485
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.190
Matt Huss III: Hope so I

486
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:30.570
Matt Huss III: I, I haven't enjoyed anything

487
00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:43.260
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've since I was in high school. You know, before even probably Middle School. Um, I haven't found anything that I really

488
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:49.410
Matt Huss III: Have found that I really enjoy um there's things that

489
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:52.680
Matt Huss III: If I'm

490
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.930
Matt Huss III: A little high or high, then I enjoy

491
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:06.600
Matt Huss III: But otherwise, it's like too much of a hassle too much of an effort to do it, you know.

492
00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:17.100
Matt Huss III: So I hope that changes the longer I'm clean so that I can do those things that I know I enjoy. If I'm high at, you know,

493
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.090
Matt Huss III: And be able to do it without advance such

494
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:29.460
Matt Huss III: As being a chore or job to do something and someone Jeff and rather as something you want to do.

495
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, so that's something that you get to work on this week.

496
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get to figure out some of the things that make you happy.

497
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you want to do.

498
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Almost like a, in a sense, it's almost like a bucket list. Hey, I've never experienced this. I've never experienced this. I've never experienced this, and I would like to try these things.

499
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Excuse me, but really putting together.

500
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't care if it's one or four or five things but just finding something

501
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you want to do.

502
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you want to experience while you're, you know, on this earth because when you build a list like that and you start, you do the first one, whatever it might be, could be something simple trying a different type of food. I mean, it could really be that simple.

503
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The first time you do it motivates you to find something else.

504
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:36.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then motivate you to find something else.

505
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've just got to figure out what that looks like for you.

506
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.110
Matt Huss III: That makes sense.

507
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what you're towards this week. Okay.

508
00:52:54.930 --> 00:53:10.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then next week we'll talk about what's on your list, and we'll talk about the things that are feasible to be able to do in the moment versus the things that aren't that might take a little more planning or a little more time or a little more money or whatever, you know,

509
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're going to get you out of your box a little bit

510
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And get you to experience some things that you haven't experienced before.

511
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they could be just simple things can make all the difference in the world.

512
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to find them.

513
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:34.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Deal.

514
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.380
