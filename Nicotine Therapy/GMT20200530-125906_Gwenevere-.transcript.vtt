00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.040
Christina haro: Know when when I'm growing up. I never had an agent. My name my social security card didn't have a name.

28
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.950
Christina haro: But then at the motor vehicles.

29
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:06.390
Christina haro: They told me they had to put an H. For some reason, some more London record to had to me. So I left like that. And then one day when I was working years ago my employer told me, you know, Christina.

30
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.740
Christina haro: We can't, we can't leave it like this because, you know, when all that REAL ID stuff came in and all this stuff.

31
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.380
Christina haro: He says, you're going to have to change, you're going to have to figure out which one's your legal name.

32
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:34.740
Christina haro: So I contacted cemetery and they sent me my my birth certificate my original while they told me over the phone that my original birth certificate had an eight. And I said, no, my mom made me in the Spanish sense not, you know, the American sense

33
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.550
Christina haro: Because I'm sorry, but that's the way it was like, does my social security card. It doesn't have any

34
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.430
Christina haro: Example, I had to go through all this port.

35
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.820
Christina haro: Stuff and get everything changed. Um, so they made me pick either eight or nine eight

36
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.800
Christina haro: So I just left with an

37
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight freely.

38
00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.430
Christina haro: So I had to go to us so security and habitations. And they sent me a new social security card. Yeah, it was a big old mess.

39
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain. Yeah, I probably going to run into that someday, too, because I have a social from when I was little. It says Quinn and then everything else has going on here.

40
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all kinds of fictitious made up last name things. It's just gonna be a mess. I should probably get it together before I'm 60 right

41
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.920
Christina haro: No, I'm still in the middle of that because I haven't changed my insurance card to CA, so I gotta do that. Yeah, it's a big thing.

42
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so your record in here has the Hispanic version.

43
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.500
Yeah.

44
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, you know, that's really a government agency would, would I don't like that at all that they would ask you that your name is your name. If I wanted to spell my name going to vary, you can spell your name, however you want.

45
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I don't, I don't think that's not cool.

46
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.980
Christina haro: It's ridiculous. Right. No, no.

47
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we have, let's do a little review, since it's been a minute. I'm so excited about the job to where I'm where were you gonna work.

48
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.180
Walmart.

49
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Benefits.

50
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.560
Christina haro: Yeah, I used to work at Walmart years ago. And that's where I got in trouble with my name, but um

51
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:34.350
Christina haro: After I quit. I had a problem with this kid because he became my supervisor and he was just my coworker well after he became a supervisor Sheila's the biggest pain in the butt ever

52
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:44.970
Christina haro: And I told them, You know, I'm not going to be out that by this little boy, he was 18 years old. And one day, he started yelling at me for everybody.

53
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:56.400
Christina haro: And the manager wasn't there that day and he kept he just kept on it. And I told him you know go yell at me. I finally got mad and they threw my bad day him and my apron, the nightclub.

54
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.900
Christina haro: Oh man back and my manager called me, and she told me that

55
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.930
Christina haro: She put me in the computer as a really horrible, you know, because I was a good worker.

56
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.080
Christina haro: And they didn't go back because he was still there.

57
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:22.980
Christina haro: Yeah. And then after about a month in common. They told me that he quit. He walked out on them. If I wanted to go back and I said, no, I really got a job at a regarding another job. So it stayed like that. So now I decided to go back

58
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.220
Christina haro: I'm excited.

59
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh my goodness this is going to be good. So what we can do is it'll be interesting to see some things will probably come up when for most people interactions, like when people are giving you a hard time at work.

60
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to talk about those with me like that same level of anger that frustration because there's going to people that are going to get under your skin.

61
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.320
Christina haro: Oh, I know.

62
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I can talk about ways to sort of self regulate and and communicate, where they don't get the best of that moment. It's not there right but rather, you get to keep your cool and you get to kind of continue on working even though they're kind of jerks.

63
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they're going to go be jerks and they're going to be jerks, but

64
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not probably going to change them. You know what I mean, it's going to be about whether you kind of, if this is where you want to be, then how do you meet this moment with as much grace as possible. So definitely looking forward to hearing about some job stories.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.720
Christina haro: Yeah, it was like

139
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.030
Christina haro: I was constantly just

140
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.520
Christina haro: I don't know.

141
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.180
Christina haro: Especially last year, you know, having one of those

142
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.070
Christina haro: Years, where I was just dependent more stuff, you know,

143
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.110
Christina haro: Things got bad

144
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, nine out of 10 before and this was prior to the last six months, we would say, right, okay. And so over the last six months or as long as you've been in this program, anyway.

145
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Before it was nine out of 10 now in the lashing out maybe acting out angrily. Maybe yelling and something like that. Give me a number, about if they were 10 times. How many times would you do the lashing out

146
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.440
Christina haro: I say about once twice.

147
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.090
Christina haro: I just more calm. No.

148
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.450
Christina haro: I can deal with things a legit.

149
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:12.840
Christina haro: And then last year I had a hectic year you know it's busy working really, you know, um, it was hard. It was hard. Last year, you know, I worked at a place where my daughter was my was my boss.

150
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You so that

151
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.080
Christina haro: I yeah

152
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.010
Yeah.

153
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

154
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.360
Christina haro: So you know me and her started to kind of not get along.

155
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so all those notes are done, so we can kind of get into

156
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were talking about maybe share a little bit more about the dynamics back then with your, with your daughter, what was going on when you were working with her.

157
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:53.310
Christina haro: Um, I started working with her and then I worked with her part time. And then, um, she was running a place. So she was my boss. She was the store manager so

158
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Kareena

159
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:03.150
Christina haro: Or Clara, Clara. Yeah. So it was a big, you know, it was, it didn't feel it just didn't

160
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.280
Christina haro: It didn't go well towards the last, I guess. Few months.

161
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.070
Christina haro: And

162
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:19.140
Christina haro: There was a lot of stress, a lot of stress. It was, you know, when then

163
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.210
Christina haro: As time went by. Last year I realized, you know that I'm

164
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:33.540
Christina haro: We were clashing with clashing probably because of our addictions. We were passing really bad. It was a stressful year.

165
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.180
Christina haro: Till about

166
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:48.300
Christina haro: I guess when we book entered into therapy that's when everything changed because about a month before we started this program. She decided one day.

167
00:17:49.890 --> 00:18:00.900
Christina haro: She couldn't do it anymore. So she says she woke up one day and told me I can't, I can't do it anymore and says, I'm not going to go back to work. And they said,

168
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.170
Christina haro: Okay, so I didn't go back either

169
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

170
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:15.780
Christina haro: That was the end of that. Yeah, it was very stressful. Those stressful. It's just we were clashing, you know, I was constantly Fi network well

171
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you have any of the content over what you were clashing over

172
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.140
Christina haro: No, it was just

173
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.750
Christina haro: Simple things, you know,

174
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So oftentimes that's the case, what we're arguing over is really kind of silly kind of petty things. But what we remember is how we felt around them and and the arguments.

175
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at Clara. Now, and she's the one. Is she the one in in the bright heart program.

176
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing in her

177
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.050
Christina haro: A

178
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.600
Christina haro: We get along better now.

179
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.880
Christina haro: We get a lot better.

180
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.750
Christina haro: Never. This is not my boss. But, you know, things are different.

181
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's

182
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.340
Christina haro: A personality and and you know she's done. She's I can say she's a little back to normal. Now, you know,

183
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So we get along better as an outcome and she's normal, but what are you seeing with your eyes or hearing with your ears. It's different about Clara.

184
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.990
Um,

185
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.420
Christina haro: She says happier and so do I. We

186
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Smiles more

187
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.140
Christina haro: Yeah, we do.

188
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.250
Christina haro: Yeah, we've gotten to um

189
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.870
Christina haro: Back then it was just a work relationship. It wasn't like we were even related

190
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.140
Christina haro: And now it seems like I'm

191
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.090
Christina haro: It's different now.

192
00:19:52.860 --> 00:20:01.920
Christina haro: I can see I can see the difference in her, you know, we go we went back to being the friends that we were okay

193
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And the dynamics between you two earlier on.

194
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Has she come to you recently and kind of process with you about the origin of her drug use.

195
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:29.310
Christina haro: Know we just never discuss we don't we just

196
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.550
Christina haro: I think she discussed more things with her dad, and she did with me.

197
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you mean did like I'm talking about like like current life because we're saying she's

198
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.790
Christina haro: Oh, like current um

199
00:20:47.220 --> 00:21:04.860
Christina haro: We don't really talk about stuff. I mean, we talked about our appointments and stuff, or a surprise. I'll tell her. Oh, I had a great you know I had a great meeting. I'll tell her you know we just this this. We discussed that you know little things or surprise. I'll tell her I can

200
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:23.970
Christina haro: Oh, I learned about breathing and stuff like that and then she'll tell me the little things that she does with her therapists, but we don't really get into the dynamics of our like I can talk to her about my stuff. But she doesn't really talk to me about her. What

201
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of that.

202
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.760
Christina haro: I and I think maybe um

203
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:40.920
Christina haro: I think she's doing okay though. I mean, I've seen her to me, but I see as a mom, I see things I see her differently than they saw back then.

204
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that wasn't my question, though.

205
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.630
Christina haro: But, but

206
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When I asked you, as I tried to catch a quick but you got off at very, very fast.

207
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry. No, you know, don't apologize for

208
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't be a client do anything wrong. You're can't do it wrong.

209
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just wanted to

210
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: My daughter doesn't talk to me about

211
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. She doesn't talk to me about

212
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Me I raised her. She doesn't talk to me about me.

213
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what I was asking you about

214
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Same. Notice how you talk with me about your mom. She's incredibly influential on what was normalized in your life that have really aggressive type of the relationships were normalized in very early childhood.

215
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Which probably indeed set a course of it being acceptable on some level, like, it's okay. I'll put up with abuse from, you know, a husband.

216
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just curious. She doesn't ever talk to you about boy this set in motion. For me, these things around either substance use to relationships. She doesn't share those things with you.

217
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.270
Christina haro: The only thing that she did share with me.

218
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:12.090
Christina haro: Was that of working, where we did was we worked out of town. Okay, well we did she met a lot of people that and that is what got her into

219
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.850
Christina haro: What she was doing. Yeah.

220
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:23.670
Christina haro: And you know, I know we all make our own choices. You know, in reality, a lot of people say, well, you made the choice. Nobody. It's nobody's fault, but yours.

221
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:37.380
Christina haro: But I do really believe that the environment around you has a lot to do with it. And I think she was young. She got influenced and doing some stuff, she thought, you know, was okay was going to join the crowd.

222
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:49.740
Christina haro: And she told me that being over there, where we work and meeting other people that worked, where we where we did with the same company.

223
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:59.370
Christina haro: She worked in that company way before I was broken, so she met a lot of people during that time she told me that's what got her in trouble.

224
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And you accept that as

225
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.600
Christina haro: I accept that and I believe it because

226
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:17.580
Christina haro: Knowing how she was before and the jobs you had before. And the friends she had before the things she would tell me um

227
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:29.400
Christina haro: I knew how she felt about stuff like that and then all of a sudden when I realized what was going on. She wasn't T. She wasn't the same person.

228
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:40.800
Christina haro: And then I realized what was going on. So then after we didn't work. And then we doing this program and stuff. And then she started telling me what

229
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:52.080
Christina haro: How she ended up you know doing stuff she did. She did tell me that that's how she got in trouble by joining the powder below with everybody else.

230
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So revisiting this discussion. You started last night.

231
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yesterday.

232
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And

233
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to that dinner table.

234
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, back to that idea that, who was it that that left the table.

235
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.290
Christina haro: Oh, my older son.

236
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.740
Christina haro: He does. He

237
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.740
Christina haro: Know that somewhere in party. Yeah, it

238
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.840
Christina haro: Is

239
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.330
Christina haro: There's times where, you know, we'll start talking about stuff and then

240
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:43.920
Christina haro: You know, proceed. Being a mom I he says, I always put my two cents worth and I shouldn't say things he says I criticize, which I don't see it as a criticism I see it as, you know, I'm

241
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.730
Christina haro: To me, I didn't see it as a criticism I didn't really and even at this point, I didn't

242
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.700
Christina haro: Know, I didn't think I was criticizing

243
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you say let me hear

244
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.100
Christina haro: Well, we were we were kind of talking about, okay, we're talking about

245
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.750
Christina haro: My daughter's um what was going on when she was in Texas. Right.

246
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's, that's correct.

247
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.410
Christina haro: Yeah, so

248
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.550
Christina haro: We just talked about. And then she called me.

249
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:33.660
Christina haro: While mom, I had to do it at the time. He says, Well, what was I supposed to do, right. And I told her no three. Now you know you got yourself into that situation I you know do made it clear, you got yourself into that situation. So you should have had it over before you did this, right.

250
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is the this marrying

251
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.770
Christina haro: This man or oh

252
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:48.090
Christina haro: No, no, no, it was, um, she's got herself into trouble because the daughter brain tumors with okay well she's not with us anymore, which has a new baby right

253
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.720
Yes.

254
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.310
Christina haro: That

255
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.370
Christina haro: They did some bad choices and she ended up having to live in her heart, and she was pregnant.

256
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.970
Christina haro: Okay, so that's why I'd rather

257
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice you you have a real like

258
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Style of omission.

259
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You really don't like to share details if the your natural upfront inclination is to give general information.

260
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just want to tell you what the limits of confidentiality are in here just for some people they don't really get what they are. If you tell me you're going to kill someone, and I know who it is. I have a duty to sort of warn them and

261
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue. Let me continue

262
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The other responsibility. I have if if I find out that there is someone who is a vulnerable adult who's being abused. I'm gonna, I have a responsibility to protect that that vulnerable adult if I find out you are abusing some vulnerable adult if I found out that someone was abusing minor

263
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Like beating right

264
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: using drugs around them and heroin and right there. There's this little five year old. And so if those things are going on. Presently

265
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a duty if there's a court order that orders me to speak.

266
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I would speak and also if you sign a release of information, then I could speak. That's how few things so you do not have to worry if you tell me Kareena blah, blah, blah. It's not going anywhere. You have everything in here stays in here. Okay.

267
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, I can't, I can't get I can't be of service to you and you say,

268
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:43.020
Christina haro: No wasn't really she had it on place. Okay. She had an opposite. She's doing great. I was the point, she's losing grip so she meets this dummy.

269
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:53.430
Christina haro: Dummy that this was not you. Okay. He's not a good person. So she ends up paying it in chance of losing her apartment.

270
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.370
Christina haro: Okay, she's losing a job so into

271
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:04.770
Christina haro: Ends up without lifting so she basically ends up living in her car because she doesn't have anywhere to go.

272
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:19.830
Christina haro: Um, so. Meanwhile, my, my older my she's pregnant and then I have my granddaughter. So my granddaughter will come and stay with my ex and his wife as a person living in the car right her and her boyfriend. So, um,

273
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:31.950
Christina haro: So my accent in LA, which is my granddaughter's the other doesn't watch this is new. It's also he realizes what's going on. And I guess he kind of I'm

274
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:41.160
Christina haro: Kind of, I guess, from what I get. He kind of told her that if she didn't fix the situation he was going to go pick up his daughter.

275
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:53.790
Christina haro: Right, it was a big deal. Yeah, you had her cytokines saying some kind of papers. Right. And I don't know what it was. So that was the whole topic of our conversation, you know, that was

276
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the result of those papers sign

277
00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:04.980
Christina haro: Um, well, now I'm my granddaughter's leaving on Mondays and she's been with him for CDs with the in the summers with him.

278
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:19.890
Christina haro: Well her being in Dallas. Every time my granddaughter was going to go visit and last pieces to it, happy to put her on the airplane and he would pick her up right well in those papers it says that whenever my daughter.

279
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:32.280
Christina haro: Has she has the responsibility of putting her in the plane and the financial responsibility to put her on the plane right so now that she lives over here, closer

280
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:43.200
Christina haro: And he's supposed to come and get her now. He says, or are you paying for my trip. Well, she got mad and she says, Why should I pay for your tip you know I'm no longer in della

281
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:51.120
Christina haro: You know, I'm here in New Mexico, which is what, three hours. Right, so she kind of had a discussion with him over that.

282
00:30:51.810 --> 00:31:02.220
Christina haro: But I told her walk through, you know, you should have never seen those papers so far. The second look at them. So it was a big discussion about those papers, which I don't know what we're in the papers.

283
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she have a copy of

284
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:18.600
Christina haro: That she has she hasn't showed me that she said she campaign. But anyways, I like that. I don't think I criticized for it. I think so. But she was kind of getting offensive or defensive AND THEN HE SAID HE GOT IT. HE SAID I WAS CRITICIZING

285
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay there. That's what this whole thing is about right there.

286
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you saying I don't see how anybody reasonably would hear that as a criticism is that right from your perspective. Yeah.

287
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:38.340
Christina haro: And I don't think I criticized her because she was he got more who's got more offensive than she did give someone from from

288
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:38.820
That's

289
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because you you have the idea. So let's stay right here. We're not going to go anywhere. Further, just right right there.

290
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the idea boy Kareena it would have been a good idea. Had you

291
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to more people about what's in that paperwork gotten more feedback from people. Maybe this would have gone down differently.

292
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.810
Christina haro: Is that what your thought, well, yeah. And I told her I told her what you should have called me before you sign anything

293
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you will not

294
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, you're ready.

295
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.370
Christina haro: But

296
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in the wording.

297
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that the intent is. There, I said it differently. Back to you, but I use different words.

298
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to really find this interesting that I think there's a certain word you used in there that is going to make everybody on this planet they speak English defensive. You know what it was.

299
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:33.870
Christina haro: Me, I

300
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's a certain word

301
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That you used

302
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the word should

303
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

304
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.810
Christina haro: Yeah, I thought about that.

305
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.920
Christina haro: Yeah. So what I also. But in that conversation. I also told him.

306
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.280
Christina haro: You should have. Talk to your dad about it or you should

307
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You should wait

308
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.870
Christina haro: You should. I know, I know it's good.

309
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To talk to your dad. Wait, you should have

310
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Watched you should have thought about it, you should have called me first. You should have had me read it should should watch so hold on let's move from here to stay there for a second. I want you to see how it feels yourself.

311
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So try it on. You're going to try on how it feels to be shifted. You ready

312
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You should have started treatment earlier.

313
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:18.930
Christina haro: No.

314
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, like a MoFo.

315
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

316
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. There is no such thing. There's no such thing. This is what I think it's more like when I was doing the validation minute ago with you. And I said, Is it like this and you're like yeah, here's how I worded it. I said, Boy Kareena would have been

317
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe helpful or it might be something like

318
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey Kareena did you

319
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you consider given me a call.

320
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would have loved to have read it with you. Maybe I would have picked up on something in the paperwork that you didn't pick up on. Do you still have it. In other words,

321
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Or should does to someone

322
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When I did that to you just now. Did you get a zing like a bit of shame got activated. Am I right.

323
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It got it now. I made that up. That's not true. I don't actually think that

324
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted you to feel the word the zap that we all get and that's why I say to people don't should on people, because the other word is that sh it word but I say don't show it on people because it's funny.

325
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And because it's a cute way to remember to drop the word drop it entirely and your whole way of speaking will change.

326
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're gonna have to sit there for a second and really think, how am I going to phrase this

327
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm either saying, I feel, I feel it kind of sad that I didn't get a chance to read that with you and be helpful as a mama. Do you see how you're not offend. You're not offended by that are you

328
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.030
Christina haro: Know,

329
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I owned that I'm kind of sad and

330
00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to to have been helpful and I would have picked up on something maybe that you didn't, because when people are in that much anxiety when someone's coming after our kid, we can't

331
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Read the same way we can't pick up on on on meaning the same way, because we're so stressed out, we have all this cortisol going on.

332
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't pick up on it like someone who's a little bit outside of the intense environment and and Kareena I was a little bit outside of it and I might have picked up on something and then get into solution which is do you have it around. I'd love to look at it now.

333
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so watch the difference. So notice how earlier I said you should have started the program earlier. Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. Right shames that that okay so that one. Yuck. That's a yuck. So watch this.

334
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to play with the difference in the wording. So Christina, you know, you might have looked into treatment, a little earlier when you you know you lost a car relationship started going sideways or

335
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You noticed, you know, you couldn't pay a bill. I wonder, I wonder what was going on that you didn't think of it was that as shaming did as much shame come up with that version of it then with you should have been in program earlier.

336
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.580
Christina haro: Though it's good.

337
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: In that wild.

338
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That word and you want to know what it is. It comes from this image of our early parent

339
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And this finger like this. You're a bad girl you did bad. That's what this should does to us. You should listen to me, you should do it. I tell you, you should you should you should. And it's this waggling kind of nasty finger that it's it's this imagery of parents

340
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And we all kind of have that. And when we hear that word we go

341
00:36:49.320 --> 00:37:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I made a mistake I'm bad, I'm not good enough. All of those big core self image of things come up for us lightning speed. We're not even aware of it, we just immediately. Well, you know what you should have we immediately get defensive we pop off right

342
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's try it again.

343
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what would happen if you had to come up and this is not easy. By the way, you might not even I'm right here and we can play with it. But, so let me see how it started. So

344
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I was in, I was in Dallas and

345
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know Bobo was, you know, he kept manipulating me and I ended up, you know, I ended up breaking the least he was spending all my money and ended up breaking this lease and I had to get out of the apartment and I had to live, you know, in this car, and then

346
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What is a Las Cruces granddaughter father name.

347
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.870
Christina haro: Jerry

348
00:37:49.470 --> 00:38:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Jerry Okay. And then, Jerry coming at me with this you know custody paperwork and this travel thing. And now he's telling me I gotta, I gotta pay for him to drive over. Okay, so now you say to me, What

349
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I'm gonna I'm gonna help

350
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we don't have access to should like let's say you go on a should detox.

351
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: For a month even you'll see it's super hard. I gave up. I deserve and should for a year just to see if I could do it. It was a wild ride, I tell you.

352
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be done, but anyway. So coming back to you. So here's what you can do. You see what you already have these skills. It's about remembering them. I feel

353
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking a question.

354
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And just just sharing the same way you share in group.

355
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagine it's your turn and go into. So as soon as I say it, I want you to pay attention to your body, pay attention to what gets

356
00:38:52.500 --> 00:39:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Like twisted around. Okay. You weren't there to help me. I'm Karina, and you're going to notice it in the body, you're going to have an emotion labeled to what's going on, disappointment, sad, whatever it is. OK. And then you tell me how you feel.

357
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can ask me a question.

358
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it tricky bit with why is why can also make me defensive, too. So that's another one that we got to put an X through you can

359
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.370
Christina haro: Get rid of why

360
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Why get rid of why well we phrase it with fancy talk like this Kareena. Do you know why. Uh, nope. There's why I just did it to Kareena do you

361
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you think about giving me a call or were you just so stressed out. You didn't even think about anybody looking over that paperwork. They're kind of like that.

362
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you ready so I'm Kareena

363
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Take two

364
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you know, then Jerry's coming at me with that somehow I I signed a legal document saying that I have to pay for his three hour drive

365
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it was it you know I was paying for getting my grant in my daughter over to him. It did. I don't remember ever signing anything that said that transferring him to daughter.

366
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just breathe, honey. Just remember to breathe.

367
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the table. You guys are eating there can be a beat, right, because we're eating. Yeah. Take your time.

368
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Brief how you feel. Let me review. Breathe. You notice how you feel, think about your own emotion share how you feel. Maybe asked me a question or tell me a little story.

369
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:43.320
Christina haro: Well curry net. Can you find the papers so I can look at them, you know, maybe there's something in there that you miss

370
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you went to solution, you didn't do. Did you do any of the things that I suggested you just when

371
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought about it. I'm like, Okay, how do I word it

372
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it was a beautiful solution. Beautiful.

373
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I was beautiful and and then she gets to answer now the style. Here's the thing. As lovely as you you are with that beautiful question. Remember you have years of having shifted her

374
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so she may be primed for defensiveness, even when you do your very best to ask a very loving question. Okay, you got to prepare yourself for that. It's going to take months maybe maybe years until the guard is down enough to trust that you're not going to shut her

375
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:45.000
Christina haro: And then during that time, you know, when all that was going on with her. She wasn't talking to me, so there was no issue was even going to call me or ask me, you know, and I

376
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.970
Christina haro: You know, I wish I would have been there to helper. You know, I

377
00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So, sweetheart, say that that's what you say to me, not you should you should the way people get defensive is when you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

378
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: turn all of that to the self and we say, so I'm Kareena tell me how you feel. Mom, you just did it with whenever your therapist do with me Kareena tell me at the dinner table.

379
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:23.610
Christina haro: You know, I wish I was there to help you. You know, I, you know, we weren't talking at the time. I couldn't help you, you know, but

380
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:31.290
Christina haro: You know, I can look at them now and see if there's anything you know we can do about it. Yeah.

381
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And add that was gorgeous don't change a thing. And now I see on the top.

382
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring me even closer to you on an emotional, psychological level and tell me how you feel that what you just said happened. How do you feel

383
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:52.320
Christina haro: You know, I feel bad that you sign things because you felt like you know you were in the find

384
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: No, nope, you're analyzing feel, it'll be one word, I feel, what word

385
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.090
Christina haro: I feel sad for you.

386
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how not for her. She gets to feel herself. How do you feel, she's her own person.

387
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:11.760
Christina haro: Your eyes so

388
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:12.990
Christina haro: I i

389
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel sad Christina.

390
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.070
Christina haro: Yeah, I do. I feel sad.

391
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Bam. Look how hard it is to get to

392
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.420

405
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, you're going to hear it. It's probably going to have your, your body have a tight chest somewhere or stomach turn something's going to happen. You're going to notice the emotion. It's going to be sad remorse regret somewhere in there, you're going to remember those best you can.

423
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That was gorgeous. Does it get any better than that. Is that the most honest thing you can say to your daughter.

424
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.240
Christina haro: Yeah, that's only really good. I like that.

425

Gwenevere Abriel: Was it the truth was a your truth.

426
00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:03.630
Christina haro: The truth is the truth, you know, but sometimes at that time. You can I tell you at that at the time when everything's going on. You don't see, I guess you just don't see what you say.

427
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, say, I don't see

428
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:11.100
Christina haro: I don't see ya. I don't see and maybe they do you know they see

429
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:23.670
Christina haro: You know, and I tried lately. You know, I've tried to, um, because, you know, we, I tell you the dynamics in my, in my house with my kids when I'm, what I'm

430
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:41.010
Christina haro: There's things that I told them about them that I don't like sometimes the way they talk to me. Yeah. And I've told them the same thing. You know, I tell it like if you don't like something, I say, Please tell me you know and then they tell me the same thing, you know.

431
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.200
Christina haro: So we're trying to

432
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting better.

433
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.600
Christina haro: It's getting better.

434
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what you noticed about as I was

435
00:46:51.210 --> 00:47:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: very direct. Today I wanted to offer you another way different ways of phrasing to get your intent of love across to your daughter.

436
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I it's very different than shooting where she ends up feeling like she screwed up. You see it.

437
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice is different about what I was inviting today.

438
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.020
Christina haro: It has more

439
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.810
Christina haro: In the compensation is more

440
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.210
Christina haro: It feels like

441
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:49.590
Christina haro: There's more care in the conversation like you it more emotion in there. Then when you should should, should any point fingers is more like you don't really give a crap about conversation. You know what I mean, if you worded differently.

442
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.940
Christina haro: The other person will will, you know, feel like you actually care care.

443
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.320
Isn't that something

444
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Wouldn't it be nice to have our audience. Our daughter our son feel that you care versus

445
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your shaming them. Wouldn't that be cool.

446
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the difference between

447
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is like could versus should and if you absolutely have to use one try could

448
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.690
Christina haro: A could instead of this good

449
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.610
Christina haro: Oh my

450
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen. I wish you could have called me. I know we weren't, we weren't talking, then I have regret around that makes me sad. And I wasn't there for you.

451
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm there for you. Now if you happen to have that paperwork. I'd love to just sort of scan it and see if we can figure out a phrase that it really distinguishes transport of daughter to a location versus

452
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A father to the daughter and wonder if we can find that working together.

453
00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. And then she feels you are there for her available and helpful and she doesn't have to feel small and wrong.

454
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong is how we feel when we have been should

455
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You do too. We all do. Oh, I hate it. You should have looked up up. I'm like, oh, I don't know about that. That's what I did. I hear about what I should have done.

456
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: a grown ass ramen.

457
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you're giggling

458
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.660
Christina haro: That's funny.

459
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, okay. How's your body doing because this was pretty intense stuff. Yeah.

460
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:35.850
Christina haro: Yeah, fine.

461
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any questions, because we could do these role plays as much as you want. Any questions about like you can predict even later today, there's going to be a conversation

462
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can give me, you can take when, how am I going to supposed to say it like this is it. You have any questions about how to phrase, something, something that might be coming up.

463
00:49:54.810 --> 00:50:03.450
Christina haro: Well, today, I don't know. I don't have any questions, because I don't even know how today's gonna go today. We're having a birthday party for my granddaughter because
