120
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.620
Dawn Abriel: When was the last time you had an asthma attack.

121
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:11.100
LML211BL: It's been a while. Probably at least a few years. So it hasn't been affecting me anymore. But, I mean, the last time I went to the doctor, they still, they still told me about it. So I'm not sure. Sure.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.360

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.140
LML211BL: No. Okay.

128
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.710

131
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:35.700
Dawn Abriel: Okay, that's one of the reasons you will have to go get your blood drawn for bright heart health and for life, Link. You'll do it for brain, heart health, and then we'll send them the results, but

132
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:50.550
Dawn Abriel: You'll have to go to a quest lab and call first to get an appointment and make sure that they, you know, have safety protocols, most of them do. Now, but

133
00:13:51.600 --> 00:14:02.040
Dawn Abriel: Some people like and avoid making them go get labs, but for people who are IV drug users, I have to have a baseline of what your liver is is up to these days.

134
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.690
LML211BL: Okay.

135
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:10.650

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.220
LML211BL: No, ma'am.

296
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.280
Dawn Abriel: Even better.

297
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:35.370
Dawn Abriel: And this question is to help us just rule out any early dementia you bathe yourself and clothe yourself and feed yourself. We know where you are who you are. You make your own decisions. You have a memory that's appropriate for your age, you can focus and you can read

298
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:36.930
LML211BL: Yes, ma'am.

299
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:44.130
Dawn Abriel: Good. Now I'm going to want you to get your pulse and I'll show you how to do that.

300
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:57.300
Dawn Abriel: You have a muscle that goes from your jaw down to your neck and right in front of that muscle. So take your right hand and feel your left net. There you go right in front of the muscle.

301
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:05.850
Dawn Abriel: You should hear feel a thump, thump, thump. If you push too hard, you block it off so you kind of have to be you feel it.

302
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.050
LML211BL: Yeah.

303
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.320
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'll tell you when to start counting. Hold on.

304
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.110

LML211BL: This 170

311
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.380
Dawn Abriel: I want you to get real close to the camera and pull your eyelid down so I can see under your eyelid.

312
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.320
Dawn Abriel: That's good. Okay, let go, relax.

313
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.590
Dawn Abriel: Make your eyes go all the way to the right.

314
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.340
Dawn Abriel: Left.

315
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.150

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.510
Dawn Abriel: Good look straight ahead, and breathe out of either side of you knows

317
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.680
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Stick your tongue out and open your mouth really wide and move your tongue, side to side.

318
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:35.700
Dawn Abriel: Ah, perfect. Close your mouth bite down your teeth fit. Normally, and you don't have any job paid

319
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.140
LML211BL: No, I'm

320
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:37.890
Good.

321
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.930
Dawn Abriel: Bring your head up just a little bit and let me see you swallow.

322
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.230
Dawn Abriel: Okay, there's no tenderness and no lumps in your neck right

323
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.210
LML211BL: Now,

324
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.590
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

325
00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.540
Dawn Abriel: Take a big deep breath. Let me see your how your chest rises.

326
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:03.480
Dawn Abriel: All right.

327
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:17.700
Dawn Abriel: Good. And I want you to push on your belly upper right upper left lower right lower left, and tell me there's no lumps or bumps or pain when you push around

328
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.370
LML211BL: No.

329
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.390
Good.

330
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:27.390
Dawn Abriel: Then make the camera, calm down and let me see your ankles, that there's no swelling in your ankles.

331
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.180
Dawn Abriel: Great. OK. And now let me see you pull against your fingers.

332
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.440
Dawn Abriel: Good. And let me see. Tap your fingers against your thumb.

333
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.840
Dawn Abriel: Perfect. Alright.

334
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.600
Dawn Abriel: So let's talk about the program.

335
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:29.850
Dawn Abriel: The group on Tuesday at noon means it has to be like this. There can't be only one walking around, because if someone were to walk in and see someone they knew on the screen that would just be really terrible, right. You wouldn't want that happening to you.

336
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.180
Dawn Abriel: So you make sure that no one can come in for the hour that you're in, in group therapy.

337
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:51.060
Dawn Abriel: Before you go to group, you have to fill out the BAM. You did one similar, but every week. I look at them because people can't talk about everything that's going on for them so

338
00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:02.730
Dawn Abriel: I look at everyone's BAM every single week. And if I see that you're having problems. I might ask to talk with you individually. So

339
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:15.600
Dawn Abriel: That has to be done before you come to group and it can be done an hour before or the day before. You just want don't want to wait to the last minute because

340
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:27.780
Dawn Abriel: It, it, you have to check in for the group at least a half an hour ahead of time because there are a lot of people checking in to various groups around the country so

341
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:35.190
Dawn Abriel: Make sure you've got something to read, you know, you're, you're going to sometimes you're on hold for a while to check into group.

342
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:37.710
LML211BL: Okay.

343
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:51.600
Dawn Abriel: So after we're done. I want you to go back to bright heart health, go back to the virtual clinic, like you did to check in with me and and say to them, show me how to do a Bam.

344
00:33:52.710 --> 00:34:05.100
Dawn Abriel: And show me how to do the ACE survey. It's the ACE is just one time you answer 10 questions, but it gives us a good idea of what happened to you in your early childhood.

345
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.250
LML211BL: Okay, but as clinic and what was the other one.

346
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:11.340
Dawn Abriel: It's an ace. It's a survey.

347
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.690
LML211BL: The as all the

348
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.900
Dawn Abriel: Other is the brief addiction monitor the band.

349
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.780
Dawn Abriel: You say the doc wants me to do a Bam, and an ace.

350
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.030
LML211BL: Okay.

351
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.970
Dawn Abriel: The other thing that they can do is they can tell you which the closest quest lab is for you.

352
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.780
LML211BL: Yeah, I believe they already had told me, and I wrote it down.

353
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:35.700
Dawn Abriel: Super. Okay, great.

354
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:44.280
Dawn Abriel: Then eat it once a month, you will get a manila envelope like this.

355
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.690
Dawn Abriel: And when you get it, do not open it. If you open it, they won't use it.

356
00:34:52.950 --> 00:35:06.630
Dawn Abriel: To go. You have to go to the virtual clinic and say, Hey, I got one of these. What do I. What do I do, and they'll say, Okay, open it in front of us. And then you'll take one of these out and you'll open this in front of them.

357
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:12.180
Dawn Abriel: Then you'll you'll leave your phone here you'll go to the bathroom and fill this or you give

358
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:27.150
Dawn Abriel: Some urine. Put it in there with the leg, nice and tight. Bring it back, and then you'll slowly move this in front of the camera, and then they will read the results. And that's your urine drug screen for the month.

359
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.380
Okay.

360
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:40.950
Dawn Abriel: And those results will be available to life link also I think life link does a different kind. They do a mouth swab every week, but

361
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.120
Okay.

362
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.560
You know,

363
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.980
Dawn Abriel: And I don't know what your parole.

364
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.160
Dawn Abriel: stipulates but

365
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.430
Dawn Abriel: You do also want to make sure that you've signed a release of information for your parole officer.

366
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:57.600
LML211BL: So,

367
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.520
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, already do that.

368
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.720
LML211BL: No, I'm not.

369
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.280
Dawn Abriel: So when you go back to the virtual clinic, tell them that you need to do that also

370
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.460
Dawn Abriel: Okay, it's called an R. Oh, I release of information.

371
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:19.050
Dawn Abriel: So you're going to go get your labs you know about the urine drug screens.

372
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:20.880
Dawn Abriel: I right

373
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.580
Dawn Abriel: He prescriptions electronic

374
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.300
Dawn Abriel: So you won't ever get a piece of paper with your prescription, you told them.

375
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:37.140
Dawn Abriel: Care Coordinator which pharmacy you wanted to use. And that's where the script will go now.

376
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:51.240
Dawn Abriel: Given that you've been off of everything for three days. My guess is that one strip is going to be plenty. So let's start with that and see how you do. Okay.

377
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.260
Dawn Abriel: Have you, what were you taken in the past.

378
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.720
LML211BL: Now recently.

379
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.790
Dawn Abriel: Well, the last time you took Suboxone buprenorphine.

380
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.680
LML211BL: Oh, I had to do like a whole strip in the morning and then I do like half of one in the afternoon.

381
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:17.970
Dawn Abriel: Okay, don't ever take don't ever divided up like that that you don't get the full blood level. It's never supposed to be divided up

382
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:26.340
Dawn Abriel: You take and you take the full dose. First thing in the morning. If it turns out that you need that other half when I check in with you next Tuesday.

383
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:37.650
Dawn Abriel: And what you're going to pay attention to is how long your medicine last but it takes two or three days before you even know it takes that long for you to get a steady

384
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:51.240
Dawn Abriel: Amount in your bloodstream for us to know what you need. So just pay attention. Oh yeah, I got a guy to runny nose, it started about midnight, and I woke up and I really needed my medicine, something like that.

385
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.400
Dawn Abriel: Okay, okay.

386
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.120
Dawn Abriel: So we're going to start you on one strip

387
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.900
Dawn Abriel: If, by chance, that's too much medicine, you'll know because you'll get sleepy.

388
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:15.120
Dawn Abriel: If you're sleepy then cut it in half and take half and see, see how that last if that doesn't last enough then take

389
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.170
Dawn Abriel: Three quarters.

390
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.220
Dawn Abriel: The next morning.

391
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:26.700
Dawn Abriel: You can you can play with it. Don't take more than I prescribed because that'll get you in trouble with your preparation.

392
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.570
LML211BL: Okay.

393
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:39.960
Dawn Abriel: If you're having trouble with anything, you can always go to the virtual clinic and say, I need to get in touch with the doc and they will message me they've got lots of ways to get ahold of me so

394
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.450
Dawn Abriel: Tell them I'm you know I'm brand new to the program. And I'm really having trouble.

395
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:47.940
Dawn Abriel: And they will

396
00:38:49.170 --> 00:39:02.730
Dawn Abriel: do their best to get in touch with me. I gotta tell you, though I get up early and I go to bed early, so I don't even like look at messages. After about four or five o'clock. I'm i am i'm spent

397
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.220
Dawn Abriel: So if you've got a problem. Make it

398
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.600
Dawn Abriel: Early in the day. OK.

399
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:16.290
Dawn Abriel: OK. I don't like leave people hanging, but I also just I'm an old lady, I can't pull it off doing those long hours anymore.

400
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:17.430
Okay.

401
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:36.990
Dawn Abriel: I by law. I have to send you some Narcan and it's the nasal spray just have them around. They save lives, you know, it's people in your position, who are around other addicts that end up saving lives. So don't hesitate to to have it.

402
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.390
Dawn Abriel: And

403
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:48.180
Dawn Abriel: The group is once a week. Tuesdays at noon. Do you have any questions.

404
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.430
LML211BL: No, no, no.

405
00:39:51.120 --> 00:40:03.360
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to your therapist. Her name is Glenn a beer, and I'm going to be sending you an email. Keep the email I send you because you're going to want to

406
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:12.630
Dawn Abriel: Refer to it, it'll have some important names and numbers on there that you'll think oh, what was the zoom room number, but it'll be in my email.

407
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:24.300
Dawn Abriel: And it will have my address in there, it will have my email address. So if, say, you go to virtual clinic and you've waited a half an hour and you're just frustrated you can email me.

408
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:43.500
Dawn Abriel: And maybe, maybe I will be around to see it. And I can't guarantee that. But often when people get frustrated. We've had a really huge number of new people because of the coronavirus because the clinics have shut down and all the clinics now are sending their people to us so

409
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.910
Dawn Abriel: The care coordinators are a little overwhelmed.

410
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.400
LML211BL: So let's you email.

411
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.640
Dawn Abriel: You'll get it. I will send you. I will say,

412
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.280
Dawn Abriel: Email. So you'll have it right

413
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.460
LML211BL: I am a little bit not feeling that great again.

414
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:08.490
Dawn Abriel: Of course I am used to this. People are either stoned or in withdrawal so i i know it both ways. Okay.

415
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.170
Dawn Abriel: And, you know, to take the strip under your tongue.

416
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:27.870
Dawn Abriel: You must not smoke before you take yourself if you do, you won't be getting the medicine cigarettes cause all your blood vessels to cramp down. This is why it's so

417
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:38.790
Dawn Abriel: Dangerous for your health. Because the damage it does by having your blood vessels all cramp down. And what you're doing is you're you're absorbing the medicine under your tongue, there's a

418
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:50.550
Dawn Abriel: big network of blood vessels under there. And that's how you get it into your system. But if you smoke beforehand and cramp those down. You won't be getting the full eight milligrams of medicine.

419
00:41:52.800 --> 00:42:05.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay, what most people do is they wake up, they take their sub they were to that nasty taste in their mouth for at least two minutes and then they go brush their teeth and had breakfast or whatever but

420
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.600
Dawn Abriel: Anyway,

421
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.710
Dawn Abriel: And I will write to the prescription and just a couple of minutes. As soon as we get off.

422
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.960
LML211BL: Okay, thank you.

423
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:33.720
Dawn Abriel: You're so welcome. It was nice meeting you and I'm the doctor for that Tuesday I want to keep all the life link people to myself right now until we get this worked out well when did you first contact bright heart health. How many days ago.

424
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.360
LML211BL: In three days ago. So it's pretty quick.

425
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:55.530
Dawn Abriel: Not too bad. Yeah, I was hoping to make it less than 24 hours, but we haven't been able to pull it off yet, mostly because people can't get in and do all the assessments and we need those before we can see if it's appropriate to do an outpatient care.

426
00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:06.360
LML211BL: Yeah, I probably would have been able to get into an appointment with you yesterday by I had gone to sleep. Really, really, they and I was like, mostly asleep until like four

427
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:07.830
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

428
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.810
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. All right.

429
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.280
