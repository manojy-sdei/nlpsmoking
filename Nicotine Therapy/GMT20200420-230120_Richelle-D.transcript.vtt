00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:03.899
Richelle Direny: To pinch him up.

2
00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.710
Richelle Direny: Hey,

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.870
Richelle Direny: What's going on, how was your weekend.

4
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.119
Brock Simmons: Good good size Tammy passed away. I don't know if you heard

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.870
Richelle Direny: No, I thought she was going, she was coming out of the woods in

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.490
Brock Simmons: Us that day that we had groups I missed group last week.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
Brock Simmons: I don't know what happened. She passed. Well that day last Thursday. She has

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.720
Richelle Direny: A group.

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:51.600
Brock Simmons: You have the same day as a group. Yes, she had passed that morning and time just got away from me and it was like 730 or no, it was like 830 and I realized I had missed so much going on and it's just a hectic day but

10
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.750
Brock Simmons: But other than that, things don't really good

11
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.720
Richelle Direny: Oh, because when I'm

12
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.360
Richelle Direny: Alone.

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:14.880
Richelle Direny: I know that when when we spoke last week that I remember you had asked for Yana was in group. And I said, Yeah, but she didn't mention anything and I didn't think maybe at the time it was appropriate for me to ask, like in the middle.

14
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.570
Brock Simmons: You know, kind of

15
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:29.310
Richelle Direny: Body, so I didn't ask and then today. I was like, You know what, I don't know. I know. Tammy wasn't doing good. I knew you guys are all family, friends, and if that was the case. You know, I didn't want to really bother anyone

16
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.150
Brock Simmons: I don't

17
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.260
Richelle Direny: Forget to kind of group for me, not a group session.

18
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.370
Brock Simmons: I did call you. I don't know if you can see that I tried to call you that evening for like five minutes, but never picked up. So I just wanted that and

19
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.970
Richelle Direny: You know,

20
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.650
Richelle Direny: There was one day, if not call came in and I wasn't, you know, one

21
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.970
Brock Simmons: Yeah, that was

22
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.710
Richelle Direny: A minute. I was a little confused.

23
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.390
Richelle Direny: Like what, what is this. I was so confused.

24
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:08.460
Brock Simmons: I try to get ahold of the people went to digital last but it's but I can't ever get some guys to pick up and it takes like a half hour for me to pick up. So I started, I go ahead and try to call you to see if I can make that up because I had realized that

25
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.420
Richelle Direny: You should have sent me a message. Did you send me a message right after

26
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.710
Brock Simmons: I need your phone number, because I don't have it no more and

27
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.680
Richelle Direny: You even said, I did, I did see someone caught and I was so confused by the call.

28
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.260
Brock Simmons: Yeah, let me. That way I can just get in touch with you directly and anything

29
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.300
Richelle Direny: What's your area code.

30
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:45.660
Brock Simmons: 41919419. No, it's actually 567-303-7925. That's my new number number. I got a new phone.

31
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.390
Richelle Direny: So that's the number you call me from that day.

32
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.650
Brock Simmons: No, I called you, from you this year from this zoom I call directly authors.

33
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.300
Richelle Direny: Oh, no, no. Okay, so, you know, okay, so you know how I send you a text messages.

34
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.290
Brock Simmons: Right, right.

35
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.020
Richelle Direny: That's the number you call that 561 number

36
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.990
Brock Simmons: You haven't sent me messages in a while though.

37
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.550
Well done.

38
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.020
Richelle Direny: Okay.

39
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:25.830
Brock Simmons: Lesson number 51673037935 you had wrote it down last week or the week before, and I'm not too sure what she did with it after that.

40
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.030
Richelle Direny: No. Okay.

41
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.710
Richelle Direny: I think I updated it in the system when I

42
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.420
Brock Simmons: Yeah, they were supposed to update is in the system and they never did.

43
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.830
Richelle Direny: Okay, coming. If you got it.

44
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.600
Brock Simmons: What is it

45
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.400
Richelle Direny: I just sent you a message.

46
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.560
Brock Simmons: Okay, my wife actually has the phone downstairs. I'm up in a little room that we created all this, but I'll get if you send it all happened.

47
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.420
Richelle Direny: I just said, Hi This is Michelle.

48
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.740
Richelle Direny: So that's the because I to say, to tell you the number off the top of my head. I don't. So that's why I texted you. So you could just send it

49
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.020
Richelle Direny: You could just call that number but but yes if it was that same day that she passed because the thing is, I know.

50
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:27.120
Richelle Direny: That, um, I think it was either you or someone else or Tammy or Rihanna had said something to me. So I kind of told them with bright heart. And so one of the care coordinators contacted spoke with her daughter.

51
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.150
Richelle Direny: My daughter said that she that she had the home she had to make the decision to pull the plug.

52
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.610
Richelle Direny: So wait, when you said that she's coming out of the woods. I was like, Oh, that's a big turnaround because that's

53
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.000
Brock Simmons: What

54
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:48.570
Brock Simmons: Does a sunny, which is so daughter sunny. He gave us that are things looking up and take off of that ventilator. And then she was breathing on their own at that time.

55
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:59.130
Brock Simmons: So I'm not sure what happened from the time that they pulled the plug. I know my wife's taking things really good friends, and we and we can't get ahold of me at all. Was she had

56
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.210
Richelle Direny: She had Ruby was, she was you had you had asked that because you came to the six o'clock group right

57
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.160
Richelle Direny: Is burning group you are

58
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.940
Richelle Direny: Well, she she was, she

59
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.430
Richelle Direny: Now you have me thinking.

60
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.790
Brock Simmons: BUT WE COULDN'T GET AHOLD OF HER TO FIND OUT BECAUSE WE HEARD IT THIS in somebody else's she had passed, but then we finally

61
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.810
Richelle Direny: Wasn't

62
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.860
Richelle Direny: She wasn't

63
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.550
Brock Simmons: She got it.

64
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.620
Richelle Direny: Because

65
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.160
Brock Simmons: A lot of go to the hospital and see often. I think that is bullshit.

66
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.410
Brock Simmons: That's that's the US that

67
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:41.970
Richelle Direny: So how is the daughter. How are you guys holding up because I know with everything with the coven AND THEY'RE LIMITING people from coming in and being able to get their family members to be able to have a burial.

68
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:52.200
Brock Simmons: Where they got it on hold right now that way. Hopefully I don't know why keep until May 1 because we're not at this stage one open back up and papers.

69
00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.020
Brock Simmons: But our they're going to keep her cold that long. I'm not for sure but Sonny's one delay and have a little get together may 1 or second somewhere around that time.

70
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.200
Richelle Direny: The body as long as they can hold a body. Oh, that's

71
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.760
Brock Simmons: A heard. Yeah, I think that's

72
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.100
Richelle Direny: Put them in a refrigerator and

73
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.870
Richelle Direny: Them is long and I'm because I thought the same thing.

74
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.220
Richelle Direny: They could hold them into a real long time and so

75
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.570
Brock Simmons: You know, really good. I mean, my wife took a harder than Thursday, Friday, it's tough, but other than that.

76
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.070
Brock Simmons: I mean it happens.

77
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:35.670
Brock Simmons: I'm just upset that people's loved ones are up here at the hospital and they're sick and they didn't allow people to come in and see him. I don't see how they get away with us.

78
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.060
Richelle Direny: I get you know what they're looking at it from the standpoint of it seems cold hearted. It seems wrong.

79
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.780
Richelle Direny: How can you do it, but then you're putting other

80
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:54.480
Richelle Direny: You're putting yourself at risk because if you know you come and you see me and I have exposed for covert or what have you.

81
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.430
Richelle Direny: Write what you just want to see me. But now you just got exposed. Now you're going out you're exposing your family and everybody else that's out there.

82
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.370
Richelle Direny: So they're looking at it from that standpoint, so

83
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:15.300
Richelle Direny: from an emotional standpoint, we're going to look at it like, How dare you, because that's our emotional we're looking through the lens of our emotion in comparison to looking through the lens.

84
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:24.990
Richelle Direny: Of, you know, what can spin out of that, um, I would only assume if it was a child, it was, it would have been different.

85
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.200
Brock Simmons: Right, I understand. I just thought, oh, it's just sad for them. I mean, they lay up there.

86
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.430
Brock Simmons: That's that's sad really sad.

87
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:47.280
Richelle Direny: And that's my one. I wonder if like people, you know, outside of them being ill inside of everything going on. Um, I wonder if what accelerates it or

88
00:07:48.570 --> 00:08:01.230
Richelle Direny: Is this is just my mind I and I always say, I'm not a professional, you know, depression sets in loneliness sets in, you get like all of that. So when you're you somewhat give up because, just think about if you're

89
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:07.440
Richelle Direny: You're who you live alone and no one comes to see you and you're always alone, what's gonna happen.

90
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.210
Brock Simmons: Yeah. It's sad. I don't know.

91
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:24.180
Brock Simmons: That's where I was grieving the most is set up there all by itself. That's where I was taking me I don't I don't want my worst enemy to die like that, you know, this is what

92
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.780
Brock Simmons: It's over with. Now, I mean she chose to do things that she knew was for killers, so

93
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:40.260
Brock Simmons: All the way up until the time she died. I guess for crystal meth. So I don't know how true that is that's just what we've been told.

94
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.820
Brock Simmons: I don't

95
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.080
Richelle Direny: Know why right now it's you know room. You're going to hear all kinds of things.

96
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.620
On

97
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:57.870
Richelle Direny: And that's it. Like I was talking to someone else. The other day, I mean, today I'm even if it's true what what is what. What purpose does that information.

98
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.070
Brock Simmons: Service rather

99
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.840
Brock Simmons: Purpose at all right.

100
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.590
Richelle Direny: It's there's no purpose. Okay. She did okay whatever she's still gone

101
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.880
Richelle Direny: So I think at this point, it's just remembering, you know, the good times that you had with her the memories of her

102
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.890
Richelle Direny: Her hurting daughter her hurting grandchildren, because you know

103
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.120
Yeah.

104
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:31.440
Brock Simmons: That was actually that's not her real daughter, she never had kids, she wanted kids all her life. And she ended up raising Sony. So since she was a baby and so brother's daughter.

105
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.930
Richelle Direny: But she critically her nice

106
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.220
Yeah.

107
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.820
Richelle Direny: That's I'm sure that was her daughter and I'm sure that that's my mom.

108
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:57.150
Richelle Direny: Absolutely. So, you know, regardless of what it is, it's, it's still a loss, it's, it's a loss. It's a friend that you lost. Um, and, you know, so it kind of sets the like segue into to this.

109
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.030
Richelle Direny: For you thinking about

110
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:13.650
Richelle Direny: As you're saying, for a moment, taking what you know about Tammy what little that you may know, or what little that you can information that you know in the things that she's done and somewhat

111
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.310
Richelle Direny: Allow it to be a mirror to your life.

112
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.080
Richelle Direny: Like you said, the statement is, well, you know, she did things

113
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.670
That

114
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.060
Richelle Direny: Would have accelerated this process, you understand

115
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.350
Brock Simmons: Right. Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:41.610
Richelle Direny: So it, take it in marry yourself and saying, You know what, Brock, this is a, a friend, a sister. This is someone that was close to our family.

117
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:51.750
Richelle Direny: Right now, she's gone. There is no turning around, she started her journey. But as soon as she started her journey. Her journey ended.

118
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.680
Brock Simmons: Right.

119
00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:00.240
Richelle Direny: So you have to think of it like that. Like I know someone who I'm literally. He was in his

120
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.820
Richelle Direny: 80s, I think it was. Yeah, he was in his 80s.

121
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.690
Richelle Direny: And he was a late 80s, maybe going into 90 but he was an alcoholic.

122
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:13.650
Brock Simmons: Right.

123
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.780
Richelle Direny: And Karen tell you what kept him alive.

124
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.490
Brock Simmons: What's that love

125
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.040
Brock Simmons: Well,

126
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.440
Richelle Direny: Because he did it so much.

127
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:37.350
Richelle Direny: Right, that his body. When the the he I guess he fell and something, how I hear the story is that he felt and in him falling. They knew something was wrong. His wife knew something was wrong with him because he wouldn't drink.

128
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.090
Richelle Direny: And so because he had stopped drinking in the few days he stopped to

129
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:49.020
Richelle Direny: Stop drinking his body probably started reacting to all of it now his body started to fall apart.

130
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:57.810
Richelle Direny: And then eventually he passed away. So it's kind of, I mean, I don't know what Tammy story is, and I don't know how long she's been on the drug or whatever the situation is

131
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:07.710
Richelle Direny: But do you take that just taking these little itty bitty information from other people and just think about yourself insane. Life is short.

132
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.860
Richelle Direny: No matter how long we think it is life is

133
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.040
Richelle Direny: Short things that can accelerate

134
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.150
Richelle Direny: The process is the things that we engage in

135
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.060
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

136
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Brock Simmons: I said, Exactly. I've, I've been thinking about it. Ever since terms, that means every day. I've been thinking about it.

137
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:38.010
Brock Simmons: So it's definitely. I mean, I've been doing good. I haven't been relapse or anything like that. Knock on wood, but yeah, I think about two things all the time. I mean, just

138
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.340
Richelle Direny: Be see

139
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.420
Brock Simmons: What I have no hang on to the smallest don't sweat the small stuff.

140
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.400
Richelle Direny: Don't do this.

141
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.050
Brock Simmons: Stuff right

142
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:53.910
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and it's small, um, you know, you have like your wife, you have your children that are home and then your children that are out of the home.

143
00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:07.830
Richelle Direny: On that. That's a big like that family is grieving this individual, and whatever that in the grief that you see is nothing compared to what they experienced behind closed doors.

144
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.820
Richelle Direny: So, you know, for you. It's just, I'm processing that for for

145
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:22.860
Brock Simmons: Right. So if you want to make a note we put in your computer. I don't tell whoever's in charge it

146
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.600
Richelle Direny: Will Natalie. I just want Natalie, because I know she had cushy I didn't choir.

147
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:45.000
Brock Simmons: Yes, yeah. Ball. Yeah, she is going. That's what's really mind blowing, is that we got the good news is, she was one of the portal and all sudden it just was like a smack in the face that she had already passed. So it's something took a turn, whatever it was. I don't know what happened but

148
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.720
Brock Simmons: He's in a band now.

149
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.440
Richelle Direny: He's in a place no more pain.

150
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.230
Brock Simmons: But only and I did watch the video Jackie.

151
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.730
Brock Simmons: I can't forget what other name is jack

152
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.710
Richelle Direny: Peri Peri Jackie Perry.

153
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.880
Brock Simmons: Yeah. Jackie, Barry. I did watch that video live

154
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.150
Brock Simmons: I liked it and she has a good influence on things like I've actually watched to

155
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.760
Brock Simmons: Pass that one and watched another one because it kind of gave me the chills on some of the stuff you will talk about

156
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:33.510
Brock Simmons: She makes you want to try them here. Some of the stuff she talks about. It's really touched me this. I've actually I like a lot. I'm trying to get my wife and watching me, but she shiny daughter yeah but she'll come up with wine.

157
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:39.990
Richelle Direny: Hold on.

158
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.030
Brock Simmons: You have a good weekend.

159
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.950
Richelle Direny: Yeah, hold on. One moment. Okay.

160
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.820
Yeah.

161
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.000
Brock Simmons: Hey,

162
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.800
Brock Simmons: Hey,

163
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:28.530
Richelle Direny: Sorry about that little one, he wanted. He has like a little Wi Fi phone that he plays game or whatever. So they wanted it. I'm so sorry about that.

164
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.770
Brock Simmons: Not a problem. A little alone. So I know

165
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.950
Richelle Direny: I was asking you, I'm

166
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.930
Richelle Direny: What I was saying to you.

167
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:53.430
Richelle Direny: Did the thing with her. What I like about her because I started kind of following her as well is that she um she takes, pretty much. It's like okay she has a Biblical perspective, but she puts real life.

168
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.170
Richelle Direny: Reality with

169
00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:02.370
Richelle Direny: This. So, um, it maybe eventually your wife will join you. If you find one that

170
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:03.840
Brock Simmons: She will

171
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.300
Richelle Direny: What what stood out to you the most.

172
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.980
Brock Simmons: What's that

173
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.030
Richelle Direny: What stood out to you. Animals that made it interesting to watch a second one.

174
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:20.250
Brock Simmons: Um, I don't know just what this staff, the outlook, she has on things very, I don't know, she's

175
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:29.250
Brock Simmons: I can't explain it. I don't know. I don't know if you wanna. I don't know. It was really touching and she was just she lived that life of being

176
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:42.300
Brock Simmons: Criticized and stuff for being gay or whatnot, or whatever it is. And I don't know, I just kind of touch far so aren't really like that all the time, it is I can't explain it. It just kind of hit home or it was

177
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:49.050
Brock Simmons: Everything she talked about she has an explanation, very good with what she says the words that she says

178
00:16:50.880 --> 00:17:03.990
Brock Simmons: My spirituality, I've kind of like that away from all that for a long period of time. So I'm just now getting back into gwan charts and stuff like that. Just watching that the Holy Ghost from. Oh, no. That's what we call it, but

179
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.300
Brock Simmons: She started crying. And here I'm getting all worked up

180
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.580
Brock Simmons: And

181
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.250
Brock Simmons: I really do want to watch another video maybe tonight before I go to work, sometime this

182
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.750
Richelle Direny: Was the latter like after I watched the first one I started kind of bingeing the video.

183
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.320
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah, that's how I'm doing lately, and it's like

184
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:40.470
Brock Simmons: She just has a very good way of getting a point across. And she talks about things very educational with, you know, the whole spirituality aspect of it. So I really like I'm going to continue to patches, so

185
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:48.810
Richelle Direny: Well, one of the things that she did say what I liked what stood out was that like, especially as it's related to your son like at the end of the day, you still have to love them.

186
00:17:49.260 --> 00:18:07.800
Richelle Direny: Like right never stopped loving them regardless of if you don't agree with maybe their lifestyle because or whatever it is you love them and that's kind of were like, you know, feeling like an outcast. And, and I think that's the deepest when you're your own family turns against yeah

187
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:24.810
Brock Simmons: Yeah, and I actually listened to the church that she was attending. I don't know, she attends that same chose our level of basis or she switches what the guy that was that lead to death church. He actually had a good time herbaceous wants to do. He was very good. I don't know.

188
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.620
Brock Simmons: It was one in Illinois. I know that I need to

189
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:35.190
Richelle Direny: Think I don't know she I think she visit, Sarah. I think they used to live there. I don't know what her she attends I just know that

190
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.820
Richelle Direny: I think. She's a, she's a speaker so she goes.

191
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:39.840
Richelle Direny: To different places.

192
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.180
Brock Simmons: And she crossed. Absolutely.

193
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.600
Richelle Direny: So, but it's very interrelated. But if you find that it's touching other aspects and other areas that I think for you.

194
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.970
Richelle Direny: Now segue into kind of one of the things that may look to see you.

195
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:02.550
Brock Simmons: Yeah, and just gives me a different outlook one how my son fils and just the things that she went through people criticize stuff.

196
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.510
Brock Simmons: I mean, I, I'm starting to come around with the whole thing. I mean, we'll get along so much better than what we was

197
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:23.610
Brock Simmons: I'm just like one except it was hard for a long time, but finally come around just accepted it in English so much better than what it was and not as toxic arguing all the time.

198
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.700
Richelle Direny: Difference. So the question is, is it that you're accepting of

199
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.420
Richelle Direny: How would I say

200
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:42.720
Richelle Direny: Are you accepting of the lifestyle or are you accepting of the choice because I think that's a different if you're accepting of like at the end of the day.

201
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:53.460
Richelle Direny: His choices. His choice. There's nothing like you make your own choices. Your wife makes her choices, all of your children make their choices. We have to come to a place of accepting their choices.

202
00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:05.940
Richelle Direny: What they have to understand this is your choice. Whatever comes beyond that. Remember it is your choice. And you have to live out whatever your what comes with those choices.

203
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:24.120
Richelle Direny: And that I may not necessarily agree with it, but it's still your choices and it doesn't change my love because at the end of the day, it's still your child and you still love your child, but you have to just be accepting of their choices. And that's what it is.

204
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.730
Richelle Direny: Right, you understand if you're trying to

205
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.690
Richelle Direny: Feed for a murder. Are you going to stop loving them simply because

206
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:44.490
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah, I think, a little bit of both. I accept both. I mean, the choices that he makes or just I'm there for him. Regardless, now, and I don't have to worry about criticizing the move over.

207
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:54.120
Brock Simmons: I just expected more as my first son, that's all i just i wanted more. And I played sports growing up and I wanted, I just had so much more plan.

208
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.340
Brock Simmons: They just read verse. But what am I going to get through it.

209
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:02.040
Brock Simmons: I don't. Oh.

210
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:14.340
Richelle Direny: I see, I think, would it make you feel, I don't feel better is, though, but it. Look at the lens all parents every last one of us. Mom, Dad, every last one of us.

211
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:20.220
Richelle Direny: Right children. We all have certain expectations of our children.

212
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.970
Brock Simmons: Right and disappointment as well. I just want

213
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:36.450
Richelle Direny: That but it's not about the disappointments right now you have great if you're if you're a big football fan. If you're a football player, you have a son, what do you immediately expect

214
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.620
Brock Simmons: Right.

215
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.930
Richelle Direny: He's gonna bring on that mantle. Right.

216
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.130
Absolutely.

217
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.440
Richelle Direny: But then he likes battling

218
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.920
Brock Simmons: When I went through like ballet and all

219
00:21:52.980 --> 00:22:05.130
Richelle Direny: That. So that's like a humongous like here's a took a dagger to my heart. What do you mean you like ballet. That's not what I had for you, but this is not about you said about your life. It's about fears and what it is that they want to do.

220
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:14.340
Richelle Direny: Except in the years to come to a place of acceptance of that. And I think that's all of us have to deal with that and go through that, you know, in our

221
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:25.170
Brock Simmons: longest time I thought it was something that I had done on me. I put a lot of guilt on me. I mean, what did I do wrong because I did go to prison for a long time. I wasn't there. So,

222
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:36.570
Brock Simmons: It was just a big is chaos. For the longest time, but I would definitely is so much better. We are now. I still have problems when friends come over. I mean, I still kind of

223
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.080
Brock Simmons: That he's 17 but to be 18 so

224
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.030
Brock Simmons: I still have some trouble some problems with certain things, but

225
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:56.580
Richelle Direny: There are certain rules and guidelines. So you believe that you have. Do you, do you have certain rules in your home that you want them to always respect.

226
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.510
Brock Simmons: Yeah, absolutely. I got rules. Yeah.

227
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.380
Richelle Direny: Well that's and that's just how you have to look at it.

228
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.540
Richelle Direny: You don't have to bend your rules to prove that you're accepting anything

229
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.560
Brock Simmons: Right.

230
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.690
Richelle Direny: You have rules you have rules if if you if you have daughters. Right.

231
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.490
Brock Simmons: Yeah we up to

232
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:25.080
Richelle Direny: Okay. Are you or is one of your rules is that you can't have any you can't bring bring in a whole bunch of men in my house.

233
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.600
Brock Simmons: Right yeah after nine o'clock 10 O'clock 10 o'clock the latest trends are going on. Yeah, that's

234
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:39.090
Richelle Direny: Well, now are you going to not bend the rules because she says that. Oh, you don't love me and you don't accept me and are you on your rules because of that.

235
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.170
No.

236
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.240
Brock Simmons: Not at all.

237
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.330
Richelle Direny: Tell your wife, it's me. Who sent you the text.

238
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.280
Brock Simmons: Bad

239
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.430
Brock Simmons: She's downstairs, she she come up and open the door and she's trying to say something.

240
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.800
Richelle Direny: Sorry, just me who said

241
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:08.880
Brock Simmons: Do you have a date and time for our next individual push way out. Or I mean I'm not rushing or anything like that. I just wanted to

242
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.500
Richelle Direny: Know,

243
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:20.970
Brock Simmons: I mean you guys must be getting super busy with clients. I mean, you seem like you push two weeks out every time I said one appointment.

244
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and it would be to eat fat.

245
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.290
Brock Simmons: So the whole

246
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.320
Brock Simmons: Right. Her health. She must be doing pretty good. Now, I mean, when I first went

247
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.690
Richelle Direny: Into consideration. I'm push two weeks out because majority of the people I see her in the evening.

248
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.150
Brock Simmons: Oh, yeah.

249
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.730
Richelle Direny: If I was during a during the day, it probably wouldn't be as bad. And then everyone has, you know,

250
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:58.800
Richelle Direny: Until in the other thing is that when people don't show for their appointments, it makes it really hard because they fill them in different slots so the two weeks that would bring you to the 11th.

251
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.870
Brock Simmons: Yeah, look.

252
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.080
Richelle Direny: At five. Okay.

253
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:23.820
Brock Simmons: That'll work. I have another question for you too will show I run out of medicine Wednesday, I won't have no muscle Wednesday I don't go till Thursday but it'd be all right. Just go over till Thursday, or should I try to get a hold of the dark. I mean, it's no big deal. I will wait a day.

254
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.200
Brock Simmons: I've just

255
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.510
Richelle Direny: Heard no because I thought that

256
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.910
Richelle Direny: Wednesday is the last day. You take your men.

257
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.150
Brock Simmons: So the Tuesday evening, be my last job, so I'll be out Wednesday and Thursday.

258
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:44.940
Richelle Direny: Alright, so I'll let her know because technically it's supposed to. I think your last those would be Wednesday. And then when you see her on Thursday, you get your next

259
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:52.440
Brock Simmons: Slide. But what happened to pharmacy didn't fill them till they weren't feeling that day, she put them in. So I was already a day late on getting them.

260
00:25:54.330 --> 00:26:04.230
Brock Simmons: I don't know how it sounded out. But somehow, and I'll be out Tuesday. So I don't know. I can't wait till those dates and that's no big deal, but I didn't know if you could send me an email or what

261
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.780
Brock Simmons: The deal was because

262
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.130
Richelle Direny: I can. What group do you come to you come to the six o'clock or

263
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:25.200
Brock Simmons: This Thursday. I'm going to come to the 12 to one, because we have a we're going to go to Tammy, so it'll get together that evening, so I won't be able to attend to six to 7am until 12 the one

264
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.000
Richelle Direny: Are you still working.

265
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.740
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I'm still working well.

266
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.140
Brock Simmons: Ya know,

267
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.280
Brock Simmons: And I

268
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:32.730
Didn't get

269
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:46.470
Brock Simmons: We didn't get laid off because I would making parts actually for the coronavirus testing little springs for the virus testing panels or whatever supposedly

270
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.640
Brock Simmons: Our

271
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:59.670
Brock Simmons: Old School screw shop and that's when making on for the testing. I don't know what it is. I haven't got the full details, but so we tiny little screw our spring that we make for so

272
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:10.770
Brock Simmons: I got lucky. I mean, I wanted to get laid off to first within us more I think about. I'm glad I did. Because when we probably never make it. We are

273
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.410
Richelle Direny: You said you wanted to get later.

274
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:26.700
Brock Simmons: Yeah. First, I was hoping that we did. I was kind of pissed off. But then I started thinking how I won't be able to make it on $300 a week on employment. I mean, that would be they're devastated really

275
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:33.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and then you would, um, you know, it's that easy. Get an attractive, depending on what your traders.

276
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:45.990
Brock Simmons: Yeah. And then I never did get my stimulus money, neither. They never did deposit in my money, but hopefully they'll have that worked out this week supposed to have it worked out this week.

277
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.410
Richelle Direny: Okay, how can I want to go over

278
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.410
Brock Simmons: My wife got hers, but I didn't get it.

279
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.050
Brock Simmons: So I'm not sure. We'll get it figured out this week about a lot of

280
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:16.140
Richelle Direny: No, no, no, no one in her like with Tammy or her family or anything like that. No one was exposed

281
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.150
Brock Simmons: They were

282
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.850
Richelle Direny: They were nobody was exposed to the coronavirus

283
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:32.580
Brock Simmons: No, nothing like that. No, not that we're aware of. We're talking about that too. I think this weekend, we'll just talk about it because she just got very sick fast like

284
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:46.230
Brock Simmons: From the videos where we use on when she was have hardly ever in the video. But then when she was in the videos were very bad. I don't know what happened. I will never know the truth. I mean, Tammy only knows

285
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.380
Richelle Direny: Everything on the reason why I asked about the corona because there's something that you also have to think

286
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.510
Richelle Direny: About is that I'm

287
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:03.150
Richelle Direny: Being exposed to the corona where it is a respiratory I'm thing.

288
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.170
Brock Simmons: Right.

289
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:12.990
Richelle Direny: I don't like you are a smoker. So, you know, if you were ever supposed to contracted, given that your lungs are already compromised. You also have to

290
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:24.750
Richelle Direny: Kind of have that knowledge that you don't want to put yourself in harm's way, because I'm sure if you've ever gotten a coal. It seems like 10 times worse for you because

291
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.970
Sorry harder.

292
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:38.700
Brock Simmons: As far as I know, she never did contract the virus, but we haven't seen we haven't been in contact with her probably a good month before she died so

293
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:48.120
Brock Simmons: It may be longer than a motivated than a month and a half. You didn't go down and see, she was into other things in my life. But I know part of that.

294
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:54.990
Brock Simmons: She had people hanging out down and this one's no good. So my wife did was for down

295
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.780
Brock Simmons: I hope she didn't. I mean, will say we didn't. We haven't had no contact with him.

296
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.380
Richelle Direny: Alright, man. Alright, let me look at your plan here.

297
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.060
Brock Simmons: What is the Florida open them back up and he said when everyone open the state that

298
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.180
Richelle Direny: Seems like they're opening of the whole United States me first.

299
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.180
Richelle Direny: Say that earlier that they're opening it up, me first.

300
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:32.280
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I don't know if that's a good idea. They should I think we should wait a little bit longer but everybody's in a big hurry to get

301
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:41.100
Richelle Direny: You can go out there. First, let me see if anything happens to you, and then I decide whether or not I want to go.

302
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:51.000
Brock Simmons: I'm not in it every day, every night. So I mean that's it's scary, but at the same time, it's gotta be. It's gotta do.

303
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.130
Mm hmm.

304
00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:12.660
Richelle Direny: I wanted to ask you, um, so let's take the next like 20 minutes 2025 minutes to kind of talk about, you know, what are your goals. Like, what are some of your exclusively in light of everything that's going on now things that maybe you have experienced um

305
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:23.610
Richelle Direny: You're on your journey and like you said that you know you're doing you're in a better place. And today you haven't done any relax, you're feeling much better and

306
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:33.660
Richelle Direny: Everything as it is right now. What are some of what's your long term goal. And that's kind of how we come up with a short term goal.

307
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:53.610
Brock Simmons: I know we had talked before I have 12% left on my phone and I don't have an extension for two weeks over there, but we should be okay. We talked before about education. I don't have my diploma. I don't have any kind of education on my drop out. So that has always been told.

308
00:31:54.750 --> 00:32:04.680
Brock Simmons: Not too long ago I took the test and I had passed it. But then took the test and have failed it. That was two years ago. So I don't know if you consider that a long term goal.

309
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.760
Richelle Direny: What do you want to get your GED.

310
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.600
Richelle Direny: You know you did. You did.

311
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.750
Richelle Direny: You did not get a high school diploma.

312
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.310
Brock Simmons: No, no, I

313
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.610
Richelle Direny: I get your GED.

314
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.870
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah.

315
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:29.130
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's a goal that's a long term goal because that's something you're gonna work towards. Now the what your objective is, is that how are you going to work towards getting back

316
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:44.490
Brock Simmons: Right. Well, I mean, that for sure to China me opens back up to, you know, schedule appointment and gets a professional and you got to go through classes here in Ohio. So I'm waiting for, but

317
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.300
Brock Simmons: You got to go to classes once a week, twice a week, I think.

318
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.050
Brock Simmons: Eventually work the way up to take the test.

319
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.250
Brock Simmons: So that was that was

320
00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.430
Richelle Direny: Your goal you want to, you want to be able to get your GED in the next six months to a year.

321
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:16.110
Brock Simmons: Yeah, absolutely. Within the next 90 days, really. I mean to take the test. I'd like to take the test within 90 days because I get a rate at my job if I do get my GED. They didn't want me to get it and I just asked me.

322
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.670
Brock Simmons: So I did a $2 raise as soon as I get my GV

323
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.150
Richelle Direny: You think you got to diaries.

324
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:31.020
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I will get a $2 raise if I get my GED. So within the next 90 days, I would like to at least

325
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.480
Brock Simmons: That's my goal and

326
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.340
Brock Simmons: I don't know if that's too short time span timestamp, but

327
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.380
Richelle Direny: Well, it is.

328
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.100
Richelle Direny: Because you don't want to. You don't want to set yourself up for failure.

329
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.270
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah, don't worry.

330
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.480
Richelle Direny: About, um, how long have you been out of school.

331
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.270
Brock Simmons: Since a nice break how

332
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:57.060
Brock Simmons: Long time good 15 years 20 years yeah about 20

333
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.420
Richelle Direny: Okay, so think about this, what, how old are you now.

334
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:09.210
Richelle Direny: 35 okay so you would 35 ninth grade. So you're saying

335
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.610
Richelle Direny: Maybe a good

336
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:16.410
Richelle Direny: 19 1819 1819 years

337
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:24.030
Richelle Direny: So if you think about that you've been out of school and you've been out of the game, a long time.

338
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:37.410
Brock Simmons: Yeah, but at the same time. So I went to detoxes and I went to school there too. I went to CBC, and I went to school. The whole six months I was there. So I kind of doubt request a little bit or

339
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:38.730
Richelle Direny: Go with that.

340
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:48.960
Brock Simmons: Let's say that one was probably two years ago I was in crossroads back in 2016. So that would be my last times 2016

341
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:58.410
Richelle Direny: I were in 20. So that's four years ago going on for years ago maybe not a full four years ago. It's still your brain is

342
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:08.490
Richelle Direny: Because remember, a GED. Is that a cumulative of everything that you would have learned in school, they're going to put on on a test and you have to be able to pass it.

343
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.050
Richelle Direny: But so

344
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.060
Richelle Direny: You have to be realistic to

345
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:25.710
Richelle Direny: How, when you were in school. If you did apply yourself. Where are you, did you grasp the information quickly did it take you a little while longer than other people to get the information

346
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:33.390
Brock Simmons: I've always been a fast one I'm usually pretty fast. I mean, I'm not very not I wouldn't say

347
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.440
Brock Simmons: I would say average I picked up really quick. I mean, a

348
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.740
Brock Simmons: Thumbs up fairly quick. And while I go over it and

349
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.700
Brock Simmons: Let's say, six months. Let's just go with the time frame.

350
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.110
Richelle Direny: So it's just thinking

351
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.580
Richelle Direny: I think six months because then it gives you that amount of time.

352
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.910
Richelle Direny: To one with the economy.

353
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:54.840
Right.

354
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:01.500
Richelle Direny: To be able to start applying for the program, getting the materials and studying a little bit because you have to make

355
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:15.630
Richelle Direny: You have to structure yourself. You have to make a realistic goal, like every day for maybe an hour, you're going to review the information and then set that time to study. I mean, I don't know how you might be a little bit different. I did it.

356
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:28.470
Richelle Direny: With someone here in Florida, and it wasn't like they said it was an it's a cumulative exam. Um, you can test out of it. If you feel some people could go and just didn't they test right out of it.

357
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.280
Richelle Direny: You want to wait to study help your kids in school.

358
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:45.210
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I've tried that and instead of waiting to teach our kids nowadays math and someone cares so much different than what we learned this lattice stuff. And I just, I don't understand it. I will

359
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.530
Brock Simmons: Just do a simple, you know, carry a one over and they know stuff like that. I did not understand this, if

360
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.160
Richelle Direny: I could tell you right now. Google is your friend.

361
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.780
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah.

362
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.530
Richelle Direny: Google is your friend. Hold on.

363
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.090
Brock Simmons: But yeah, that is one of my long term goals here lately is the GD and then

364
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.490
Brock Simmons: I don't know. I really haven't thought outside of that. Be honest.

365
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:24.420
Richelle Direny: So one of the ways I'm in the next, we're in April. So the first which is technically next week. They're talking about opening up everything.

366
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:32.550
Richelle Direny: So I would say in the next month and a half, you will gather all the information that you will need.

367
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.100
Richelle Direny: To start the process.

368
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:51.960
Brock Simmons: Right, absolutely. Yeah, I spoke with my supervisor at work and I told them. I told him by the end of this month. By the end of May, I would have been class taken hopefully to take it because they want to move me up. They want to promote me to a

369
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.780
Brock Simmons: Different position so that is definitely something I will be getting on so

370
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.270
Richelle Direny: Again, you don't want to. Oh, because sometimes we don't realize how much stress we put on ourselves because we make these

371
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:23.640
Richelle Direny: You won your husband, your, your father. You have to provide you have to do all these things and you don't want to put too much stressors on yourself and you put these goals and you try to meet them and then you get frustrated because you can't meet them.

372
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.770
Richelle Direny: Can do that.

373
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:40.830
Brock Simmons: I've done it several times I get overwhelmed and I just, I've actually relapsed a couple times like that because I would get so overwhelmed with the things that I would schedule or it's just it it's asking so I definitely know what you're talking about there.

374
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:52.200
Richelle Direny: I'm so one of the goals I would put it identify any barriers that will hinder you from

375
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.660
Richelle Direny: Meeting. Your goal you at least for short term goal.

376
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:06.090
Richelle Direny: Because you on you. You have to be able to identify any buyer to meet your short term goal, which is trying to get into the next six months.

377
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.660
Brock Simmons: And what do you say a month and a half, like

378
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:25.590
Richelle Direny: In a month and a half, you're going to give yourself a month and a half to at least gather whatever information is required to start the program. So whether it's calling the school. I'm getting whatever materials they tell you to get that's what you're doing.

379
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:34.530
Richelle Direny: All right, then you're going to identify the barriers. That's going to stop it. Because if you identify the barriers, then

380
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:44.460
Richelle Direny: Ultimately, you just said one of your triggers is when you get overwhelmed, is that I mean one of your triggers is getting overwhelmed and that leads to a relapse. So if

381
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:58.590
Richelle Direny: You set this goal a month and a half, even if it happens in the next three weeks. Wonderful. But you're giving yourself mentally. I have a month and a half in that time, I'm going to identify any barriers. That's going to stop me.

382
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.510
Richelle Direny: And why like and verify those barriers. What I'm going to do is set on

383
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:15.300
Richelle Direny: That maybe how long do you think for you in the time with work and everything that you have going on that you can say you can study each day.

384
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:28.140
Brock Simmons: He say I have five minutes. I mean, I usually sleep till about 230 or three. That was the time that my son would get home from school, so I would have at least a good hour, hour and a half.

385
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:38.070
Brock Simmons: It would definitely changed on Thursdays that I have stuff like that, of course, but a bitchy Lauer's. I mean, that's

386
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.960
Richelle Direny: I say you will study a minimum of one hour each day.

387
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.940
Brock Simmons: Our that's our that's

388
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:59.490
Richelle Direny: A minimum because if you can put more into it. But if you say a minimum of one hour, then it will you got 24 hours in a day, even if you say after because remember your ultimate goal is that you want to get a race.

389
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.140
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah, absolutely.

390
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.450
Richelle Direny: So I want to get my DG which

391
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.290
Richelle Direny: Will ultimately

392
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.110
Brock Simmons: Well you got like a case plan or something that you got to do that.

393
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:22.230
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, like you're a goal that you're working like what every time that we meet, what are you working towards

394
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.670
Richelle Direny: And then you change it.

395
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:39.360
Richelle Direny: So in that. Meantime, you're able. So in terms of a relapse prevention program you're identifying all of that because you're not we're not going to talk about alcohol. Every time we speak, you're talking about those things that will cause a relax.

396
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:40.290
Right.

397
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.920
Richelle Direny: It will study a minimum of one hour.

398
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.080
Richelle Direny: Six days.

399
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.000
Brock Simmons: A week

400
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you have to give yourself if you study more. That's fine.

401
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.650
Brock Simmons: You have to give yourself a day.

402
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:24.960

405
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:55.170
Richelle Direny: That's it. You should be able to accomplish it. And I think you know what I personally don't like taking cumulative exams, only because our comprehensive is what they say. Um, I don't like taking them because you tell me this study all this stuff.

406
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.080
