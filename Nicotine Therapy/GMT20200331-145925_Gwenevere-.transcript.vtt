16
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: My part is, I'm here, I'm an independent contractor. All I ask is, when people scheduled, but they keep it. That's the part that's it. When you schedule you keep it, that's all.

17
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

18
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into how you're doing over there. You still working.

19
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.700
Shaun W.: Yeah, yeah, I'm still working.

20
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.320
All right, what are the

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the relationships like at work and you tension over there.

22
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.410
No.

23
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.000
Shaun W.: I don't really talk to people, I just worked with we work so fast that uses Kevin talked that much.

24
00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um, let's see, I think there is trying to save some money trying to get a car so that maybe you could hit out on your

25
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Own not kind of

26
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang up the house. I don't know why that there's kinda delay on that there's could be saving money. I don't know.

27
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:19.020
Shaun W.: Yeah, that's the only thing I'm doing saving money trying to buy a car. I got because I don't want to buy a studio score. So I got my license. Finally, so now I'm just waiting to buy a car.

28
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

29
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about

30
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about why the quality of the car means so much to tell me about that value.

31
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.270
Shaun W.: Just, just how it runs. I don't care how it looks. I just care how it runs

32
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to break down the middle of nowhere.

33
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.690
Shaun W.: Yeah, there were a way to work or something you

34
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

35
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let me just see. Do we have anything specific about that. I want to succeed in life. You said I want to get a job. I think we need to close that. I mean, you just have a job. Let's just, let's just close that one. What

36
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.580
Shaun W.: Do you think yeah

37
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. What if we change it to something around getting a car, maybe about getting your own place if that is a goal you have

38
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.090
Shaun W.: Yeah, that is

39
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.050
Shaun W.: Just waiting to get a car because once once I get a place. I'm not gonna build save money.

40
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.560
Shaun W.: Because, already pay child support rating. So I don't make that much either. I mean, so that's why I got to get a card for you to please. Yeah.

41
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I get it.

42
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Cut down here at this new area for completed goals. Nicely done.

43
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.450
Achieved

44
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.860
Slash

45
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.930
Close.

46
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are tempers

47
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: With living with your mom at this point are you guys able to kind of keep

48
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.420
Shaun W.: It at a pretty low level.

49
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.510
Shaun W.: Yeah, we don't talk too much.

50
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's how you pull that off. You just kind of avoid each

51
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.990
Other

52
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not ideal, but that's people are not over the years. That's the only way to do it.

53
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.670
Shaun W.: Yeah.

54
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.640
Shaun W.: She's, she's achieve adorable.

55
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.720
Yeah.

56
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.180
Shaun W.: She's different manager.

57
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm feeling distance or cut off from other people. And is it feeling even more cut off and distant with this shelter sort of status that your status in

58
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.750
Shaun W.: Know I like here, I feel good linear. It's chill.

59
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't mind being away from people that that works for you.

60
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.180
Shaun W.: Okay, with a way for people. Yes. Yes. I was worried about moving, moving by myself. So that's what I was worried about like being away from my family because I

61
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:03.960
Shaun W.: I like being around my family like the kids and I like being around them. Right. So when I moved by myself I want to be alone. I mean, okay. We talked to the white. So I don't have friends.

62
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me ask about that which kids are you talking about

63
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.720
Shaun W.: That you're around my nephew niece.

64
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.740
Shaun W.: Or nephew or niece.

65
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Nephew niece and you would be moving. If you could move somewhere.

66
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.260
Where would you be moving

67
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.930
Shaun W.: I don't know.

68
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.590
Shaun W.: Okay, what it's probably gonna have to be in the hood somewhere. So it's the poly

69
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then you'd be putting yourself in proximity of that same environment that got you to begin with. So that's not ideal.

70
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.700
Shaun W.: It's just, that's the cheapest housing, you can get here in Albuquerque is over there.

71
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.870
Shaun W.: Get a two bedroom where you get it to better for 500 bucks.

72
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.030
Shaun W.: Yeah well be that one right now he has one next door to me or $500 for two bedroom.

73
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

74
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That was no no

75
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And no way that you could live somewhere in a little different environment with less better environment better neighborhood with less that's not in your scope of reasonable

76
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.010
Shaun W.: That's not not how you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, I want to live in a good. I don't want to leave.

77
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.720
Shaun W.: But

78
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.100
Shaun W.: It's like the one place when you're a felony, that's hard to get a place to live.

79
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.630
Shaun W.: It's hard to even find a job like I went to so many interviews and what I told him to fill in the interview, just stop right there ever one time is Lady already hired me

80
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:48.060
Shaun W.: I said, Oh, by the way, you know, I fell into that she was like huh that already put it on my paperwork. I think I was filling this you already hired me everything that she ended right there.

81
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you manage this one. Was it like I never

82
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.570
Shaun W.: Hire

83
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.220
Shaun W.: You today. I went to

84
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.040
Shaun W.: I went to an interview with some lady was all. Hey, I know this place that does hire felons, and they started $12 an hour and I was aware of that and she told me so I walked in I found it.

85
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:12.240
Shaun W.: And then I went in there. They said, Hey, you got to go through this temp agency, we only hire to the tip agency. And so I went to that temp agency and hired me

86
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.760
Shaun W.: But they hire felons, which are felonies have to be older than seven years, but so by felonies. We're back from all night.

87
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just curious. I know people that are in a pinch. Just the way you're describing, and I've said

88
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to your P O and see if they have bonded jobs that they can recommend where they know that felons are coming through their door because I didn't know where else to direct people

89
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.910
Shaun W.: I don't feel told me one.

90
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.680
Shaun W.: Yeah, my people told me he's all here I get you a job over here. He told me, but then I already had this young

91
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.970
Shaun W.: But he was telling me I get you a job by building those manufactured homes or whatever.

92
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew it, I knew I was onto something with the PO

93
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.120
Shaun W.: Yeah, they know

94
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I did that in my felony drug court, we have, we would have someone who would go out and find people who would be willing to take on our folks and take a chance and then they could work because I mean you can't can't function make our job.

95
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.780
Shaun W.: Yeah, I don't know.

96
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The system is not set

97
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.340
Shaun W.: Up.

98
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried all screwed up.

99
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:35.070
Shaun W.: I tried not to live my big chunk water thousand so I keep my $1,000 at zero just case for emergency smart.

100
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's get back to this this the cycles. Here I've got an adding a new one. I'm adding

102
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.740

111
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.370
Shaun W.: Yeah, we'll

112
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.460
Shaun W.: Just wait till the next feature.

113
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you setting this goal for when

114
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.610
Shaun W.: Right now.

115
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When are you when you crunch the numbers, when are you saying, Okay, I think I'll have 20 $500 by June or July or August or something.

116
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:58.560
Shaun W.: By me I should have 1000 I'll have 1000 by the end of this month I'll have a 2000 by the end of this month and then she brought me.

117

118
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.570
Right.

119
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.300

120
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.910
Shaun W.: Okay.

121
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's get a little goal around this notion of finding independent living someplace that you want to live on your own. Is it some vague idea like a year from now, like, kind of, what's your mindset around it.

122
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.930
Shaun W.: Before the new year.

123
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.040

Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you think you're trying to accomplish with with the with the weed, what, what's the outcome you want from the Beijing.

146
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.390
Shaun W.: Oh, oh no, it is they told me that it would help me.

147
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.830
With what

148
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.160
Shaun W.: Oh my PTSD.

149
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's

150
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.020
Shaun W.: The doctor

151
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Doctor

152
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.120
Doctor

153
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.340
Shaun W.: I don't remember his name.

154
00:12:48.900 --> 00:13:00.990
Shaun W.: Are you remember the name. I went in there and talk to him and he said that my pod recommended that you do that. I got on it. I don't, I don't really care for it. Like, I guess when I was a kid, I liked it. I don't really like it.

155
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you and I do more of the psychotherapy part. Why don't we work some of that medicine and and and see if it has a positive benefit. Okay.

156
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the side effects of that.

157
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Are real to which can be a little while we might feel more irritated. There might be a few days where that happens. We also might have

158
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A positive effect where we're not as irritated. We might also cry, we might have nightmares. We might have fewer nightmares.

159
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive and negative are equally as possible with these interventions. It doesn't mean it will go badly, sometimes it has a really positive effect from what I've been watching

160
00:13:47.250 --> 00:14:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: There is about a 24 hour period here, the intensity is up and then it goes down again. Okay. So as long as my clients are educated around it like they know what's coming.

161
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: They can pull back a little bit, they can tell the people in their life. Listen, I'm going through something right now just ignore me I'm kinda kind of I say I'm not good at. I'm not good company.

162
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the way I work is I know the company is going to talk myself back here is just throw the food in the door and step away.

163
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

164
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.930
Shaun W.: So, but

165
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately, there's really not much side effect if it's done properly, there's just you.

166
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Enjoying the full scope of who you are and your history and not not feeling the activation around it. So why don't we spend a little time today, I'll pull

167
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And pull away from these goals for just a moment. Let's just see if we can find a target to target thought or target and memory to focus on on. Do you happen to have your to

168
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Bilateral

169
00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.310
Shaun W.: Things handy go

170
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.470
Shaun W.: Okay, you just

171
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to be this.

172
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.210
Shaun W.: What 12 inches. Right.

173
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:25.980
Yeah.

174
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to now just to finish up what we had done before. I want to make sure this is what we're saying the same thing but I wrote was

175
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so what Shawn's going to do is his goal is to save money and the way he's going to get there. This is going to spend less money on vapor weed invading products. Do you think that will help you save money.

176
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:50.820
Shaun W.: Yeah.

177
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.080
Shaun W.: Okay, yeah.

178
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I wrote. And we'll keep an eye on that over the next 30

179
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

180
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.690
Shaun W.: About allergies. Right. An hour so

181
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.650
Shaun W.: Opens allergies. Right.

182
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just throw them away. Okay, so here we go let's do look

183
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

184
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see something you have said, I don't even have any of these subjective unit of distress piece in here. Let's do this. Let me show you what I'm doing. So you can see

185
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so right now I'm going to target somewhere to start, you have this history right and I don't have any little statement. See where this is blue or here.

186
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.500
Shaun W.: Yeah.

187
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to fill some of those in. So I'm going to ask you about a 50 it's not 100 not the worst thing that's ever happened to you, not the chilis thing that's ever happened. But somewhere in

188
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be asking you to share a little story with me.

189
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And

190
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of today is going to be it'll sound like this, Sean.

191
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your emotion. Oh, I was angry. OKAY. AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING I WAS THINKING WHAT A JERK. And I might say or what, what's your belief about yourself at the time that was usually the hardest one for people to get not really help without one. And then I might say something like

192
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you rather have been thinking about yourself. And you might say, Oh, that's a stupid question why asked me that word question. Well, let me, let me just, let's just give this a try. And so then you try it on. And that's the positive cognition and then I'll do the work.

193
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the bilateral stimulation and after about 30 seconds of it, then I'll say what's coming up for you and then may only tell me one statement I might decide, hmm.

194
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's interview some positive images or I might decide, Hmm, let's go with that. And then I might iterate again and you don't say

195
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not a lot of dialogue back and forth. It's real short statements on your side, the therapy.

196
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the bilateral stimulation, where you're pulling up into the working memory. Think about it like like your little desk, your little workspace. We pull up only that not a whole lifetime of trauma and abuse only that piece.

197
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I bring up a negative cognition. Maybe I'll do something else. I got to kind of see how you're doing around it. That's why these numbers are important.

198
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All do all the complicated stuff over here. You don't have to think for me that that's my job. All you have to do is pay attention to if you're feeling somewhere up in the

199
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You just tell me, we got it back off that or you know me, you can say stop or cut it out. That's too much you can do whatever you want to. But if you want to be. So you could just be like, way, way, like a little cut

200
00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It turns out you want more. And I'm making the iterations, the bilateral stimulation to short like there was a really interesting fragment coming up from the hippocampus, you might do this, I want to sit with a little longer.

201
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying. Okay.

202
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're but my point is

203
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: No censoring if it comes up.

204
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This, I just thought of this guy doing this, then let me do my part, which is because I'm only going to want to be isolating to really narrow. I don't want to work the whole network.

205
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be trying to you're going to hear me redirect the conversation redirect it won't, I won't be intending to be rude. It will be me only

206
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying with a very small little memory fragment not getting you flooded with all of the connections. Okay, so it won't, I won't be doing it to the mean it will be in service and protection to you.

207
00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do this. Let's have a nice nice moment where we kind of how to get away from all of that psycho education part and let's let's find our breath. I'm going to do it as well. Let's do some some breathing in through the nose.

208
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Into that belly.

209
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And again into the nose filling along all the way down into the belly expanding that diaphragm down, press in the organs stimulating the Vegas start telling the mind. Oh, we get to be in a relaxed body.

210
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This morning, let's set our intention to discovering something new.

211
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A new feeling a new awareness, a new relationship with the self.

212
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sean, I'd like you to think about

213
00:20:51.030 --> 00:21:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're currently feeling stuck. It might be boy I've really tried to solve this problem in a particular way. I can't seem to get past it, I, I've tried it this way, in that way, over the years, and I just, I'm still stuck with this dilemma, where you're feeling blocked or where you struggle.

214
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you identify what your, your concern tends to be these days.

215
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you describe it.

216
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.070
Shaun W.: You want me to do you want me to

217
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, you're frozen. You've got internet problems.

218
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's funny. You're sitting there on the screen with your eyes closed.

219
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me okay

220
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.120
Shaun W.: Yeah, you were

221
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're frozen right now.

222
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait, you're coming back for coming back. Okay, we got you.

223
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So present day because we've got time, I'm going to be able to do this. I've got enough time to do this targeting with you and maybe me. I'm Dr. So

224
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about what keeps coming up there might be something maybe about the way things the way you feel like where you've been trying to solve it your way. And it's still, it just seems like I keep doing the same darn thing and I don't like it.

225
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that

226
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.630
Shaun W.: And you want me. You want me to go up to the 50 right you said not always 150 60

227
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't you tell me what you just thought of just now and I'll work from there.

228
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.630
Shaun W.: What if I thought about. I thought about my dad when I was younger and he's taught me up with a ninja sword.

229
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.130
Is that 150

230
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: On you for him.

231
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.270
Yeah.

232
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.750
Shaun W.: Hundreds with them when they sent me up on those murders and I said in a death row. Okay.

233
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:56.850
Shaun W.: So my dad when I was younger. He a samurai sword. Did he chopped my ear off. So I'll make you more often than not.

234
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.980
Shaun W.: scalping on my head. A couple times and stabbed me with the tip of the sword on my shoulder.

235
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to hear this, you know,

236
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.900
Shaun W.: For good, yes. All right. This happens

237
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Not hard to hear. Because I can't contain it, but like that. It's out of 50 that something this profoundly life threatening registers as only a 50

238
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.880
Shaun W.: That's the

239
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:27.990
Standard

240
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.660
Shaun W.: The Hundred and One is way worse. I think about that every deal the

241
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:42.810
Shaun W.: Yeah, that's the one because I can't stop. I can't stop thinking about it because like every it's like something like just triggers of me. I can't explain it like just the it always pops in my head.

242
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that is it the, I don't have freedom. I'm stuck in here that one trapped

243
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.550
Shaun W.: No, I just I can't explain it like a song or smell or sound. I can't explain it. I don't know why it does it just pops in my head.

244
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.450
Shaun W.: That's on chemo was facing all that stuff.

245
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just get a little, we're not going to do that one. We could. Um, but I think I would rather do do a 4230 with you, but I will want to do that 100 I'm going to tell you because

246
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That one right there. You just taught me something that neural network has to do with a smile, you can get triggered by a song by a color by a sound crackling have a chip bag. It can be anything that neural

247
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.470
Shaun W.: Network for us. Yeah.

248
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, it's huge, which says to me that this gentleman is going to need to have some desensitization and some rewiring around that neural network otherwise all this for this other work we do waste of our time.

249
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:57.240
Shaun W.: They told me they told me that my trial that I would be all right if I would go, they would if they said that I can be fixed it, they would lock me up, you know,

250
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot. You were

251
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying again.

252
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.460
Shaun W.: you're muted private don't

253
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it again court said you'd be fixed if you did what

254
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.600
Shaun W.: They said I would be fixed his way. Yeah, they said, We fix stuff I locked myself into a

255
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.300
Shaun W.: Can hear me.

256
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you'd be locked into what this is.

257
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:31.920
Shaun W.: I'm not digging one psychiatric or something, some kind of psychiatric home or some lady got up on the stand in the psychologist, because I had like four

258
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.330
Shaun W.: Different psychologist, look at me, and do all kinds of tests for my lawsuit.

259
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's see here. Lucky here.

260
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Though, what would they do, what are they going to do with you for two weeks. They're just going to give you medication to leave you alone and not address what's going on. What are they going to do with you.

261
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.770
Shaun W.: As fucking household to sorry

262
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:04.380
Shaun W.: Dude keeps calling me disconnecting my every time he calls the zoom the zoom disconnects my thing.

263
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it happens to everyone.

264
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's, let's do this. Let's keep working together. I have been seeing progress. So let's let's keep doing we're doing. I don't want you locked up for two weeks. I don't, I don't want that for you. Um, let's see if we can help. This is, this is the evidence based treatment for PTSD.

265
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Let's is it it's used with veterans that have had

266
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Been shot at seeing their, their

267
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Buddies dying to them. Okay. This is the go to, let's do it. Okay, now I do mine a little differently. I do mine in in a format called attachment focused and kind of put a little bit of that flower child on it a little, a little you know that's that's how I roll.

268
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.530
But it means

269
00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But it means to me that I'm incorporating some attachment theory with that has to do with hey, my mom was me when I was little.

270
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was awful. When I was accused of murder. It means I'm combining two things. And I like that and I want that for you. It means I'm addressing the shock trauma and the developmental trauma. I want my clients to have at all.

271
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's begin.

272
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's begin at let's go even lower because I need to see where you get flooded I needed to learn where that that happens for you. Let's go to a 40

273
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite. Dad chop me up with ninja sword something a little under that not quite as distressing as that, what else is happening not quite as distressing.

274
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.140
Shaun W.: Well,

275
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.070
Shaun W.: I'm sitting. I'm gonna send this only give you some coffee.

276
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.290
Shaun W.: Thank you. Well,

277
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.430
Shaun W.: She's been so nice. He

278
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.550
Shaun W.: Says he says

279
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.060
Shaun W.: I'm trying to think. I can't think of nothing right now.

280
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do it like this.

281
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling so we'll walk it back. This targeting. You know, I might be rushing it I'm just eager to get started with you but

282
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.170
Shaun W.: I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think, though, what

283
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.590
Shaun W.: What, what could I

284
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.370
Shaun W.: Don't know something else like 4830 or 40 and there's a lot of things, man. I've been through a lot

285
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me help you watch and we only might get to the target and then we'll do the technique next time.

286
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.990
Shaun W.: So let's do it like this.

287
00:28:50.700 --> 00:29:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotion that you felt when your dad was chopping actually with the ninja sword. This might sound naive. But what emotions were you feeling during that event.

288
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.340
Shaun W.: I think our first always feeling shocked. Okay.

289
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.060
Shaun W.: And then, and then it turned to anger.

290
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.600
Shaun W.: And then I wanted to kill him and then

291
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.690
Shaun W.: My sister.

292
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.270
Shaun W.: My sister called me and

293
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:33.420
Shaun W.: Got me a plane ticket from Ohio back to Albuquerque, and she said she will take care of me. So she takes care of. She took care of me until I got. Well, again, I took off. Okay.

294
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And how old were you when this happened.

295
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.630
Shaun W.: I can't even remember the year as

296
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.340
Shaun W.: Every year

297
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I was he

298
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.940
Shaun W.: Was older I was older, I was like,

299
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.280
Shaun W.: In my early 20s. Okay.

300
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Early 20s, I put 2223 2424 I went

301
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:58.470
Shaun W.: I went out to the kind of get to know them and live out there and try to get to know them a little bit that happened with the first companies.

302
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this again, we're trying to get to a target that we can work with that doesn't sort of pull in this huge network. So notice how more comes in as we start to talk more stories become right active

303
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So my question is,

304
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember 24 her dad. He came out there to get to know him. And within a couple days he's behaving with violence.

305
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling shock. Wait, I'm almost there, because we're trying to the targets different than story than telling a story. It is different. It's true. I do want to hear the stories on but that's

306
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.580
What

307
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You want. Yeah, so I'm

308
00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Shocked and then you were angry and you wanted to kill them. Your sister gotcha out of there, you were able to get out and healed went to Albuquerque and healed.

309
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember at the time that this was going on. It doesn't mean that you were aware of the thoughts right when the violence was happening, but just right in that story. Just hold on to that story just hold it right there. No other stories just that many of your working memory.

310
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What were the thoughts. I want to hear them.

311
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What were the thoughts and beliefs running through your head. He told me one and want to kill him. But tell me more of the thoughts and beliefs about yourself that we're going through your head.

312
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.340
Shaun W.: I couldn't believe you did that was all.

313
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't believe

314
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: He's doing this.

315
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you broke up. Here's what I heard.

316
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.280
Shaun W.: We have to get off. I was reading on the sheet metal

317
00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on.

318
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to miss a word you're saying, unfortunately. Telehealth is a real stinker right now let's do that. So what I heard you say was, I was thinking

319
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't believe my dad is doing this to his own son. Do you remember that thought yeah yeah yeah yeah you were starting to say something else. But it broke up what you say.

320
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:25.110
Shaun W.: That I was running thinking I need to get help, because I was bleeding so much I drink. I lost a lot of blood. So I had to stay in the hospital.

321
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:40.710
Shaun W.: I remember I was just thinking to get help, because I rental grocery stores in the sliding door open. I nailed down two or three months later, the blood or I kneeled down at the grocery store. Three months later they said the blood was still staying on the country all

322
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This memory stay with this memory stay there.

323
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.610
Shaun W.: All right, all right.

324
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I need help.

325
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.810
Shaun W.: So I ran to the grocery store.

326
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.080
Shaun W.: Okay, keep going. Open this guy, this guy opened the door and he was like

327
00:32:52.860 --> 00:33:01.530
Shaun W.: You like I remember you just looked at me and I said, Hey man, can you please call an ambulance because they said I look like Carrie from Stephen King and then. So he called an ambulance and then

328
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:09.240
Shaun W.: On the member on the way there. This lady was like, where are you from, you have an accent. I said, I'm from Albuquerque shoes. That's weird. That's where my parents are from, she said.

329
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She called an ambulance.

330
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you got to the hospital. And then what happened.

331
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:24.120
Shaun W.: THEN THE COPS WERE TRYING TO INTERROGATE ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, they fold the blood trail, all the way back to the apartment complex, but they didn't know which apartment and happened that I didn't tell him that the okay

332
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:33.030
Shaun W.: I didn't know nobody out there. So I was, I was kind of scared like take you down. Where am I gonna go. I don't know. I don't know. Nobody here. I mean,

333
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in the hospital room and you're starting to feel scared. I don't know. Nobody. This is a new city to me.

334
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Is that right,

335
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Ah.

336
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.220
Shaun W.: OK, then my dad showed up at a

337
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.980
Shaun W.: Walk. Yeah. And he started walk around thinking he's gonna be arrested, but I didn't tell the cops nothing

338
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:57.330
Shaun W.: And

339
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.300
Shaun W.: They kept asking me to do this, but I didn't want to tell them about the because I kept thinking, I'm gonna kill this fool.

340
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.130
Shaun W.: And then

341
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.250
Shaun W.: And then my sister call to talk to me and talk about it. And if I flew home and then I was in

342
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:20.160
Shaun W.: The North Korea crazy. He started lying to everybody that was. It was crazy. Like he started July, thereby tell them what happened that he knows that's not what happened. I was like, what

343
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:30.030
Shaun W.: He was talking about, he was scared when that's not the case. I was outside. You went inside. Got a sword came out of a job, young, you don't mean you're trying to tell people that he was scared. It's all a lie.

344
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, that he was afraid of you.

345
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.150
Shaun W.: Yeah, yeah. It's all I have, though.

346
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

347
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.650
Shaun W.: He went inside of came out and instigated it

348
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

349
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:43.560
Shaun W.: Won't do it.

350
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:52.260
Shaun W.: I went to open the car door he chopped my ear off my ear. When I started the hanging and then I turn around and try to rush him and he hit me with the sword on the top of the head right here.

351
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.990
Shaun W.: You see that

352
00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah yeah sure do.

353
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:09.960
Shaun W.: Yeah, he's he's flapping the open right there and then he he slapped me open over here, too. And then I went to block it in my shop my English almost got my middle finger.

354
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.550
Shaun W.: And then

355
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:18.990
Shaun W.: What I kneel down because I kneel down when he hit me in the head. I see light, then I kneel down and then he stabbed me with the tip of the sword on my shoulder.

356
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.460
Shaun W.: And then that's when I got up and ran. I said, I better run. Okay.

357
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright, I think this one. This is a profound

358
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Incident.

359
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why I think this might be a useful target discussion and part of what we could use for the work is the physical impact shoulder finger skull I the the the the physical wounding that it happened. The

360
00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't get into the big theory or from Stephen Portus around trauma getting locked in the body. If we're not able to completely defend ourselves, we get the

361
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Impulse to protect if it's not completely completed it can get locked in and we can continue to have this sort of anger, like I need to

362
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish this this self protection, so I won't bore you with the details around that. But this one might be might be a really useful target for us. And it's a complex emotional response, it's

363
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: How can a father do this. They're supposed to protect their children and he's trying to hurt the cognitive dissonance.

364
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is is so so profound. It doesn't match what a father's supposed to do, there's no story with that matches what happened that's very crazy making for a young person.

365
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also then it turned to this. I'll kill them. There's, I didn't tell the cops.

366
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm going to kill him. And then there's he's lying and there's all this big opinion about lying. Like, look how complicated. It's got all these different things to it.

367
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think if we can rework this one, it could have an interesting impact on a lot of different pieces for you.

368
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But we would have to work pretty hard, because notice how you want to just start talking about his behavior about right about how right, notice how we wanted to drift off into another story, it's going to be difficult to stay right there.

369
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.310
Shaun W.: I couldn't believe that photo was lying. I couldn't believe that

370
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.310
Shaun W.: Someone was like, what

371
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, Sean. Someone else outside of your family system would say I'm shocked that Sean wouldn't tell the cops that his father tried to kill him. Someone else, not you.

372
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.090
Shaun W.: Because your family history is

373
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Such but another family would be shocked that you lied. You see it.

374
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's your family.

375
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Structure is such that the the the the odd lie to you is that your father would protect his ego, so he's not a what a villain in this story like

376
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is surprised me.

377
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.680
Shaun W.: My whole family cut them off. They knew he did. They were like, well,

378
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.470
Shaun W.: He's a piece of shit. Yeah, I didn't know where we talk again everything is

379
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.560
Shaun W.: Let's do this.

380
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: For a second I want to hear every word you're

381
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.050
Shaun W.: Saying

382
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To yourself on video, the bandwidth

383
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just doesn't seem to be

384
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.280
Shaun W.: Here for right

385
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, cuz I can't hear you try and take yourself off.

386
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Video so I can hear everything you're saying all right let's try again, test, test, test,

387
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:42.510
Shaun W.: Test test test.

388
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

389
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.490
You pass the test.

390
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, we got a good one there. Now, when you think about that. Just now when that came up into your working memory.

391
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: From zero to 100, where does it really fall, but how distressing. Is it

392
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:10.830
Shaun W.: Like a 50, to be honest with you would happen to me is what really stresses me out. Like there's times I think different recipes for no reason. I always think like everybody's out to get me everybody's against me.

393
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:12.870
Shaun W.: That's

394
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:18.570
Shaun W.: That's the main one, the one that happened to me, the thing I can tell you all. But that's the hundred like that's the one I need help with

395
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All right then. That's the one. All I'll do

396
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do my best.

397
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.140
Shaun W.: To shake you

398
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is there's a big piece around this one and it has to do with

399
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: being accused of murder being locked up and you were in prison for five years under these charts.

400
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or four

401
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay okay in prison and isolation guards were threatening you it was a horror story.

402
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.560
Shaun W.: Yeah, the guards being, you know,

403
00:39:49.230 --> 00:40:01.170
Shaun W.: They were thrown my food at me because those two kids in the case starve to death. So they thought I killed two kids. And so they were choking my food out need meat. And so I had eat my food, also for like the first week. And then finally,

404
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:11.370
Shaun W.: What just don't have it as a long story was this, he told me that piss in a cup and throw it in his face because the guy kept doing it. And so he did. He came up like did it and then they beat me up.

405
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.130
Shaun W.: But they never to my food on the floor again.

406
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

407
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, not trying to sound naive. I want to know the emotion. Just now when you because you're sending me a very clear message when don't waste your time.

408
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to talk about this. This is the root of my PTSD. Let's get to it. I want to know. Just now when you started to think about that you were forced to do things you didn't want to do

409
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were imprisoned against you hadn't you don't see what did I do, I didn't

410
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.510
Shaun W.: I didn't know

411
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.100
Shaun W.: I've never been to this place. That's why I couldn't understand, like, how are you resting in peace. I've never been

412
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.410
Shaun W.: Day with most I could, I am

413
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, confused you felt confused. What other emotions.

414
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.380
Shaun W.: Anger sad. Okay, think of actual everything

415
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:09.090
Shaun W.: Everything.

416
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.170
Yeah.

417
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.180
All right.

418
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want. I want to know.

419
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Lisa. This is a hard one to get to. I heard some of your thoughts like

420
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never even been to this place, who would accuse me of this. I don't understand. I don't understand. And you're trying to put little pieces of the story together to see how someone had came to this conclusion.

421
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And now the hard part two want you to tell me what you thought about yourself, what you believe about yourself during those four years that you were in prison.

422
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:51.510
Shaun W.: I believe that I strongly believe that I was going to make it through that I was innocent. I was going to get our normal lead me and I'll tell everybody. I'm going to get out. Everybody's like,

423
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.640
Shaun W.: One of my best friends burn me for $500 was in there, he thought I was never getting out.

424
00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There with it. I believe I will make it through. I'm going to get out sign

425
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're out

426
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.110
Shaun W.: Yeah, I knew I was innocent. I knew I wasn't gonna but it was just a point of proven it

427
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:18.780
Shaun W.: And then, you know, is my best for one of my best friends that set me up and he was innocent to he's never been to the down, please. But he the cops got him to say he was there.

428
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:27.480
Shaun W.: Now, please. He's never even been. And then he said that we did it. And then he comes out later they find a video to three years later, of the cops telling this guy what to say.

429
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.490
Shaun W.: You don't. I mean,

430
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

431
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:37.020
Shaun W.: It's a long story. It's a long it this case went on for like 15 years. I mean, it just ended in 2011

432
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to lighten it up a little bit. As we near the end of the session, but

433
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you the one that watches that Better Call Saul show

434
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No. No. Okay.

435
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There's one of you in here that because sometimes I'm icebreaker I'll say, yeah, what's your favorite TV show.

436
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

437
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:56.370
Shaun W.: Was

438
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the Vikings Vikings. Okay. I thought I wish you

439
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, interesting, because some of the stuff that you talk about just makes me think about that TV show.

440
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is for real. It's like this is legitimately happens to people.

441
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.340
Shaun W.: I should just eat it, sports, man. I was a kid, you know,

442
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.500
Shaun W.: I wasn't raised that good household, I guess like emotionally

443
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.880
Shaun W.: Uh huh. But we had everything we needed. We're taking care of it, but

444
00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:30.930
Shaun W.: I don't, I wish I just would the winter, where we're making the games and stuff.

445
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, Sean. If you thought there was another way. I think you would have done it.

446
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But I you know when our environment, both in our home and in our community says this is the way to get love attention and acceptance. That's what we go do

447
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That was the only way you knew to do it.

448
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.560
Shaun W.: I guess to being accepted was committing violence on

449
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.600
Shaun W.: The way to be accepted.

450
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.280
Shaun W.: Well gangs.

451
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Gangs demand that they demand that you

452
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Do what they're doing, so that you don't rat them out. It's just this deal

453
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.580
Shaun W.: To get in the game. You gotta get jumped.

454
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.490
Shaun W.: In my game three guys jump you for 18 seconds.

455
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How how young, were you

456
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.880
Shaun W.: What I'm not sure.

457
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:35.940
Shaun W.: How old when I got in the game. Let's be 16. Oh, you're just a baby.

458
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.290
Shaun W.: And then I got caught for a drive by shooting it. I went to. I went to the New Mexico boys school towards eating.

459
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How long were you in there.

460
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.030
Shaun W.: All goes like 27 months, eight months.

461
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.130
Shaun W.: Then I got out and I was all for a year and they came to the rescue of those four counts of murder.

462
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anything good happen in the boys home though, did you kind of like some parts of it.

463
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.790
Shaun W.: You know, I liked it a lot, but they just saw there was no girls.

464
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.380
Shaun W.: Like about it.

465
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.690
Shaun W.: Okay, yeah, it was a week when I was there. We're loved smoke cigarettes very

466
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, is there any I'm nurturing people like a teacher counselor someone that was kind and wise that really kind of connected with their

467
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Know. Well, what did you like about the voice home. Then I heard about the girl is not there.

468
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.580
What did you like

469
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.570
Shaun W.: All the homies.

470
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.140
Shaun W.: Over there. Okay.

471
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So people

472
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.520
Shaun W.: A lot of those

473
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.850
Shaun W.: Those. A lot of us in there. Those 43 of us in there from my game.

474
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah,

475
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.390
Shaun W.: There's a lot of us in there.

476
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.750
Shaun W.: Because we throw roll call every day.

477
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.260
Shaun W.: Okay.

478
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, but there was there, you're saying it was the feeling like you're with a group of people and I might use terms like I belonged. I had my tribe. I didn't feel like the odd one out I belonged. When you were in that those 27 months.

479
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You fit in. Yeah, yeah, that's an amazing feeling. I was just checking to see if there happens to also have been some adults there that you RESPECTED THAT YOU admired that you felt cared for. I was checking to see if there was any of those there.

480
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't sound like it though.

481
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:50.700
Shaun W.: It's a school they tell you when you first get there. They tell you 98% of you are going to end up dead or in prison.

482
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:51.660
Oh,

483
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a real tension of speed.

484
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.390
Shaun W.: But it's a fact, though, and they tell you that when you go to prison. Everybody you are in the boys school, which is a prison.

485
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:02.850
Shaun W.: Or they're dead.

486
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:12.660
Shaun W.: They tell you that when you get there. They line you up. They tell everybody only 2% of you are going to make your life so look around you guys are probably not going to make you

487
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.670
Shaun W.: Angry

488
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not quite how I would run a boy's home.

489
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, okay.

490
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:22.350
Shaun W.: Boys prison.

491
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.460
Yeah.

492
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me just make a little, little statement here a little update on your bowl, which is I want

493
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a good relationship with my kids. Can you tell me, are you noticing because you and I touch on topics of how to communicate empathy, how to communicate that you care about your kids to kind of

494
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:48.930
Shaun W.: You know, give them that room.

495
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To re establish trust with you. Have you seen any improvement with your relationship with your kids these days.

496
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.280
Shaun W.: No, my son likes me. I don't have to worry about that but

497
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or certificate I you

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.770
Shaun W.: Text me and told me, sorry, the other day, so that was cool. Yeah, I'm
