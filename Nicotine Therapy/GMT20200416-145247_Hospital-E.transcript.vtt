00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason the reason that's okay, it's because you're writing here and and and who are you introducing

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.670
Nicole Bacon: Hello. Hey,

18
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:50.130
Dawn Abriel: I'm Ben. This works because it's just you as the patient, Nicole. If there's ever any other patients present then

19
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.570
Dawn Abriel: It can't be allowed.

20
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.060
Nicole Bacon: Right, right. That's what I thought.

21
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your last

22
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Name Jeffrey

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.630
Bacon.

24
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't

25
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.100
Nicole Bacon: Get the plugin she she had to go get her charger.

26
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

27
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:22.320
Nicole Bacon: Hi, I'm the reason I'm here is I sent a email to Dr. Brill encompassed some questions I had because you know course doctor patient privileged Nicole really didn't tell us a whole lot. Sometimes

28
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.490
Nicole Bacon: But basically we got to understand that.

29
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.920
Nicole Bacon: I believe the medication.

30
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.560
Nicole Bacon: That she needed. She wasn't getting or grant out

31
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.230
Nicole Bacon: And I'm not sure what she was prescribed for. But if you look at the email.

32
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.310
Nicole Bacon: That I sent it has all the questions that I wanted to, to ask. I, I have the questions here.

33
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me start with, can you give me your phone number, Mr bacon.

34
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.170
Nicole Bacon: It's area code 505501904 to

35
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.280
Nicole Bacon: Address.

36
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
Nicole Bacon: I'm looking to love our neighbors do San Marcos Santa Fe, New Mexico 87507

37
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. I'm looking at the release of information. Now this release to you, Jeffrey so

38
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We're good there. And so I'm the releases are typically for the purpose of improving assessment for treatment planning for sharing information relevant to treatment when appropriate. Dr. Have you had a chance to look at the message that came from Mr bacon.

39
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.740
Dawn Abriel: I did. I looked at it and the

40
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.130
Dawn Abriel: The issue that came up for me was

41
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:54.690
Dawn Abriel: Nicole at no point during the many times that we met in my asking you is this medicine last 24 hours, is this working. Did you ever say anything except yes this is an appropriate dose so

42
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.240
Nicole Bacon: Okay, with that I'm

43
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:16.260
Nicole Bacon: Uh, I think it was just frustration that um I was on this specific medication before in Portland, Oregon. I had been on it for over a year. We down almost all the way down.

44
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.940
Nicole Bacon: But over the months of trying to figure out if I could get it here. It just seemed like they don't send it to the southwest region for some reason.

45
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.180
Nicole Bacon: And I think that's been my issue with staying

46
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.150
Nicole Bacon: Clean on them is that I still feel sick on them and the the intake.

47
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.360
Nicole Bacon: Procedures.

48
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.890
Dawn Abriel: Let me just be clear. Sorry to stop you, but I really need a very specific information. You're telling me.

49
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.460
Nicole Bacon: That

50
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.810
Dawn Abriel: The medicine that was available. You were on a generic

51
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:14.820
Dawn Abriel: buprenorphine only so the active ingredient, no matter where and what company. The active ingredient is exactly the same. Some of the carrier products that are put in different generics. They're altered, but they don't have the as

52
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:24.420
Dawn Abriel: They're in active. That's why they're called the inactive ingredients. So when I would ask you is your medicine lasting you 24 hours.

53
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:48.120
Dawn Abriel: Is this the part where you were hoping it would be. But you weren't telling me that it was okay. So really, the problem is not about the preparation. The problem is, do we have you add a dosage that gets your blood level up high enough so you get 24 hour coverage.

54
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:57.990
Dawn Abriel: Right. And that is such a simple remedy. We just very slowly and small amounts get you up till you are, where you need to be

55
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.580
Nicole Bacon: Okay, okay.

56
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.160
Dawn Abriel: And it has nothing to do with the preparation.

57
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.720
Nicole Bacon: Okay, that's what I thought it was was happening.

58
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.690
Nicole Bacon: As it seemed like

59
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:18.240
Nicole Bacon: Before I was able to take this certain dose, but this certain pill and it carried me but

60
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.220
Nicole Bacon: It just seemed like I felt worse, taking the subs and just being sick.

61
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.490
Dawn Abriel: Um, yeah, I am too.

62
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And lost it. So,

63
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.720
Nicole Bacon: State, the way I believe Nicole is telling me you're just not coming through.

64
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.870
Nicole Bacon: Okay, she has told me. Just recently, the medication that she had been receiving made her sicker.

65
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.060
Nicole Bacon: Once she took it. She felt really bad. So therefore, she would not really want to take it and she would stop taking her medication and go seek

66
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:21.270
Nicole Bacon: What she shouldn't get so the the gist of it is that she believes that the medication that she was getting the buprenorphine maybe was not the right type of beef in our friend the buprenorphine hydrochloric that I had in the

67
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.820
Nicole Bacon: Email

68
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:37.950
Nicole Bacon: Is the one that she said did work without bad side effects and all the other you win or friends and specifically the subliminal. I mean, this is the strips.

69
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.600
Nicole Bacon: Would make her feel sicker and instead of taking him, she would go out

70
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.630
Nicole Bacon: And go get something else.

71
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Under. Okay, I want to say something. I know you want to talk, talk, but I've got to go. I think Dr every hour, I would like to talk to you more in depth as we move forward. I think this takes some really focused treatment planning.

72
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this is a complex issue.

73
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.650
Yes.

74
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.690
Nicole Bacon: Okay, and my just and I can leave now. But my Jeff says

75
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:23.130
Nicole Bacon: What I everything that I wrote down in the email, we need a prescription for what will work for her what she had does not work. She said it makes her more sick than than not taking a prescription pill and

76
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:43.080
Nicole Bacon: She believed that the pills that she was able to get in Portland worked for her very well and what they have here does not work, and any guidance on my specific questions on the email of where we can get the correct fills and what kind you have been able to

77
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.060
Nicole Bacon: Prescribe to a person like this.

78
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.040
Nicole Bacon: So that way I can follow through and find where I can get

79
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.250
Nicole Bacon: The right prescription medication.

80
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Mr bacon. I have to go. It was a pleasure to

81
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.190
Nicole Bacon: Meet you

82
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.720
Nicole Bacon: I do think you

83
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Always want people to be involved in their families recovery. I am a family therapist, and I welcome you here.

84
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want to register at that with Nicole as well. I want to touch base with her, but I want to send out the invitation that I would love to have a family therapy, maybe once a month, Nicole and Mr bacon would you be amenable to that.

85
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.900
Nicole Bacon: Of course, yes.

86
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.340
Nicole Bacon: It would be because

87
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.260
Nicole Bacon: What she tells me is like pulling teeth to get information and what I heard her telling you now is not what the way she described to me.

88
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:43.650
Nicole Bacon: So if you might know she would just like to have a better medication and I will do my best to find where we can get it. Once we have a prescription for her yes and

89
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If medication if pill taught skills by then we would just be doing the pills.

90
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't

91
00:09:49.770 --> 00:10:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a therapeutic aspect to this that's relevant to those addictive behaviors that sort of gets in and it gets sort of complicated after that. And I want to continue that discussion in a really meaningful way.

92
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If we could set something up. I have your number. Is that a good cell number to reach you.

93
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, something up sort of collectively, but first I want to touch base with her and I have that scheduled. And that's going to be

94
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.100
Nicole Bacon: I'm see a

95
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Second 1:10pm great heart health virtual clinic is the wait time is extremely long, so please set your alarm for at least 12:45pm in order to make that appointment at 110

96
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There are technical difficulties because the entire planet is using zoom. So please understand and accommodate for that. Think of it like traffic on a freeway or having

97
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Gas money for your car have gaps in your car, and that you accommodate for that traffic you lived in California, so you know exactly what I'm talking

98
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.720
About

99
00:10:50.940 --> 00:11:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, she was such a pleasure to to meet you, Dad, I do have to run into a client waiting my other room looking forward to really collaborating this to be the first time we're doing this with an even larger team effort. I'm optimistic and welcome back.

100
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.840
Nicole Bacon: Thank you very much.

101
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.780
Nicole Bacon: And again,

102
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.880
Dawn Abriel: Hey, before you go before you go, Mr bacon. Why don't you

103
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.580
Dawn Abriel: Listen to

104
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.480
Dawn Abriel: My questions for further clarification.

105
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:29.370
Dawn Abriel: Let me just tell you a a explanation for what happened to you, Nicole and you can

106
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:51.120
Dawn Abriel: Tell me if that was occurring or not. Because the only thing that makes sense to me is that you had some short acting opioid attached to your opioid receptors, when you took the buprenorphine it not those off and put you into partial withdrawal.

107
00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:16.020
Nicole Bacon: So, um, okay. Bottom line, this is okay. I remember getting these texts in Portland, that I would take them and I feel great right away and then that wasn't the case. No wonder, no matter what dose, like I would start to feel, you know, start with the the right

108
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.350
Nicole Bacon: Procedure to take them. But then the ones I've been getting through this program.

109
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:36.660
Nicole Bacon: It seems to no matter how long away, even if I wait 24 hours even longer. I still take them and it feels like yeah I'm not all the way precipitated withdraw, but I'm

110
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:48.060
Nicole Bacon: Just sicker for hours and then I take more I feel worse taking more stuff I take, I feel worse. And I actually

111
00:12:48.630 --> 00:13:03.840
Nicole Bacon: Found a couple of those same subjects on the black market. Just a couple of weeks ago and I i tried them and they didn't have any side effects and I wasn't able to get no matter what.

112
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.590
Nicole Bacon: Of jokes like I started

113
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.390
Dawn Abriel: With the ones you got off.

114
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.740
Dawn Abriel: The ones you've got off the street where the same as the ones that you got in Portland.

115
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.200
Nicole Bacon: No. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

116
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:25.680
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so here's the thing. I have 00 control over what a pharmacy stocks, right.

117
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.490
Dawn Abriel: Right zero

118
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.660
Dawn Abriel: Right, none.

119
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:33.180
Dawn Abriel: I have no control under so I don't know what you're going to do about

120
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:56.490
Dawn Abriel: I can write for a medicine and the different regions contract with different companies to supply them with a particular brand and they're, you know, they're at right now. The last time I checked, there were seven generic brands for buprenorphine and

121
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:12.000
Dawn Abriel: You know, again, their carrier products are different, but the active ingredient is the same. So I can't account for the physiology for you. That would make

122
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:13.800
Nicole Bacon: Right.

123
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.580
Dawn Abriel: But I believe it. I am here to tell you, I believe that

124
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.640
Dawn Abriel: Your lived experience is accurate and I in no way want to discount

125
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.590
Dawn Abriel: I just have

126
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.630
Dawn Abriel: No power.

127
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.200
Nicole Bacon: Right to

128
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.010
Dawn Abriel: Do anything

129
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.840
Nicole Bacon: Because I've, I've called tons of

130
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:44.010
Nicole Bacon: The pharmacies to try to get the right one. And I just don't think they supply the right one here. So the thing is is maybe if you could

131
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:55.080
Nicole Bacon: Write the prescription for the one that's closest to it. The, the one that I used to get and hopefully we can get the one that's closest to it. If it's available, you know,

132
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.720
Nicole Bacon: And that's something that me and my dad are working with the

133
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:05.130
Nicole Bacon: Pharmacies trying to find, you know. So if it's sent to CVS and they don't have it like we can talk to CVS and go from there.

134
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:17.430
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I will, I will cut and paste the name of that and put it in the prescription and see how far that takes you. Okay.

135
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.240
Nicole Bacon: That sounds great.

136
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:32.700
Nicole Bacon: All right, thank you. Question. Another prescription, even though for a restricted medication like this, you need to have electronic prescription. Can you write it out. Also, in case we have to shop it around.

137
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.490
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely, positively not

138
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.840
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Can't do it. It's just not possible.

139
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:52.680
Nicole Bacon: Okay okay yeah I it's changed. I guess it's just different. I my private doctor in Portland, he would give me the, the actual it's just different programs and different doctors work different

140
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.140
Dawn Abriel: Um, for one thing, in New Mexico.

141
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:18.060
Dawn Abriel: They're, they're changing over and all the states are going to do this now slowly, they're all doing this the electronic prescribing is so much safer people can't alter the prescription. They can't accidentally lose it. They can't. It can't be manipulated.

142
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:29.310
Dawn Abriel: So it's just so much safer for everyone. And what what can be done is, if you don't, if that electronic

143
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:42.270
Dawn Abriel: Prescription doesn't go through, you can ask me or you can go to the virtual clinic and say, I just found out that this pharmacy will order this particular

144
00:16:42.750 --> 00:17:01.020
Dawn Abriel: Brand and would you make that my default make that my primary pharmacy and then you can text me or get ahold of me and say, would you please reorder it to this other pharmacy and I'll cancel the first prescription and then reorder it

145
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:09.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, it's a hassle for me. I'm willing to do it a couple of times until you can get settled to a pharmacy and a preparation that works for you.

146
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:24.150
Nicole Bacon: Okay, that sounds fantastic. Okay. Sorry to interrupt. Another question I had to my email was, Have you prescribed something like this to anyone else in New Mexico and or do you know

147
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:33.660
Nicole Bacon: Of a pharmacy that would be good to try for. And if nothing else, I thought a nationwide pharmacy. If we had to do some more shopping

148
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:41.280
Dawn Abriel: Well, CVS Walgreens. They're all nationwide. If there's no. It has nothing to do with

149
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.790
Dawn Abriel: With the nationwide aspect, it's

150
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:55.140
Dawn Abriel: They, they bid the pharmacies bid the different companies, companies say we've got a deal on buprenorphine.

151
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:15.780
Dawn Abriel: And so then they end up with that particular generic for a few months. It's a real pain in the, you know what, for me, because not all the generics are equal equally potent. So then I have to readjust my whole patient load to to that generic and so I have gotten into the habit of

152
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:35.400
Dawn Abriel: I have a little F key that I say, you know, keep the generic the same and I make them order because I know they can do it. They can order that same because they've already been doing it and and I haven't gotten a lot of pushback, and they've been able

153
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:45.330
Nicole Bacon: You know, another question. Doctor, I know you're talking about generics are there, the actual non generic. You can order from hydrochloric

154
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.700
Dawn Abriel: Not in the two milligram tablet, I believe, let me

155
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.480
Dawn Abriel: Let me just me.

156
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.860
Okay.

157
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.690
Dawn Abriel: Let me, let me check. Oh.

158
00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:58.620
Dawn Abriel: I just

159
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.470
Dawn Abriel: Got out of that program.

160
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:28.290
Dawn Abriel: So if we were to go that route. I gotta tell you, then there's a whole nother hassle because the insurance company will say we need a prior authorization to justify why you want

161
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.120
Dawn Abriel: The generic normal rather than

162
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.760
Dawn Abriel: Brand name.

163
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:50.220
Nicole Bacon: And rehearse the brand name residential generic. Well, there's the chance to that. I'll say it this way, I'd rather spend money on prescription medication, than have money go to the black market.

164
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.820
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely.

165
00:19:54.810 --> 00:20:01.170
Nicole Bacon: So if we have to pay for medication of our own pocket if I find the the

166
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.610
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, sorry.

167
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.400
Dawn Abriel: There's no Suboxone the brand name.

168
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.000
Dawn Abriel: Hill tablet.

169
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.540
Nicole Bacon: So yeah, not really looking at the sub you Tex.

170
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.870
Nicole Bacon: Eight milligram. I'm the I have the MDC right here.

171
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.940
Nicole Bacon: And the company that makes it

172
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.110
Dawn Abriel: I'm not finding

173
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.870
Dawn Abriel: Let me see if I can find it this way.

174
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:53.580
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

175
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.510
Nicole Bacon: I can't get ahold of them yet. That's their number, but they're the ones who make

176
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:16.410
Nicole Bacon: They're the ones who make just one of the CVS might or might not Carrie Carrie here in Santa Fe.

177
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.250
Dawn Abriel: Texas text is just the buprenorphine alone.

178
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.360
Dawn Abriel: Right and

179
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.000
Dawn Abriel: Right now there are multiple companies who

180
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.400
Dawn Abriel: Yeah i don't i i don't know which company has the rights to the name sub you tax.

181
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.110
Nicole Bacon: Okay, right.

182
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.600
Nicole Bacon: I believe we did some research that said subby Tex like that is no longer

183
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.550
Nicole Bacon: Available in the US. They have all generics. They're different names.

184
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.920
Nicole Bacon: But, but what

185
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.480
Nicole Bacon: Is

186
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:06.720
Nicole Bacon: I believe, Nicole told me that you gave her what you believe, was the closest to what she could use the one that she was looking at before.

187
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:21.000
Nicole Bacon: It's made by at the farm and they're in Europe and we put the NBC number and I wasn't able to find that one but I found a similar one that CBS on their national website.

188
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:39.960
Nicole Bacon: Says that they might carry their little the pharmacist was a little confusing to me. She more or less stated that they would carry it. If someone else had already ordered it before or been prescribed it through four and then they could order it. If a new prescription came in.

189
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.690
Dawn Abriel: That makes sense. I saw her.

190
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:50.850
Nicole Bacon: I know as frustrating. So if you on the email on the prescription, whatever you write it for

191
00:22:51.930 --> 00:23:00.930
Nicole Bacon: If nothing else, I'll try to get placed with that pharmacy or the nationwide part of the pharmacy.

192
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:17.010
Nicole Bacon: And if it doesn't work will continue but also I found there's a pharmaceutical supply company that supplies pharmacies only and it states that it has the buprenorphine Hydra chloride.

193
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:33.150
Nicole Bacon: I, you know, it's only for pharmacies to buy, not for individuals. So I know we can try to find the right thing. We just need a prescription, I believe, and move forward and in my doctor, it might be easier if I just go to the eight milligrams

194
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:43.290
Nicole Bacon: But I think it'd be easier. Maybe to find what because that's what I was taking the eight milligram. And I would just cut it up.

195
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.520
Dawn Abriel: Right, yeah.

196
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.510
Dawn Abriel: So, but your dose was for right

197
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.870
Nicole Bacon: Right. But I, that wasn't working for me.

198
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:55.980
Nicole Bacon: Right.

199
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.240
Nicole Bacon: I still felt

200
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:12.930
Dawn Abriel: And and about how so so so it wasn't like I just still find this very confusing that you would that it would precipitate withdrawal.

201
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.380
Dawn Abriel: Were you doing fentanyl

202
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.330
Dawn Abriel: No, no.

203
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:24.060
Nicole Bacon: And I would wait. I've tried it so many times and I would wait

204
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:33.360
Nicole Bacon: 24 hours sometimes 3032 hours. I'm still the same reaction.

205
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.270
Nicole Bacon: Um, so

206
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:51.960
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, if we could have write the prescription for the NBC. It's in the email or I could give it to you here, and then we can work on

207
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.580
Nicole Bacon: Our prior to calling the pharma season and you cannot figure out what the doctor doesn't normally write it with the MTC code. Oh, say,

208
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:16.470
Nicole Bacon: I want Drug A oh and and the pharmacy would either fill it, or say, oh, we can be generics and you have to decide to fill up with the agenda. I don't think they even making the 70 tax rate the brand name that brand name of somebody Texas not allowed anymore. Right.

209
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:32.430
Dawn Abriel: Right, I, I knew I couldn't find that but i can i can put as much information as possible in my pharmacy notes that they can read and they can either scratch their head and go talk to a supervisor or

210
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:42.870
Dawn Abriel: And and you I would recommend that you call as soon as you know that they've gotten the script in and start discussing with them what the alternatives are

211
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.360
Dawn Abriel: Okay. For procuring it

212
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.790
Nicole Bacon: Yes, that sounds good. Okay, I'm still listening, but I'm turning my head to look at the computer.

213
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:59.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay, well then let's go through the part that I need to get you re enrolled.

214
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:11.250
Dawn Abriel: And it is I'm a little concerned about. Is there anything you would tell me that you don't want your father to hear because

215
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.390
Nicole Bacon: I'll just go

216
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.890
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

217
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:22.230
Nicole Bacon: Thank you, Doctor, and once she gets a prescription. I'll work on getting it. Phil, how are you

218
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.870
Dawn Abriel: Nice meeting you.

219
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.410
Dawn Abriel: So it looked like.

220
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.960
Dawn Abriel: You had a really tough time getting getting established into the program.

221
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:58.710
Dawn Abriel: What was it that was in the way of you're telling me what was truly going on for you because this program won't work unless you know how to say, I don't understand, Doc. Please help me get through this. If you don't believe that I mind your side. This just won't work.

222
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.330
Nicole Bacon: Right, right. So as far as

223
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:12.900
Nicole Bacon: procuring the medication that was able to stay sober on from my private doctor information that we're talking about this in the email.

224
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:27.000
Nicole Bacon: I tried for about two months called all the pharmacies in Santa Fe called all the pharmacies in Albuquerque talk to everyone. I could possibly talk to and I wasn't able to get it and so

225
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.710
Nicole Bacon: You know,

226
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.030
Dawn Abriel: Nicole, Nicole. You didn't talk to me.

227
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.590
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

228
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:44.940
Nicole Bacon: Why not because I knew that I couldn't get that medication. And so I'm like, well, this medication needs to work for me. And I kept trying and it didn't. And I just said.

229
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.730
Dawn Abriel: Hoping, I understand. Do you understand that that didn't work and it cannot work in the future.

230
00:27:51.030 --> 00:28:05.370
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, if you don't believe that. I will do what I can. Try to facilitate it might be limited, but to keep that from me, that was it only hurt you didn't hurt me.

231
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.290
Dawn Abriel: Write it hurt you.

232
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.340
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, is frustrated but I I'm thankful that you said that

233
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:32.190
Nicole Bacon: Yet not all of them are made the same. I can feel it physically in my body. You know, like when I take one pill. Like, I feel great and it works for me. And I take this other one I still feel sick. And no matter how much I take or not take it and it's it

234
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.250
Dawn Abriel: Right. So I hear that and I would have heard it. Two months ago.

235
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:38.970
But

236
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.530
Nicole Bacon: So shut down because I was frustrated

237
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.870
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. And this is part of an addicts way of thinking.

238
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.280
Dawn Abriel: And this is why talking to go into your is

239
00:28:54.690 --> 00:29:15.990
Dawn Abriel: It. There's just no substitute, there's no number of pills, you can take that will help you rewire your brain so that you learn to see reality differently. You need the medicine so that you feel okay enough to be able to be in therapy. That's what this is all about. Right.

240
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:16.770
Yeah.

241
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.220
Dawn Abriel: So since you've been away it what what drugs. If you've been using

242
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.200
Nicole Bacon: heroin and meth mostly heroin.

243
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.500
Dawn Abriel: And so your last

244
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.670
Dawn Abriel: Opioid Use was what and when

245
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.180
Nicole Bacon: Last night around 6pm

246
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.300
Dawn Abriel: And it was what

247
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:43.740
Heroin

248
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:50.490
Dawn Abriel: And how much 2021

249
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.010
Nicole Bacon: So,

250
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.230
Dawn Abriel: $20 worth

251
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.550
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes.

252
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.240
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I'm not sure what that is. I think it's a

253
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.870
Nicole Bacon: half gram. It's a plane to have a gram

254
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.410
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I think it's point two five.

255
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.670
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah.

256
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.570
Dawn Abriel: It's hard to get. Point two.

257
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.950
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, have a

258
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.380
Dawn Abriel: Quarter of a gram makes more sense.

259
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:31.110
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And so about how much total per day. Have you been doing

260
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.480
Nicole Bacon: Um, I haven't passed.

261
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.990
Nicole Bacon: A half them every day.

262
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.640
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so that's why you really ought to be able to get away with.

263
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.030
Dawn Abriel: You know, six to eight four to six somewhere in there of buprenorphine.

264
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.110
Dawn Abriel: But again, we'll, we'll just have to see.

265
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.660
Dawn Abriel: And was it smoking it IV. How are you using it.

266
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:04.770
Nicole Bacon: IV.

267
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:17.640
Dawn Abriel: Right. And right now, you don't have any abscesses, or none of your veins are infected. You don't have any shortness of breath or chest pain.

268
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.480
Dawn Abriel: No.

269
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:24.780
Dawn Abriel: No problems. Okay. And you're not right now. Have you had overdoses.

270
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.540
Nicole Bacon: Yes, three of them.

271
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.040
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

272
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.540
Dawn Abriel: But no medical complications, you haven't had the infection around your heart that many people get from IV drug use.

273
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.700
Nicole Bacon: No, no. Luckily, and

274
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.560
Dawn Abriel: And no legal problems.

275
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.770
Nicole Bacon: I am I have a

276
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:50.490
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I did get last summer. So I have probation and men.

277
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.750
Dawn Abriel: Wow, this is so risky.

278
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.660
Dawn Abriel: To be on probation and I know

Nicole Bacon: Oh, nevermind. Don't do anything for Cheeto forever. I know I've, I've seen it.

431
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:12.390
Nicole Bacon: As I grew up, you know, like ask people doing bong hits sitting on the couch lazy super lazy and I don't like that laziness. I want to get out of that because that's what has made me feel like

432
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.220
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, well,

433
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.850
Dawn Abriel: That you can get over

434
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:25.530
Dawn Abriel: The THC takes quite a bit longer to get over and also

435
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:26.760
Dawn Abriel: You still

436
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.410
Nicole Bacon: too much for me and only

437
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.730
Dawn Abriel: Are you are you still using the clonazepam every night.

438
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:43.230
Nicole Bacon: I actually just ran out of those a couple days ago, so I need some more of those. I don't know if I could get this from you or I need to see my psychiatrist.

439
00:47:43.620 --> 00:48:02.280
Dawn Abriel: You need to see your psychiatrist, because I, I, I would so much rather you were on a different kind of sleeping pill again benzodiazepines affect your hippocampus and it makes it much more difficult to incorporate new information now.

440
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:02.970
Nicole Bacon: Since

441
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:11.730
Dawn Abriel: You're not taking a lot. And I'm not you know that people who are on value three or four times a day. Of course, they

442
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.110
Dawn Abriel: Were lost to the world.

443
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.950
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

444
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.700
Dawn Abriel: Taking a little bit at night to sleep but but

445
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.450
Dawn Abriel: There are other asleep medicines.

446
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.870
Dawn Abriel: And if any of them worked for you better or as good as

447
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.710
Dawn Abriel: Again, as a pan. My goodness, why not take those

448
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:44.010
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I know that that these are also a little crutch, and I've seen my friend get hooked on them and get seizures. So actually, a straight up melatonin that my dad's been given me. It's worth better

449
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:54.330
Dawn Abriel: Please take it, you'll be happier with yourself and congratulations on the on the sugar. It's one of those things that

450
00:48:54.630 --> 00:49:05.220
Dawn Abriel: Has been underplayed for a long, long time. And we know we it's, you know, we can see it in microscopic studies that

451
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.700
Dawn Abriel: It causes inflammation.

452
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.620
Nicole Bacon: And we

453
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.830
Dawn Abriel: You know you're young, you're you've got some residual

454
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:29.820
Dawn Abriel: But you know you're looking at being in a pandemic right now opioids depress your immune system all by themselves. They depress it sugar depresses your immune system. So,

455
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.240
Dawn Abriel: Yes, it's like two things against you.

456
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:50.160
Nicole Bacon: So, and this again. But yeah, I just saw my little cousin. She's what four years old and she's like play with me. I'm like, I'm tired, she took a big chunk of sweet tea, she's like, Oh, we're ready. Here, have some we could go. I'm like, wow.

457
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.370
Nicole Bacon: She knows the

458
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.800
Nicole Bacon: Power of sugar.

459
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.630
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

462
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:18.540
Dawn Abriel: Do you have. Well, I think I still need to order. Another thing of Narcan for you because you're be admitting

463
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.370
Dawn Abriel: So,

Dawn Abriel: You can pick that up and have it available.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:41.220
Dawn Abriel: I am so glad you came back I am really in when when you started drifting away. I said to one of your

471
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:53.580
Dawn Abriel: I really hope she comes back to us. Most people do some people it takes two or three times coming back and then they really see how this is all about you.

472
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:57.840
Dawn Abriel: You helping yourself and letting us be a part of that.

473
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.170
Dawn Abriel: So congratulations you've done the hard part.

474
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:13.860
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, the vulnerable and the the hiccup of where I think I'm fine. I'm just gonna work and not communicating not being truthful and I hate not telling the truth. I hate fibbing like it.

475
00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.230
Dawn Abriel: It feels good, doesn't it.

476
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.190
Nicole Bacon: Yeah it sucks. I have morals. So it really hurts me

477
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.180
Yeah.

478
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:22.890
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

479
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.440
Dawn Abriel: We had, we had a lady last week.

480
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:34.020
Dawn Abriel: She was at 24 milligrams after three days, three years she's down to 1.75 milligrams

481
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.890
Nicole Bacon: Wow.

482
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.510
Dawn Abriel: Wow. And she went to the dentist.

483
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:47.250
Dawn Abriel: And then got a kidney stone went to the emergency department and both those doctors ordered her short acting opioids.

484
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.420
Dawn Abriel: And her

485
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.880
Dawn Abriel: adult brain said, well, the doctor ordered. It must be okay.

486
00:51:55.350 --> 00:52:04.860
Dawn Abriel: And we noticed in group, she was saying, Well, I don't, I don't know why you asking me these questions and we were whoa what's going on.

487
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.120
Dawn Abriel: Shutting so I

488
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:23.880
Dawn Abriel: I ran a PM P, you know, to see what what narcotics were ordered for her. And when I confronted her, you know, she started crying. And she said, I, I feel so guilty. I have hated lying to you. I don't know why I did it. And it was this

489
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:37.020
Dawn Abriel: Sheet. Yeah, it's part of the disease. It's the disease. It's not that anyone's a bad person. It's what the nasty drug does to the brain and

490
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:50.910
Nicole Bacon: And it's mastering even like being aware of it like it's one thing when you're not aware and you're just going like subconsciously, but when you're aware of it and you're still doing it. It's like

491
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.070
Dawn Abriel: It's like you've got an enemy inside

492
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.300
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes.

493
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:57.810
Dawn Abriel: Right.

494
00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:18.390
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and that's why people like you and this other woman when when you come out the other side you will be such important advocates so important to the community of addiction to help people who are going through what you're going through now make sense of this.

495
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:32.850
Dawn Abriel: Right. You know, I try one of your tries, but neither one of us had addictions. So all we can do is talk, theoretically, you will be able to zero in on exactly what they're going through.

496
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.060
Nicole Bacon: So, yeah. Yes, definitely.

497
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.100
