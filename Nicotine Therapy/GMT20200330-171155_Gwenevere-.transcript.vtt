00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk with you I'm

2
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just thinking

3
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: About like our text exchange, just in case there's anything that kind of went a little sideways.

4
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's, here's what I did.

5
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you know those messages I send the day before everybody. I say, Hey, everybody. Confirm who a good for tomorrow. You know, I kind of do that I try to try to do it every night before.

6
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.190
JESSICA G: Mm hmm.

7
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone pretty good advice.

8
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.340
JESSICA G: Yeah.

9
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I've noticed now might not have been your intent because notice that your intent might have been one thing

10
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I the message received may have been something else. So I'll just tell you what the message received was and then you can tell me in real time, because you can't get all this out and attacks. It'd be like four pages long, so

11
00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The message I received and it doesn't have anything to do with you specifically Jessica has to do with what I've learned over the years with appointments, whenever I see someone write me back. Oh, have it at 12 I have an appointment. What I do with it. I think to myself, yeah.

12
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.960
JESSICA G: I think before

13
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They won't show up.

14
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm the message has been because if I ever assumed they would be or ask for clarification, it becomes back and forth, back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.

15
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I'm just

16
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.360
Yes.

17
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Or no, so

18
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What I did was I assumed you were trying to because some people have written just like you and the messages I told you that I had an appointment. Why did you expect me there. Now that might not have been at all what you were intending

19
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But as a consumer of people saying, Hey, I have this appointment.

20
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I interpreted as okay they have to go do this other thing.

21
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So I looked for another spot for you. And so that's what was happening on this side. Now for you. What was going on with what it was like for you around this original appointment.

22
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.250
JESSICA G: What. Okay, so you didn't think that I was good. You thought that I was canceling

23
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.570
Yes.

24
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.880
JESSICA G: Okay.

25
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me okay so that surprises you

26
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.150
JESSICA G: Yeah, because I had, I said that if we can switch, and if not, then I'll make sure to be there at 11

27
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's the part that if that was in there. So this is what you wrote this, you didn't make any mistakes. We're, we're just getting clear because this can go sideways fast for clients if they don't get a chance to get clear

28
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.350
JESSICA G: So here's

29
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know my side. Right. You know that I just assumed people are not going to show up. But let me tell you why. So you wrote a great, a great tax you said, is there any way we can switch it to 12

30
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to notice I have to

31
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to go sign some paperwork for my employment.

32
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Period. That was, that was it.

33
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.990
JESSICA G: Mm hmm.

34
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.790
So I heard

35
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to go sign paperwork. In other words, there was a conflicting appointment, you had made an appointment to go take care of employment.

36
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.390
JESSICA G: And you didn't get the second message.

37
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so over here at 11 o'clock at night in Florida, I'm asleep.

38
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.840
Uh huh.

39
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.030
JESSICA G: Okay.

40
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.720
JESSICA G: Well, I don't know, I don't. Yeah, I mean,

41
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.840
JESSICA G: I've always showed up to my appointments. Most of the time, you know, so I don't

42
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know, I know you want to go to there, but try to hold on to just this text that's why I'm just talking about the text.

43
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.520
JESSICA G: And then even even still like

44
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.600
JESSICA G: In the morning like you read the other message right

45
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.280
JESSICA G: If not, so I can make sure to me 11

46
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So right then you right. Yes. No, I think LM l m k is, let me know. Please, if not so I can make sure to meet at 11

47
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, then I'm up and i i see let your time probably for 23 in the morning there's I'm sure you're sleeping.

48
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I say let's see if something opens up, I see that

49
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like you that are people are rescheduling the night before. There's something happening around 11 o'clock, maybe on a Wednesday. So I offer I say let's see if something opens up on Wednesday at 11 please text me if you want to be on call for full April 1 at 11

50
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.640
Right.

51
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.310
And then

52
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, I mean I had someone that was going to be there today at 11 it just worked out that she couldn't make it.

53
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she ended up going to grow.

54
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was a whole other something else. This has nothing to do with your credibility. That's what I'm wondering if what's happening for you is your credibility is being called into question. It's not

55
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with any time I've ever seen in a text when someone says, I have to go to the DMV, I have to drop my children off. I got called into work or something like what you did, which was

56
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.700
I need to go.

57
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.950
JESSICA G: Sign paperwork.

58
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The message I get

59
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it's a priority payment is cancel.

60
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If that makes sense.

61
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.860
JESSICA G: Okay. Well, for me, my meeting with you is a priority.

62
00:06:47.490 --> 00:07:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's, here's what I could have done differently. And I'll really do my best to remember. But the answer is if if I had interpreted it a little differently. This is what you would have heard back. No, I have a client at 12

63
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what might you

64
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I do. I'm very booked up right now. That's why people are on call.

65
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what, what do you think you would have done if I just said, I'm sorry. I already have someone at 12 what like your texts have been

66
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.230
JESSICA G: I would have said, Okay, then I'll be there at 11

67
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.000
Really, okay.

68
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so used to not being prioritized like

69
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see here that now.

70
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.600
JESSICA G: That yeah

71
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so I'm glad we're talking about it because you are you are. You're starting to really take this therapy thing seriously, aren't you

72
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.830
JESSICA G: Oh, yeah.

73
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.310
JESSICA G: I do. Yeah, I do. I really do.

74
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We do have some hard work, too. And so is there anything left with any feelings or thoughts around the text. Are we done. What do you think

75
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I thought

76
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.920
JESSICA G: I just walked off the extra early and I got ready and I

77
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:08.820
JESSICA G: Went as early as I possibly good that made sure I made it back by 11 now.

78
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about employment. Tell me about that. What's going on with that.

79
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.120
JESSICA G: Um, so last week, I'm reading was

80
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.140
JESSICA G: I don't know. I was just

81
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.470
JESSICA G: I impulsively went on to indeed and looked up for

82
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:36.600
JESSICA G: her job and I applied and I put in my resume and they called me the next day.

83
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:48.120
JESSICA G: And and yeah and then. So I went to the appointment, the day after that and to the interview and then

84
00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:05.490
JESSICA G: And then I went to my grandma's to go clean her house for her and my auntie. She takes care of she's her caregiver and she told me that she has extra hours that she can pick up. So if I wanted to pick them up.

85
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:17.280
JESSICA G: Which is like kind of frustrating to me because I've been telling my grandma, like, Hey, you know, like I know my auntie is unable to be there as much and

86
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:33.300
JESSICA G: I can pick up hours I can help you. Like, I still do it in either way, even if I'm not getting paid, but like she needs. She my grandma can't see anymore. My grandpa can, like, you know, it's just they need help and my auntie doesn't Billy.

87
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:50.040
JESSICA G: She just doesn't really take care of them. The way they need to be taken care of. So anyway, so that happen, and my auntie happened to be there and she told me that if I were to pick up extra hours. And I was like, okay, sure.

88
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:58.560
JESSICA G: So, um, and I was kind of bunk to because she had this packet. This whole packet of like

89
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:08.490
JESSICA G: So many pages. It's like this thick of stuff that I need to fill out and questionnaires and like little quizzes and about HIPAA

90
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:22.830
JESSICA G: And she was like, I'm I called her yesterday and I was like okay so what time do I have to be there to sign the paperwork and she was like, oh, I still have the packet and my car. I've been meaning to take it to you and

91
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.780
JESSICA G: So,

92
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:32.100
JESSICA G: She went and dropped it up on my grandma's and I went and picked it up and I stayed up till one in the morning, filling that out.

93
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.020
JESSICA G: And then

94
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.120
JESSICA G: And then so this morning. Actually, today.

95
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.440
JESSICA G: Okay, I had a discussion with my son's dad last night because I told him you know like

96
00:10:47.070 --> 00:11:06.870
JESSICA G: You need to help me out like he's not just my responsibility. He's your responsibility to and ever since he was born. I've always helped us figure it out on my own. And so now you're on this idea where it's like, oh, I have to go to work. So Dr.

97
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:27.150
JESSICA G: Like you can switch some things around like get a ride from one of your co workers lend me the car for a couple of hours or can I go drop you off, like, you know, and pick you up take you the car back whenever I'm done. Like, I don't need that much time. But, you know, like

98
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.540
JESSICA G: You and then his excuse was well

99
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:46.650
JESSICA G: I don't have any money. Any money any family here, what do you expect me to do and why can't your family watch him. That's messed up. And whenever they ask you for favors don't do nothing for them. And I'm like, that he's not my family's responsibility.

100
00:11:47.430 --> 00:12:03.600
JESSICA G: And my family have been the only ones that have helped me, you know, even when I was in California, you still didn't do anything. You didn't even financially provide for him like my mom has always done it. And I always had to figure things out on my own.

101
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.060
JESSICA G: And so

102
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.720
JESSICA G: So he called me and he was like

103
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.900
JESSICA G: Well, I think I'll be able to take off a few hours. So you can go do what you have to do.

104
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:23.580
JESSICA G: And so I was like, no, I already got a ride from my friend. And so my friend came and picked me up.

105
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:36.720
JESSICA G: And I was calling my auntie to ask her, like, what the exact location was and she wasn't answering and she wasn't answering. And then I got them to the place. And she was like, Oh, she said to be there at 12

106
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:47.730
JESSICA G: And I was like, she was like, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I just barely find your messages and she told me I just contacted her and she thought for you to be there at all. I was like,

107
00:12:48.300 --> 00:13:05.040
JESSICA G: I'm already outside of the building. She was like, Oh no, I'm sorry. So I had to have my friend bring us back and call him back and take the help they use off for me and the whole thing like Adam, but

108
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Metallica you hung in there for it, even though that was so chaotic.

109
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You persevered. You could have thrown your hands up and you didn't

110
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What's feeling different that you decided

111
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To basically confront

112
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.690
JESSICA G: YOUR SON'S FATHER what what's changing what's what's going on oh no no know I just feel like

113
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.570
JESSICA G: Like enough like enough.

114
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:48.900
JESSICA G: You know, that's the nice like either you're in it, or you're not. That's how I feel. So I feel like that's why I started working because at the end of the day.

115
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:56.070
JESSICA G: I don't want to have to depend on him anymore. I'm tired of it. And he's

116
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:07.530
JESSICA G: just tired of it. I'm tired of it. I need to do for myself. I'm like, I know how. And so the days that I'm working with the other company.

117
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:17.220
JESSICA G: He's going to be off those days. So I'm going to pick up like the 12 HOUR SHIFTS 14 hour shifts, if I can, and then

118
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.750
JESSICA G: The days that I'm working with my grandparents. Well, I'm able to take my son and I made sure that was okay, you know,

119
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:39.000
JESSICA G: I mentioned I was okay with everybody. And yeah, like my grandparents love him like that when they don't see him, they get so sad. And my grandma starts crying and then mopey and then he goes over and they're happy again, you know, so

120
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:46.650
JESSICA G: So it's cool, I guess. So that's, that's what's going on. I just, it's frustrating because

121
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.620
JESSICA G: That's something that's been bothering me for a long time with my son status that

122
00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:04.770
JESSICA G: There will be times when I'm like hey, like I need this from the store, please. He's a mate and he works maintenance and so he has the he does work or work orders.

123
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:15.420
JESSICA G: So he goes to different locations and in between locations like he's able to go to Home Depot, he's able to do other fields.

124
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:29.460
JESSICA G: So I know he's able to run to the store, which is like right around the corner from our apartment, really what I need and then go back and less than 15 minutes Albuquerque is not that big.

125
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:38.250
JESSICA G: You know, we can get around the list of 15 minutes. Yeah. And so I'm just frustrated. I'm just tired like I

126
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.440
JESSICA G: He just like

127
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.270
JESSICA G: Check file.

128
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.620
JESSICA G: And it's not fair. It's not fair to me. It's not fair to listen.

129
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

130
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got some

131
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Some energy some real fire right now.

132
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Some motivated. Yeah, that's cool.

133
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

134
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.020
JESSICA G: It's really different than

135
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mind was very preoccupied in fear.

136
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it doesn't look like that right now it looks like you've got this is

137
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.420
JESSICA G: Good boost.

138
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Of confidence and might even be propelled a little bit by resentment and anger, like I've had it.

139
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.630
JESSICA G: That's accurate.

140
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it was on your list of things to do. I had said it for like June.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Get

142
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It right as we said it nice a nice long goal and you you possibly you're like, that's it. I'm just gonna go look it up.

143
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.150
JESSICA G: Yeah.

144
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.560
JESSICA G: You roll it.

145
00:16:51.240 --> 00:17:09.000
JESSICA G: And don't get me wrong, like there were taught minutes where I was like, I can't, I can't wait. If I go out. What if I get sick, you know, okay, worst case scenario, but then I was like, Okay, I'm gonna do it because if I don't do it right now that I'm never gonna get the best to do it again.

146
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.770
JESSICA G: So like for the interview. I was like,

147
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.520
JESSICA G: Should I go, should I just not go. No, I'm going to go. Because if not, then I'm not going to do it.

148
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.170
JESSICA G: Yeah.

149
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You used what I call the five second rule. It looks like you put that into place.

150
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.640
JESSICA G: Right, yeah.

151
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If I give myself more than five seconds. I'll talk myself out of it. The second I think in it. I just got to do it right then right now, right now, right now, right now.

152
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It does work. Man, I'm telling you. And if you ever yeah if you ever really are in a pinch. It's like crisis mode and you know you have to finish something get somewhere.

153
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.720
JESSICA G: You can

154
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You can fill it with just like counting. I know that seems really kooky but like 123123123 you can like literally bypass the messages trying to tell you all you know you're, you're going to get

155
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sick and

156
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You can bypass it but just some little mantra, even if it's counting a few numbers.

157
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get the thing done or I'll be okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

158
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.450
JESSICA G: Yeah, sorry I'm relocate again.

159
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Little, little sounds. He needs to make

160
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.380
JESSICA G: So,

161
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.680
JESSICA G: So yeah alright

162
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's next for you, then what's next on the to do list. What do you need to do to prepare for this new new routine in the day.

163
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:06.720
JESSICA G: I don't know. I know what I need to do like physically. I have to get a copy of my driving record, but then we. These are close

164
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:27.300
JESSICA G: To go get his car insured and registered to my name because he hasn't even done that and I haven't either. So I know I have to do that. And then I have a training tomorrow for that job. And if I if I have all the paperwork, then I start this week.

165
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:28.860
JESSICA G: But

166
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll time as the training.

167
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.330
JESSICA G: And nine o'clock.

168
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:48.360
JESSICA G: So I'm going to wake up extra early. Get ready. Attend group and then after group. I'm going to shoot straight over. Okay. Beautiful.

169
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see copy of driving of your driving record to show that you're reliable driver kind of thing.

170
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:04.290
JESSICA G: Um, yeah, yeah, basically, to make sure that I don't have any like driving violations or anything like that.

171
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it seem like you'd be able to do some of these things online like

172
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Nowadays, such a thing.

173
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:26.700
JESSICA G: Yeah, so I looked it up and I can do it online. And I'm hoping that I can just like download it maybe download a PDF of my driving record or or something and hopefully email it to them.

174
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:43.170
JESSICA G: And then as far as registering the car. I have to ensure it first. So I'm Nicola insurance company, hopefully in a little while, and then get it insured and then apply for the registration online as well and sell them be very close

175
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there any reason you could still go to the job training tomorrow, even if this paperwork is an all figured out tonight.

176
00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:09.150
JESSICA G: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm still gonna go. I'm still gonna go even if I don't like have everything that turned into them. I'm still going to go and I'm still going to turn it in. And then as soon as I get everything like all set, that's when I'll be able to start working

177
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:11.760
And

178
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

179
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:23.940
JESSICA G: Oh no, I was just gonna say my goal is to get it done, hopefully today that way by Wednesday. There are Thursday. I'll be ready to nice

180
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, you mentioned, and it was you didn't spend a lot of time fixating on it, but I don't know, maybe there was a bigger emotional reaction to it. Your aunties unreliable Miss notice like

181
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How upsetting. Are you just kind of like, that's just the way she is. I've got to just hold her more accountable, like a call earlier calm or often sort of

182
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: See her limitations REALLY SEE WHAT SHE IS AND NOT EXPECT MORE THAN WHAT SHE'S REALLY capable of, like, I don't know, what are you doing with what she did.

183
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:15.000
JESSICA G: Why it's a whole it's a whole being with her like I already obsessed over it. I because I was like What is her motive. What's their motive. Why all of a sudden

184
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:23.820
JESSICA G: You know when I've been telling them for a long time, like, Hey, you know, she's not doing what she's supposed to do, you know,

185
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.040
JESSICA G: And

186
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:36.000
JESSICA G: I can help you if you want that Grandma I can help you and I'll do everything that you need me to do.

187
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.520
JESSICA G: You know, and

188
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:47.490
JESSICA G: I made that offer. I guess my grandma talked to my auntie. And so the answer was no, that it's all that everybody's all set.

189
00:22:48.210 --> 00:23:06.390
JESSICA G: So okay, so that's fine. But why all of a sudden when I'm like, Okay, I'm going to start working. And then I call my grandmother go cleaner house because my grandma asked me if I can she offered to pay me $50 if I go clean her house like once every two weeks.

190
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:21.210
JESSICA G: Nice and i mean i i'm not gonna take the money, right. I've always clean her house just to help her. Just because you know they've helped me so much and so

191
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:30.000
JESSICA G: I was thinking to myself, Why all of a sudden, like what, you know what, like I didn't trust that and she's

192
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.240
JESSICA G: Um, my auntie is really

193
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:45.840
JESSICA G: Hypocritical I guess you can say like she's the nicest person ever to your face.

194
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:56.160
JESSICA G: Uh huh. And then she's like really caddy and like there's, there was an incident, the other day where she called my mom.

195
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.890
JESSICA G: Saying stuff and it shows the whole thing.

196
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.880
JESSICA G: So, um, are you back.

197
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.330
JESSICA G: Okay.

198
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.710
JESSICA G: Thank you.

199
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.520
JESSICA G: But yeah, so

200
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:28.380
JESSICA G: There was just a nightmare motive and now it just feels like she's like like trying to sabotage me or, or, like, you know,

201
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.270
She ever Jennifer's

202
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:49.290
JESSICA G: Well, that's the one. It's the same empty where she remember that I told you, as she was pressing me to go get a job at that place that she worked for as a caregiver and then the job went under, and I never got paid.

203
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.320
JESSICA G: Yes, that's the same one.

204
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You

205
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You still wonder whether she knew about that.

206
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.110
JESSICA G: Oh yeah, oh yeah, I wonder whether she knew about that. I wonder

207
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:16.890
JESSICA G: Like she knew they were having problems with the IRS she she hadn't gotten paid herself for a couple weeks and she was still telling me to go apply

208
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:28.710
JESSICA G: And I went and I applied. She helped me like, you know, get in the door and and I worked and I worked every single day and I worked hard and

209
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.480
JESSICA G: And then all of a sudden it's like, don't go to work. Don't go anymore. Okay.

210
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.310
JESSICA G: And then

211
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:53.580
JESSICA G: The payday came up and I was like, so we're supposed to get paid today, right, and then she gave me this story that didn't make sense they made no sense whatsoever.

212
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.780
JESSICA G: Like I was like that's not how it works like you know

213
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:07.950
JESSICA G: That's just not how it works. You don't. You don't like work for a whole month without getting paid. And then, like, you know, I don't know how to explain it.

214
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:18.750
JESSICA G: So I just, I never even said anything. I feel that I just left it alone, but I feel like that was messed up.

215
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me hear the cynic, you know the worst thing that she could be up to the way she could sabotage you let's just go there. I'm not going to tell her. You're having these thoughts.

216
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to make sure. Like, you're not being naive, let's say, Okay, let's just air it out. What if she says, okay, grandma is going to need you here. I'm going to make a number up Tuesdays and Thursdays.

217
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to need to hear

218
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: How might that be sabotaging to you and your plans. What do you think

219
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.110
JESSICA G: Well,

220
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.740
JESSICA G: At first I was like

221
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:13.890
JESSICA G: Because she started telling me, Oh, you don't even really have to be here at that specific time. Just make sure you clock in the hours.

222
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.070
JESSICA G: You know, and I'm like, I'm not gonna do. I would never do that. Like, you know,

223
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:33.720
JESSICA G: And I feel like she just wants somebody else on board so that everybody else stops ragging on her because my other auntie. She's like, threatening. Like, if any, if anything ever happens to my parents.

224
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:42.240
JESSICA G: I swear, like you're going to be in so much trouble because you're the one that's supposed to be taking care of them and if

225
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:50.670
JESSICA G: Something happens to them and you're not taking care of them properly and doing what you're supposed to do. You're just collecting the check, then

226
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:59.070
JESSICA G: I'm gonna get you. And I'm gonna report you like basically like that. So at first. My idea was like, okay, is she trying to get somebody else arm.

227
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:18.000
JESSICA G: So that way you know that tension can be off of her. But then I was like, nah, I talked to my mom, I was like, Mom, you don't know your sister better than I do. What do you think is going on. And I explained to her and she was like, Oh, she just wants. She just doesn't want to not do the work.

228
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:25.380
JESSICA G: She doesn't want to do the dirty work. So you'll go and you'll clean and you'll do everything you're supposed to do.

229
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And take the credit for it.

230
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.050
Okay.

231
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.410
JESSICA G: Which is fine with me. I don't care.

232
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.590
JESSICA G: Whatever works for her.

233
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's talk a little bit about the other piece. Let's talk about the reason why you want a job to begin with. One that job, meaning money.

234
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not okay.

235
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Simply put, why do you want a job.

236
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.770
JESSICA G: I want a job so that

237
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.250
JESSICA G: I can have money.

238
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

239
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If you only work three days a week because you're doing this thing for your grandparents and you won't be making

240
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.900
Money.

241
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because sometimes it sounds like you might kind of just do it because their family.

242
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And on top of that you might have all this, I call it agita like tension.

243
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family members may come after you when your auntie throws you under the bus, like I'm joining you in your paranoia.

244
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.000
JESSICA G: Yeah.

245
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, I don't know, could be or not.

246
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is

247
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want is work. So if you see so

248
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen just play this one out. What would happen if you worked

249
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Four or five days a week and then came over maybe when you were free and did some cleaning maybe maybe only once a week, you did a deep cleaning for them.

250
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you live with yourself. Is that something you could tolerate

251
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe then your auntie would step up. Maybe she would do her job or family members might guilt trip or into doing it. I have no idea the dynamics there but

252
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you might be making the money you need freedom.

253
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:35.730
JESSICA G: Freedom.

254
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.590
JESSICA G: Yeah.

255
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.690
JESSICA G: That could work.

256
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What if this

257
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is jobs that oh no we have so many patients that I need you to see.

258
00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I what I wonder is, if you'll say, No, no, no. I gotta, I gotta work for my grandparents.

259
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:10.080
JESSICA G: Oh no. Okay, so my primary the primary job is going to be first premiere healthcare.

260
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.920
JESSICA G: That's going to be like my like my

261
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.300
JESSICA G: First job. I guess you can say, and so

262
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:26.220
JESSICA G: My son status off Thursday, Friday and Sunday. So those are the days that I'm going to work there.

263
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:36.180
JESSICA G: And then so all the other days I'm gonna clock in like four hours.

264
00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.590
JESSICA G: I my grandparents okay in the morning.

265
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:50.040
JESSICA G: Or in the evening and just go spend time with them and go like, you know, a light housekeeping meal prep, all of that.

266
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.350
JESSICA G: And then, um,

267
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.940
JESSICA G: Yeah, so that's what I kind of had in mind.

268
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, looking ahead, knowing that if this theory of yours is true. Is there any chart.

269
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That is used. Yeah, I mean, have you ever been. Have you ever been someplace like target on on the back of the door. It shows the person that did what at what time mop the floor. Clean the counters.

270
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, empty the trash and then you'll see the next shift, you'll see a time and what was done the person sign your name.

271
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So when the kind of work that you're describing is there any of that kind of accountability, like I did the laundry. I did this and this and this. Is there any of that in place.

272
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:51.360
JESSICA G: I don't know. I'm gonna right now when I go take those papers to the to the

273
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.820
JESSICA G: To the office for this is for my grandparents.

274
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.970
JESSICA G: Job. I'm a mask and see if they have some kind of like spreadsheet.

275
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:08.130
JESSICA G: And if not, then I'll just make my thank you so much for that idea.

276
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:15.180
JESSICA G: I've definitely good to use it. If not, I'm gonna make my own like spreadsheet.

277
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is one of the reasons why I'm saying it is because of that earlier conversation which was

278
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: My auntie might throw me under the bus. But if a family member comes by your grandparents house and they see you just cleaned. We just did the laundry.

279
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see it right there.

280
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can even have your grant your grandparents initial it as in see it. I just want you to see that I'm not on it. Sorry, Grandma. Take a look. See, I did your laundry. If you can initial here, here and here that shows that I did it.

281
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it, then it's off of you. It's not hearsay, then a family member comes by and they look around, they go, oh, this place looks good on Jessica was here I see

282
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The difference between them. When your aunties there. She'll be like, What the heck is this, she may not want to do the cleaning. She may not want to do these things. Now, someone comes by.

283
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You are only there for this time period, your grandparents signed off on it already.

284
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it's a mess. Well, it's not you, it's on her. It's her shift. So now I don't know idea if that's just going to piss your aunt off. I have no idea. Or if she might step up and be like, well,

285
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I did the ironing. And I made food for the next three weeks and two of them are in the freezer. You know, maybe having, you know, we can

286
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: hold ourselves accountable and model and then maybe on TV will want to do the same. I have no idea.

287
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a thought.

288
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.060
Something you think

289
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.500
JESSICA G: Is it bad that I hope I picked her up.

290
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.000
JESSICA G: I hope I make her look bad because she's wrong.

291
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.170
JESSICA G: She's wrong for what she's doing.

292
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:20.100
JESSICA G: Yeah, she's there for them, though she was there for them all the time she takes them everywhere they need to go. She does. She does she does her job, but um

293
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:29.670
JESSICA G: It's just sometimes she's not there when she supposed to be there or she's not there as much, or she goes out of town.

294
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.650
JESSICA G: For my arm.

295
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:32.490
JESSICA G: He doesn't like

296
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, the, the job is not to supervisor on right it's

297
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to do what she's gonna do

298
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably doesn't want to be pointed out what she's doing wrong. So you just go in, you'll do your thing and go. That's it, but I'm excited for you.

299
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.660
JESSICA G: Thank you.

300
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.220
JESSICA G: Maybe

301
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe your son's dad will

302
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he'll step up, you know, the interesting thing when we, the more we do for our children. We actually do connect to them or they become a closer relationship. Like, do you know what I mean.

303
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So they might actually bond more

304
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture.

305
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.370
JESSICA G: Hopefully,

306
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:28.230
JESSICA G: Maybe he'll step up more. I just, I don't know. He didn't seem too.

307
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.840
JESSICA G: happy for me.

308
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, to not have everything ready for him when he gets home.

309
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.630
JESSICA G: And then my mom can

310
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

311
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.420
JESSICA G: When I told my mom.

312
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.580
JESSICA G: And

313
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.160
JESSICA G: She wasn't too happy either

314
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about that. She thinks she should be haunting carrier, son.

315
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.170
JESSICA G: I don't know what her

316
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.910
JESSICA G: But my suspicions are that

317
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:14.100
JESSICA G: Her way of thinking is like know if she gets this job. She's going to be tied down there.

318
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.230
JESSICA G: And

319
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.560
JESSICA G: Like I feel like she's holding on to this hope that we move back to California.

320
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.390
Really

321
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.320
JESSICA G: So me getting a job is like

322
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.800
JESSICA G: devastating to her because it like when I thought, yes.

323
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:42.900
JESSICA G: Okay baby. No, I says. It says when I got when I enrolled into school she

324
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:57.060
JESSICA G: She freaked out. She told me so many things she told me that I'm stupid for doing that, that I'm making the wrong decision and just, you know, just

325
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:04.320
JESSICA G: So upset about it. And I'm sorry I didn't understand that was I was upset and now

326
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.630
JESSICA G: When I told her about the job and I heard the same tone in her voice. I told her mom.

327
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:21.180
JESSICA G: Why are you upset. I don't, I don't understand. And she's like, No, why would I be upset I'm not upset. I'm like, I can hear it in the tone of your voice.

328
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:35.040
JESSICA G: Like you, you've got the same way when I enrolled in school. And I just want to know why, why, why is that making you upset. Like, I don't want to make you upset. I want to make you proud.

329
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:43.470
JESSICA G: You know, and she was like, no, no. Everything's okay. And I heard tone kind of change and she seemed like

330
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.700
JESSICA G: Like that kind of made her snap out of it, I guess.

331
00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how much easier it is to say it to me. I wonder if you have hope that will end up going back to California, but how that direct question you may not have asked your mama.

332
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: weirdo.

333
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the, what's the difference between, why are you why did you change your tone. That's the same tone as when I went to school versus mom were you holding out some hope that maybe you and I would live together back in California. What's the difference between those two.

334
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.880
JESSICA G: I don't know what I think that I just

335
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.960
JESSICA G: I already know she's gonna say

336
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What's she gonna say

337
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.860
JESSICA G: She's gonna deny it.

338
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be lied to.

339
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of them. She's gonna she's gonna she's gonna have to lie to you and you do not like that.

340
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.740
JESSICA G: No, I don't like for her to like guests like me.

341
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.370
JESSICA G: And make me

342
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.310
JESSICA G: Feel like or make me out to be the one the crazy one and

343
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.880
JESSICA G: I'm just making things up, you know,

344
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.740
JESSICA G: Like I could say the same thing about her like lately I've been wanting to

345
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.220
JESSICA G: Tell her like mom like, I need you.

346
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.730
JESSICA G: I really wish you were here.

347
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.980
JESSICA G: What i don't know i don't

348
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.460
JESSICA G: I don't, because

349
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.480
JESSICA G: There's no reason to anymore.

350
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.050
JESSICA G: It's never gonna happen.

351
00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I just get if she somehow miraculously does himself gross. I think you'd recognize the change to be more honest, the way she talks, she asked direct question she would answer direct questions. You don't answer a live question with a why question.

352
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you'd recognize an honest issue if you saw it.

353
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's part of the reason why

354
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I did that weird thing about talking about the text message like what's going to cause problem why we obsessing over the text.

355
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because

356
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything you and I do from a text. How long a text takes all of your communication.

357
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is therapeutic. It could be at my client, you

358
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.870
Like value.

359
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: An honest response, maybe more than someone who didn't, you know, if they didn't grow up with with a parent that sending mixed messages this text, they'd be like, why are we talking about this. What are you doing,

360
00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But for someone who grew up with a parent who sends them like three messages at the same time, like, what, what am I don't know how I'm supposed to feel right now I'm gonna go cuckoo.

361
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I wanted to be really clear. I wanted to tell you honestly what my brain was doing, how I filter it

362
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having nothing to do with your credibility, but having to do with this is how I interpreted. Three years later, having worked with people from Breitbart health and 14 years. Having worked in felony drug court. What do I. What's my filter.

363
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That I came about that long before I met you, my filter. Something to do with you. Okay. And for you because right that kind of information coming in and you never get a chance to get clear eat that get clear information I want I wanted in here for us to have that opportunity.

364
00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:06.180
JESSICA G: Yeah, that was, that was pretty satisfying like I felt like it was a satisfying feeling for me like having that conversation with you.

365
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice what Jessica how quickly, at least, it felt quick for me. Once we talked about the facts and the fact that, like, here's my worldview and here's yours and oh yeah I could see how you see it that way. And I can see how you'd see it that way, then you and I were done.

366
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it's done.

367
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.090
JESSICA G: Really, yeah.

368
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we could then we moved on to other things. So

369
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.880
My broccoli.

370
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that you would end up feeling crazy your or gasoline more if you ask a direct question because watch how it might look, you know, Mom.

371
00:43:49.080 --> 00:44:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The meaning watch the meeting I make out of this time that I hear about getting this job so familiar to when I went to school. It makes me wonder, do you still hold out hope that maybe when I will live together Monte you miss me

372
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now he might say, Oh, you're being ridiculous, what kind of doctor asked her parents that kind of question.

373
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: On it, right, a non, answer, answer.

374
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something wrong with you. What kind of, what kind of daughter asked her. Oh, that's ridiculous. What kind of mother wouldn't want their daughter to succeed as a good one.

375
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

376
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.570
JESSICA G: That's what

377
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.170
JESSICA G: That's what boggles my mind and why

378
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.320
JESSICA G: What

379
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:49.980
JESSICA G: I don't know, just her thought process. Like, why is she upset about me making steps for my life like

380
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not going to get a straight answer.

381
00:44:55.650 --> 00:45:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking why questions. So the difference between the way I'm doing it is, it's a it's a direct content driven question. Mom, do you miss me

382
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, you sometimes think about hoping that you and I might live in in California again.

383
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're ready. If you've really accepted the fact that she's going to do some dancing around

384
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.380
Questions.

385
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: At least one of you.

386
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is really being genuine and honest and you were asking her why questions anyway. Did you notice that why mom, I noticed your tongue is that you are asking her why questions in general, I will tell you this word why

387
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's only recently that I really incorporated it into my language. I stopped using it for years.

388
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I stopped.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.720
JESSICA G: Wow. Yeah.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I stopped using should I stopped using why completely. I just detox completely

391
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to see what what happened.

392
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really interesting things happened. The people that I was talking to or less defensive

393
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When I asked someone. Why, what they do is they're in a position of having to defend

394
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I have to defend myself. Like, is there something wrong with what I do. Why do you ask the why. What do you mean what we what people are asked her why question they tend to get defensive

395
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It look. Look at the difference, instead of why as if mom has to defend herself, but more like you're sharing

396
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The Thai recognize the tone. Mom, it's kind of similar. And you're asking a

397
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.300
JESSICA G: Question mark to

398
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Do kind of miss us being in California together kind of

399
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a closed ended question is a yes or it's a no.

400
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: No, she's a master at it like most people are if they're any good at.

401
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And they'll say something like, what kind of daughter would ask them, of course, I want to live with you. Of course I miss you and I get that.

402
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.080
JESSICA G: But you have to shoot thank

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

405
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But you got to ask your direct question.

406
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying out loud. The meaning that you're making out of that tone. There's no mystery anymore for her. She, she knows exactly what meaning is going on for you.

407
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no mystery. You're saying it mom to kind of wish we were back in in California together to ever think about that is that kind of like the stream thing.

408
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it. You are honest.

409
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: She gets defensive okay but didn't ask a why question. You are just sharing the

410
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting you made out of her tone. You have a right

411
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To your own interpretation of things.

412
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.730
JESSICA G: And now she knows how I feel, or what I think.

413
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.160

JESSICA G: I feel the same way, like I

417
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.890
JESSICA G: I hope that maybe one day she'll

418
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.470
JESSICA G: Come to her senses.

422
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:20.340
