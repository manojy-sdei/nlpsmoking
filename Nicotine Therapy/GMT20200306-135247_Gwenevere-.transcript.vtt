00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.149
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Garcia.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

4
00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.000
Morning.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it's been a month. So we're at like a monthly

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that feeling like enough for a while. Just kind of touching base once a month that feel like enough support right now.

7
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.670
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I mean, I feel pretty good. You know, I haven't had really any kind of

8
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.260
Anthony Garcia: Problems or anything, you know,

9
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we'll keep it like that then um if you want to. I've noticed what's been kind of handy. You know, if you do the thing where you kind of do. Where is it that little moon thing. I don't know if you have an iPhone, but to do what you call a

10
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Like to hold notification.

11
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.190
Anthony Garcia: Yeah.

12
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can put it on there. So we're not interrupted with BUZZING

13
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, do not disturb that's the word I was looking for.

14
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Find it

15
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Like when you go to sleep. Do you ever put it on. Do Not Disturb

16
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.270
Anthony Garcia: No, but I just I just put it now.

17
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790
Anthony Garcia: I do have a mode right there. Like, as soon as I get that menu.

18
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Alright, sweet. Okay, so what does mean though because we're seeing each other only once a month is on each time I want to get just one statement on the goal.

19
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't let's not go on and not otherwise the whole time will take up on review and goals. So I don't think that's really what we want to do. So let's just one statement, maybe

20
00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to implementing conflict resolution skills kind of touching base on how you assess how you're doing on conflict resolution skills are you

21
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to implement them or right now. Do you need to say to me, I don't have enough. I need more

22
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you at with that. And the goal is manage my stress and anger. But what I'm meeting you to do right to demonstrate the ability to move towards that goal is

23
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: To implement conflict resolution skills, but if you're not engaging in any conflict, you're just sort of being a doormat. You're shutting up and repressing everything and you're not practicing those new skills. So what's really going on over there.

24
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.560
Anthony Garcia: Um,

25
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.170
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I don't

26
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.020
Anthony Garcia: I don't really like

27
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.110
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. I really haven't had too much complex recently to where I

28
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.690
Anthony Garcia: Can think of, you know,

29
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.040
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. I guess I just been handling it the way I was have been just kind of

30
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.810
Anthony Garcia: You know, trying to get angry.

31
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but

32
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The

33
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:22.230
Anthony Garcia: Problems for me is always been pretty pretty high, but I've noticed that I don't seem very angry as much as I used to. You know, I like even you this whole week gone by, so quick. I mean, I can't even think though like one thing that made me mad, you know,

34
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold that

35
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that your cousin is still GIVEN YOU LOOKS you're doing something with it. Anthony try to capture what you're doing.

36
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see it when you perceive it, you're making a new meaning of it, something's happening because you could get pissed off at it if you wanted to. What are you doing with it now.

37
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:57.060
Anthony Garcia: I mean, yeah, there's times where, like, yeah, I mean, I get irritated, but I just, I guess. I don't know what I've been doing with it. I just, it just doesn't get me angry anymore.

38
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:11.640
Anthony Garcia: I've been kind of just going kind of with the flow and letting things just kind of, I don't know, I just not not trying to make things happen all the time you know where I'm just

39
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:27.780
Anthony Garcia: Want everything the way I want it to be, you know, I just whatever is happening. I just kind of go with the flow. Now, and I know that this isn't permanent. You know, I just, I'm just looking

40
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:44.040
Anthony Garcia: Towards the future and hoping that it's going to be better than what it has been. And it's been, you know, like even, like, I don't know, I can't really explain it, but I feel better. You know, I wake up every morning. I'm not

41
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.380
Anthony Garcia: Like mad to go to work. I'm not pissed off. And my daughter. I'm not

42
00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:00.390
Anthony Garcia: You know, I'm just get up already ready, getting ready, get ready to go. And, you know, a day goes by, and that's it. You know, I

43
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. That's beautiful. Love it. But it's really important that we name what you're doing. So we can reinforce it. Okay. Because if you just think it's a fluke.

44
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if we only say it's just the medication which I do think it has a beautiful impact on you.

45
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we don't name some things that are intrinsically yours forever. And we keep labeling it. Oh, it's this medicine, you're going to miss out on feeling confidence. So let me just ask a couple of really precise questions.

46
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see your cousin gathering antiques and going antique shopping. What do you think, what's the next thought when you proceed. He's investing in something else. What's the next thought

47
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.800
Anthony Garcia: I have no back to it. It's like

48
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.290
Anthony Garcia: I don't care anymore.

49
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care. So it's not a threat because remember what a thread. It was before you understand your

50
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:07.110
Anthony Garcia: Before I thought like I was going to lose the shop I lose my job. I was going to have any money. He was going to go start doing things with other people.

51
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.880
Anthony Garcia: But I mean it just, if that's what he wants to do. I mean, I'm happy for him. You know, like

52
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.800
Anthony Garcia: Go do it. You know, it's like, it's not going to change me. I'm going to be able to go get a job anywhere, whether it's at a tire shop or somewhere else.

53
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:40.800
Anthony Garcia: And and I just feel that I don't make up excuses. I'm why I wake up every morning I go to work. I believe in the last even like year through all the times where I didn't have my medication on time and stuff. And I didn't feel good. I was still at work.

54
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.460
Anthony Garcia: You know, so I just don't believe that I'm gonna let him.

55
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:59.220
Anthony Garcia: Whatever he decides to do I don't want. I'm not gonna let that dictate how I feel more, you know, I just, I don't care. I don't care what he does. I just don't

56
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you recognize

57
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How different that is if I played a recording. I mean you and I have gotten into and they're kind of funny. I'm yelling, I mean, I know.

58
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not really yelling, like the mad yelling, I know there's care. But do you see the difference. I don't care. I have. And you know what that speaks to self efficacy

59
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I can go get another job. You could not say that to me before you couldn't do it. You were adamant. You are going to stay in your fear, you're so afraid.

60
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're gonna you're convincing me over and over. No, no, no, I can't. I can't. I can't. I, your mind is somewhere else. There's just, sort of, it sounds like this relaxed. I'm

61
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of space right now I'm getting up, I've got this job. I'm getting by. It's not like the rest of my life. It's temporary

62
00:07:51.990 --> 00:08:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy clearly is into something else. This is good for now. But there's no sense of urgency and having to change him and hear from him that he's got to be this other way trying to change you're trying to change him, you're not. It doesn't sound like you're doing that, but you

63
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.070
Anthony Garcia: Know, I think I, I think I finally accepted that this is something I cannot change, you know,

64
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.890
Anthony Garcia: That change him.

65
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.690
Anthony Garcia: You've been telling me this whole time. I cannot change him.

66
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:34.470
Anthony Garcia: Now I understand, I can. I mean, I can only change myself and do what I have to do to survive and he's just, I'm not gonna let him do that to me anymore. I mean, he wasn't he doesn't even know he's doing it to me.

67
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

68
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:49.410
Anthony Garcia: I never even told them that that's what he did to me. But you know, I don't think I will ever. Maybe I will one day, I don't know what right now. I don't think I can tell them, because I don't want him to feel like

69
00:08:50.640 --> 00:09:06.750
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. I just don't feel bad about I just know that it just doesn't bother me anymore. If the shop closes tomorrow I'm still gonna smile wake up tomorrow, smiling, and then I'll go look for another job. Okay, that's beautiful. Now,

70
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. Take that. Now see if you take pride in it. No doubt that's yours and I'm restating and I want to keep restating it

71
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And at the same time. Now I want you to picture that same thing you can do. And do you believe that what's happening is it is a sense of accepting what you cannot change.

72
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it also that you feel some sense of confidence that everything's going to be okay. You don't know how, but I'll work it out is there that sense of confidence, even if it's gone up a little bit.

73
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.920
Anthony Garcia: I feel very confident now because

74
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.550
Anthony Garcia: I never thought in my life that I could get down 2.5 milligrams

75
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.290
Anthony Garcia: Feel good

76
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.420
Anthony Garcia: You know, and

77
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:10.590
Anthony Garcia: The fear that I had throughout this whole program was the withdrawals, you know, and that's why I always tell my doctor, a real maybe I'll wait another week or so.

78
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:22.920
Anthony Garcia: And then we kind of started just dropping. You know, I guess we both just decided to start dropping increment increments. And I notice I'm not feeling as bad as I thought that was

79
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:37.050
Anthony Garcia: You know, I think it was all kind of site like I psyched myself to make myself withdraw you know more. I still didn't feel bad few times, but it was manageable. I was still able to work get through the day.

80
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:50.730
Anthony Garcia: It was hard, but like I know, I know that things aren't just going to be handed to me if I want things I'm gonna have to work hard towards it and I'm ready for it, you know.

81
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.950
Anthony Garcia: Like I have more energy.

82
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.360
Anthony Garcia: My brain is so foggy as it used to be.

83
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.780
Anthony Garcia: I took the kids to the mall. The other day, it was great.

84
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:19.650
Anthony Garcia: But I don't know. It just everything just seemed to be good since I've dropped down because I've been taking my medication and even with the the sleep aid that Dr. Gabriel gave me the the

85
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.050
Anthony Garcia: Seroquel the 25 milligrams is enough for me.

86
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's

87
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.430
Anthony Garcia: I mean,

88
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Any more than that. You guys are like wiped out for the day.

89
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.590
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I'll take it at about eight and by nine o'clock. I'm out.

90
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:42.720
Anthony Garcia: And when I wake up in the morning. It's like 530 I'm energized, I feel good. I get up. I have my coffee.

91
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:53.370
Anthony Garcia: This morning I already took all the trash bins out and everything and got ready for this meeting and just, you know, I just feel better. Well,

92
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.720
I'm so glad

93
00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:08.880
Anthony Garcia: And not all pissed off all the time either. I'm not all mad or thinking about ways to get mad or like sometimes in the morning. I remember waking up and like just like think of things to be pissed off when I get to work, you know,

94
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.230
Anthony Garcia: Everybody, you know, and I hadn't been doing that, you know,

95
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:23.340
Anthony Garcia: nobody's told me yet that they think I'm different. But I'm waiting for somebody to finally to say, hey, you seem a little bit different, you know, maybe

96
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, that

97
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.240
Anthony Garcia: I do feel different.

98
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's what matters because remember the old philosophy is waiting for other people to reaffirm what you already perceived. So let's stay here with what you perceive I value your assessment of yourself. I really do. Stay there. Let's keep reinforcing that

99
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now what I was about to do before we were moving forward a little bit with this. I want you to picture.

100
00:12:51.720 --> 00:13:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you can picture your cousin doing his thing. Is there anything and be being that I don't care. And then right next door, as if another split screen is this other thing which is I see my dad walking up the stairs and I

101
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I remember. Oh, what an idiot. Oh, or do I see my dad and some other thought is going on, or is it still what an idiot. And then something else, what's going on when you see your father sort of hovering around outside your door.

102
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.970
Anthony Garcia: And

103
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:40.050
Anthony Garcia: It hasn't really happened. But what did happen was the other day. Me and him were after I got off work out to the show. We're going to go get something to eat.

104
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:57.000
Anthony Garcia: And as I was driving my mom calls me and she wanted me to pick her up at this apartment from so Korean lady just down the road. And so she said yeah your dad's not picking up his phone. I said, Yeah, he's with me and

105
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:58.470
And

106
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:10.050
Anthony Garcia: It must let us find at the house. So he that's what he did, he did he leave his phone at the house. So anyways, we get to the apartment and my dad's picture up here like

107
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:18.600
Anthony Garcia: A lot of times, so I'm waiting there at the gate and my mom calls and I'm looking for my mom and I can't find it, and

108
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:30.120
Anthony Garcia: I call my mom and she's all I'm here, I'm here at the game. I'm on here at the gate. Don't you see me. And so I asked my dad. Are you sure we're at the right place.

109
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:49.260
Anthony Garcia: And I was on and he was uh yeah I think so. It looks kind of different in the nighttime or whatever. And I was our dad you've picked my mom up like 20 times from here and drop her off. You don't know what it looks like. And he blew up. He's told me

110
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:59.670
Anthony Garcia: Don't worry about what I do or how I think or how I see things and he blew up and

111
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are right next to

112
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.540
Anthony Garcia: Next to me in the car.

113
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.440
And

114
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.200
Anthony Garcia: I mean, I didn't yell at him.

115
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.910
Anthony Garcia: I just told him.

116
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.490
Anthony Garcia: Whatever is to have, you know,

117
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:23.940
Anthony Garcia: Okay. My mom got in the car and then I just kind of like got agitated with both of them. And then I started, you kind of tell them both of them off, you know,

118
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you were telling them.

119
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.810
Anthony Garcia: Like I told my mom. Next time you have a want somebody to pick you up and they never picked you up before

120
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:44.250
Anthony Garcia: Like, look out for them. You know, I mean, don't just expect me to fucking just like park right in front of you and pick up right up front end, you know,

121
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:59.070
Anthony Garcia: And I kind of seen hurting her you know what she got kind of hurt so I don't know maybe say, and then my dad was saying that you know what you pick up your mouth. From now on, and I said, I'm at work where she needs to be picked up is I don't give a shit.

122
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:10.800
Anthony Garcia: Something that I said you know what you need to tell mom that she was on. I will. I will. And I was I, yeah, I want to see someone my Ma ma ma. I think that has something to tell you.

123
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.950
Anthony Garcia: What you got so pissed off.

124
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But did he say anything.

125
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.600
Anthony Garcia: He stopped talking and he wouldn't say he he hasn't talked to me sense has been reading

126
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.010
Anthony Garcia: I was busy, but I didn't blow up like I normally do like psycho.

127
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:35.040
Anthony Garcia: Crazy blow up. But I did get kind of agitated. I know, I still get a little bit irritated with

128
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, the way you guys speak to each other is is quite aggressive, there's no there's no doubt about that. That's a norm for you guys. It doesn't doesn't match up with like the rest of the way the world kind of talks to each other. It's still really intense. Okay.

129
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:57.180
Anthony Garcia: Can I just go open the door for like two seconds, because the dogs barking out their momentum out

130
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.740
Course

131
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.400
Anthony Garcia: Come on.

132
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.180
Anthony Garcia: Barking as easy as science telling me to open the door.

133
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We all called

134
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.010
Anthony Garcia: I let him in. Yeah.

135
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so one little thing I saw um

136
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, shoot. If I do that, then I'm gonna be able to move forward here let's let's keep going here.

137
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm making some notes, you're seeing some progress, you're still getting agitated. I just want to let you know that, of course, someone saying the way your father, talk to you.

138
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be a natural response to want to sort of defend this, the psyche, right, that that self, it makes sense that you would you would defend against it. You just aren't really practiced at

139
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're doing with your cousin is all you're going to need to do and you did a piece of it.

140
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what I did here, this a little. It's a little, a little. This is content. This has to do with I noticed when you were upset and then you're kind of talking with your mom. This is the only piece and you may have actually

141
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Said it differently when you were talking to her, but what I heard was missing what you actually wanted. So if it was me, I would be something like this. Um,

142
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I got frustrated because I was relying on Dad's memory and it was just bad timing. He forgot his phone. Um,

143
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I think next time. If I'm going to pick you up please text me the actual address, since if I'm going to be going to be the one picking you up. I want to have the physical address please just send it to me.

144
00:18:51.570 --> 00:19:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't assume I know it because I lose texts. I forget things. So each time you want me to pick you up somewhere, please just send it so that there's no miscommunication.

145
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's how I talk. Notice how it's exactly asking, I did say how I felt. But I also asked for behavior west. What I didn't say was something like what you did, which was, you need to take care of me.

146
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.400
Anthony Garcia: Yeah.

147
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's vague.

148
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a powerful statement and it's really hard for me to not see

149
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That that might have been on an emotional level. What was so painful about it like you ended up not feeling cared for, like, you made to feel helpless and like I'm trying to be of use and you're making it impossible for me. I don't, I don't know where to pick you up.

150
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:53.820
Anthony Garcia: You know, yeah. And then, you know, I really want to attack my mom make my dad made me so mad because he almost it almost felt like he was doing it on purpose, but that's that's like again.

151
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.880
Anthony Garcia: And inception, you know,

152
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.180
Anthony Garcia: It might not have a might have been his memories all

153
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:21.030
Anthony Garcia: Right. And, you know, so, you know, now I think about. I didn't think about it at that very moment, but I guess now that I think about it, it could have really been how it was. And that how I thought it was. And that's what I got to work on with him is stop thinking everything

154
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.170
Anthony Garcia: So I guess I'm like you said, oh I overanalyze everything

155
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So look what you did. Remember I put these two screens. I said, you play out what to do with your cousin, not caring and it's the same skill.

156
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You breathe, you just focus on this is temporary, this isn't for every not going to be living up right next to him forever. Okay.

157
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And the more physical distance you have from him, it's going to be easier to have the psychological distance, the emotional distance. But for now, so you see the screen over here.

158
00:20:51.660 --> 00:21:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did get activated by him. But I'm telling you, it's the same skill set that you're able to say that's not about me. My dad's losing his shit he's always been that way he can be that way. Tomorrow it's going to be that way in 20 minutes

159
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm all I can do is see what I can do to change and really accept what I can't and

160
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, saying,

161
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:26.310
Anthony Garcia: That's something I still need to work on because I mean I've figured out a few things. But I know, I know. It's gonna take me a while. I guess I just gotta

162
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:27.960
Anthony Garcia: But just

163
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:45.090
Anthony Garcia: Stay focused on and not let FEW THINGS LIKE THAT TURNED ME AWAY FROM ME, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN IT HAS A feel like how it was just for that few minutes I started getting discouraged and stuff. No, and I started like

164
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.410
Anthony Garcia: Almost to the point where I'm like, want to give up, you know, and then

165
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:58.140
Anthony Garcia: And then I think about all the things that I've been doing this last two years, and how far I've come. You know, and

166
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:09.420
Anthony Garcia: I don't ever want to go back to how that was, you know, ever. I want to take care of my daughter is like my biggest thing is what I wanted to do for her.

167
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:25.260
Anthony Garcia: And she needs me now, more than ever, it is because my mom took up and she asked, nobody. I'm all she gots now really, you know, my dad's here, but he's more just like here's $20. Have a good day.

168
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.520
Anthony Garcia: I know

169
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:39.450
Anthony Garcia: All the little things that she wants to talk about with her friends and all the other stuff. She comes in. She sits and she talks to me about him and stuff, but I'm not always knowing what to say and do

170
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.070
Anthony Garcia: But

171
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:53.190
Anthony Garcia: I just feel better that she's open now. And she's willing to sit there and talk to me and tell me what's going on with her life. So I feel like she trust me and

172
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.630
Anthony Garcia: She

173
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.600
Anthony Garcia: She believes that I can help her, I guess.

174
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.820
Anthony Garcia: You know those things make me feel better about myself.

175
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to reinforce, he said, I need to work on it.

176
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The. It can be as always. Do you remember the breathing and then you remember why don't you start to memorize or put on your screen.

177
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. And it's this one's agnostic. Like it doesn't have the god in if you'd like to God.

178
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Prayer, then you can memorize that when God grant me the serenity. But if you want to drop that piece, the part about acceptance is still really useful because in the moment, we can say, I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.

179
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel what's going on with your dad. You're like, This is ridiculous. There's no way to argue this man out of his way of being there, there isn't. You're not going to change him.

180
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's not going to show you care. The way you needed it.

181
00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna have to feel it elsewhere. And you can feel it with your daughter when she connects with you and trust you with your personal kids stories. It's fantastic. You've earned that and don't let that go. That's, that's love. But dad, he's a mess right now. Okay.

182
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:23.880
Anthony Garcia: I know. And then another thing about him that makes me mad and I hate to bring it up as bit but you know I just always kind of felt like

183
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:36.930
Anthony Garcia: Everything I say to him, and everything I do. He just looks down upon whether it's great or not even like when I do something for my daughter. He tries to pay me back for it.

184
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:58.980
Anthony Garcia: I just I bought I bought her a $50 pink sweater is like the pink sweater and pink and and we brought it up and I was, I told the show pop out which about what I got you. And he went, she went devotional yeah my dad got me this fish your sweater and my dad tried to pay me back for it.

185
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Right. I know, I know you're upset, but watch know how you were saying that this might be just my perspective. Let me see if I can read your mind.

186
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: My dad doesn't think I'm able to earn money. He thinks he's got to pay me back. I'm a man. I can do this myself, my daughter.

187
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:28.980
Anthony Garcia: Like almost like yeah, almost like where I'm a kid when I don't know I just feel very great about that, you know, I really like that hurt me, you know,

188
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be thinking

189
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

190
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic. Thank you for that. That means I can buy for more stuff. That means, maybe I can buy something for myself. And frankly, Dad. That's the only way you frickin show love. Anyway, I'll take that money.

191
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You have two choices among 100,000 choices. Those are just two. And all I did was guess at what you might have been thinking your way is pretty predictable, you're going to find

192
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.750
Anthony Garcia: The money.

193
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:09.510
Anthony Garcia: I would have fell into what he wanted me to do, which means he would have, I would have took the 50 and he would have been, I hear you know i don't know that's that's how I felt.

194
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:22.980
Anthony Garcia: At the time it irritated me. I didn't say nothing. I didn't get mad, but it's been itching me like for the last few days, and it's like still kicking me, you know,

195
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Other answer this first answer that comes to mind. What does your father. Oh, you

196
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.010
Anthony Garcia: Know,

197
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your father. Oh, you

198
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.840
Anthony Garcia: Maybe some love.

199
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he know how

200
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.620
Anthony Garcia: How you know

201
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This does your father know how to show love does it show it to your daughter.

202
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Our hand or 20

203
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:53.370
Anthony Garcia: Hands or the 20 that's when it. That's how he did it for me. That's what he did to me when I grew up, so I never really

204
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.750
Crazy.

205
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going crazy because he only knows

206
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To hand money and then feel love and U Haul. Listen to this. Listen, the way you you've looked at your life to when I don't have money in my pocket. How am I miserable. I feel

207
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: really uncomfortable, not having money money.

208
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is has been power.

209
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:27.330
Anthony Garcia: This has been doesn't believe that I'm doing better. I like almost to where he thinks that I need to stay here I need

210
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.470
Anthony Garcia: To be helped us. I don't know.

211
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.290
Anthony Garcia: It's just something in my head that just it's driving me crazy is just almost to where

212
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:48.960
Anthony Garcia: He won't let me have a life of my own, even with my daughter. You know, you know, I try to make choices for her and stuff and he always tries to undermine it. And Stephen

213
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some work with that.

214
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This is really, really, really, really, this is at the heart of it. Okay, no doubt, so let's let's not let's not do what we've done before.

215
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I try and convince you that there's a healthier way to think about it, you're going to need to feel it the same way you really grasp what it's like to really accept someone for for what they are.

216
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You still want your father to show you love to believe in you.

217
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: In the way you did when you were 678 910 so we're not going to analyze this, I want you to feel it on your own. I can't, I can't, hammer this into your head can't

218
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do you know take another year. Let's not do that, let's do these therapeutic interventions and let's have it be different.

219
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some of this CMDR and see if we can shift this, you have a very rigid neural network around that.

220
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm quite the sales woman. I can't get in there. I can't get in there. You love that thought.

221
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You are so right and he's got to change. Otherwise, we're still stuck here. So I think we should do do something a little different around it. So why don't we do this.

222
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to right now as we're even talking about notice you're like you're getting into it. Right. You're like, oh, he didn't believe in me. It's like you can't even see my progress right she

223
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:15.120
Anthony Garcia: Was it's almost to the point where he couldn't even believe that I bought a $50 sweater from my, my daughter. That's like my kid, you know,

224
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so and so let's break this down. What's the emotion, you're feeling right now. What was that when we started talking about what he did.

225
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.960
Anthony Garcia: Angry I was pissed off. Okay, I'm still mad like I'm still feeling bad.

226
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I can tell.

227
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good, though, because it gets it, we can work with that right now. So OK, now go to

228
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I am. Let's see if we can get right to the core. This is an important one, you get to the belief about the self right now say if we don't have it right away. I'm gonna help you get there right now. The belief I have about myself, is what I am.

229
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.250
Anthony Garcia: Sorry, I'm supposed to think of something that I am

230
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.620
Anthony Garcia: What do you yes

231
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's

232
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'll do one out here.

233
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.310
Okay, um,

234
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I am competent and that's going to be here. I feel excited and curious. I believe about myself. I'm confident

235
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to go to the sponsoring belief inside of you right now. What do you believe about yourself right now.

236
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.050
Anthony Garcia: I believe arm.

237
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.610
That's it. You're almost there. I'm

238
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.800
Anthony Garcia: I guess I'm generous.

239
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a nice one. But there's there's a negative one in there. That's the one I want to dig around that.

240
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.410
Anthony Garcia: Oh, I am

241
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:04.020
Anthony Garcia: A failure, you know, that's how I feel when like only when I'm around my day.

242
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. My guess is because we've been here before. That's exactly it. Now, from one to 10

243
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a failure gets to have a range, doesn't it. And so here we're going to put it in a range. How true is that right now. I'm a failure. One is that that actually is, it will go zero to 10 that is not true and 10 is it's absolutely true. How true is it right now. I'm a failure.

244
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.460
Anthony Garcia: Hey,

245
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

246
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And the opposite of that. I'm a failure. Think about this. When your dad is like, Well, here's a 20 I heard you guys sweater. What's a positive belief, you want to have about yourself.

247
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

248
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.330
Anthony Garcia: I'm a good dad.

249
00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay. And here comes that scale again but different numbers to throw you off a little it's going to be one to seven. How true is I'm a good dad seven is darn straight my percent seven is absolutely one is not really

250
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.420
Anthony Garcia: I would say maybe one or two.

251
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you want to put one and a half.

252
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Went to. Alright, cool. And right now, where are you feeling it in your body. Where are you feeling this what's getting charged

253
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:36.480
Anthony Garcia: My back my shoulder and like my shoulders are tense right now almost like punching something

254
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. All right. Um, so let's do, let's do this. Do you remember, you're going to get back in your note here to close down. Do you remember your, your nurturing

255
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your protective and your wife's figures.

256
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.910
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, my sister, my mom, your

257
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:01.890
Mom.

258
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.990
Anthony Garcia: My mom's like, the more protective. Yes. And then I think my sister was like that.

259
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.320
Anthony Garcia: Was one. Yeah, yeah.

260
00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're gonna

261
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to get in touch with that. Okay, so close your eyes for just a little bit. Oh, yeah. First, we got to have those get your thing imaging easier to containers right, are they still there.

262
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.850
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I just, I leave, it's like this than that I leave them there.

263
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect.

264
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.470
Anthony Garcia: Even just in case.

265
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:38.700
Anthony Garcia: You

266
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Haven't so let's do this, let's do this together. Okay, first let's bring in some positive imagery. I want you to snap to

267
00:33:49.890 --> 00:34:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A smile on your mother's face maybe bringing in a scent from cooking Korean food right bring it in everything that embodies the quality of nurturing

268
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And protection from mom.

269
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And as many senses as you can grasp, just pull them up seeing her maybe something she's wearing or a sense. She has a perfume or

270
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Way. She moves. It's familiar and that's mom.

271
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no ambivalence, you know, she wants the best for you.

272
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's also this wisdom this sister that

273
00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: She's kind of this organized by she knows how to save and it's helping you there and and has some some really decent advice. Doesn't she

274
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got some wisdom.

275
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that quality and I want you to picture interacting with them.

276
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: They're all around you interacting with you talking to each other and you interacting

277
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And nod your head when you you're very much immersed in it and you can feel it. Okay. All right. We're going to do a slow iteration. So for your eyes. Those two objects at the rate that I so it will be this pace, hold on to that image.

278
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.550
Keep breathing.

279
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together into the belly nice belly breath.

280
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale out the mouth, all of it.

281
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.430
I think it all.

282
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice what comes up just observe thoughts, beliefs, sensations and feelings.

283
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.720
Anthony Garcia: I noticed on that is like cans anymore loosened up a lot.

284
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.380
Anthony Garcia: I feel

285
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:34.560
Anthony Garcia: Better. You know, I feel like I'm not as angry as I was a minute ago. I'm almost forgetting what I was even angry about

286
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.670
Anthony Garcia: But then, you know, still there. I just

287
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.210
Anthony Garcia: I can feel like, I don't know.

288
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.200
Anthony Garcia: Okay, even right now. I could just feel my dad just like

289
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.760
Anthony Garcia: Thinking like negative thoughts about me.

290
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.850
Anthony Garcia: Let's go upstairs. You know, he's upstairs in his room and

291
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

292
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. What's the earliest age I know my dad thinks negatively of me. How old is that, how old are you, go take your time on this scope. Let's try and get a core

293
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.160
Anthony Garcia: I think when I was young when I was when I first got in trouble, big trouble. I would say maybe

294
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.700
Anthony Garcia: 11 okay

295
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did something. And what are you picturing with your dad's face voice behavior.

296
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I, I'm mad at him. I'm picturing him thinking something negative athlete can just break me in a little bit into that imagery

297
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:44.220
Anthony Garcia: That's not really like that angry of his face. I can like this. The disappointment.

298
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.280
Anthony Garcia: I see is like

299
00:37:49.590 --> 00:38:00.150
Anthony Garcia: Okay, just so disappointed in me and and it just kept happening and happening and happening not all my life. Even when I went to prison as I was older.

300
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:11.460
Anthony Garcia: The disappointment in his i don't know i think he wanted. He thought I was going to be something special or something. I think I disappointed. That's what happened. Okay.

301
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that I want you to hold that worst image right it's the sense of

302
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling his disappointment.

303
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's a feeling. So see if you can actually get an image of it. Can you picture something in his face, something that wasn't made up but you you really interpreted a face has

304
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:40.410
Anthony Garcia: A name. It's an angry face, but the eyes are like sad, you know, but basis really mad. It's like very angry.

305
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.150
Anthony Garcia: But inside the

306
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.210
Anthony Garcia: Eyes, you can just see the sadness and

307
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.670
Anthony Garcia: Disappointment. But, you know,

308
00:38:48.480 --> 00:39:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold that in your awareness right now angry face you perceive sadness inside you interpreted as he's disappointed in me, where do you feel that in the body. Just a quick statement or do you feel it.

309
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.180
Anthony Garcia: That's right in my gut in time. Yeah.

310
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.350
Okay, now

311
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.050

Anthony Garcia: I noticed I feel sad.

321
00:40:43.560 --> 00:41:07.230
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, because I know that I did these things to him. I did disappoint him. I, I just, I got in trouble so much you know and and then in military it affects my dad's promotions and stuff. And I remember he was emotional time and I got into big trouble and

Gwenevere Abriel: What do you realize

337
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.730
Anthony Garcia: That maybe I just

Anthony Garcia: Not feeling like

349
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.860
Anthony Garcia: How I was a minute ago. I'm feeling

350
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.740
Anthony Garcia: Like, I need to

351
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.400
Anthony Garcia: Do better with

352
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.280
Anthony Garcia: My thinking, you know,

353
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.080
Anthony Garcia: And stop letting all these thoughts and stuff but

354
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.220
Anthony Garcia: Make me feel bad about myself, I guess.

355
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold them. Now close your eyes with me.

356
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a question inside

357
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture asking

358
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Your protective figure

359
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Your nurturing figure or you wise figure

360
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: For some help with what to do differently, see what comes up.

361
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.160
Anthony Garcia: That my mom's the protectors, which is going to tell me that I

362
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.580
Anthony Garcia: Pretty much what I want to hear.

363
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:26.520
Anthony Garcia: And my sister gives me good advice and stuff. And it just almost seemed like is my dad's. The only one telling me the truth about me, you know,

364
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.430
Anthony Garcia: And I think that's what pisses me off about him is because

365
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.200
Anthony Garcia: He's not

366
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.820
Anthony Garcia: Trying to make me feel better with lies or or

367
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.740
Anthony Garcia: Or anything he's just telling me exactly what I did.

368
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.860
Anthony Garcia: How I did it every day. I mean, he reminds me a lot, every day.

369
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:54.450
Anthony Garcia: He always reminds me

370
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.640
Anthony Garcia: Of the things that I did.

371
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here. I know it's really stay here. I want you to remember what you said earlier, I could have done things differently. I want to change my thinking.

372
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.080
Anthony Garcia: Yes.

373
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to them. Say it again.

374
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:13.440
Anthony Garcia: I do want to change my thinking this

375
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.450
Anthony Garcia: Stuff makes me feel bad about myself.

376
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture.

377
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: As a young person at age 11 you could ask your mom, you could ask your sister. You could ask your dad. It might be that these are not the figures that we need to ask. It could be your adult self.

378
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be someone else. I want you to see what happens when you pull up this quality.

379
00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Of nurturing protection and wisdom.

380
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just your adult self come in.

381
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.910
Anthony Garcia: I just don't see it. You know, I just, it's hard to picture.

382
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.430
Anthony Garcia: Picture that right now.

383
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.130
Anthony Garcia: I know I'm an adult.

384
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.960
Anthony Garcia: Because

385
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.720
Anthony Garcia: It is. But my mind is my brain my mind.

386
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

387
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.170
Anthony Garcia: The way things, almost, where am I

388
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.820
Anthony Garcia: You know, like a kid asking for candy little

389
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, so you're wanting to do this. I want you to picture that when you're 11 seeing your dad's face.

390
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to picture the quality those people, if it turns out something else comes up, we've got to go with that.

391
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But first start with at 11 you're about to make a decision and have a different action. You said I want to do things differently. I want to think differently. Want to behave differently.

392
00:49:52.530 --> 00:50:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture at 11 seeing your mother seeing your sister and going to them for help or is it your dad for help. I can't tell you go in. Let's see what it is.

393
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.610
Anthony Garcia: Always went to him for him always

394
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.580
Anthony Garcia: I think that's what it was. I always

395
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:16.860
Anthony Garcia: Always went in.

396
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.210
Anthony Garcia: Had to call him out.

397
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.110
Anthony Garcia: He was always the one that came to the school.

398
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.920
Anthony Garcia: Was always here.

399
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:32.670
Okay.

400
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So Anthony when you were thinking, I need to make better decisions. Do you have a sense of what that is in your mind, you know, you know what that is. You can picture it I needed to have gone left

401
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I went, right, doggone it, again, I went right again. I went right I should have gone left to you have imagery of that I could have done things differently. I made

402
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: poor decisions.

403
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:00.840
I have

404
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.240
Anthony Garcia: Images of me.

405
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:06.930
Anthony Garcia: Always

406
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.410
Anthony Garcia: choosing the wrong way.

407
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture one all I can picture.

408
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.650
Anthony Garcia: They never do it right, you

409
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I need you to picture the worst one.

410
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.620
Anthony Garcia: thing I did was

411
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.470
Anthony Garcia: I will say,

412
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.820
Anthony Garcia: That my dad's like right here, you know,

413
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold that one.

414
00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This well

415
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Either before you did whatever this ruin dad's career thing or maybe right after I want you to picture mom.

416
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture these resources and I'm not sure if there's another figure that's going to emerge. This is going to be our last iteration picture that

417
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it right before was it as you did this thing that ruins the career, just like the worst thing and I want you to picture your resources are available to you. You're not alone. We have resources. Okay, open your eyes. Hold that WORST piece.

418
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:16.890
Anthony Garcia: Okay.

419
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about the quality

420
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Of support.

421
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to your growth.

422
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.630
Safety

423
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.010
And wisdom.

424
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.520
Exhale,

425
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What thoughts or beliefs are coming up for you.

426
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:26.850
Anthony Garcia: Just that

427
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:31.470
Anthony Garcia: I was getting given so many chances, I guess.

428
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.300
Anthony Garcia: Just not when I was at KP as I grew older,

429
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.820
Anthony Garcia: And I didn't take

430
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.960
Anthony Garcia: Almost like a word I purposely

431
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.330
Anthony Garcia: ruined everything that I've ever had, you know,

432
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.530
Anthony Garcia: It's like almost like self destructing myself.

433
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.450
Anthony Garcia: I just

434
00:53:58.890 --> 00:53:59.250
Anthony Garcia: Picture.

435
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.150
Anthony Garcia: Now that my mom, my sister and everybody's disappointed in me because

436
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.550
Anthony Garcia: Maybe a lot of things could have been different for us and

437
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:18.120
Anthony Garcia: We always wanted if maybe I didn't do what I did.

438
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.220
Anthony Garcia: All those times that

439
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.360
Anthony Garcia: Maybe I be closer with my daughter. I didn't go to prison or

440
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.870
Anthony Garcia: I don't know, it's just a lot of

441
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.240
Anthony Garcia: Not a just feeling like disappoint myself, I think.

442
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on. Go grab a piece of paper.

443
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring today to a close with this is important, go grab a piece of paper, a good proper case, you know,

444
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on the whole thing.

445
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

446
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

447
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony start this sentence and you know you can do what you want to do, you know, this is just a an invitation. But once you to see what happens.

448
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: When you write Dear Dad.

449
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry.

450
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the big

451
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the big one. That's the one that you're projecting all of this stuff on to him. It might be time

452
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That you say you're sorry

453
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to be in shame about it, Anthony. You're lovable, you're an amazing man.

454
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But until you say you're sorry

455
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Really on it.

456
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be free from it. I won't hold you anymore. You're good boy, you did the best you could

457
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter that you did that.

458
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got this moment. Got the rest of your life. It could ruin relationships, if it stays like this inside of you.

459
00:56:52.110 --> 00:57:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happens. And we're going to have to go. But I want you to see if you notice, you want to continue writing Ellen farmar our next work together.

460
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you want to write it. Maybe you'll give it to him. Maybe you'll burn it. Maybe you'll share it with me to you. Maybe I'll share it with your group.

461
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'll share it with your daughter. Maybe I'll rip it to shreds. Maybe you'll eat it. Maybe you make it into a soup. I don't know what you're going to do with it. It's the writing it. I want to know what happens to you when you see it right in front of you.

462
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But the goal of course I don't have a hidden agenda.

463
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to change the meaning that you have around the disappointment, you have in yourself, the regret all of that and just say, I'm sorry.

464
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's

465
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it okay we consider writing something like that.

466
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.320
Anthony Garcia: I shed. Right. Yeah.

467
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.210
Just consider

468
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's enough just to even

469
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.620
Anthony Garcia: I've always wanted to go do that. You know, it's just something that

470
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:01.350
Anthony Garcia: Something

471
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.110
Anthony Garcia: Almost

472
00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.400
Anthony Garcia: I don't know whether it's fear. Right.

473
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:10.920
Anthony Garcia: What is something

474
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.780
Anthony Garcia: Saying, sorry, when I want to know. I know.

475
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:16.380
Anthony

476
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't do these experiments, we won't see what's holding it back. We won't be able to save all here. So you have so much resentment because of what he needs to be sorry for we can't get there.

477
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't get there if we don't lean in and see what other level of truth, there is this is one piece of it. It's not just one sided there could be deep deep deep deep resentment towards him.

478
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not mutually exclusive. Anthony, they can coexist. You might have so much anger and hurt.

479
00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't preclude each other.

480
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The sorry the apology freeze you

481
00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with it. Don't do anything more just sit there with it that I can both really have resentment for how you let me down and wasn't a good enough father, and I'm sorry.

482
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: For what I did. I didn't know any better. I was 11 I was a little boy I did the best I could to survive in this environment. And I'm sorry not I'm a bad boy. No, but I'm sorry. Just, just sit with that this week. Don't do anything else, and just sit with it. Okay.

483
00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to take what you're doing.

484
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now because we gotta go, I want you to take these feelings, whatever, whatever they are for you.

485
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to put them in that large trash bin.

486
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to make sure that it's locked.

487
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's actually have it sort of maybe go on a train.

488
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, and sort of picture it moving along when you put it in there and you can kind of see it's on that train and just sort of have it.

489
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it drifted away further on down the track.

490
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you'll come by and take it off the track and visit it again, maybe you and I will do it together. But you don't have to do it now doesn't need to be addressed. Now, all of that is locked up in that band.

491
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you get to go enjoy the day you get to enjoy you are feeling good, knowing that you are you did some incredibly hard work today.

492
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.420
Anthony Garcia: Okay.

493
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're very complicated and you're letting me sort of bring us back to this this amount of information. I know it's huge. But we won't get anywhere if we can't, we can't work with these really pivotal pieces. Okay.

494
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done. All right, we'll see you soon. How about two weeks from now on a Friday.

495
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.400
Anthony Garcia: Sounds with me.

Gwenevere Abriel: Hello. Hello. Can we try to get video so I can see ya.

Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe hit. There we go. I gotcha.

534
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.920
Magan: It said it was video but it

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Was just your was a black screen.

536
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:20.640
Magan: Okay.

537
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so

538
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:27.840
Magan: Okay, sorry.

539
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:28.980
Alright.

540
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Have some some quiet time for your for yourself. Now, as I recall.

541
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Me just see, we went into

542
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Some negative conditions. If you want to do today, we can

543
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some em, Dr. If you want to do it today.

544
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:55.050
Magan: Yeah, that's fine. I don't want to talk about work and everything this time.

545
01:04:55.740 --> 01:05:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna it's all connected. Because guess what it's all happening to you hope so it's

546
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna be

547
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now let me just make sure we have everything we need remind me what device you're on phone or laptop.

548
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.240
Magan: Or iPad so phone I tried the iPad and didn't

549
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.000
Magan: Mesh up remember

550
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Go get to things like this right next to your phone about shoulder width apart, or you already have them.

551
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Please do right next to the fun right sides of them so that I don't see them, but you

552
01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Will

553
01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look left and right shoulder width apart.

554
01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.000
Magan: Okay hold on one second.

555
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:40.860
Magan: Shoulder width.

556
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, because I don't want to strain your eyes. I mean, able to have the bilateral movement, but I hurt when we do this activity.

557
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:52.650
Magan: And plan for

558
01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. And look at the tip top of the leaf of each one. They're about the same height. That's great.

559
01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:00.240
Magan: Yes.

560
01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.150
Magan: Have to the bottles probably better. Okay.

561
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I do seem like I'm missing one container. I've got container, but I don't have a distancing metaphor okay need one more thing in here. Okay.

562
01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: One more thing. And it's a distancing metaphor.

563
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.430
Magan: That means

564
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you

565
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll give examples for some people.

566
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:28.860
Magan: They're having

567
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A negative experience. Maybe they don't like something going on in their gut, right, or they're having an emotion, it's fear. It's anxiety or it's a memory.

568
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: A distancing that if I'm going to give you some examples of once people have chosen doesn't mean we can't change it. I just want one in writing, so I can help. So here we are. Here's one. Um,

569
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I take this image that I have. I don't like it. And I stick it in a helium balloon I wrap it up and I

570
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought away into the atmosphere. And I can see it really slowly drifting away. I also can put it in a rocket ship and really fast. It takes off and I can't see it anymore and it goes out into space.

571
01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I put it on a leaf and I stay on the riverbank

572
01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: With the qualities of my team of protection nurturing and wisdom and on that leaf is that image and it's slowly drifting away.

573
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point that I can't distinguish it from the water anymore it's it's moved down the river. It's a little slower pace. What's really important is that it's a process, meaning it's in motion. So it could be a train container and it's what was your container container was a train.

574
01:07:50.340 --> 01:08:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Train cart with thick metal so might be like, something like that on a train. You can see this train right moving and this negativity or whatever. You don't want to be feeling or having right now is moving away and you can see it.

575
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving away. You can even hear the sounds maybe and as a distance. You can barely tell the track.

576
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:16.020
Magan: anymore. I think the one that's standing out is the leaf actually

577
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it. Is it a on a creek a river, where are you standing if

578
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Creek. Okay, there we go. Beautiful.

579
01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I'm just gonna

580
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Go over some of the structure of this, this is kind of what it's going to look like we're going to be spending some time getting to

581
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: A target.

582
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to hear me say, what's the, what's the belief going on. I might ask about an emotion I might have you pull up the worst piece, the worst image she won't have to tell me, Megan, you're just going to hold it in your working memory.

583
01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to be in such distress that you start to dissociate. If that's the case, so we're going to cut, you can do this, like, however you want to say stop. Do you like this as a way to say I need

584
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.960
Magan: To say stop.

585
01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Useful. Oh, I love it.

586
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And you that you can do that anytime you want to. You also may want more.

587
01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You also may want more me to continue, I might my iterations might be too short and your some things from the archive of the hippocampus are starting to come up and you want to reprocess them.

588
01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You might just do this because we're going to do about 30 seconds each. You want might want more.

589
01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another option you can always say more. I mean, I'm just giving you some some signals. You can use

590
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, basic format is going to be

591
01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to bring something up and I'll either be bringing I'll be asking you to be thinking of a positive maybe your, your team of nurturing protection and wisdom and I might be doing an iteration on missy. How do you feel

592
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what's coming up for you, you'll give me a pretty short response not along one

593
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I might say go with that. And we're going to do another iteration. It's not processing and where we talk and talk and talk. It's that and then go with that. And then there's going to be another iteration. I'm going to be

594
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.860
Magan: I think I just have to do it.

595
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm giving you. Okay, so that you're you have some idea of what's going on, you can, you know, I'm here, I'm going to be guiding you through the whole thing.

596
01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, he is. And she do short responses, because we're going to be

597
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.920
Magan: Short responses.

598
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Only

599
01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we want to actually have the experience of

600
01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. Let's do some targeting for a second.

601
01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There's very complex networks in there for you around some negative experiences.

602
01:10:55.950 --> 01:11:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This one that you have said, I'm just going to go from the previous session. I'm just going to take one from there.

603
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:02.970
Magan: The

604
01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: One that you said, which was, I am not good enough.

605
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that a pretty common one for you.

606
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:12.060
Magan: Oh, yeah.

607
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:13.770
Magan: We go.

608
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For you.

609
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to track back all that is. Is it five years old. Yeah.

610
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it 10 years has been around about 20 years how far back. Is this how old is this. I'm not good enough.

611
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.930
Magan: I have a memory in particular.

612
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How old are you, just so I have some idea.

613
01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:47.550
Magan: For five

614
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. So what I wanted to do is so first

615
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.460
Magan: Is yourself starting

616
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.160
Magan: Off space doing

617
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: low vibration where you're

618
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be focusing on positive imagery first. Okay.

619
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.960
Magan: Okay. Give me one second. Hold on one second.

620
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:14.760
Magan: Okay.

621
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.140
Magan: Okay, I'm ready. Okay.

622
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A heads up, we're actually going to do some positive imagery first. Okay.

623
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well it should have a positive feeling not a yucky one or a scary one

624
01:12:55.710 --> 01:13:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now with your eyes closed for so I really want that imagery, very solid. And then I'm going to ask you to open your eyes. And then you're going to be

625
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking in the direction of those objects at the pace that I sat with my fingers. So first, I want you to close your eyes and I want you to immerse yourself in this quality of a dragon.

626
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And Gandalf the Grey.

627
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And that quality of protection.

628
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are there with it.

629
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It is certain.

630
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It is your resource of a protective figure

631
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To yours.

632
01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then have your dog be a part of that imagery interacting

633
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: With the Dragon

634
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: With Gandalf the Grey.

635
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then your children.

636
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In their

637
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Wisdom.

638
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Interacting

639
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone together and you there together.

640
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the faces. Notice what everyone's doing, how they're interacting. Notice how you feel around them.

641
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When you feel like you were very present there. I'm going to ask you to open your eyes. And we're going to do a slow iteration and you're going to hold that in your awareness that imagery does take work to hold it there.

642
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So well done in your awareness and just look at the tops of those two

643
01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's. Very nice.

644
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together through the nose.

645
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly breath. And when you're ready, just exhale all out of your mouth, letting it go

646
01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And gently.

647
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just turn inward. See how you're feeling physically and emotionally

648
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.500
Magan: Don't need to say

649
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.210
Magan: Yeah, okay.

650
01:15:56.310 --> 01:16:03.270
Magan: My backers, but that's pretty much the only thing I would say that there for me right now. Okay.

651
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Any thoughts or beliefs going on in your mind.

652
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:10.290
Magan: I'm worried that this isn't going to work.

653
01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:18.750
Magan: I'm worried that it's going to work. And I'm going to feel the same way I did last time.

654
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that, I want you to pull up the imagery of protective nature nurturing and wisdom people at that imagery we able to do that.

655
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And go just said those two things together.

656
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We go with left and right.

657
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, with me.

658
01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Be belly breath, inhale and exhale. When you're ready to get all

659
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's coming up for you.

660
01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.040
Magan: I don't know, I just heard.

661
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.200
Magan: It was weird.

662
01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go with that. I heard crying. I want you to pull up those that team.

663
01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Dragon

664
01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:50.550
Magan: I think that's what I was crying about

665
01:17:51.540 --> 01:18:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I heard crying. Pull up your, your team with it together. Okay, let's see what goes on in there, right there, hold them together.

666
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice short one in here with me.

667
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, get that belly all that area that long ago.

668
01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just turn inward. See what you can

669
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.280
Magan: Do I say what I'm thinking about.

670
01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:52.890
Magan: I'm thinking about

671
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:56.970
Magan: Okay.

672
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And lets me just check in the distress level from zero to 100 or if it's a dissociative direction slowing down of heart rate then below zero.

673
01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what kind of number of way out as far as distress right now. If it's towards anger running that would be up towards 100 if it was towards dissociation and being the negative numbers.

674
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:26.700
Magan: Like a 40 okay

675
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, that's workable. So you can still think

676
01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, that's good. I'm liking that you can still work with that some change can happen in there. So I'd like to know what the belief is about

677
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right about now around that I'm thinking of my mom. What do you believe about yourself right now. So if you can find it. What do I believe about myself right now.

678
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, from zero to 1010 is that is absolutely true. How true is that right now.

679
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:20.280
Magan: Right now it's like

680
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and the one you want to believe. What's the positive cognition. What do you want to believe instead

681
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:34.560
Magan: That

682
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:37.380
Magan: She died.

683
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:39.660
Not

684
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.000
Magan: Not thinking

685
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.190
Magan: That she mushy.

686
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to believe

687
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.880
Magan: Yes. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: still happening with me another human being.

690
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something about the way you and I have been working together.

691
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That I believe you are enough. Do I think that if you even a little bit

692
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I act like that too I treat you like them.

693
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.970
Magan: Yes, uh huh.

694
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you trust me a little

695
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.710
Magan: Yes, yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: And then all of it out.

705

Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever, whatever comes up for you. What do you think about what are you noticing.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.510
Magan: Noticing that

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.780
Magan: And she died on a birthday.

708
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:13.290
Magan: That's coming up next week.

709
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:17.310
Magan: And I'm

710
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:22.500
Magan: Noticing

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:28.890
Magan: That when she was dying. I told her I forgave her

712
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:32.070
Magan: Okay, I really didn't

713
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.510
Okay.

714
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're gonna go with that. Again, God

715
01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to be thinking

716
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I am enough two things you just pictured what you just pictured, and I want you to go with the thought, I am enough

717
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.770
Breathing in and out.

718
01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to add the image of the dragon.

719
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Gandalf the Grey.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.340
Magan: A little bit of anger.

726
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.390
Magan: It's hard for me to keep the image of

727
01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:07.350
Magan: The protectors in my head.

728
01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.530
Magan: It's really, it's really difficult actually

729
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the protectors, you're able to get your dog and children now.

730
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.990
I'm

731
01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:20.250
Magan: I'm seeing my, my children, more than anything.

732
01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now they're wise, we're going to do something with that ready

733
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.080
Okay.

734
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Said I feel anger. So we're going to go with that. And I want you to pull up the image of your children as they are the quality of wisdom.

735
01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna be talking to you throughout the integration.

736
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job is to pull up the image of them.

737
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Wisdom on money.

738
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:52.080
And

739
01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:54.540
We're feeling anger.

740
01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite him to slow down. I'm going to see if you can ask your children how to express anger, because they're wise, how do they get to express it, you can learn from them.

741
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.590
How did they get to do it.

742
01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this little four year old perhaps ask your children or learn from them about anger.

743
01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up right now.

744
01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.990
Magan: Yelling and my kids.

745
01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:20.250
Magan: Looking scared of me yelling

746
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.460
Magan: At me feeling like a bad mom and saying,

747
01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:35.580
Magan: Out loud and and they're telling me you're not a bad mommy. You're a good mom. You're the best. Mommy, the whole world.

750
01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

751
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: See if your children know how to bring the dragon in the room.

752
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:13.650
Again,

753
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you right now.

754
01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.000
Magan: I just get imagery and then like grabbing my hands.

755
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.630
Magan: And pulling me to the dragon again.

756
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna go with that.

757
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that.

758
01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: See where it takes you.

759
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:43.800
Magan: Let's pretend

760
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I spell it together.

761
01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale it all out flat, flat belly flat belly.

762
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Gently

763
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just observe what comes up.

764
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:06.000
Magan: I don't, I don't feel

765
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.580
Magan: That angry feeling as as present as it was

766
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.490
Magan: I want, I want to

767
01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:38.190
Magan: I want to believe it when I hear you say it, or my children say it in my mind at least, but I know that you say it to me.

768
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.060
Magan: And I want to believe that I am enough

769
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.590
Magan: But extremely difficult.

770
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want you. And let's do this one out loud so I can hear some stream of consciousness and once you have a conversation. You get to decide it's going to be

771
01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to ask you to be in a dialogue with Dragon Gandalf dog children.

772
01:32:04.230 --> 01:32:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Or when

773
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to challenge.

774
01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't believe you precisely around I'm enough. Why don't you just see, who do you want to talk to. Who do you want to be in an argument around with it comes to mind.

775
01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:23.940
Magan: It has to be those people

776
01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Who comes up.

777
01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: My mother. Okay, let me hear it out loud. Get in the argument. Let me hear it if it comes up. Say it.

778
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:38.310
Magan: It's more of a question for her.

779
01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: No censoring just say it.

780
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.130
Magan: Mom, why am I not enough free

781
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Can a four year old answer.

782
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:54.540
Magan: No.

783
01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The Dragon answer.

784
01:32:59.220 --> 01:32:59.910
Magan: No.

785
01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, I can't

786
01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.620
Magan: I can't office looks pitiful

787
01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the dog.

788
01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.250
Magan: She's looking at me.

789
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.810
Magan: Like she feels bad for me, you know,

790
01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What about children.

791
01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:28.710
Magan: I don't understand.

792
01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What about when a VR Sarah post

793
01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.940
Magan: When I fear disagrees.

794
01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she do

795
01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:45.270
She then

796
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Asked a question.

797
01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:54.390
Magan: To my mother.

798
01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.450
Magan: And ask the question.

799
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.070
Magan: Again,

800
01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear her voice. What does she say to mom.

801
01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:09.990
Magan: Do you, do you really believe that Megan's not enough.

802
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.660
Magan: You feel that way. Is that true

803
01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.130
Magan: I wonder why Megan feels that way.

804
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.890
Magan: Why would make him feel

805
01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:31.620
Magan: Like she's not enough.

806
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:35.670
Magan: From you.

807
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on.

808
01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.020
Magan: pretty firm.

809
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Little girl with mom.

810
01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.330
Magan: Mom.

811
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:53.790
Magan: She doesn't

812
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.240
Magan: She doesn't like to see little girl.

813
01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does the therapists do to protect a little girl.

814
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:14.190
Magan: She wrapped her

815
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Little girl.

816
01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.110
Magan: I believe that you are

817
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do I say to mom.

818
01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.190
Magan: You should be ashamed of yourself.

819
01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

820
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The adult

821
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have protected you

822
01:36:30.210 --> 01:36:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, but

823
01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not healthy one. Mom did

824
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely

825
01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

826
01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you protect your children from that you know the difference. The healthy environment healthy

827
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And more each day more and more

828
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: protecting yourself.

829
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You're protecting your children. You're living a very, very different life than you did.

830
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:20.010
Yeah.

831
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this therapist.

832
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This is seem like I am a piece of that protection, that's

833
01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.910
Magan: It does actually was weird. It just came up

834
01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.500
Magan: Something I didn't see coming just did.

835
01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:54.450
Magan: I mean, you told me to say what's coming up. Is that what came up was a lot of imagery. Everything was imagery

836
01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:59.550
Magan: For me, I mean, I don't know if that's the way it's supposed to go or not, but

837
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:04.260
Magan: Everything was imagery. I was seeing it play out in front of me.

838
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:09.000
Magan: And then when you said that to her. It was like

839
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.320
Magan: I felt bad for her.

840
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.490
Magan: You felt bad for her, my mom because you said that there. And it's like, but it's the truth.

841
01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:33.180
Magan: And there's that the same shift that always happens to be trying to protect other people's feelings, even in there.

842
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:43.740
Magan: And it's not fair because it's the truth. It's the other truth. She should be she so she can

843
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:46.020
Yeah.

844
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.410
Magan: It is too overwhelming.

845
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.360
Magan: To stop.

846
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And we are

847
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.030
Magan: I'm sorry, I mean,

848
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're doing you're doing the work is this

849
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on time right on time nothing to be sorry for

850
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This is exactly how it's supposed to go.

851
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

852
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If we take away the, sorry.

853
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You have access to feeling that this was therapeutic if we could get rid of that. Sorry. If instead you were

854
01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Allowed to just have this event, a perfect experience.

855
01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:14.760
Magan: It could. I think the reason why sorry is coming up is because I feel like perhaps I failed. Perhaps I didn't do, because I don't know what the outcome is supposed to be and perhaps that's smart. Because if I did, then I would be anticipating it an end, I would be

856
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:19.440
Magan: Knowing what to expect and I don't

857
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:38.850
Magan: And and so I'm sick. I'm saying sorry because I feel like I got, I messed it up like I did something wrong with it right or I'm not. I'm broken but I broke, it broke the system by saying stop or I broke the system by

858
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:43.290
Magan: Entering the way with this answer versus that answer.

859
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

860
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:46.260
Magan: That's what comes up.

861
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's exactly what you were doing in the activity, which was putting other people's feelings first

862
01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:55.800
Magan: Exactly.

863
01:40:56.610 --> 01:41:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't need to in here. You can't do this wrong. There's no one

864
01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.250
Magan: Yeah. Well, that's the first thing I noticed after I said stop was I did it again.

865
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.300
Magan: Because that's the last image that was in my brain.

866
01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.480
Magan: My mother had this way of

867
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:22.320
Magan: breaking my heart with just a look and that look was there.

868
01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:25.230
Magan: And it was just like

869
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:32.100
Magan: Share the trail. Like, how could you do that to me. How could you say that to me.

870
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:37.860
Magan: And then I as a little girl and as a woman.

871
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.990
Magan: feel ashamed of myself because I've made my mother feel that way.

872
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that, that feels like a pretzel up the wrong way that no, you would

873
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:56.850
Magan: Honestly, how I felt my whole life with her.

874
01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:59.070
Magan: She would do that to me.

875
01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:00.870
Magan: And it

876
01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:08.400
Magan: She could she was very manipulative. That way when you were talking about the manipulation in group.

877
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.600
Yeah.

878
01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:21.510
Magan: It wasn't just me that I was thinking about, I was thinking about all the people in my life that do these things around me and my mother had

879
01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:24.720
Magan: Far too many from this

880
01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:35.820
Magan: And my father, but we're so my mother, but that look was one of those manipulations of that she would always do to me like

881
01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:52.740
Magan: It was almost like she wasn't really hurting, but she didn't want anybody to know the real truth about her. She didn't want anybody to know that she was really a bad mother or a bad person or that she did something wrong.

882
01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.620
Magan: So it has to be a secret.

883
01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job was to lecture for feeling the truth and anyone knowing the truth.

884
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:04.410
Magan: Exactly. And that's what that look meant

885
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:13.500
Magan: I would always tell people, and I still will say it to this day. Nobody really knew my mother. Not even me.

886
01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:23.370
Magan: She was one person behind closed doors, a whole other person in her interpersonal relationships, she never said I love you.

887
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:33.540
Magan: It was like pulling dead that literally to get her to say I love you. And when she did respond

888
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.330
Magan: And never felt genuine and never felt real it felt forced

889
01:43:40.710 --> 01:43:41.400
Magan: So,

890
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:47.910
Magan: With her everything just felt manipulative fake

891
01:43:50.100 --> 01:44:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So Megan. You know what was true behind all the prep selling whether we call it projected identification all psychology has lovely terms for the phenomenon. But what you felt around your mother was real.

892
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Crazy.

893
01:44:13.410 --> 01:44:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Used

894
01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right really confused. How can a mother not protect me in love, man.

895
01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it was,

896
01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:27.870
Magan: That was wrong with all of it.

897
01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's real. You don't have to question that history you felt those things.

898
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.150
Magan: And I wanted it from her more than anybody.

899
01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's biology, we can't. I wish I could tell you there's a switch, that's going to go off. Nope. We want it from parents

900
01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter what they do to us. It's biological we won't

901
01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't

902
01:44:53.850 --> 01:44:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Be able to jump over it.

903
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:58.710
Magan: Everything is she did.

904
01:44:58.890 --> 01:45:01.350
Magan: Everything I wanted it for her.

905
01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:07.530
Magan: And she didn't even deserve it. She doesn't deserve that she didn't deserve me

906
01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.830
Magan: But I wanted her to want me

907
01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.130
Magan: I wanted to be enough for her.

908
01:45:16.170 --> 01:45:16.470
Yeah.

909
01:45:24.210 --> 01:45:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: She family you

910
01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.240
Magan: You were enough

911
01:45:27.450 --> 01:45:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You were you are. You're more than enough.

912
01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But she was not okay with herself.

913
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She made a very poor decision unconsciously to dump that responsibility onto a child for you to take care of her was unhealthy you needed to do that.

914
01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you are unconsciously afraid she would abandon you. If you didn't take care of her.

915
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.850
Magan: That I believe that because I feel that way with even like Andrew

916
01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.030
Magan: And

917
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:13.770
Magan: Everybody in my life. I'm afraid to lose everybody

918
01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:18.720
Magan: Even the people that are hurt the truly hurt me.

919
01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.900
Magan: I just don't want to be unveiled.

920
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

921
01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a little bit of time. Not very long. Only a few minutes. When you say I don't want to be on my own. First, let's take, let's take whatever's going on.

922
01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's incomplete because we just started right

923
01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take this and let's put it in the

924
01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:47.760
Country.

925
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe put it on the leaf or send it away, which you want to put in the container, lock it up. We visited later.

926
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.380
Magan: Or do you want a good way to put it in the container.

927
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So it goes in that container you lock it, you have the key. I have a key. I think to we may both have it.

928
01:47:10.530 --> 01:47:11.340
Magan: I can't do

929
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We do this. I thought

930
01:47:16.290 --> 01:47:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it going to stay in there.

931
01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:28.020
Magan: For now. Yeah, I don't want it to stay there forever, but it's not ready to get on the leaf. Okay.

932
01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you and I will will visit it again.

933
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: For now we'll go a little

934
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Cognitive Behavioral will lift up from that experiential work you just did.

935
01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we reworked the experience of a memory. Okay, and now we're just going to kind of a little bit more superficial will stay out here and we'll just go

936
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To that thing you said earlier, right.

937
01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can find it if you can remember it before I did the container.

938
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:05.340
I

939
01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, I don't want to be alone. I think it was close to that. What was it you said

940
01:48:14.130 --> 01:48:15.210
Magan: I don't want to be alone.

941
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.200
Okay.

942
01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wired for that to

943
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:28.200
Magan: To be alone or not to be alone.

944
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to be connected.

945
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Your particular conditioning has made it possible for you to be around people that have a bit neglectful and abusive behaviors are a bit toxic.

946
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:45.060
Magan: Absolutely.

947
01:48:45.450 --> 01:49:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just familiar, doesn't mean that's your future, the work you're doing now is changing your expectation about what's possible around, who am I going to bring into my life. What am I going to tolerate in the future. OKAY. YOU'RE NOT THE SAME ISSUE FOR YEARS AGO. YOU ARE CHANGING

948
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:16.440
Magan: Oh, I know I can feel it. And I've even changing in just the time that I've been in therapy with you and it's bothering. A lot of people

949
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

950
01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:25.410
Magan: It is it's bothering. A lot of people in my life.

951
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:27.810
Magan: But

952
01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:34.110
Magan: I refuse to apologize for working on myself. Yeah.

953
01:49:37.230 --> 01:49:40.260
Magan: This isn't about anybody else but me. Uh huh.

954
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're going to have you, your ink your confidence.

955
01:49:48.450 --> 01:50:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to go up, you're going to have your children. You're going to raise them in a way that you're proud of. Okay. And you're going to set limits and boundaries in future relationships that you weren't setting before your expectation of what you will tolerate

956
01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Can change. I don't know whether you're doing it yet. I don't know. But it's a real possibility with conviction and this

957
01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: defiance to compromise. If you decide to go that route. Yeah, you're gonna piss. Some people off because they like to

958
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Accommodate is like

959
01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It was convenient for them. So don't be surprised when they're irritated. They don't know you. APPLAUSE Oh look sheet. Now they're pissed off, you were

960
01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You were a giver and now you're an inspector and that's inconvenient. If you want to stay. You're going to piss. Some people off. But you might like you feel proud and enjoy.

961
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:54.660
Magan: All my boss said something like that. My male boss.

962
01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

963
01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:57.330
Magan: He said, Megan.

964
01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:03.270
Magan: I have to say that I've been noticing a change in your confidence.

965
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:08.490
Magan: And he didn't mean it in like an inappropriate way but he's like, it's very attractive.

966
01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, neat when someone sees it.

967
01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:15.780
Magan: Yeah, and he didn't say it like in like a he's

968
01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.450
Magan: Like that. Yeah. It wasn't like that at all.

969
01:51:20.130 --> 01:51:21.060
Magan: It was a very

970
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:25.740
Magan: Respectful very respectful lover.

971
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that just makes it therapists so happy. It's like, I've got the natural environment reinforcing it to us. Yay.

972
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it because it's organic. Right.

973
01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:41.970
Magan: It. I met and it was almost

974
01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:43.560
Magan: Hate

975
01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To say that, you know, and now you have, you have to believe that

976
01:51:48.300 --> 01:52:03.240
Magan: Yeah, and it was nice to hear and I even thought like because somebody told me the other day to give is to to truly give is to do without expectation of anything in return.

977
01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:11.310
Magan: And he gave that without expecting anything in return. So it was genuine

978
01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:13.440
Magan: I didn't

979
01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.850
Magan: Ask him for it.

980
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like you accepted it a little part of the gift anyway.

981
01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:28.110
Magan: A little bit of it. Yes, I, I didn't say I didn't say what I would typically said, Say I just turned

982
01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:41.640
Magan: Because I was uncomfortable, but I acknowledged it because that's something I wouldn't do I would just ignore it before or be like oh you're yeah you're talking about of your ass or make a joke out of it or knock myself right but instead I said

983
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You did.

984
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:43.890
I did.

985
01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:45.990
Magan: And that was a

986
01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:46.920
Ticket

987
01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:50.550
Magan: Alright.

988
01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I want to ask you.

989
01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: As far as your schedule goes, but do you think you're going to be able to meet, maybe, same time, same place march 20

990
01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:03.120
Magan: That's next Friday. It is, yes. Okay.

991
01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Am march 20

992
01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.910
Magan: That's what we'll do. Okay.

993
01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If anything comes up and you need to meet again, let me know. Okay.

994
01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:15.570
Magan: This stuff.

995
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Can start it might mean that networks, getting loosened up and it may want to kind of creep on into dream world might want to try and get in there.

996
01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You might start to feel relief. You might also start to feel agitated, whatever the observation, you're still doing this right.

997
01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing wrong with it. Just pay attention, bring it back into therapy. Tell me about it. Write it down. Text me email, whatever you need to do. Just don't go through it alone.

998
01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it would be normal to have an increase reaction to some things that you haven't. Maybe brought up and quite that way before. OK.

999
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.500
Magan: OK. OK.

1000
01:53:53.130 --> 01:53:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking forward to seeing you again remind me when I'm going to see on group I kinda want to make a little note of it.

1001
01:53:58.230 --> 01:54:00.810
Magan: On a month, the 24th.

1002
01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.370
Magan: Of March.

1003
01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's 23 actually already have it on here. I have begun right here on the 23rd. Okay, I'll see you. I'll see you next Friday.

1004
01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:10.620
Magan: All right. Thank you.

1005
01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:11.670
Bye.

1006
01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.180
Jackie: Hi. Hey.

1007
01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I close my door. There's no one here, I

1008
01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess they were busy in there. Maybe checking in a group, I think possibly

1009
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.980
Jackie: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1010
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So how's your week been

1011
01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:49.020
Jackie: Um, it's been okay the whole drug testing from last week is still kind of on my mind.

1012
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. I completely forgot about it.

1013
01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:54.450
Jackie: Wow.

1014
01:54:55.770 --> 01:55:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not completely, completely, but I mean I didn't write, not the way you're doing it. Like, did she really use drones or something, you know, did she relax.

1015
01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:05.370
Jackie: Yeah.

1016
01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: More like right before you came in because you were held up in virtual clinic. Last night I was, I was like, Okay, we're not focusing on Jackie today.

1017
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.870
Jackie: Obviously, oh my god.

1018
01:55:19.650 --> 01:55:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, but it was still a nice group. I enjoyed everybody sort of making it a process group more productive, I think. Um, alright, so let me get in here to note for you, but so do you want to kind of start with that. Like if it's been on your mind this week and what what were the thoughts.

1019
01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.370
Um,

1020
01:55:40.410 --> 01:55:52.410
Jackie: I guess I'm kind of bugged that it happened. What did they think, do they think I really did something was on my mind a lot. It was just, I don't know. I wish it never happened. It was a really unpleasant experience. Yeah.

1021
01:55:53.580 --> 01:56:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed she didn't bring it up either he didn't talk with the doc and say, hey, I want to talk to you later. Or maybe you didn't, I didn't see it.

1022
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:10.530
Jackie: Well, I kind of wanted to stay small in that group because I guess for the past couple weeks I felt like a lot of attention was on me. So like

1023
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:14.070
Jackie: Yeah, I just wanted to say to stay small

1024
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, you missed out on a chance to talk about that drug screen and asked her, What do you think of me think imma relapsed off.

1025
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:25.950
Yet

1026
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: checked it out okay um

1027
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if we're a treatment plan Review time, we are not, we're good. We can talk about whatever you want. Um,

1028
01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to continue to see if we can cultivate some of these

1029
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: These protective and nurturing figure, it still seems like it's a loose loose end. And it's so useful to have

1030
01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, can we pick away on it, just a little bit more and see if they can come up with some images.

1031
01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. Okay.

1032
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I remember once we were doing an activity. I think it was probably the the anchor room and a concept of I've got a little notes here. It might even be able to see it of the Buddha came up

1033
01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. For you.

1034
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn. I remember how you phrased it like, Oh, well, he would think about something and then he would like let it go, or something was somewhere in that

1035
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:28.410
Jackie: Yeah, that sounds really familiar.

1036
01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it. Okay. Me too. I, I don't know whether it landed right in one of my like there's certain space in this record that follows the whole time. It doesn't get deleted, and that's where I keep the anchor room and I keep these protective figures, the container and this distancing metaphor.

1037
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And what it made me think about was

1038
01:57:53.790 --> 01:58:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of the Buddha. Do you think of him as a spiritual guide you go, oh, wouldn't that be nice, or I feel that presence in me, like, what does he mean to you.

1039
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.280
Jackie: I think he's a spiritual guide, I would say.

1040
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:18.930
Jackie: At least things that I've read, he insightful and he has lots of methods on

1041
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:28.290
Jackie: Like living life and kind of a carefree way not taking things seriously not being weighed down so

1042
01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:31.050
Jackie: Kind of a deal for me.

1043
01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we start there.

1044
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he seem like

1045
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A protective figure what he keeps you safe.

1046
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:45.210
Jackie: I wouldn't say he keep me safe, but he gives me tools to help myself. Okay.

1047
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you say he has quality of nurturing

1048
01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.810
Jackie: Know, okay.

1049
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How about this one does it seem like he's a wise figure

1050
01:58:56.850 --> 01:58:58.470
Jackie: Definitely. Okay.

1051
01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have here an owl Winnie the Pooh.

1052
01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:07.650
Jackie: Oh my God, I forgot I said that I thought that was just something that was in my head.

1053
01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.330
Jackie: Everything.

1054
01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been. I've been embarrassing.

1055
01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:14.940
Jackie: I don't know, it sounds funny, later on, I guess.

1056
01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not to me i i really i i could see that really clearly, you know, because I know those particular characters, you know,

1057
01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:25.170
Yeah.

1058
01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And look what you just said you said

1059
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Insightful which, of course, L has and carefree. My goodness. Isn't that Winnie the Pooh.

1060
01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:36.300
Oh, yeah.

1061
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

1062
01:59:39.090 --> 01:59:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely just for today. Check and see if you would like. While we do some of this work together. If you, if it's okay to put the phone on don't disturb it's up to you, you just run the risk of it, it might turn your

1063
01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Your audio your video off sometimes it'll do that if if someone tries to get through.

1064
01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.380
Jackie: Your you

1065
01:59:58.410 --> 02:00:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to put your phone on Do Not Disturb

1066
02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.530
Jackie: Yeah, let me do that really quick.

1067
02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Just I'd like to say it, just in case people feel like, oh, I didn't want to didn't want to disrupt anything

1068
02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:10.050
Jackie: Right. Give me one second. I'm sorry.

1069
02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.040
Jackie: There we go. I just put it on airplane mode for now.

1070
02:00:21.090 --> 02:00:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I found what do you have an iPhone. What kind of phone you have

1071
02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:25.350
Jackie: An iPhone.

1072
02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I found, which I love, like on this screen I do the little, the little moon.

1073
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, look what it does, it puts it, I think that it says it's on. Do Not Disturb and you can say for, like, I guess, an hour if you hold your finger down

1074
02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:44.310
Jackie: Oh my gosh, look, it says until the end of this event going

1075
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, how cool is that

1076
02:00:47.010 --> 02:00:48.780
Jackie: That's pretty. Wow. Okay. That's, yeah.

1077
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know so cool.

1078
02:00:50.250 --> 02:00:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Like cuz then write the buzzing and it won't, won't break whatever a little piece we're working on.

1079
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, yes.

1080
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You you had some embarrassment around Winnie the Pooh, but um

1081
02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you pass that

1082
02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:09.450
Jackie: Yeah, I do so.

1083
02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now I brought up the Buddha, would you want me to add it to a wise figure, leave it alone.

1084
02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.190
Jackie: What do you, what would add it for sure.

1085
02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And with that, we have insightful methods.

1086
02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.060
And

1087
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A carefree way.

1088
02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to add anything to that.

1089
02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.130
Jackie: Not quite. Okay.

1090
02:01:42.810 --> 02:01:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Some

1091
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you scan your landscape of your life. See if you can think of even a mentor someone that really wanted to your growth and your development wasn't contingent on something they got back from you.

1092
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You believed they wanted the best for you.

1093
02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.020
Jackie: My dad, I guess.

1094
02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.650
Jackie: Least I think

1095
02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.410
Jackie: Like he's the first one that comes to my mind. But then at the same time, like there's so many

1096
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:39.090
Jackie: Problems that revolve around them. So like this thought comes from him when I was like really little, like, really, really little, and it didn't last a long time, but he's kind of like the only person that comes up, even if it was for this small period of time because other than that, like,

1097
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: About it. So let me hear the age, you were and the exact image if you had a snapshot of just now.

1098
02:02:45.810 --> 02:02:58.890
Jackie: Probably about seven and I just remember like sitting in his truck in I don't remember what we were talking about what I'm pretty sure he said something in it felt like, wow, he really cares

1099
02:03:02.730 --> 02:03:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he said something and I felt cared for.

1100
02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:06.510
Exactly.

1101
02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Any ambivalence about that memory.

1102
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:12.000
Jackie: No.

1103
02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: She recognize it.

1104
02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And doesn't have to be. Dad, it's that image.

1105
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:21.510
Jackie: Exactly.

1106
02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: He wanted the best for you without felt like nurturing. He wanted your growth, he, he wanted for you to reach your potential

1107
02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:30.870
Exactly.

1108
02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, okay. No ambivalence around that memory. Yes. The rest of it. Even the day after. That's a whole other thing. But this one, we've got that one.

1109
02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Beautiful.

1110
02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember ever seeing it in anyone else even a glimpse

1111
02:03:54.090 --> 02:03:56.580
Jackie: I can say pretty confidently. No.

1112
02:03:58.410 --> 02:03:58.800
Okay.

1113
02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now let's go to

1114
02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to fantasy for protective figure for a second wants you to go because you were able to go there with Winnie the Pooh, and the owl go there again go to metaphors to philosophy to images that you've seen could be

1115
02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: TV movie.

1116
02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up for

1117
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: A protective quality just the quality

1118
02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:36.990
Jackie: Big

1119
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we got big BAM.

1120
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:51.570
Jackie: Big is like the main thing that jumps out. It's hard for me to think of anything else. Okay.

1121
02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm going to do is we're going to

1122
02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: All say some things and then let's see if we can come up with something. Okay.

1123
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, mountain

1124
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

1125
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:12.840
Jackie: I mean, he's big right yeah

1126
02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.600
Jackie: Whole thing. Oh yeah, definitely.

1127
02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:18.450
Jackie: He's really big.

1128
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Jesus

1129
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:23.070
Jackie: And not so much.

1130
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The sun.

1131
02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:27.570
Jackie: Nuts allege

1132
02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Planet Earth.

1133
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:35.250
Jackie: That's both like reassuring and scary.

1134
02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get a sense that it's a person or an animal.

1135
02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:48.180
Jackie: I get a sense it's like

1136
02:05:50.760 --> 02:06:03.840
Jackie: Like a fictional person, I guess not like a real person, like the owl was really it was bigger than like Winnie the Pooh and piglet, you know, so, like, maybe not. Maybe not necessarily a person. But just like a character, I guess, I don't know, it sounds really weird.

1137
02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm having fun, I like I like doing this.

1138
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:12.600
I'm not

1139
02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking something negative i i'm concerned I care that pulling these images is a challenge for you. So I do think it's important

1140
02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:28.140
Jackie: I'm interested to see what we figure out

1141
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's persevere. So, um, something, something worked around Iron Man and the Hulk.

1142
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:48.750
Jackie: I think it's like with the what's in my head that feels comfortable comfortable about those figures is that they're just strong in bigger

1143
02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:56.670
Jackie: Like I am pretty sure I don't really watch those movies or anything, but I'm pretty sure they're known for, like,

1144
02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:03.900
Jackie: I'm fighting and like protecting and they're the good guys right so they are

1145
02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's interesting about the Hulk. And this isn't my my area, but right so he's he's Dr. Brenner, I think it is something like that. And normally, he had ingested something or whatever it was. And when he gets angry.

1146
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He turns into this, this figure, and yes he does have a protective quality on the people that that he cares about can de escalate that anger. They it's still they're afraid of them. It's really dangerous that they won't be able to bring him down because it's so all consuming

1147
02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:41.670
Okay.

1148
02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:46.620
Jackie: But he normal person before all that happened.

1149
02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:49.860
Jackie: Guy. Yeah, okay.

1150
02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And he wants, he comes down. He returns back to the shape all the clothes are ripped and torn because he can change.

1151
02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:01.020
Jackie: All of making

1152
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he's like, Oh, no, you know what, what happened and kind of forgets. He doesn't know was the big and they call them was the big guy there.

1153
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.870
Jackie: I see.

1154
02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't remember, you know, and he feels terrible about it.

1155
02:08:17.730 --> 02:08:18.930
Jackie: But he's a good guy. Right.

1156
02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, he's a scientist. He's very smart.

1157
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:23.340
Jackie: He just doesn't remember what happens

1158
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When he transformed the big guy.

1159
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:26.130
Jackie: I see.

1160
02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's keep going. What about

1161
02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What about a seven year old. What about what was missing. Maybe from dad as a protective person. Let's see if we can

1162
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:42.690
Jackie: In general,

1163
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, as a protector, what would have been nice that he have

1164
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.320
Jackie: Consistency. Okay.

1165
02:08:54.660 --> 02:09:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What would have been nice if dad had been able to protect you as a seven year old what like you have done.

1166
02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:11.880
Jackie: I'm stepped in more I'm made my mom.

1167
02:09:13.410 --> 02:09:15.180
Jackie: Act different, I guess.

1168
02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:17.490
Jackie: Okay.

1169
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead

1170
02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what was the quality of your dad. Most of the time, aside from this one time. But most of the time. What was he

1171
02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.640
Jackie: Like you, okay.

1172
02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:43.260
Jackie: He

1173
02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:52.230
Jackie: Chose my mom and whatever she said or did or wanted to do over me and my brother, most of the time. So I don't know how to put that into a word.

1174
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:53.520
I got

1175
02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Excited.

1176
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How important is loyalty to you.

1177
02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:16.230
Jackie: Vital very yeah

1178
02:10:18.090 --> 02:10:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So look big and loyal.

1179
02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this character this fictional characters physically big

1180
02:10:28.110 --> 02:10:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And vital is loyalty and that loyalty and bigness shows up consistently. So we've got those is that all sound really true.

1181
02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:40.680
Jackie: Definitely, yeah. Loyalty

1182
02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a recent maybe movie that you've watched that that had a big character in it. Someone that had some loyalty. And I'm like, Oh, I like this.

1183
02:10:57.690 --> 02:11:01.710
Jackie: I watch a lot of scary movies. So it's kind of hard. Let me think.

1184
02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, maybe there's maybe there's a

1185
02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:07.440
Jackie: Oh yeah, that could be true. Um,

1186
02:11:10.410 --> 02:11:15.360
Jackie: Okay, so there was this really funny. This zombie movie that I watched with my husband.

1187
02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:30.870
Jackie: three nights ago and it made me cry so much because there was this dad who had like gotten bitten by a zombie. And he had this little baby that he was carrying on his back, and he was trying to like get to a safe place before he turned into a zombie.

1188
02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:42.900
Jackie: The dad wasn't big necessarily, but he was big in the idea that like he was trying to, you know, protect his daughter, despite what was going on with him.

1189
02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.390
Jackie: Is like the ultimate concern.

1190
02:11:46.650 --> 02:11:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Alton concerned and does it seem like if we to watch this character over and over, he would do the same thing. Each time he would have chosen the safety of his daughter.

1191
02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Okay. So I think this is a good one. So, what what do we call this guy.

1192
02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:04.200
Jackie: Like a name.

1193
02:12:04.530 --> 02:12:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like, because that right now I've got zombie movie.

1194
02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I we need him to have some sort of name, like, what is he, what do we call that guy.

1195
02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:14.430
Um,

1196
02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:21.450
Jackie: Bitten guy. I don't know.

1197
02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:24.060
Jackie: So,

1198
02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Super dad.

1199
02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:33.000
Jackie: Strong, strong, strong man.

1200
02:12:33.810 --> 02:12:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. That's it.

1201
02:12:41.190 --> 02:12:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Copy. Okay, so we're going to go strong man see if this is true so close your eyes and let's let's get some visuals on this. See if it really lands. Pay attention to your body as usual. Jackie, because

1202
02:12:53.700 --> 02:13:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to pick up on the BS. If it's trying to please me it's, there's something missing. It's going to court, a land in a tight chest kind of something's going to happen. Okay.

1203
02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm doing it with you and I'm picturing myself being seven

1204
02:13:17.010 --> 02:13:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was president was

1205
02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This strong big man that

1206
02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Was consistent in loyalty

1207
02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To me.

1208
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Consistent there it is again I can rely on this.

1209
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Strength and protecting me

1210
02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately, he's concerned about me.

1211
02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You took a nice deep breath.

1212
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's it like to be in that

1213
02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In the presence of an image, such as this, where you can relax because it's so predictable.

1214
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So consistent

1215
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.770
Comforting Yeah.

1216
02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that image to stay there with it.

1217
02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens with the other pieces.

1218
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's picture him there what you're doing.

1219
02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The quality of it. And that's up to you because

1220
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: In your imagery. Let's see what happens. There's you and then there's this predictable, consistent loyal strong

1221
02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, and you have this feeling of comfort.

1222
02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you also have wisdom enter that space.

1223
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In the form of the Buddha.

1224
02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: In which he brings insight.

1225
02:15:04.410 --> 02:15:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill and methods, how to be carefree

1226
02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want, you can also have the hour.

1227
02:15:18.090 --> 02:15:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: From Winnie the Pooh.

1228
02:15:25.410 --> 02:15:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture them interacting

1229
02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice their faces. Notice

1230
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the sounds.

1231
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you feel.

1232
02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That the quality of this team.

1233
02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And this imagery also have a lived experience.

1234
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you knew it to be true, you

1235
02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Experienced you're down in the truck as caring for you.

1236
02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone interacting

1237
02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know you've got real sense of it.

1238
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.760
Jackie: It's there.

1239
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do want to do some, some of the MTR with you.

1240
02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But I neglected to make sure that you have the two because I think you're on a phone, right, or no.

1241
02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:53.850
Jackie: No, this is a Mac Book

1242
02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can just do my little blue light them. Yay.

1243
02:17:00.570 --> 02:17:01.380
Came up today.

1244
02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just moved on.

1245
02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: My computer yesterday I was sitting here talking away BA BA BA BA BA and the screen went back

1246
02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:17.430
Jackie: Oh fun

1247
02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, Okay, what just happened.

1248
02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:31.260
Jackie: This computer and I'm not quite used to it. So like I got a phone call during group and it like made everything tiny and I was like, how do I fix this. It was really it was a scramble

1249
02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess I'm that's my lead in to say that everything that I normally have access to is not up

1250
02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:52.140
Jackie: One.

1251
02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Though just going to take a second here.

1252
02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:57.960
They'll come up when if I type in blue.

1253
02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see is that the one. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So let me change the we're going to do positive one, so that one will be a little slow. That's what we want.

1254
02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To share the screen. And so the idea is you want to obviously have this. I think it automatically makes your whole screen. My shared image.

1255
02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can check it should be.

1256
02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:33.750
Jackie: Sitting

1257
02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: For your whole screen.

1258
02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:36.060
Jackie: I see it.

1259
02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's do this together, let's go back to where we were. Let's go back to

1260
02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That strong

1261
02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: insistently loyal.

1262
02:18:49.710 --> 02:18:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery

1263
02:18:57.750 --> 02:19:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Concerned for your safety and well being at all times consistently loyal.

1264
02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You can rely on that.

1265
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with that interaction with the Buddha.

1266
02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The owl.

1267
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And that image of your dad as well.

1268
02:19:20.610 --> 02:19:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That moment at age seven

1269
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're ready, open your eyes. When you're ready,

1270
02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's really true. You can see everyone interacting and you feel comfortable

1271
02:19:48.090 --> 02:19:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's have this light, you want to be looking at it, the furthest left and right.

1272
02:19:54.450 --> 02:19:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: hold those images in your awareness.

1273
02:20:23.430 --> 02:20:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, big belly breath bring that to the bottom of the lungs. Nice. Inhale, and then exhale, it all out your mouth.

1274
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your awareness and see how the body is responding

1275
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's happening.

1276
02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.260
Jackie: It just feels open

1277
02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.650
Jackie: That's the most noticeable thing.

1278
02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to do some work today around

1279
02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A target belief about yourself that's been troubling and I'd like to, I don't have my notes in front of me. I just have you in this light.

1280
02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you to correct me.

1281
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A negative cognition is

1282
02:21:26.130 --> 02:21:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All never be understood.

1283
02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And correct me. What's one that you have had

1284
02:21:33.690 --> 02:21:41.190
Jackie: being understood is huge. To me, and I feel like constantly am always be misunderstood. So I think that's pretty accurate. Okay.

1285
02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I am misunderstood.

1286
02:21:44.310 --> 02:21:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That true

1287
02:21:45.690 --> 02:21:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: True. Okay, now let's see how true from zero to 1010 is absolutely true. I am misunderstood right now hold on to it, how what number you at

1288
02:21:59.340 --> 02:21:59.970
Zero.

1289
02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, zero is that's not true.

1290
02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:06.420
Jackie: Right now, at this moment right

1291
02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:08.190
Jackie: Right. Gotcha.

1292
02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

1293
02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little I'm a little zeroing in on on a

1294
02:22:19.410 --> 02:22:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Neural Network, a particular image that had its worst, you don't have to tell me what it is. If you don't want to

1295
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's easier for me to bring it back to it. If you do, but you absolutely have the choice to just stay quiet the seal have the same effect pull up that worst image. Maybe it was when you were six or five or 411 or 12 whenever that was of

1296
02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I misunderstood. It was the most intense

1297
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or perhaps at the earliest stage.

1298
02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe move back and forth between the earliest awareness of it and the most intense, are they the same or

1299
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one seems more urgent for you to work through today.

1300
02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:25.350
Jackie: I definitely got when it comes up because I think about this, it pops in my head pretty regularly. When I was 14 I don't remember what it was about what I was like screaming and crying and pretty much ripping my hair out like trying to get my mom to

1301
02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:35.970
Jackie: Understand something because oh she was lying about something that I didn't do. She had called the cops and said that I was like beating her up.

1302
02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:54.030
Jackie: Man, I'm so stressed. I was I was literally like on the floor like banging my head against the floor like don't do this, like, listen to me. Just listen to me and she was just like so caught up in lying and like making like validating her claims and making me look bad and

1303
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:55.530
Jackie: By the time

1304
02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:57.180
Jackie: Oh, sorry. Nobody stop.

1305
02:23:57.780 --> 02:23:59.700
Jackie: Well, but

1306
02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I do know this one but check in with yourself and see, see if there's a bit more that you want me to know a little bit more. See if there's. Do you want me to hear a little bit more

1307
02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:16.800
Jackie: Just that I was so worked up from wanting her to listen and understand what I was trying to get through.

1308
02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:36.540
Jackie: And she wouldn't. And then she used that urgency and that me being so like just listened to me against me, because once the cops got there. She was like, look at home, crazy. She's being and it was just me, like, no, just listen. Like, nobody's listening to me here basically

1309
02:24:37.050 --> 02:24:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

1310
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I am misunderstood.

1311
02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And that

1312
02:24:46.350 --> 02:24:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory that one up there in the high numbers.

1313
02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, how you feeling right now what emotion.

1314
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:08.910
Jackie: Right now, I'm just kinda here, it's not really doing a lot when I was talking about it like the top so my thighs were getting tense. And I was like, clenching my stomach a little bit like tightening it

1315
02:25:10.470 --> 02:25:13.230
Jackie: They don't know that's a, that's a big one. Uh huh.

1316
02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not aware of an emotion right now.

1317
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:18.270
Jackie: Yeah, no, I can't. Name one.

1318
02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. And so we've got some awareness in the tops of the thighs and the stomach and

1319
02:25:31.650 --> 02:25:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief is I misunderstood these cops misunderstand.

1320
02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom.

1321
02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I misunderstood.

1322
02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:46.530
Jackie: Yeah, it was like one fee.

1323
02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:49.440
Jackie: Yo, you want

1324
02:25:50.970 --> 02:25:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And she used your organic response to this confusion against you.

1325
02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That you indeed see she she did hit me. She say, Look at her. She's all worked up

1326
02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:04.110
Jackie: Yep. Yeah.

1327
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you're feeling now what emotion.

1328
02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:09.540
I'm

1329
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:16.260
Jackie: Like between irritated and disappointed.

1330
02:26:18.690 --> 02:26:22.440
Jackie: Okay, really can't stand her and what she's done me. Yep.

1331
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1332
02:26:34.050 --> 02:26:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's hard to get to. What did you want to be believing about yourself at 14 in the presence

1333
02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your mother's behavior.

1334
02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What would have been convenient. Had you had access to different belief about yourself.

1335
02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that comes to mind. Jackie, try not to edit and censor what came up just now.

1336
02:27:00.690 --> 02:27:03.780
Jackie: The word confidence. But that doesn't really make sense to me.

1337
02:27:05.490 --> 02:27:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is it okay that it makes sense to me.

1338
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Okay, what does you

1339
02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:12.870
Jackie: Know, yeah.

1340
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's try this on.

1341
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: A different scale one to seven, seven, it's absolutely true unconfident How confident are you right now.

1342
02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven is yes yes absolute

1343
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:33.510
Jackie: Seven because I'm being very genuine and an open. So seven

1344
02:27:41.970 --> 02:27:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to check in on one piece.

1345
02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When we were doing the positive imagery with dad in the truck. Was there any resistance there. Did you not bring it in, was it was completely welcomed integrated with everything else.

1346
02:27:57.390 --> 02:28:03.600
Jackie: It was open. Yeah, it was. It felt right. It felt comfortable comfortable the mom wasn't there, and it was me and him and

1347
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:05.550
Jackie: Yeah, it was.

1348
02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling me didn't know

1349
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how, how true is it at age 14 I'm confident

1350
02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:25.500
Jackie: I'm pretty little not not very true. I don't think I was really confident back then.

1351
02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:29.550
Jackie: I mean number 23232 and a half.

1352
02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Two and a half. Yeah.

1353
02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you ready

1354
02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:39.870
Jackie: Yes.

1355
02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to continue at I think I might even slow it down a little bit more

1356
02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Even going slower. I just want to see what this looks like at this speed.

1357
02:28:54.570 --> 02:29:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like that. Okay, we're going to do it really slow. And here we go. When we start with eyes close. I'm doing it with you. I'm visualizing with you obviously doing it my own way, but I'm working the same images as you are.

1358
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: 14

1359
02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst part of it.

1360
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The Worst Picture.

1361
02:29:23.310 --> 02:29:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that event.

1362
02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold it in that working memory now.

1363
02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to pull up your team now.

1364
02:29:36.450 --> 02:29:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The Buddha.

1365
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing how to manage to cope, the right method to again feel carefree

1366
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And the owl.

1367
02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: From Winnie the Pooh.

1368
02:29:57.510 --> 02:30:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And at age seven that exact memory deed.

1369
02:30:02.370 --> 02:30:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: My dad caring for me.

1370
02:30:07.350 --> 02:30:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And this awareness of

1371
02:30:10.410 --> 02:30:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Big strong man.

1372
02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Consistently

1373
02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Presenting with loyalty

1374
02:30:20.940 --> 02:30:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Concern for you.

1375
02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Consistently

02:30:27.060 --> 02:30:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: See them interacting

1377
02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And pull up that worst image and open your eyes.

1378
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:42.270
When you're ready,

1379
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, with me right into the belly. Nice big belly breath.

1380
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, nice and slow. All of it out flat belly.

1381
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice what's coming up.

1382
02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:54.810
Jackie: I'm sad.

1383
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad emotion. What do you notice in your body.

1384
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:08.220
Jackie: My body's not tense or loose or anything right now. I guess I'm open to whatever it is.

1385
02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok wants you to pull up that WORST piece.

1386
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.150

1387
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: unconfident

1388
02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst image I'm confident

1389
02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you right now.

1390
02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.490
Jackie: That was difficult for me because

1391
02:33:07.770 --> 02:33:14.280
Jackie: To feel so am I supposed to be making myself feel confident in that situation.

1392
02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And if that tell me what happened. Just, just tell me

1393
02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:25.590
Jackie: It was just difficult because I couldn't feel confident while thinking of that well.

1394
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't feel confident

1395
02:33:30.570 --> 02:33:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To go with that. I can't feel confident. What I want you to do is pull up your team. See if there's someone who can help you and ask them a direct question, you can say it out loud. It's up to you. I can feel confident and pull you up, pull up your team.

1396
02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Can use them.

1397
02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice belly breath.

1398
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then nice and slow emptied all out the long have

1399
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You observed what is going on. What do you observe

1400
02:34:55.950 --> 02:34:59.400
Jackie: The way that event happened in my head to feel

1401
02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:01.260
Jackie: To have that team there.

1402
02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Change the event.

1403
02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, we're going to go with that.

1404
02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up the WORST piece of it.

1405
02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This time tried talking out loud.

1406
02:35:17.490 --> 02:35:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: uncensored

1407
02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: as they come up.

1408
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:34.260
Jackie: I'm ignoring her not letting her affect me because it's just going to make me

1409
02:35:35.370 --> 02:35:42.150
Jackie: feel worse in the long run. There's a lot of wisdom there that I'm getting from this team.

1410
02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:46.950
Jackie: To help me deal with her in the situation.

1411
02:35:49.080 --> 02:36:00.690
Jackie: I'm being told not to waste that kind of emotion on her because she's more than likely feeding on it and validating herself by it.

1412
02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:06.060
Jackie: It would just with them. I'm being

1413
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:11.490
Jackie: Directed to just go in a different room and completely shut her out.

1414
02:36:12.990 --> 02:36:18.420
Jackie: I'm glad it's happening. Ignore her because that will probably make her feel bad.

1415
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:23.670
Jackie: That's what she doesn't want she likes the attention and she likes having that effect.

1416
02:36:26.370 --> 02:36:40.260

1420
02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:57.690
Jackie: Says,

1421
02:36:59.010 --> 02:37:03.600
Jackie: Just she's giving me information tools on how to handle this situation.

1422
02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend to that.

1423
02:37:12.810 --> 02:37:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And how and then

1424
02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale it all out.

1425
02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

1426
02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up in the quiet space after the exhale

1427
02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:41.550
Jackie: Here's like a little bit of disrupted me kind of

1428
02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:44.070
Jackie: Uncomfortable.

1429
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it right now.

1430
02:37:56.910 --> 02:37:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm confident

02:38:07.410 --> 02:38:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why.

1433
02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's at a six.

1434
02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:17.910
Jackie: It think because I'm feeling these things that I personally can't connect and doesn't really make sense to me.

1435
02:38:19.530 --> 02:38:21.540
Jackie: So like, I'm like, Is this right

1436
02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this right and to go with that she did pull up that worst image. This is a part of the desensitization.

1437
02:38:37.410 --> 02:38:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And pull up that worst image.

1438
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it right that I feel confident

1439
02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:46.050

1440
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:30.780

1443
02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:53.940
Yeah.

1444
02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a bigger person.

1445
02:40:01.170 --> 02:40:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What a neat.

1446
02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Entry of the common phrase right

1447
02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:06.450
Be

1448
02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:09.120
Jackie: Noticed that yeah

1449
02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a bigger person.

1450
02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Not stooping to the other level just

1451
02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I'm I'm right to be confident. What's happening could make a girl crazy

1452
02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Could make her doubt herself.

1453
02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, it feeds her

1454
02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But more importantly,

1455
02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If you remain defiant inside of you.

1456
02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To the craziness. If you stay in there and it's right for me to become I don't need to doubt myself.

1457
02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stay in that space of I understand what I need. I understand what's going

1458
02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:54.270
On

1459
02:40:57.030 --> 02:41:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any doubt that you are seeing craziness around you.

1460
02:41:04.170 --> 02:41:08.040
Jackie: Wholeheartedly. There's no doubt that I was seeing craziness around me.

1461
02:41:12.270 --> 02:41:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your body and will end today with that sort of scanning

1462
02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:20.100
Jackie: I feel okay

1463
02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Noticing the body feels okay

1464
02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: About those size.

1465
02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:32.760
Jackie: They're not tight my toes were kind of curled for a minute. But, I mean, it doesn't. I don't feel tension anywhere.

1466
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check in does anything need to be sent on a distancing metaphors anything needs to be put in a container that we visited later just check in with yourself.

1467
02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what needs to be done.

1468
02:41:59.310 --> 02:42:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Any sort of

1469
02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:01.680
Jackie: That's it.

1470
02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:06.690
Jackie: Situation with my mom in particular needs to go away for two later.

1471
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you want it in the box or in a container.

1472
02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:14.250
Jackie: And the container will put in the container because that thing's pretty strong.

1473
02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. So we'll put it in there. So, picture right the strength and wisdom and ability to be able to put it in.

1474
02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And it stays in

1475
02:42:24.810 --> 02:42:25.110
The

1476
02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:27.840
Jackie: Look it up.

1477
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Lock it on up. You can see it in there. I think it used to be a jar thank or something.

1478
02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure you can see it in there.

1479
02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can

1480
02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are ready, and of course I'll probably invite it a when you're ready, you set that tone you decide when you're ready to bring it out again.

1481
02:42:48.810 --> 02:42:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll stand there until then.

1482
02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:51.660
Jackie: Yep.

1483
02:42:56.190 --> 02:43:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got a minute here. My next client hasn't shown up. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's important for you what

1484
02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of just look at at the events today.

1485
02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what feels important for you.

1486
02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.200
Jackie: Out of what happened today.

1487
02:43:17.010 --> 02:43:19.290
Jackie: There's something about that big thing.

1488
02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:28.320
Jackie: I don't know what it is, but I'm intrigued about that. I never made that connection. So there's something about that that I'm interested in.

1489
02:43:31.290 --> 02:43:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that were a big maybe sitting with that. Just let that you know you had a

1490
02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Big was this protective figure and then you were the bigger person.

1491
02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's something about it. That's really landing so

1492
02:43:50.730 --> 02:43:53.610
Jackie: Definitely big feels safe.

1493
02:43:55.020 --> 02:43:55.800
Jackie: Really does

1494
02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Yeah.

1495
02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have any chance to sort of move in to that more just see if you recognize your adult self. This is the self as well. I won't get into the too many metaphors right at this final out moment here, but I want you to see if you find yourself being

1496
02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Big throughout the day, just see, oh, this feels big I FELT BIG just noticing group, you said I wanted to be small.

1497
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:35.400
Jackie: I feel

1498
02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:42.960
Jackie: A lot of the time throughout the day. I consider myself big because I'm doing what I'm doing. And I feel like

1499
02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:51.720
Jackie: I move with intention. So I think that's big. But I can feel when I want to be small to like group, for example.

1500
02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Play with that part of being big might be that I have choice. I get to decide how big I am how small I am whereas before you may have been without that choice, but now you get to decide on your terms how you want to show up.

1501
02:45:14.010 --> 02:45:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

1502
02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Do you want to continue meeting go back to 11 or 10 or whenever that was, I don't

1503
02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:26.670
Jackie: I kind of like nine

1504
02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: On Friday, yeah.

1505
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:31.290
Jackie: Yeah, I like this.

1509
02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then if something changes down the line. There might be a week window where there's an adjustment period, but otherwise I'm offer that to someone else.

1510
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. Well, enjoy your weekend and I'll see you on group.

02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see what what day is it Tuesday or something right that's Tuesday. So that doesn't throw off your group any

1559
02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:58.230
Nicole Roybal: No, yeah, I made sure not to do that.

1560
02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. Got it. All right. Amber thinking that's just going to be an initial, initial new patient

1561
02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Evaluation, but don't don't hesitate it to still say everything

1562
02:50:16.410 --> 02:50:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm nauseous. I mean, they have to address it.

1563
02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:27.870
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I told that girl on the phone that that's been happening. So she's, like, make sure you tell the doctor everything and try to keep like a

1564
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Journal

1565
02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:32.040
Nicole Roybal: A chart. Yeah.

1566
02:50:32.250 --> 02:50:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Please do. Because they're going to want to know duration and definitely you know when your menstrual cycle was in any other and your things. But, you know, letting letting them know you know that you're also in on the MIT program on the Suboxone will be helpful.

1567
02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, so tell me some things you like about what you have been doing this week. Start with them.

1568
02:50:58.350 --> 02:50:59.700
Nicole Roybal: At one more thing to say, I'm sorry.

1569
02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:07.920
Nicole Roybal: No scheduled what well woman exam, just because I guess I'm due for a Pap smears. It's been like four years.

1570
02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. When's that

1571
02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:13.290
Nicole Roybal: That's on March 27 of writing.

1572
02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:18.270
Nicole Roybal: So, but I scheduled that too. So don't interfere with us.

1573
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you said 27th, at what time

1574
02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:26.130

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

1578
02:51:36.270 --> 02:51:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Boop well woman for an exam. Excellent. What was it like for you to schedule these

1579
02:51:43.050 --> 02:51:50.490
Nicole Roybal: It just took a long time. Honestly, I'm calling like Office after office like oh no we don't accept your patience. Oh, no.

1580
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:59.700
Nicole Roybal: There is always some excuse as to why they couldn't accept a new patients. I finally like the fifth one I called finally they were like, oh, yes, we can get you on. It was a loveless

1581
02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:03.720
Nicole Roybal: I've never been to love this before.

1582
02:52:03.810 --> 02:52:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt what

1583
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: On the second, the third, and the fourth time. How are you feeling emotionally

1584
02:52:10.770 --> 02:52:11.460
Nicole Roybal: Irritated

1585
02:52:13.860 --> 02:52:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When. What did you tell yourself that you ended up making that this call.

1586
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:20.130
Nicole Roybal: Just keep trying, because one of them's gonna

1587
02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:26.850
Nicole Roybal: Have to I'm gonna have to eventually find somewhere that's going to accept new patients just like having hope, I guess.

1588
02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

1589
02:52:29.970 --> 02:52:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: have hope.

1590
02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And did work out.

1591
02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep. All right. Nice.

1592
02:52:42.210 --> 02:52:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at this week.

1593
02:52:46.080 --> 02:53:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what you liked about what you did in did includes all things. What I thought what I did, how I felt all of it. But what you liked about what you were doing last week, right up until right now all of it. I'm interested in

1594
02:53:03.930 --> 02:53:18.990
Nicole Roybal: Okay, um, was mainly just been at my grandma's house, honestly. And what I like about it is I'm spending time with them and it makes me feel happy because I missed them. I hadn't I hadn't really been seeing them at much like the past years.

1595
02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:26.700
Nicole Roybal: Four years probably and I've never really saw them so it's nice to for the past month and a half. I've been seeing them every day, almost

1596
02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:32.640
Nicole Roybal: So that makes me really happy. But it also makes me sad to see my grandmother. She is but

1597
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:35.250
Nicole Roybal: I leave someone there to help

1598
02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So happy and sad.

1599
02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:39.810
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1600
02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you like that you're going there.

1601
02:53:44.220 --> 02:53:50.670
Nicole Roybal: I'm just sending going like spending time with them and then it. Plus, it takes me away from everything else and it distracts me

1602
02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:57.630
Nicole Roybal: Okay. And it's just something to do with my day, like how you were saying I can't just be sitting at home all day. I

1603
02:53:59.070 --> 02:54:06.840
Nicole Roybal: When I'm there, I'm not. I never sit down. I'm always cleaning doing something so constantly say definitely like that.

1604
02:54:07.890 --> 02:54:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1605
02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.610
Nicole Roybal: Kind of sit there and think about crazy things.

1606
02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you not liked about you what you've done and what you thought this week.

1607
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:44.730
Nicole Roybal: I didn't like that. I didn't like me all like the goals are. I do all the things I'm supposed to do this week. I guess that was supposed to get that whole

1608
02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:53.460
Nicole Roybal: Insurance thing figured out with my grandparents, so I could get start getting paid to be there caretaker, but that's not really here nor there. So something

1609
02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:55.980
Nicole Roybal: I don't know.

1610
02:54:57.450 --> 02:55:05.880
Nicole Roybal: That's something I didn't like about myself, cuz I told myself I was going to do that. And it kind of made me down on myself because I didn't done. Okay.

1611
02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:15.030
Nicole Roybal: But I'm I'm going over there right after therapy today and my sister and I helped me get it done. So sometime

1612
02:55:15.390 --> 02:55:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the they're just

1613
02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:18.480
Nicole Roybal: Helping out with my parents, my grandparents house.

1614
02:55:19.020 --> 02:55:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There you're able to, I won't have the right wording there at your grandparents house you're able to apply for the ability to be a caregiver.

1615
02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:28.860
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

1616
02:55:29.130 --> 02:55:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: At your grandparents house.

1617
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:39.240
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, well, I have to call their insurance and talk to them and they send someone over to like evaluate. See what needs they need that needs to be met and everything.

1618
02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

1619
02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:45.150
Nicole Roybal: So I did figure out exactly what to do and what they're going to do. I just have to schedule it

1620
02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So scheduling it so scheduling the time to go over there.

1621
02:55:50.040 --> 02:56:01.650
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. And then also, I'm like I needed to know. Like all their medical history and all that stuff. And my sister has all that information. My older sister. So I was waiting for her to send that to me, she never did. But she's going to be there today so

1622
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:04.560
Nicole Roybal: We could both do it, get it figured it out.

1623
02:56:06.090 --> 02:56:08.220
Nicole Roybal: She's there peel a whatever that is.

1624
02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So the negative thought was that

1625
02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a disappointment and yourself. But I did hear that there was a bit more complicated than that.

1626
02:56:20.130 --> 02:56:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There were some pieces that weren't completely contingent on you.

1627
02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also your sister, or is that not true. And maybe you could have done it on your own.

1628
02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:42.120
Nicole Roybal: No, I couldn't enough because I don't know. I don't want them to ask me questions, and my grandparents on a lot of pills. So if they asked about all that kind of stuff. I wasn't going to know

1629
02:56:43.350 --> 02:56:44.250
Nicole Roybal: And there was like no point

1630
02:56:46.890 --> 02:56:49.740
Nicole Roybal: Sorry, I just want to clear

1631
02:56:52.110 --> 02:56:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So help me understand why you landed on I'm disappointed in myself when out loud, you're able to see very clearly.

1632
02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:01.680
Nicole Roybal: As possible.

1633
02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:10.740
Nicole Roybal: Um, I don't know. I guess I just like I could have tried harder to bug. My sister for that information. Okay.

1634
02:57:10.830 --> 02:57:11.550
Nicole Roybal: All right, maybe that's

1635
02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:15.930
Nicole Roybal: Because, are you going to dig deep and i don't know i figured out

1636
02:57:20.430 --> 02:57:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

1637
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So how are you doing around

1638
02:57:25.770 --> 02:57:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The addictive thinking how frequently throughout the day. Is it coming into your mind.

1639
02:57:30.390 --> 02:57:31.110
Nicole Roybal: And trying

1640
02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: To go to the dark side.

1641
02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:42.390
Nicole Roybal: Usually at night, always. Honestly, because we're not like like how you said like be at my grandparents. I'm away from everything like that. So I don't even doesn't really crossed my mind when I'm there.

1642
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:50.970
Nicole Roybal: But then once I leave and I'm back home in environments like even at the apartment sometimes to just because like I

1643
02:57:52.260 --> 02:58:00.030
Nicole Roybal: Was drinking when I was living here most of the time, you know, so being back here, I'm just like, I want a shot, but I it's not possible, even if I wanted to. So

1644
02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:08.310
Nicole Roybal: Of course, it's possible, but I'm not going to. But yeah, just the craziness. You hit a lot at night, especially if I can't sleep at night and I'm just laying there.

1645
02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:16.290
Nicole Roybal: And I might start to tell me, Oh, if you drink, you'll be able to fall asleep. You'll feel better and i'm just like No, don't need that.

1646
02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially at night when I can't sleep.

1647
02:58:20.190 --> 02:58:20.760
Mm hmm.

1648
02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:23.820
Nicole Roybal: And I'm laying there. Wait, yeah.

1649
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How often is that that this is this is happening this difficulty going to sleep. And how long are you having to stay awake.

1650
02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:37.980
Nicole Roybal: Um, well, I haven't been having that much trouble sleeping lately because every waking up earlier like what my grandmas and stuff and get

1651
02:58:37.980 --> 02:58:42.030
Nicole Roybal: Red. So that's been helping me sleep, but just like

1652
02:58:43.470 --> 02:58:53.340
Nicole Roybal: Just sometimes like you know like it just, it just crosses my mind. And then once it crosses my mind it tries to stay there and I'm just like go away. I'm trying to like put it on that shelf like you guys taught me.

1653
02:58:54.420 --> 02:59:01.110
Nicole Roybal: And it's just, it is hard. It's hard, but I know that it will be harder to

1654
02:59:02.190 --> 02:59:09.840
Nicole Roybal: What is it called them to relapse or a slip and get back on track. That would be even harder to do. So it's not worth it.

1655
02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I would say the visualization isn't really a shelf so much as it is, if you want is to put it in the container, which is a lock box with a key.

1656
02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:20.430
Nicole Roybal: All right.

1657
02:59:20.910 --> 02:59:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's do one more, one more thing that doesn't seem to be in here. I don't see your distancing metaphor in here.

1658
02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We can add that. So you've got a lock box with a key.

1659
02:59:32.340 --> 02:59:33.090
Where you can put

1660
02:59:34.110 --> 02:59:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So we take whatever that messages. Oh, you'll go to sleep. If you have a shot and take that and you say, you know, whatever.

1661
02:59:43.410 --> 02:59:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're an ass getting the box or talk to yourself.

1662
02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Thanks a lot. You're going to set me back. You know, I got to go through all this nonsense. Again, thanks a lot. You really really care about me jerk.

1663
02:59:57.540 --> 02:59:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: rather not be a friendly conversation because

1664
03:00:00.510 --> 03:00:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Never sever ties. Eventually, but I'll work with what we've got. So you get it in the Lockbox and then let's add this I'm going to put this in this particular note space that doesn't go anywhere. I'm really surprised I didn't already do it with you.

1665
03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a distancing metaphor. And that is something like that. So you have this box.

1666
03:00:22.890 --> 03:00:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: As one metaphor one symbol for what to do with some of that negative thinking or negative emotion or a negative memory. But there's also this idea of of

1667
03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting some distance between a feeling, and it might be. I'm on the shore of a river, and on a leaf kind of floating sort of

1668
03:00:46.530 --> 03:00:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: past me and down in a way into a distance that I can't see it anymore. Is that thought. Another one inside a helium balloon.

1669
03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Put a little note in there and drop it up and let it go and it floats away sort of slowly, you know, you can see a distance. And finally, it's a little dot you can't even see it anymore.

1670
03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it's on a train.

1671
03:01:12.810 --> 03:01:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's passing by. It's moving down the track the sound gets quieter.

1672
03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't see it anymore.

1673
03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: spaceship out of the atmosphere really fast.

1674
03:01:28.230 --> 03:01:28.530
Okay.

1675
03:01:29.550 --> 03:01:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A car. Yeah, you get it yours.

1676
03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:37.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that is where you have

1677
03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To think of something that was no pressure, you get to take your time.

1678
03:01:45.630 --> 03:01:48.870
Nicole Roybal: Like I don't. I've never like done that for thought of it that way. So,

1679
03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:52.950
Think something like passing by.

1680
03:01:54.450 --> 03:01:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Distance metaphor.

1681
03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:57.060
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

1682
03:01:57.270 --> 03:02:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It is near on your mind. Notice how you were saying things like

1683
03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I was asking it to go over here and notice it wasn't very far away. You were picturing it on a shelf shelf so far away. We want this thing that gets further and further away from us. We want to put that image in there and we can be focusing our attention on that.

1684
03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So another one just to brainstorm, you're in a car and you're heading this direction and you see this negative. Right. It comes by Sean

1685
03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's in the back. And you can see in the rearview mirror is you're heading this way you can see it in the rearview mirror Scott and smaller and smaller, and you can barely hear it as it is. Talk to you, but it just kept moving

1686
03:02:39.660 --> 03:02:47.070
Nicole Roybal: And that's funny. As I was just thinking about like a car. Somebody else thinking Ferrari or some thing and it's in the car.

1687
03:02:48.270 --> 03:02:50.640
Nicole Roybal: Driving off and getting farther and then you can't hear the motor

1688
03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:57.780
Nicole Roybal: And then we go, I don't know. I had to put it in such a fancy car, but I don't want it to be comfortable

1689
03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:00.720
Nicole Roybal: Well,

1690
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You may. It goes fast for already know.

1691
03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:06.810
Nicole Roybal: Right, yeah. Okay.

1692
03:03:07.290 --> 03:03:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can always change it later. I mean, it's your imagination. You can do whatever you want in there.

1693
03:03:12.090 --> 03:03:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But the point is, so I noticed you went like this. So if you're here. Where are you, while this for our is going like this. What do you were you

1694
03:03:24.930 --> 03:03:26.790
Nicole Roybal: Thinking just standing on the road.

1695
03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:29.790
Nicole Roybal: And that's because I'm standing there and

1696
03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:34.800
Nicole Roybal: I stay there, like in a certain the same place, and then it passes by me. Got it.

1697
03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:40.260
Nicole Roybal: Said about fills in my brain like

1698
03:03:41.370 --> 03:03:45.660
Nicole Roybal: Like little me Buzz or something like there's the brain and then a little amoeba passes by.

1699
03:03:47.010 --> 03:03:51.180
Nicole Roybal: Hey, you want a drink and it's just like, no, and the brain stays and it just keeps going on.

1700
03:03:55.710 --> 03:03:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, it's not like this, it's

1701
03:03:59.070 --> 03:04:02.970
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Well, I was thinking like a me buzz like floating around. I don't know.

1702
03:04:03.420 --> 03:04:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What's wrong, but I'm saying what you picked for a metaphor is speed.

1703
03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.320
Nicole Roybal: Yes, exactly. Oh.

1704
03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want to go there and have it go by very fast. And then what you do is you go back to feeling what it's like to be on the side of the road, and that would be where you bring in the imagery of

1705
03:04:23.430 --> 03:04:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The adult self right what used to be kind of Gwen where you've absorbed it you've kind of pulled in this adult self into you.

1706
03:04:32.430 --> 03:04:32.850
Nicole Roybal: And

1707
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Your best friend, Tiffany.

1708
03:04:35.460 --> 03:04:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're strong

1709
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:39.390
Right, and it's

1710
03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just sit there with that imagery and you build it up like what would I be wearing what would we be standing there, why are we on the road. What are we doing over here.

1711
03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:51.780
Nicole Roybal: And how does it feel it with Tiffany who really

1712
03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: sees that strengthen me

1713
03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And Tony Stark.

1714
03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:59.010
Nicole Roybal: And how you went out.

1715
03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And all yeah

1716
03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:02.940
Nicole Roybal: Oh, good.

1717
03:05:03.450 --> 03:05:03.750
Night.

1718
03:05:04.770 --> 03:05:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Both because what it's doing. It makes Philly. But I'll tell you what you're busy. There ain't nobody really saying go get a drink either, so what what so different, have a fun image and so that Tony Stark maybe

1719
03:05:20.310 --> 03:05:21.300
10 or something, you know,

1720
03:05:22.380 --> 03:05:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what he does. But, you know,

1721
03:05:24.270 --> 03:05:24.870
Maybe you take

1722
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And how I meant I was like, don't touch my hands.

1723
03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:30.300
Nicole Roybal: Oh my god. Right.

1724
03:05:31.740 --> 03:05:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But he cracks a joke. You know, how would how would Tony Stark with his, his snarky little attitude right he's kind of an asshole and and he's really smart, though, and then how it how he kind of laugh at the whole picture. Like what kind of joke. Would he tell about this.

1725
03:05:48.420 --> 03:05:49.830
This whole scenario. You know what I mean.

1726
03:05:51.150 --> 03:05:52.860
Nicole Roybal: Can make a pun some type of way.

1727
03:05:55.170 --> 03:05:58.320
Nicole Roybal: Of intelligence to. Yeah, it does.

1728
03:06:01.200 --> 03:06:03.900
You go there instead. Cool.

1729
03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:08.400
Nicole Roybal: And you do it, then you do it again.

1730
03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you giggle. And then you remember other things.

1731
03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:12.780
Nicole Roybal: In the

1732
03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right any exercise and you read then you watch TV, then you, you make your bed, then you mess up the bed and you're like,

1733
03:06:21.090 --> 03:06:21.570
And then

1734
03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:34.110
Nicole Roybal: I know I've been cleaning like crazy. It's like it's gone so much worse. Now I'm not drinking I, sir. It's all like I just clean and once I start cleaning. Oh my god, I go crazy nuts.

1735
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And there it is risky and I know people sometimes will turn into this whole like compulsive behavior and we'll definitely will keep an eye on it okay for now I'm so grateful that you have a business that you're staying busy.

1736
03:06:55.080 --> 03:07:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can replace it with something else. Let's do it. If you want to register for cooking school. You know, because

1737
03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever, but I like the distraction.

1738
03:07:08.250 --> 03:07:20.760
Nicole Roybal: And then I like these new apartments, we're going to be moving into they have a gym in there as well as we are now don't so I'm so excited for that. I don't have to go walk down the road and walk downstairs to the gym.

1739
03:07:21.090 --> 03:07:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you mean by way

1740
03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:28.470
Nicole Roybal: Daniel cuz we're moving into a new apartment and I can't as a month.

1741
03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:40.560
Nicole Roybal: Okay, well, he is we are, I don't know, every time we say we both say when I don't know we're not sure. Still, we're still trying to work out the kinks in our relationships so

1742
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:41.400
Nicole Roybal: Okay, what

1743
03:07:41.940 --> 03:07:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to talk about that. Where do you want to focus today. We can go anywhere you want. It can be this whole thing of

1744
03:07:46.800 --> 03:07:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've got you've got some interesting things like what I call these sort of target things that you've said throughout the time we've been together, which is like, well,

1745
03:07:55.920 --> 03:08:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to go do this thing, because I'll end up not liking it. Well, it's not like you're

1746
03:08:01.170 --> 03:08:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Avoiding being in a relationship, for sure, then you're not going to like Daniel or, you know, if I spend time with my grandmother and I won't like my ground. Yeah, you do you do with a couple of things which might be an excuse to actually kind of dive into the

1747
03:08:15.270 --> 03:08:16.680
Nicole Roybal: Higher yeah

1748
03:08:17.070 --> 03:08:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So normally, you know that if you're bullshitting yourself. You're going to have to, you know,

1749
03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only push so hard.

1750
03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:34.260
Nicole Roybal: I know, I know. And I get where you're at, I hear you, I hear what you're saying. And I feel like it's you're probably right. But I don't know. I'm just so scared of

1751
03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:36.330
Nicole Roybal: Failing

1752
03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo, why because we're all like that.

1753
03:08:41.220 --> 03:08:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah flow normal and not only fear of failure, but also it can even be afraid to succeed on top of that. So it's really complicated.

1754
03:08:53.220 --> 03:08:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's you playing God, believe it or not.

1755
03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:56.670
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1756
03:08:56.970 --> 03:08:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, you know, the future.

1757
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you have ever predicted that you meet when a year that we would have this little conversation you be talking to some weird lady in Florida. Did you have any idea that was going to be happening. No.

1758
03:09:12.780 --> 03:09:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you don't know what's coming, either just stay curious about it just come back to the moment. What do I like what do I like about right now.

1759
03:09:22.260 --> 03:09:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Believe it or not, those minutes will gather up and then that day will have passed and you will have liked it or you will not have you will have decided to do this imagery that we played with five minutes ago or fed

1760
03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have stuck your thumb out with that Ferrari and said in your cute little outfit.

1761
03:09:41.250 --> 03:09:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, let me that's a hot car, we can have some fun. You decide what imagery

1762
03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:54.480
Nicole Roybal: Or maybe I could be in the car passing by the thought.

1763
03:09:56.910 --> 03:09:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. That's what I'm talking about.

1764
03:09:58.920 --> 03:09:59.370
Yeah.

1765
03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then add imagery, you wanna, You want me to switch it

1766
03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:06.420
Nicole Roybal: I'm

1767
03:10:06.750 --> 03:10:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that one.

1768
03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:16.500
Nicole Roybal: Better because then I'm in the badass car comfortable having fun and they're out there in the cold.

1769
03:10:16.890 --> 03:10:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Raggedy

1770
03:10:17.730 --> 03:10:18.690
Nicole Roybal: an impasse by

1771
03:10:20.010 --> 03:10:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your shoes.

1772
03:10:21.270 --> 03:10:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Will hose in

1773
03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. So there we go. I am driving past

1774
03:10:35.850 --> 03:10:36.360
There we go.

1775
03:10:39.180 --> 03:10:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm in a nice car driving past. Do you want a drink, you want to drink. Nice, nice ice.

1776
03:10:55.170 --> 03:11:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Nicole. There's lots of areas that we can we can spend time in, I want you to really turn inward. I'm going to do the same. Okay, I'm going to be quiet. I want you to be quiet, not having to giggle not having to apologize for anything. There's no wrong way for you to be a client.

1777
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just impossible. There's nothing to be sorry for

1778
03:11:22.290 --> 03:11:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: turn inward and see with the moment that you have with this time.

1779
03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How you can be a taker.

1780
03:11:33.450 --> 03:11:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just scan the landscape of your mind and see

1781
03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Sir information you want. Is there an experience you want you're feeling that you want.

1782
03:11:46.470 --> 03:11:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what your truth is

1783
03:12:08.430 --> 03:12:12.450
Nicole Roybal: I know there's so much stuff going on in my life right now. It's hard to just pick one.

1784
03:12:16.350 --> 03:12:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do this, let's all agree they're all important.

1785
03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now I want you to say which one puts my mental health in jeopardy. Which one puts my physical health in jeopardy.

1786
03:12:37.980 --> 03:12:39.330
Nicole Roybal: Well, physical health.

1787
03:12:40.380 --> 03:12:45.630
Nicole Roybal: Because of how I've been like go sick all week and I'm still pushing myself to get up and go to my grandmas and

1788
03:12:46.230 --> 03:13:00.720
Nicole Roybal: Go help and I you know I have to take the bus of it and it's three buses. They take and it just takes a lot out of me. And I don't know if that's what's maybe been making me sick because I've just been exhausted exerting myself and even if I don't feel good. I still get up and go

1789
03:13:03.930 --> 03:13:09.570
Nicole Roybal: I feel like you said, I come first, I need to make sure I'm okay. I haven't been doing that this week.

1790
03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:11.610
Okay.

1791
03:13:13.830 --> 03:13:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So I need to rest.

1792
03:13:17.790 --> 03:13:19.890
Nicole Roybal: Yeah okay and

1793
03:13:20.130 --> 03:13:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Take care of my body.

1794
03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:28.590
Nicole Roybal: Now, and I do like as soon as I get home. I'll try to eat something, I'll just lay down and like I went to bed at like 730 the other night.

1795
03:13:29.670 --> 03:13:30.000
Nicole Roybal: So,

1796
03:13:33.660 --> 03:13:37.980
Nicole Roybal: I feel good. Today though I slept really good lesson. It was I sold during that part but

1797
03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What else remember the question. Let's see if you can tether back to it.

1798
03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:47.460
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I'm

1799
03:13:58.500 --> 03:14:02.400
Nicole Roybal: I liked the Daniels and then you say it department more lately.

1800
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:18.960
Nicole Roybal: But every time I go back to my mom's I feel like the cravings are even worse than they were. And I haven't been there as much. I've been at the apartment, a lot more than anything, but when I do look back to my mom's I find myself.

1801
03:14:20.850 --> 03:14:22.230
Nicole Roybal: Thinking about it more, I guess.

1802
03:14:23.310 --> 03:14:35.130
Nicole Roybal: So that's why I literally like when I went to bed at 730 rather than I think that was Monday night or Tuesday night. I can't remember, but, um, because I just didn't want to be around it. I just want to just go to bed and just get away from everyone.

1803
03:14:36.090 --> 03:14:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I'm hearing is you have a current trigger in your life.

1804
03:14:39.420 --> 03:14:39.900
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1805
03:14:40.350 --> 03:14:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The current one. Right.

1806
03:14:42.660 --> 03:14:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to do a little em Dr around that.

1807
03:14:47.490 --> 03:14:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have the ability to have a surface and your to two objects, right next to the phone about shoulder width, you have something that you can create

1808
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:58.440
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I would just have to move the phone.

1809
03:14:58.860 --> 03:14:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Take your time.

1810
03:15:02.910 --> 03:15:06.450
Nicole Roybal: I have it set up in like my makeup bad like it's so get over it.

1811
03:15:16.530 --> 03:15:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now are you comfortable. The way you're seated.

1812
03:15:18.810 --> 03:15:19.110
Yeah.

1813
03:15:23.130 --> 03:15:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can turn that down just a touch more so I see less of the ceiling and more of your body only want to kind of keep an eye on your breath.

1814
03:15:31.290 --> 03:15:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the objects are right next to the phone in there. If your hands went straight out from your shoulders are about shoulder width apart.

1815
03:15:40.890 --> 03:15:41.790
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

1816
03:15:41.880 --> 03:15:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me watch your eyes when you look left and right, and I just don't want them to be strained.

1817
03:15:48.540 --> 03:15:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they hurting. When you do that,

1818
03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:52.350
Nicole Roybal: A little bit on the side.

1819
03:15:53.010 --> 03:15:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't make a wider don't make a minor you sit back

1820
03:15:56.280 --> 03:16:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Nice. Nice. Nice. I love that adjustment. Okay, now look at those tops of those objects and see if it's straining your eyes.

1821
03:16:06.900 --> 03:16:07.230
Nicole Roybal: No.

1822
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, nice. Okay, so let's let's go around this one.

1823
03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And this one. And I remember there's no wrong way to do it. So the key is not to censor, you get to let me earn my living. I'll do the analysis for you today. I'll guide us home. How about we go here. How about we go there. Okay, you get a little break. Okay.

1824
03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:33.630
Okay.

1825
03:16:35.730 --> 03:16:36.180
Nicole Roybal: So,

1826
03:16:38.910 --> 03:16:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Candy.

1827
03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:41.400
Nicole Roybal: Tissue

1828
03:16:42.660 --> 03:16:43.800
Nicole Roybal: A little bit here. Yeah.

1829
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the current triggers is

1830
03:16:48.270 --> 03:16:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're at Daniel's right now. Right. Yeah.

1831
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to picture I'm closing my eyes and doing the same kind of thing here with you and I'm picturing

1832
03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm making my way to the House.

1833
03:17:04.530 --> 03:17:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture making your way to your family of origin, home to that home that you've been staying

1834
03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up for you when that trigger escalates, and what belief or thought comes to mind.

1835
03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:25.110
Nicole Roybal: So when I'm on my way over there.

1836
03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:33.360
Nicole Roybal: I usually take the bus, and when I get off the bus drops you off right there and have officers. I used to buy my liquor app.

1837
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:36.720
Nicole Roybal: That does not help at all.

1838
03:17:38.250 --> 03:17:50.100
Nicole Roybal: Say, literally, I'll get off. And I'll just see actually cross the street to get to like the Walgreens and stuff so I won't cross the street. I was turning right there and just keep going, mature. I don't even go to those stores will

1839
03:17:51.540 --> 03:17:58.380
Nicole Roybal: Just never I'm coming when I know I'm going to my mom's house. It's like my mind is like, Oh, you're on your mom. Do you think that no one will judge you.

1840
03:17:58.770 --> 03:18:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and we got from making a right turn. Is it happening then or when you realize I'm going to my mom's no one will judge you.

1841
03:18:07.950 --> 03:18:17.160
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, when I realized I'm good. Because yeah, because my mind already knows I'm going to my mom's so once I get off the bus and I'm right next to all those liquor stores. It's like

1842
03:18:18.030 --> 03:18:25.980
Nicole Roybal: That's what it tells me, like, Oh, well, you're going to your mom's it'll be fine. It's just like, No, it won't because I'm going to get mad at me, I'm gonna judge me like

1843
03:18:27.870 --> 03:18:33.600
Nicole Roybal: But, well, I think matters because if they don't care if I drink, then obviously, they don't care. Okay.

1844
03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and that's

1845
03:18:36.240 --> 03:18:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: On me that yeah you're you've been kind of playing with some different ways of thinking

1846
03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some imagery around that. So you're getting off the bus.

1847
03:18:54.630 --> 03:19:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought you've got visual cues that are happening and and this is not your fault. It's just that you have some connections to drinking associated with those stores getting off of that bus stop and

1848
03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been, I get to go home and and I can drink and no one's going to judge me there.

1849
03:19:13.230 --> 03:19:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so so picture. Some of the cues.

1850
03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can picture the store, maybe, maybe even before you get to that neighborhood. See, see how early we can catch this

1851
03:19:30.450 --> 03:19:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it's all the way to getting on the bus. Let's see how far back.

1852
03:19:36.420 --> 03:19:39.360
Nicole Roybal: No, I'm not thinking about it when I'm on the bus. Okay.

1853
03:19:41.250 --> 03:19:48.870
Nicole Roybal: It's just as soon as my foot steps off that bus and I know I'm on that side of town, okay, don't worry. It's weird.

1854
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to know that I'm here.

1855
03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:53.730
Yeah.

1856
03:19:54.930 --> 03:20:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so. But you do know when the foot is on that side of town.

1857
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into it really, really notice as soon as that. Right. You can feel it. Hitting, hitting the ground take in the smells of that environment as part of town. What you see what you hear.

1858
03:20:21.150 --> 03:20:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And how you feel.

1859
03:20:29.550 --> 03:20:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Writing that imagery

1860
03:20:33.300 --> 03:20:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the beliefs about yourself.

1861
03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the thoughts don't censor it

1862
03:20:42.690 --> 03:20:45.900
Nicole Roybal: I believe. Okay, so at first i feel i

1863
03:20:47.310 --> 03:20:58.350
Nicole Roybal: Feel or believe. I don't know. Cuz I feel weak because I'm still having these thoughts, and I guess I believe I'm being weak because I still have the stocks and what the hell, like I should be able to

1864
03:20:59.490 --> 03:21:12.210
Nicole Roybal: Go to one of those stores without worrying about having to even think that. And so in that way. I feel weak and then it makes me but then I believe I'm stronger than that because I'm not doing it and I am making sure that turn the other way that I don't

1865
03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:15.900
Nicole Roybal: Let those thoughts overcome me

1866
03:21:16.350 --> 03:21:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're gonna stay right there.

1867
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it can be annoying that I slow things down so much, but we can get some good work in there. When we do that, okay.

1868
03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:27.300
Nicole Roybal: No, you have to do that with me.

1869
03:21:28.890 --> 03:21:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We have this nice breath.

1870
03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to really get into, I am

1871
03:21:38.910 --> 03:21:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: An intentional loving

1872
03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Person.

1873
03:21:46.170 --> 03:21:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just really sit with that I'm intentional I'm loving and caring

1874
03:21:54.600 --> 03:21:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm an intentional loving and caring person.

1875
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm an intentional loving and caring client.

1876
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with that.

1877
03:22:21.690 --> 03:22:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to go to this this negative cognition. That's the belief, you just said, which is this. I'm weak.

1878
03:22:30.090 --> 03:22:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's the negative ones just stay there.

1879
03:22:36.540 --> 03:22:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to picture what you were doing before, which was getting off the bus and you had a scent and you really got into that imagery. Right.

1880
03:22:44.250 --> 03:22:44.670
Hmm.

1881
03:22:46.650 --> 03:22:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And is, is it true, try and answer my question. Don't do analysis.

1882
03:22:53.340 --> 03:23:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it true right now on a scale of zero to 10 How true is it I am weak first number is it what for okay beautiful and how true is it right now, different scale one to seven.

1883
03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I am strong seven being absolutely true.

1884
03:23:19.800 --> 03:23:22.020
Nicole Roybal: Well, six actually six. Okay.

1885
03:23:22.290 --> 03:23:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Six is I'm strong.

1886
03:23:25.470 --> 03:23:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And for us, I'm week. Yeah. Do you know why it's not a three on the week.

1887
03:23:35.460 --> 03:23:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Why it's not lower

1888
03:23:37.380 --> 03:23:38.010
Nicole Roybal: I'm

1889
03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:50.310
Nicole Roybal: Like I can you said right now, but I guess I did over analyze like I can be week but i know i'm not i'm not i'm not always week everyone

1890
03:23:50.430 --> 03:23:53.640
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, it's weird. It's hard. I'm over analyzing and it's hard not to

1891
03:23:53.880 --> 03:24:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then don't analyze just try to answer my guiding question, which is this listen closely to how I phrase it

1892
03:24:01.320 --> 03:24:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it that you know

1893
03:24:04.050 --> 03:24:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a three or a two in weakness, first thing that comes to mind. What was it

1894
03:24:14.130 --> 03:24:20.220
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, honestly. That's what came to mind. I don't know. There's no reason as to why I just

1895
03:24:24.900 --> 03:24:26.490
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. I said, feel like

1896
03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:30.180
Nicole Roybal: Because I feel like it's right in the middle.

1897
03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no, you're getting hung up on the number

1898
03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:35.730
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. Yeah, yeah.

1899
03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1900
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay, you're okay okay listen closely.

1901
03:24:40.980 --> 03:24:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can figure out in your mind right

1902
03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Logically,

1903
03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say someone

1904
03:24:55.320 --> 03:24:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe your grandma or grandpa was to tell you

1905
03:25:00.060 --> 03:25:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Nicole. You're not a three because

1906
03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Blah, blah, blah. What would they say

1907
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:16.140
Nicole Roybal: Go through be less week right

1908
03:25:16.740 --> 03:25:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

1909
03:25:20.190 --> 03:25:25.860
Nicole Roybal: They would say that I am zero because I'm not weekend. I'm stronger than that and

1910
03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:28.110
Nicole Roybal: They know that

1911
03:25:29.820 --> 03:25:30.150
Nicole Roybal: Just

1912
03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:37.080
Nicole Roybal: Being down on myself because they know that I'm a strong woman and I always tell me

1913
03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: tell by the way you're saying you don't believe them. So, let's go. Go back to you.

1914
03:25:43.410 --> 03:25:46.410
Nicole Roybal: Just look hard to believe it about myself. I guess I don't really have

1915
03:25:47.580 --> 03:25:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here. Stay here. Let's do it again. I know it's uncomfortable and awkward. It's a weird question massage therapists do

1916
03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead of four I'm week

1917
03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know it's not an eight.

1918
03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:06.870
Nicole Roybal: Because I know I'm not we that we

1919
03:26:07.500 --> 03:26:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know

1920
03:26:11.490 --> 03:26:12.900
Nicole Roybal: Because of what I've accomplished.

1921
03:26:13.260 --> 03:26:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1922
03:26:14.370 --> 03:26:14.790
What have you

1923
03:26:15.930 --> 03:26:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you give me evidence

1924
03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:30.630
Nicole Roybal: We've been thinking. Uh huh. So I've been tapering down. I might go content, even though sometimes gets to me but still just have to get through it. Yeah, pushing myself.

1925
03:26:32.130 --> 03:26:33.270
Nicole Roybal: Every single day.

1926
03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, every single day.

1927
03:26:38.970 --> 03:26:43.530
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, trying to push away those thoughts and push the good ones.

1928
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.910
Are

1929
03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:47.490
Very nice.

1930
03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1931
03:26:53.490 --> 03:26:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture the most intense or the earliest time

1932
03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That you felt week

1933
03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: earlier stage, sometimes they're not the same.

1934
03:27:11.460 --> 03:27:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes the most intense. It's not the earliest stage. Sometimes they're the same.

1935
03:27:17.850 --> 03:27:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm week

1936
03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:21.030
Nicole Roybal: Rather throughout the week.

1937
03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The most intense image.

1938
03:27:27.690 --> 03:27:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And just hold it and you don't need to say it out loud. You just pull it up, which gives you permission to go there without having anyone else know about it, you just hold it, pull it up in your awareness, the exact worst part of it.

1939
03:27:47.430 --> 03:27:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it in your mind.

1940
03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to do some positive imagery. So I want you to pull up your team.

1941
03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With that worst limit. Okay.

1942
03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that means pulling up

1943
03:28:04.050 --> 03:28:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The adult self of caring

1944
03:28:08.310 --> 03:28:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That means pulling in, Tiffany.

1945
03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony and Howie

1946
03:28:16.740 --> 03:28:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Having

1947
03:28:18.210 --> 03:28:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All of you interacting

1948
03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, of course, the giggles. Fantastic. That means you're free really getting into it.

1949
03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't

1950
03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn away from being present with the giggle that laughter is a part of it.

2034
03:36:58.470 --> 03:37:01.080

2035
03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up everybody for this one. Okay. You ran there you got through the moment you got through that negative thinking, but you're there now.

2040
03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:14.850
Nicole Roybal: Well,

2041
03:38:15.960 --> 03:38:17.730
Nicole Roybal: My mom's house, like you said to

2042
03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:21.570
Nicole Roybal: Think of and

2043
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:29.160
Nicole Roybal: I just picture like my mom and my dad and all them are already drunk know you know

2044
03:38:30.510 --> 03:38:30.960
Nicole Roybal: And

2045
03:38:32.340 --> 03:38:41.250
Nicole Roybal: My mind is time me just to go sit down on my couch my bed, whatever in the living room and just stay away from them. They always do.

2046
03:38:42.420 --> 03:38:44.310
Nicole Roybal: I don't know how like

2047
03:38:45.570 --> 03:38:48.120
Nicole Roybal: I mean the thoughts are still there drinking, but it's not like

2048
03:38:49.620 --> 03:38:55.500
Nicole Roybal: I have any alcohol because I ran home away from alcohol. So there's nothing I could do now. Now I'm home and now

2049
03:38:57.420 --> 03:38:58.320
Nicole Roybal: I don't have a choice now.

2050
03:38:58.890 --> 03:39:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you. That's beautiful. But pull in a little bit more as you're in the living room. Let's get really immersed with staying present just this last piece.

2051
03:39:12.450 --> 03:39:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're in the living room.

2052
03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony's there. How is there. Tiffany's there. Okay, bring it all and bring your whole team in and you're there.

2053
03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: He adult you recognized it and when affair, your therapist and you have it in you.

2054
03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You recognize to Jimmy and you found it in you. You have that same attribute, whatever that quality was in me of protection.

2055
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You have it.

2056
03:39:52.290 --> 03:39:56.640
Nicole Roybal: I know I'm strong enough, because I do it all the time. I just tired of the thoughts.

2057
03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and that's the part right there. I shouldn't have the fox theater today maybe right afterwards. Just sit with the imagery of asking, and I don't know who

2058
03:40:11.940 --> 03:40:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's got wisdom around what to expect about the continued thoughts, because despite how many times I say that the attic will continue to try to seduce you that your neural network given

2059
03:40:25.050 --> 03:40:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And many years that

2060
03:40:26.370 --> 03:40:27.660
Nicole Roybal: You've been drinking and

2061
03:40:27.690 --> 03:40:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the connections that it will continue to be there. And yet you give yourself a hard time when they are there.

2062
03:40:36.810 --> 03:40:38.880
Nicole Roybal: It's a paradox. Yeah.

2063
03:40:40.350 --> 03:40:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check in and see

2064
03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't, don't go to the ask someone who knows, maybe they don't know but they may know someone who knows someone who knows someone who can give you the information about what am I supposed to do with the fact that these thoughts, keep coming up.

2065
03:40:55.920 --> 03:40:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're done.

2066
03:40:58.020 --> 03:40:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it

2067
03:41:00.540 --> 03:41:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In side of the road.

2068
03:41:02.610 --> 03:41:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you define by

2069
03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm gonna leave you to do that. You can decide to go jump on the phone and do something else. Or you can finish this work.

2070
03:41:14.910 --> 03:41:15.330
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

2071
03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you can.

2072
03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:19.440
Nicole Roybal: Because the imagery of

2073
03:41:21.870 --> 03:41:22.290
Nicole Roybal: How did you

2074
03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep having these thoughts.

2075
03:41:25.980 --> 03:41:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask someone

2076
03:41:28.080 --> 03:41:31.110

2105
03:43:48.330 --> 03:43:54.270
iPhone: Yeah, I think that you should, because I don't feel like my mind is in the right spot to be deciding what I need to be

2106
03:43:55.110 --> 03:44:03.780
iPhone: I just wanted to one thing I will say is I woke up this morning, extremely grateful and in a different perspective than I have been in a really long time.

2107
03:44:04.410 --> 03:44:14.550
iPhone: I woke up and I just, I wasn't hurting. I wasn't having anxiety. I wasn't thinking about how I was going to get my pills. I wasn't thinking about how I was gonna

2108
03:44:15.690 --> 03:44:23.430
iPhone: Whatever, everything was good with work everything I just felt like I was thankful for just being sober and being on the Suboxone

2109
03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you're one of your tax was. And that's what I was relying on was you'll have enough to get you to Friday. So is that because you were able to have a dose this morning.

iPhone: where I'm at right now in a program that that I can

2113
03:44:48.660 --> 03:45:02.820
iPhone: Have something like a Suboxone to help me. You know, like I just woke up feeling grateful that I had that for today, you know, instead of having to search for a pill or or being on dope or withdrawing or being in the hospital where I just felt grateful for where I'm at.

2114
03:45:03.600 --> 03:45:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful. And so no anxiety and it and it is, it's a lot of ways. It's a bit like a miracle for people that that didn't think it was possible to kind of have relief from a lot of people, it's heroin, some people, it's the, it's the

2115
03:45:19.410 --> 03:45:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Carcass that's an oxy but you had a recent relapse and some other things have gone on.

2116
03:45:27.540 --> 03:45:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: that confused me

2117
03:45:29.370 --> 03:45:31.530
iPhone: Yeah, yeah. Last some stuff to to

2118
03:45:31.530 --> 03:45:33.150

03:45:33.870 --> 03:45:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we do now. This is a very unique relationship. This means that you can be mad at me disgusted. You can be all kinds of things with me and I'm not going to lose my shit.

2120
03:45:45.810 --> 03:45:46.230
iPhone: Huh.

2121
03:45:46.590 --> 03:45:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What I mean by that is

2122
03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not your dad, not your mom notch brother. I'm not anybody who's going to make it about them.

2123
03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're going through something the one piece that I will add is

2124
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a professional, which means I'm going to have some insights into some things that you and I might not agree on. I might have a perspective, given my experience in this field, my perspective.

2125
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: On recent history over, let's say, just the last 30 days I'm privileged to hold those stories with me and I don't want to abuse them. I don't want to miss use them, but they're still part of the picture.

2126
03:46:33.930 --> 03:46:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's both. You get to tell your truth and I'll hold space. You could have been really scared you weren't gonna have any medicine on Friday. Maybe that's one

2127
03:46:43.620 --> 03:46:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows what but I'll hold space for it. It's just that it's an and not only am I going to hold space your truth, but I have an opinion and I wanted to talk

2128
03:46:54.270 --> 03:46:54.540
iPhone: A little

2129
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Bit. Okay, so why don't we start with you.

2130
03:46:58.530 --> 03:47:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: walk yourself through what's on your mind. What do you need to save me kind of get it out, get it, get it clear the air, if you will.

2131
03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:16.890
iPhone: OK, so the other night. Whenever I was texting you and you had said like we need to meet like with bright heart to see how we can meet your goals how bright heart can help your goals.

2132
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:27.540
iPhone: Well, me, myself, I took it. I took that as, oh no, she's canceling me like she's their cancer. They don't want anything to do with me.

2133
03:47:28.290 --> 03:47:34.320
iPhone: And I made this big old story that I fabricated in my head just from overthinking that

2134
03:47:35.010 --> 03:47:40.920
iPhone: You were for some reason upset or I don't know what I was that's just what my brain was telling me and

2135
03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:49.650
iPhone: So I, I told my mom and my mom's telling me she's like, Trevor. I'm not reading that like that at all. I'm reading that as she's trying to get you help.

2136
03:47:50.250 --> 03:47:55.230
iPhone: She's trying to help you. I'm not reading and I was freaking out thinking. No, they're going to cancel me like

2137
03:47:55.950 --> 03:48:04.560
iPhone: And it was just all kind of fabricated in my head. And so I started talking to my mom about like, Well, maybe if I just get a new therapist or whatever.

2138
03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:14.310
iPhone: And and I'm just being honest with you this what I was thinking I was over, I had this whole story in my head like hates me she's she doesn't want this anymore and

2139
03:48:14.820 --> 03:48:28.830
iPhone: How am I going to go on talking to go in and but my mom social then I was even to a coward to call bright heart and and and say, hey, I want a new therapist. So I have my mom do it and then

2140
03:48:29.610 --> 03:48:39.090
iPhone: And then after that. That night I had to just, you could hold it. I'm Tiffany I guess, whatever that I was just acting crazy

2141
03:48:39.780 --> 03:48:47.310
iPhone: And so me and my mom talked about and I apologize to her and said, I shouldn't have put you in that position to call and I

2142
03:48:47.820 --> 03:49:01.350
iPhone: Was i mean i did fabricate all that in my head. That wasn't. I don't think wins mad at me. I do think she's trying to help me. I'd rather just meet with her and stick with her. She knows all my business. I think I was just overreacting and so

2143
03:49:02.280 --> 03:49:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's beautiful. So there was another piece of it. The two either intentionally or unintentionally, you got feedback from bright heart healthy left that out. What was the feedback.

2144
03:49:13.230 --> 03:49:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Or feedback. Your mom spoke with someone right

2145
03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:28.770
iPhone: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yes, she did. And they had told me to just go to the 12 O'clock group today and talk to Dr element and tell him that I needed to talk to him privately.

2146
03:49:29.460 --> 03:49:36.240
iPhone: And say that I would want a new therapist, but I didn't want to do that. So that's why I wanted to meet with you. That's what bright heart said

2147
03:49:36.660 --> 03:49:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I do you know who told you that

2148
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:39.720
iPhone: I'm

03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to know.

2152
03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:48.930
iPhone: She, her name was

2153
03:50:02.340 --> 03:50:07.080
iPhone: Her name was Angelina apparently she's my court court.

2154
03:50:07.980 --> 03:50:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Coordinator Okay.

2155
03:50:10.740 --> 03:50:22.050
iPhone: Yeah, she had told. And that's why I was so confused because I had talked to Dr element. And I told him, hey, what do I need to do to get back on track. And he, he said, meet with going in the morning, like you're supposed to It's Okay cool.

2156
03:50:22.230 --> 03:50:22.770
Yeah.

2157
03:50:23.940 --> 03:50:24.990
iPhone: That was me.

2158
03:50:26.340 --> 03:50:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the only the best business with Angela and that's new.

2159
03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Only piece I have. I spent some time last night about maybe 10 or 15 minutes processing. What was going on with us. I sort of sat down. I was like,

2160
03:50:40.650 --> 03:50:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's going on. You don't have to have to sit and think

2161
03:50:43.350 --> 03:50:43.620
iPhone: Yeah.

2162
03:50:43.890 --> 03:50:44.580
Of course,

2163
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of juxtaposing what I was hearing in these different places.

2164
03:50:51.930 --> 03:50:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: With my text.

2165
03:50:54.300 --> 03:50:54.750
I'm only

2166
03:50:56.160 --> 03:51:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This and I'm hearing this, which is in complete opposite. And I'm confused. But I also I'm making up a story of like how I was thinking you were terrified. I was imagining

2167
03:51:08.010 --> 03:51:08.880
iPhone: My words.

2168
03:51:08.940 --> 03:51:11.070
iPhone: I was right.

2169
03:51:11.220 --> 03:51:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going to be left with no Madison on Friday.

2170
03:51:14.250 --> 03:51:23.820
iPhone: So it wasn't even that it wasn't even that I was terrified that you are like upset at me or something and I was scared to face you like in the meeting. That's what it was like I was

2171
03:51:25.410 --> 03:51:39.300
iPhone: And I guess part of it too. Yeah, being cancelled, like I just thought like you were just didn't want anything to do with me anymore. And that scared me because I've been with you from the start, you know, I just made that big old story up in my head, but from overthinking

2172
03:51:39.600 --> 03:51:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Well, well, let's let's take another level of ownership, we're doing great. If you can go to the next one. You're gonna be free.

2173
03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:50.520
iPhone: Okay, I just need to know what it is.

2174
03:51:50.880 --> 03:51:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to this next one and just say, I found the problem. The problem is the therapist. I'm going to get a different one.

2175
03:51:58.890 --> 03:52:01.470
iPhone: Yeah, yeah. That's what my head told me. Yeah, at the time. Yeah.

2176
03:52:02.820 --> 03:52:05.130
iPhone: For sure. Exactly. That's exactly what I tried to do

2177
03:52:06.060 --> 03:52:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, that's another

2178
03:52:10.410 --> 03:52:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's working it

2179
03:52:11.310 --> 03:52:12.870
iPhone: That's the easy way out.

2180
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's splitting it's splitting. You just split the doctor and therapist and conveniently Angela You got a lot of people working against each other and not working as a team.

2181
03:52:25.230 --> 03:52:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm watching. And I didn't even know this bit about Angelina was going on. Um, but it doesn't surprise me because we're all independent contractors. So we're all like, you know. Left hand, right hand is doing.

2182
03:52:41.370 --> 03:52:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But

2183
03:52:44.130 --> 03:52:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: None of this

2184
03:52:47.460 --> 03:53:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is about Angelina excited about Dr elements, not about one of your it's about what the next step is in service to what you want, I want to talk about, if we can, if you're ready.

2185
03:53:02.100 --> 03:53:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You already did the big own. It was like one of yours, the fucking problem. We're getting rid of her.

2186
03:53:06.210 --> 03:53:06.930
Mom, can I

2187
03:53:09.240 --> 03:53:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Get rid of the bench and then we're good. You know, she kept going.

2188
03:53:14.340 --> 03:53:16.890
iPhone: You don't worry, I just, I just thought you were

2189
03:53:17.310 --> 03:53:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but

2190
03:53:22.140 --> 03:53:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's it, then we've named it, and we've called it out and now the addict inside is like okay jig is up like we were running a game where we're like, well, we'll just make her the bad guy and then you

2191
03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your part, it'll be about, you know, this is a crummy therapist or she doesn't. She doesn't care about me. You know, if you can sit with that.

2192
03:53:45.270 --> 03:53:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude that's big.

2193
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:49.710
iPhone: Yeah, I can't. Yeah, I realized that

2194
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:56.100
iPhone: Last night that I was out of my mind, and that that was not the right thing to do. And that's why I'm here, meeting with you right now.

2195
03:53:56.250 --> 03:54:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Very brave of you and hopefully your heart rate sitting more regulated. As you can see, to say these truths. Hopefully you

2196
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:11.310
iPhone: Know, that's why I told you I woke up this morning. I think with that calmness and peace because I decided last night that I was going to do this.

2197
03:54:11.430 --> 03:54:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

2198
03:54:11.970 --> 03:54:13.110
iPhone: You know what I mean. I just

2200
03:54:15.660 --> 03:54:16.020
iPhone: Yeah.

2201
03:54:16.410 --> 03:54:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So the other part. This is just content driven. It's not a process thing I just want to tell you one other. I don't know if you remember, but I'm pretty consistent with telling people, Hey, guys. You all have my personal cell phone you all do. It's a privilege.

2202
03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:35.550
iPhone: Yeah.

2203
03:54:36.300 --> 03:54:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The privilege to me, and I can tell.

2204
03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It means I don't have to go through slack who scheduled appointments and people do that, I'll do that I'm going or something. But I like

2205
03:54:50.280 --> 03:54:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Ones on, I want to be able to you know nuance.

2206

Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to hear back when can we meet, and I looked at my own tax. And I was like, Okay, I have an incomplete sentence there that's that just sucks. So I was probably trying to pull. I know I was trying to text you but I was pulling from treatment with someone else, like I was trying

2210
03:55:37.020 --> 03:55:38.670
iPhone: I was meeting with someone. Yeah.

2212
03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:50.370

2213
03:55:50.400 --> 03:55:50.610
Talk.

03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.860
iPhone: I understand.

2225
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be squishy squishy. Everything's gonna be

2226
03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, to push. What am I going to, you would have

2227
03:56:56.130 --> 03:56:58.590
iPhone: kept asking and kept bugging them. Yeah.

2228
03:56:58.860 --> 03:57:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you want your answers. You want it what you want, when you want it and you wanted it now. And I was like, No, that's the attic demanding it for me. And that's not clinically what

2229
03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:11.400
iPhone: Yeah.

2230
03:57:12.150 --> 03:57:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: went all the way through and you came out the other side this morning.

2231
03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Found some humility. I'm thinking somewhere in there.

2232
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:22.140
Yeah, showed up.

2233
03:57:24.420 --> 03:57:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: took a lot of courage.

2234
03:57:28.260 --> 03:57:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I couldn't have unearthed on you right. It could have blamed you I could be name called I could shame you I could do lots of ugly things that would make me feel bad.

2235
03:57:38.100 --> 03:57:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: appease

2236
03:57:39.600 --> 03:57:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: My responsibility, but I'm a part of it. I gave you my cell phone I I gave you a bad sentence, I, I, I said that vague phrase.

2237
03:57:50.370 --> 03:57:51.060
iPhone: I didn't keep

2238
03:57:51.150 --> 03:57:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling you

2239
03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's a lot of parts that I can. I'm to

2240
03:57:56.940 --> 03:57:59.040
It wasn't perfect but we're here.

2241
03:58:00.450 --> 03:58:01.320
to humans.

2242
03:58:02.370 --> 03:58:03.120
iPhone: Weren't perfect

2243
03:58:03.960 --> 03:58:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But our intentions are.

2244
03:58:06.330 --> 03:58:06.720
iPhone: Good.

2245
03:58:07.080 --> 03:58:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that about me.

2246
03:58:08.880 --> 03:58:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure of it. I've checked myself.

2247
03:58:12.300 --> 03:58:16.500
iPhone: Yeah, I know. I feel they are to both of you seriously.

2248
03:58:18.330 --> 03:58:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And Angelina meant well too.

2249
03:58:20.370 --> 03:58:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Solomon means well but it's good to have one chief on this.

2250
03:58:26.910 --> 03:58:27.240
iPhone: Yeah.

2251
03:58:27.570 --> 03:58:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can manage all of it all at the same time mom to mom did her best. She only knows training.

2252
03:58:36.660 --> 03:58:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You're giving her

2253
03:58:37.890 --> 03:58:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: She and I haven't met, that would be great. Polar in happy to do it. I'm a marriage and family therapist more, the merrier. I have a whole family. I'd love it.

2254
03:58:47.010 --> 03:58:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I would all be right. You'd be like, well, that's too much information.

2255
03:58:49.890 --> 03:58:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that's right but I like it.

2256
03:58:53.340 --> 03:58:53.700
iPhone: Yeah.

2257
03:58:54.450 --> 03:58:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's transparency, that's risky for the attic. That's risky because

2258
03:58:57.600 --> 03:59:00.930
iPhone: You know, I think she would like it. We just have to find a time to do it.

2259
03:59:01.920 --> 03:59:02.340
iPhone: Yeah.

2260
03:59:02.760 --> 03:59:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, there's many people working

2261
03:59:05.340 --> 03:59:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Together side that can counteract right the addiction voice. So we've we've covered the testing. We've covered this other piece I want to know a little bit about

2262
03:59:17.460 --> 03:59:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

2263
03:59:18.390 --> 03:59:19.650
iPhone: Oh, the sponsor. Yeah.

2264
03:59:20.040 --> 03:59:21.450
iPhone: So that

2265
03:59:22.200 --> 03:59:41.670
iPhone: Yeah, so my mom. She is a district court clerk manager so she has these ladies that work for her. Well, one of the ladies that works for her as a been clean off meth for like seven years and her husband runs the Celebrate Recovery here. So her husband. That was the guy told you about.

2266
03:59:43.200 --> 03:59:47.010
iPhone: I think I sent you, Matt. But that's not his real name. It's actually Chris

2267
03:59:47.610 --> 03:59:58.560
iPhone: I got it wrong and anyways. But yeah, so we have sober recovery every Wednesday night and Sunday night, and I'm working in town right now so I'm able to go to those and I'm meeting with him.

2268
03:59:59.460 --> 04:00:09.360
iPhone: Tonight after church. We're going to go to church and then meet with him tonight, but he's going to start running me through this step work, which is the thing that I've been missing. So, which is what

2269
04:00:10.050 --> 04:00:14.310
iPhone: really kept me sober and myth. I remember that community. I was talking about. So hopefully that

2270
04:00:14.700 --> 04:00:27.630
iPhone: I'll be able to find this community to him, you know, and all of his sober friends. And that's what you. That's why he wants to be my sponsor. He asked to be my sponsor. So yeah, that's how it's been a pretty cool week

2271
04:00:28.890 --> 04:00:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is beautiful. And this is the part of support. I will

2272
04:00:36.300 --> 04:00:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's an end.

2273
04:00:37.800 --> 04:00:38.400
iPhone: And I don't

2274
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:39.600
iPhone: Want you

2275
04:00:39.660 --> 04:00:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To stop paying attention to what registers, you

2276
04:00:45.630 --> 04:00:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because it's Chris

2277
04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Chris

2278
04:00:50.460 --> 04:00:50.850
iPhone: Yeah.

2279
04:00:52.650 --> 04:00:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Be careful.

2280
04:00:53.760 --> 04:00:54.150
Yeah.

2281
04:00:58.260 --> 04:01:06.480
iPhone: Yeah I know I am I my sponsor. I had in Midland my sponsor for like a year and a half. I loved him to death. But he moved across the country and

2282
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:13.020
iPhone: So I know like all like, I know that a book like back to back, and everything and all the stuff work and stuff so

2283
04:01:13.620 --> 04:01:23.160
iPhone: I definitely know but he also told me you know there's a ton of other people, like if it because I haven't met with him yet. But he said, There's a ton of people that would be willing to do that. So I just

2284
04:01:23.760 --> 04:01:27.960
iPhone: It's just kind of found that little community. You know what I mean. I just have to go

2285
04:01:28.980 --> 04:01:30.180
iPhone: And so that's tonight.

2286
04:01:30.810 --> 04:01:31.320
All right.

2287
04:01:34.770 --> 04:01:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What's all amazing loving it.

2288
04:01:38.430 --> 04:01:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So now watch where therapy can be your

2289
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountability.

2290
04:01:54.420 --> 04:01:55.260
iPhone: Say that again.

2291
04:01:57.720 --> 04:02:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: In accountability, but no one's really watching you.

2292
04:02:02.970 --> 04:02:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

2293
04:02:04.680 --> 04:02:05.850
holding you accountable.

2294
04:02:07.470 --> 04:02:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not

2295
04:02:10.890 --> 04:02:11.220
You are

2296
04:02:13.740 --> 04:02:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the decisions.

2297
04:02:15.060 --> 04:02:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For anybody out

2298
04:02:16.230 --> 04:02:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no

2299
04:02:18.690 --> 04:02:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're correcting it right now you're repairing it but really sit with accountability. This is

2300
04:02:25.860 --> 04:02:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Great critical

2301
04:02:27.570 --> 04:02:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This accountability stuff.

2302
04:02:29.040 --> 04:02:29.580
iPhone: So what

2303
04:02:29.790 --> 04:02:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I show you what what wouldn't work.

2304
04:02:32.310 --> 04:02:33.030
There'd be no account.

2305
04:02:34.890 --> 04:02:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, this is all holy that could be one. I wouldn't know because I can't hold you accountable.

2306
04:02:41.820 --> 04:02:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have a PO that I can call, you're not going to court next month. Can't do anything or you're not. I don't have an arm to reach out and check it.

2307
04:02:53.370 --> 04:02:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You have your word.

2308
04:02:56.430 --> 04:02:58.320
iPhone: That's it. Huh.

2309
04:03:01.980 --> 04:03:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you say she's onto something. And if inside right now the addict inside of you is screaming bloody murder do another don't say anything.

2310
04:03:15.930 --> 04:03:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Any promises. Don't do it to shush, if that's what's happening around transparency and accountability.

2311
04:03:26.040 --> 04:03:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I say to you, well, asked Chris if he doesn't mind kind of sharing some some of his an Anon, anon, And commonality.

2312
04:03:35.610 --> 04:03:36.060
iPhone: And

2313
04:03:36.150 --> 04:03:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can actually talk with them and

2314
04:03:39.870 --> 04:03:42.330
iPhone: Walk with Him. Yeah, I could do that.

2315
04:03:43.680 --> 04:03:44.970
iPhone: Because I really would do that.

2316
04:03:45.120 --> 04:03:48.330
iPhone: I'm willing to do anything to keep me sober. I'm sick of

2317
04:03:48.420 --> 04:03:51.240
iPhone: Relaxing I'm really willing to do whatever

2318
04:03:51.600 --> 04:03:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well that's great because I would like to. I'm not a I'm not a disclosure, which means a fairly conservative with your information.

2319
04:04:01.680 --> 04:04:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharing on my side, but there would be

2320
04:04:04.410 --> 04:04:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You really Sunday night.

2321
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:07.290
iPhone: And I'm going to

2322
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: weave it into treatment plan.

2323
04:04:10.080 --> 04:04:12.810
And we would have an integral part of the team.

2324
04:04:13.980 --> 04:04:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That could add

2325
04:04:15.780 --> 04:04:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: One more thing. I'm like it all the way through this

2326
04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Book take you to coffee. I can't do that. I can't do that. Even if you work down the street. That's the thing, right, a therapeutic relationship. You can't just do drive over here. Now let's have dinner.

2327
04:04:31.560 --> 04:04:33.240
iPhone: I can't do that. I can't

2328
04:04:33.480 --> 04:04:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: See the stretch the arm the pole.

2329
04:04:35.190 --> 04:04:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom chances to can

2330
04:04:36.450 --> 04:04:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sponsor can friend can't, I can't do that. All I can do is be your little cheerleader and say call a friend.

2331
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.500
Yeah.

2332
04:04:44.760 --> 04:04:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Any much

2333
04:04:50.520 --> 04:04:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Has he been going. I'm not wonderful hair like he's a hot mess like

2334
04:04:55.260 --> 04:04:58.590
iPhone: vital role like that. Yeah, guess what, guess what.

2335
04:04:59.280 --> 04:05:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Come here. Yeah.

2336
04:05:00.810 --> 04:05:03.180
iPhone: My mom I have ROI for her, but this is my mom.

2337
04:05:04.530 --> 04:05:05.370
iPhone: This is when

2338
04:05:06.510 --> 04:05:08.130
iPhone: I was just telling her about Chris

2339
04:05:09.060 --> 04:05:09.540
Your

2340
04:05:10.620 --> 04:05:21.330
iPhone: Answer is yes and shoes I celebrate recovery. Do you think Chris would sign an ROI. So that Chris can talk to her, though, I think I would be willing, I just, I just have

2341
04:05:23.400 --> 04:05:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your is your name, surely.

2342
04:05:25.350 --> 04:05:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Shelley Shelley Shelley, I am one of your. It's very nice to meet you.

2343
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:31.800
iPhone: Nice to meet you.

2344
04:05:32.100 --> 04:05:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for caring so much about your son. I'm just, I'm so privileged to be working with him.

2345
04:05:38.370 --> 04:05:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Really and truly

2346
04:05:39.930 --> 04:05:43.470
iPhone: Thank you for helping and and being there to talk with him.

2347
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know there's been some mixed information coming your way.

2348
04:05:49.980 --> 04:05:56.310
iPhone: I told her that I overthink it all and I was just trying to blame it all on her, as Mr catastrophic thinker right here.

2349
04:05:58.680 --> 04:06:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're here, we can make the most of it. Is there anything you want to know. Any questions you

2350
04:06:05.460 --> 04:06:14.190
iPhone: Know, I mean, I just want to know that he's on the right track. And then he's, you know, taking care of what he needs to be taken care of and and

2351
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:33.150
iPhone: And it's very imperative to me that he gets you know hooked up with this. Celebrate Recovery and and that crispy his sponsor and I was just telling her about and do all that here. That's crazy. You walked in, because we were just talking about you. I can't do. I can't. No, I

2352
04:06:33.630 --> 04:06:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you know it's okay and excited about this gentleman, Chris.

2353
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what I'd rather not say what we were just talking about. You just did right, you just said, Maybe Chris would do this piece.

2354
04:06:52.920 --> 04:07:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, Trevor. Why don't you talk about how you could increase accountability to yourself to Chris to me to mom. Just think of one little stuff that you could do, which is scary, but it would increase transparency or would hold you accountable. What's something you could do just today.

2355
04:07:12.840 --> 04:07:19.830
iPhone: No, no, I mean other than her. Make sure that I meet with Chris, that's the only thing I can think of, or you make sure like

2356
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:23.700
iPhone: Just me making sure that I meet with him, you could

2357
04:07:24.900 --> 04:07:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask him.

2358
04:07:26.190 --> 04:07:28.050
iPhone: Yeah, yeah. I asked him about the ROI.

2359
04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You could say, hey, listen, I'm meeting with a therapist and you can you can tell them, she she she ain't gonna say anything about what I'm doing in treatment, but she's going to want to make sure I'm actually going on Wednesday and Sunday. She might check me

2360
04:07:46.380 --> 04:07:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. She might do that. Would you be willing to take a call from one of your she would just be asking, hey, as he connecting with you. She's not going to share anything

2361
04:07:56.160 --> 04:07:57.810
iPhone: Yeah yeah asked him for sure.

2362
04:07:58.800 --> 04:08:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And his real name is important. Only because this is a consent and it does need to actually be him like

2363
04:08:06.480 --> 04:08:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a big deal. And I want you to know if he says no, like, that makes sense because it's supposed to be anonymous

2364
04:08:14.160 --> 04:08:16.290

Gwenevere Abriel: How about we do this, Shelly, if you want to call him.

2388

04:10:12.900 --> 04:10:26.040
iPhone: Okay, well, I know the one Celebrate Recovery that Chris does take you days. And there's a the other one on Wednesday that I go to. But it's not Christmas but Christmas is on Sunday night, but I'm going to be going to both of them.

2395
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday and Sunday.

2396
04:10:28.050 --> 04:10:28.590
Yes.

2397
04:10:29.610 --> 04:10:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember when I was telling you about the the text and the cell phone. So it's the same there too. So she you, Shelly, you

2398
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: With me and my my cell phone. I love it. But this is my personal cell.

2399
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:47.880
iPhone: Professional. Okay.

2400
04:10:48.270 --> 04:10:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I do is I schedule appointments with clients.

2401
04:10:52.650 --> 04:10:52.980
And

2402
04:10:54.240 --> 04:11:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If they can't make it. I think I rescheduled like rearrange them and I give I give clients, the ability to send me

2403
04:11:03.300 --> 04:11:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, or I relapsed or whatever they can send me the

2404
04:11:07.320 --> 04:11:07.770
iPhone: Message.

2405
04:11:07.950 --> 04:11:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That they're not suffering alone. That's kind of my philosophy. But the problem is what I send back. I don't do therapy in text I send messages feel for a client, maybe even do

2406
04:11:22.020 --> 04:11:22.470
iPhone: Right.

2407
04:11:22.860 --> 04:11:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel cold.

2408
04:11:25.020 --> 04:11:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Confusing. But the invitation as quickly as possible, either get on the phone if I'm not already in session or get in here.

2409
04:11:33.780 --> 04:11:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Into zoom

2410
04:11:35.250 --> 04:11:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when like humans, when we're in distress, and we don't get it. Everything's gonna be okay. You know, we don't get that back. It can add to the distress, and that might have been what happened and I don't want it to happen to us too.

2411
04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:50.250
Okay.

2412
04:11:51.390 --> 04:11:59.190

2413
04:11:59.850 --> 04:12:00.960
iPhone: Talking about it on the phone.

2414
04:12:00.960 --> 04:12:02.340
iPhone: Is what she's saying, no, that's fine.

2415
04:12:03.930 --> 04:12:07.560
iPhone: I'll do it over textual to have to call her. She said, I understand. Okay.

2416
04:12:08.010 --> 04:12:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's to protect him. It's, it's

2417
04:12:11.280 --> 04:12:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A special place.

2418
04:12:14.970 --> 04:12:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That stigma of

2419
04:12:17.700 --> 04:12:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you can

2420
04:12:19.980 --> 04:12:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Important. I can't risk it. I don't know if someone else picked up the phone, I don't know your number. I don't know. I don't

2421
04:12:26.100 --> 04:12:26.820
Know, I don't get

2422
04:12:28.320 --> 04:12:29.130
iPhone: To touch.

2423
04:12:30.360 --> 04:12:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can send me whatever you want.

2424
04:12:33.840 --> 04:12:34.200
Okay.

2425
04:12:35.820 --> 04:12:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I can. I'm part of this sort of team of accountability and I can maybe carefully. Bring it on, and say, Hey, I got this message. And if I start to sense clinically that some some family stuff going on. Would you ever be interested in us sitting down and eating as a family just

2426
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.980
Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: Now you have a face, and you see I'm not an over. I'm not

2445
04:14:41.880 --> 04:14:50.670
iPhone: That's what I'm Sam I just the the gratitude of having her and Chris and all to celebrate Passover and the just the thought of me being able to

2446
04:14:51.570 --> 04:14:59.760
iPhone: Because I remember how nice it was to go to meetings and be around all those people. Those like minded people. I'm just excited for to go do that. You know what I mean. I just never

2447
04:15:00.810 --> 04:15:08.820
iPhone: Never really haven't had hoping a lot in a while is all say that that's what I got back, I guess is the hope so.

2448
04:15:08.850 --> 04:15:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you something. It isn't that Celebrate Recovery was just invented. See what you were doing to minimize your access to this resource or this month.

2449
04:15:19.440 --> 04:15:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Was right there.

2450
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom had that Chris was there, Ashley was there.

2451
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:28.020
iPhone: Not get access

2452
04:15:28.110 --> 04:15:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To that resource.

2453
04:15:30.720 --> 04:15:38.760
iPhone: Putting work first blaming or I just, I wasn't putting my sobriety. First, which I know from my past will never work.

2454
04:15:40.260 --> 04:15:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a hard thing to be in. It's going to come right back at you, you're going to go, but I need my stuff. I need to help my mom. It's going to come back and you're going to have to work hard to hold on to.

2455
04:15:52.080 --> 04:15:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it all falls apart when I don't fit recovery first

2456
04:15:57.900 --> 04:15:59.520
iPhone: It's going to try and hook the card.

2457
04:16:02.850 --> 04:16:12.180
iPhone: But I feel like as long as I stay connected and it stays fresh on my mind. The more I am aware of how important it is

2458
04:16:13.470 --> 04:16:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, if you can identify what's fresh on your mind needs to be fresh.

2459
04:16:20.310 --> 04:16:21.900
iPhone: What's fresh on my mind right now.

2460
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It needs to be fresh in my mind. What is it that has to stay fresh on your mind.

2461
04:16:29.220 --> 04:16:32.040
iPhone: Really want that my recovery has to come first.

2462
04:16:32.760 --> 04:16:33.630
iPhone: Or anything

2463
04:16:34.170 --> 04:16:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: stay fresh

2464
04:16:38.580 --> 04:16:46.860
iPhone: That's the thing. That's what I'm that's what, that's the thing that the dome. The thing that I can only think of is saying so immersed in it, reading a book just, I mean,

2465
04:16:47.460 --> 04:16:57.600
iPhone: I need to get back into that is three my book all the time like I used to know and start helping people helping going through the steps, my step work is the biggest thing really

2466
04:16:58.080 --> 04:17:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell you what it looks like. Out here, you know, the way it stays fresh

2467
04:17:03.390 --> 04:17:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You fuck up.

2468
04:17:06.180 --> 04:17:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You keep doing that this month has been a what them but

2469
04:17:10.530 --> 04:17:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like slamming you're having to go to that other end to finally persuade yourself. You've got to put it first. So I got concerned when you said, I gotta keep it fresh. So all of a sudden they had this thing. I was like, oh my god.

2470
04:17:23.190 --> 04:17:23.220
iPhone: I

2471
04:17:24.000 --> 04:17:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta go use in order to remind himself that he has put recovery. First, how many more times you have to do that. So when you say you're going to

2472
04:17:36.660 --> 04:17:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Check.

2473
04:17:39.420 --> 04:17:55.680
iPhone: No, that's why I did that, I want the accountability. I'm willing to do it all. I'm sick of putting my family through hell myself to hell. I'm sick of having to go through that. I don't want to do it anymore. That's why I'm trying to, like you said, Get as much accountability as possible.

2474
04:17:57.120 --> 04:17:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So once that's settled in

2475
04:18:01.980 --> 04:18:02.430
iPhone: Important to be

2476
04:18:03.480 --> 04:18:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: scary moments for you. Are you understand

2477
04:18:08.610 --> 04:18:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be quiet going to be like this low

2478
04:18:13.500 --> 04:18:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to have time to be doing some therapeutic interventions together. We've had so much up and down, you've got chaos going we haven't been able to do the psychotherapy. Yes, of course. It's all grist for the mill. Of course. Of course. Of course.

2479
04:18:28.980 --> 04:18:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But not addressing the elemental trauma not grief response. Not that needs sitting cap off eyes closed meditative state focus on the breath, and you do maybe end our inner child work.

2480
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we can't do that while we're trying to figure out who's

2481
04:18:53.010 --> 04:18:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

2482
04:18:54.540 --> 04:18:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Not to minimize how important it is because

2483
04:18:58.380 --> 04:19:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll tell me what this was, like, you know, what was it like

2484
04:19:02.640 --> 04:19:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To show up here today and have this experience, why it matters that this event, it'll probably mean

2485
04:19:11.370 --> 04:19:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be closer

2486
04:19:12.960 --> 04:19:13.320
Yeah.

2487
04:19:17.310 --> 04:19:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That you really can

2488
04:19:19.530 --> 04:19:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can really tell me how important it is

2489
04:19:23.010 --> 04:19:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I do wish I remember there was a sense of urgency and I

2490
04:19:29.640 --> 04:19:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Could I should I have been like that with me that night with that have made it

2491
04:19:36.960 --> 04:19:45.090
iPhone: I think that would have just I think I needed to go through what I went through that that that two day waiting of me having to figure out in my own head that I was tripping.

2492
04:19:45.930 --> 04:19:53.940
iPhone: That I think I needed to what you did. I mean, I think you did. Right. I just fucked up. I think I needed to go through that because

2493
04:19:54.840 --> 04:20:02.580
iPhone: I don't think I would have woke up as with that gratefulness this morning. If I didn't. I don't think I would have realized how grateful I really was that I was tripping out

2494
04:20:03.660 --> 04:20:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: About you reached out to me before like

2495
04:20:07.860 --> 04:20:12.750
iPhone: Oh yeah, last week, last Friday night. Yeah. Thursday night.

2496
04:20:17.220 --> 04:20:19.050
iPhone: That was two days before relapse.

2497
04:20:19.980 --> 04:20:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How could I could I have made a difference. If I had met with you in the evening or something because I'm pretty sure I said how about now and you are at work or something and then

2498
04:20:28.350 --> 04:20:32.340
iPhone: We couldn't. Honestly, I don't know. I didn't realize it until two days after that.

2499
04:20:32.910 --> 04:20:37.620
iPhone: I don't know. I don't know. I think the reason I wanted to meet with you right there was

2500
04:20:39.150 --> 04:20:42.570
iPhone: Some stuff was going on, like with work and my and my little brother.

2501

2508
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:37.320
iPhone: Well, after I took the pain pills. My whole mindset changed and told me, Well, no, you could take it again in the morning and again tomorrow night.

2509
04:21:37.890 --> 04:21:51.300

04:23:09.300 --> 04:23:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So just notice that you're quite skilled

2527
04:23:15.210 --> 04:23:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're really good. Meaning the addict I talking about that right now. I'm addressing that asshole.

2528
04:23:22.230 --> 04:23:22.500
iPhone: You're

Gwenevere Abriel: smarter than me and you all

2530
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you will. You're smarter than me. I have figured out a long time ago because I used to come at all these angles.

2531
04:23:36.810 --> 04:23:37.080
Even

2532
04:23:39.270 --> 04:23:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll still outsmart sorry that's the case, it'll end up being

2533
04:23:45.600 --> 04:23:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Your authentic self that will set you straight

2534
04:23:49.440 --> 04:23:49.770

04:24:03.690 --> 04:24:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you've got a smartphone.

2538
04:24:07.260 --> 04:24:07.620
Sorry.

2539
04:24:12.240 --> 04:24:15.000
iPhone: Yeah, it's tricky it sneaks up on me on

2540
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:17.460
iPhone: That

2541
04:24:19.980 --> 04:24:25.980
iPhone: Don't know why it seems like once I get the idea in my head that I'm going to do it. It's like there's just no

2542
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Once it's in

2543
04:24:28.800 --> 04:24:39.630
iPhone: You've already done. I don't know how to stop that idea other than staying. The only thing that's ever stopped that idea from coming into my head was me doing that step work the right way like fully

2544
04:24:40.380 --> 04:24:44.970
iPhone: That's why I'm trying to get back into it because in the past. That's the only thing that's kept me sober for

2545
04:24:46.590 --> 04:25:00.660
iPhone: For I mean long periods of times with, you know, not even thinking of relaxing, or that thought never coming or even having that thought come and me being able to call somebody, but that was because I was doing step work.

2546
04:25:01.290 --> 04:25:11.520
iPhone: And I was, and that's what I meant by keeping it fresh. That's why, how, I kept it fresh. In the past was going to meetings all the time and just staying immersed in a community.

2547
04:25:13.110 --> 04:25:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been informing

2548
04:25:16.050 --> 04:25:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: On that and it was you are identifying the resources aren't there one and that we could add that to the list too, by the way.

2549
04:25:22.410 --> 04:25:22.800
Yeah.

2550
04:25:24.240 --> 04:25:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm saying. You're good that the addict is just better than me and I'm humbled by it but but it's sad because it right, you're

2551
04:25:35.700 --> 04:25:36.450
iPhone: hurting me.

2552
04:25:44.190 --> 04:25:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That Chris

2553
04:25:48.180 --> 04:25:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Paul out the addict can call them out when he shows up, and he's the one

2554
04:25:53.280 --> 04:25:53.550
That's

2555
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:59.700
iPhone: Yeah. Well, he was a 15 year drug addict. He's been sober for seven so

2556
04:26:00.930 --> 04:26:03.750
iPhone: He knows his He'll. He'll be able to call my bullshit. I think

2557
04:26:04.740 --> 04:26:14.010
iPhone: Because my mom and my mom's been around, she met my last sponsor and he was a real abrasive. That's the kind of sponsor. I like to have the real abrasive. You know, like

2558
04:26:15.120 --> 04:26:25.560
iPhone: I mean, yeah, that will show up at my door. That's the kind and apparently that's how this guy is so that's why my mom and but like I said, I've never

2559
04:26:26.280 --> 04:26:34.890
iPhone: I also think another reason why I've been slipping a relapse and whatever is because I haven't had hope and my plan like I haven't

2560
04:26:35.310 --> 04:26:47.310
iPhone: This is the first time I've had hope. And what I'm about to do, or that it's going to work. I've never believed it was going to work any other time. That's why because I was in Clovis I was telling myself I'm I can't do it. I was just making excuses.

2561
04:26:48.600 --> 04:26:48.870
iPhone: Yeah.

2562
04:26:51.150 --> 04:26:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the level of honesty that needs to be here. Not saying something to this lady wants to be there.

2563
04:26:59.400 --> 04:27:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I know I look like a puff, but I'd rather hear this won't work either. This is a waste of my time. I don't need smoke up my, I don't need it.

2564
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:14.010
No.

2565
04:27:17.640 --> 04:27:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I also won't show up on your doorstep. I won't call you out the

2566
04:27:23.880 --> 04:27:25.710
iPhone: Way simple skill, it's

2567
04:27:26.610 --> 04:27:28.440
iPhone: Not my style. I

2568
04:27:28.740 --> 04:27:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I guess, drive somewhere in there like I'm in there somewhere. But I'm still kind of a softy I still I still want to maintain this space that you can come back to

2569
04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately, I'm not judging you. So I picked out a lot.

2570
04:27:44.880 --> 04:27:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to know that you can come back.

2571
04:27:47.520 --> 04:27:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: If you slip. Relax, even if

2572
04:27:51.660 --> 04:27:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gone for six months from come back.

2573
04:27:55.170 --> 04:27:56.280
I really want you to know.

2574
04:27:58.260 --> 04:27:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you want.

2575
04:28:00.150 --> 04:28:00.810
iPhone: Someone who

2576
04:28:01.380 --> 04:28:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't leave that you want this really strong thing, which sounds very familiar as your father, by the way.

2577
04:28:12.300 --> 04:28:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Not hear that, but I won't be it.

2578
04:28:17.130 --> 04:28:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Being a sort of jello thing that was touchy feely, blah blah blah, some good things are going to happen. But we've got to show up for therapy. This is the medicine.

2579
04:28:27.840 --> 04:28:28.350
Yes.

2580
04:28:30.390 --> 04:28:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to talk about it. Your one of your excuses right has been money. One of them has been I got to work. I'm going to lose my job. I'm sick. I can't. I got a migraine and so

2581
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to put before recovery. First you put your money where your mouth is. I hate to say it, like, no.

2582
04:28:53.790 --> 04:29:01.500
iPhone: I'll tell you right now. All that was bullshit. I'll be honest with you right now, all of it, except for the migraine, one and all the rest were bullshit.

2583
04:29:01.800 --> 04:29:12.630
iPhone: But will the money thing too, but the money thing I really can't afford more than one a week, but I did just get this new medical benefits card. So I'm able to do

2584
04:29:13.650 --> 04:29:16.440
iPhone: I can, I can do a therapy and a group now in a week.

2585
04:29:17.640 --> 04:29:18.930
iPhone: Well then I need to

2586
04:29:19.620 --> 04:29:33.480
iPhone: You know, and I need. That's why I said I need to. That's why my mom helped me get the benefits card because I told her I would rather because I really enjoy the groups, but I really enjoyed this too. And I'm tired of waiting a week to do it all. Yeah.

2587
04:29:33.540 --> 04:29:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got to just say, is it working right now if we just step back and this is anybody. It's not you, it's anybody, we have to look and say,

2588
04:29:43.500 --> 04:29:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: If treatments designed to help someone not relapse, you have had to less than 30 days and another one around the 14th. I don't know, only you and God knows. So, but my point is

2589
04:29:58.980 --> 04:29:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It, that's too.

2590
04:30:01.680 --> 04:30:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So something's not working. Either you're not ingesting the medicine, which is this you're not

2591
04:30:07.860 --> 04:30:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting the right doses.

2592
04:30:11.220 --> 04:30:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the wrong type of medicine which makes me think about particular interventions that we're doing. If we're constantly putting out fires for putting on band aids and just switching it up. We don't get to

2593
04:30:25.290 --> 04:30:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Have fun. It's chill.

2594
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes together right

2595
04:30:32.580 --> 04:30:32.970

iPhone: Sorry about that. Hold on for just a second.

2601
04:30:51.330 --> 04:31:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that you like the 12 O'clock group because that's a day. You have off. Okay. But I want to tell you open your mind up just a little bit.

2603
04:31:14.490 --> 04:31:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if you're putting your recovery. First, if it meant. Look what you've been doing, you've been missing work. So I don't want to really hear

2604
04:31:23.220 --> 04:31:23.850
iPhone: I can't hear.

2605
04:31:25.110 --> 04:31:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Addiction has made you miss work not therapy, no offense, but therapy has not making this work.

2606
04:31:32.820 --> 04:31:34.680
iPhone: Yeah, Thursday at 11

04:31:37.020 --> 04:31:39.210

2608
04:31:40.980 --> 04:31:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: These folks were doing process groups, which means we're talking

2609
04:31:45.960 --> 04:31:47.700
iPhone: I thought you're talking about therapy.

2610
04:31:48.060 --> 04:31:51.030
iPhone: So am I not going to the same group that I was going through on Friday.

2614
04:31:57.630 --> 04:32:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it as far as I'm concerned, can change as the need changes, but right now for 30 days, I would like you to commit to attending weekly individual therapy and a weekly group.

2615
04:32:13.440 --> 04:32:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, going to carve that out if our individual therapy isn't where you're at home.

Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the deal.

2638
04:34:18.450 --> 04:34:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: She is a physician, it's not her responsibility to be

2639
04:34:21.600 --> 04:34:22.140
Mindful

2640
04:34:24.750 --> 04:34:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: He does things that I don't particularly like she starts talking about herself. She'll talk. She's more therapeutic. She also. She not only is she a doctor scalable shipped on the degrees.

2641
04:34:35.940 --> 04:34:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: She's also got herself a counseling degree. And so she does that sometimes. So again, up in your biz. Okay.

2642
04:34:43.950 --> 04:34:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And outsider lane, which is medicine. That's okay. But if she starts to talk about her daughter.

2643
04:34:52.650 --> 04:34:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to see me go. What, uh huh.

2644
04:34:56.280 --> 04:35:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I protect everyone I protect her. I protect you and protect not so much me, but it's not her right to tell a story about her daughter when I'm the daughter, but she doesn't have to pay attention to.

2645
04:35:09.900 --> 04:35:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Her role really just offer, you're going to see me protecting it sometimes

2646
04:35:14.550 --> 04:35:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't see you won't see it very often because she knows she's been doing this couple years with me, and she knows I'm rigid

2647
04:35:23.760 --> 04:35:31.140
iPhone: Okay and so well she she knows I'm taking the three eight choose a day it'll stay the same, right. Like, I won't

2648
04:35:31.500 --> 04:35:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me offer some visual reassurance to you. Okay, I'm going to show you what she's gonna see so you can see it to you can see your own i think i think the docs have more access than I do, but I'm going to show you

2649
04:35:45.480 --> 04:35:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: share my screen with you. So this isn't a program called karaoke. And this is see the blue.

2650
04:35:52.890 --> 04:35:54.060
iPhone: Yeah, okay.

2651
04:35:54.540 --> 04:36:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like he gave you. On February 21 21 films didn't give you a refill. You can see Chris Solomon there looks like he was setting in at 24 milligrams. Okay.

2652
04:36:07.170 --> 04:36:08.790
iPhone: Yeah. Does that

2653
04:36:08.820 --> 04:36:18.630
iPhone: Help. Yeah, no, I'm at a perfect dose right now. That's where I was, I was just making sure it was going to stay the same, like, because I'm switching doctors, I didn't. I was just wondering if

2654
04:36:19.200 --> 04:36:20.370
iPhone: It's kind of like

2655
04:36:20.580 --> 04:36:23.130
iPhone: Start me back at the bottom or something, I don't know.

2656
04:36:24.180 --> 04:36:26.160
iPhone: Okay, that's all I was making sure

2657
04:36:26.970 --> 04:36:27.240
All

2658
04:36:28.920 --> 04:36:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: has adopted an approach that Dr. Aubrey L and I started, which is

2659
04:36:35.130 --> 04:36:35.460
OK.

2660
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:43.470
Clients long term goal.

2661
04:36:44.610 --> 04:36:45.180
iPhone: On down

2662
04:36:45.810 --> 04:36:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's where we're at.

2663
04:36:52.500 --> 04:36:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you're on your way to it. Here's the deal. I have another screen.

2664
04:36:59.910 --> 04:37:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show it to you now. And this is the one that has to do with the accountability part

2665
04:37:07.980 --> 04:37:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a behavior contract. Okay, so we're going to read it together. I just need to do one little thing here, and you can not agree to it, but I think it's very reasonable. It's stuff you're already doing okay.

2666
04:37:31.980 --> 04:37:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: More so I'm going to talk fast. I'm going to tell

2667
04:37:34.350 --> 04:37:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You this

2668
04:37:36.690 --> 04:37:37.080
To you.

2669
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And

2670
04:37:44.760 --> 04:37:45.810
That would be equivalent

2671
04:37:48.360 --> 04:37:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what I'm hoping will happen.

2672
04:37:51.300 --> 04:37:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: My hope is

2673
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That for the next 30 days you will commit to doing something

2674
04:38:00.690 --> 04:38:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you're already doing.

2675
04:38:03.060 --> 04:38:05.310
iPhone: But not with fidelity.

2676
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's basically saying, I will attend individual therapy 16 minutes, no less than, we'll just put once a week. Okay.

2677
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Once per week over the next 30 days. That means I don't DIP, an hour, you can, you know, might be 50 might be 15 minutes. That's okay. But, but all I'm I'm only here for 30 I've got a tummy ache. That's not going to cover it.

2678
04:38:26.520 --> 04:38:27.870
iPhone: Or don't you. All right.

2679
04:38:28.110 --> 04:38:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, once per week. OK, I will listen, I will text call or email my therapist, no less than 24 hours before scheduled appointment to cancel because I can't book anyone

2680
04:38:38.400 --> 04:38:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's fair. I will arrive no later than five minutes past the hour have a schedule appointment unless that that's on on me where I say, Oh, I'm running late. Obviously, then that's on me and you can show up whenever I'm encouraging.

2681
04:38:50.490 --> 04:39:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, of course, we'll make sure you have enough time for your session, I will text call or email my therapist experiencing continued anxiety, guilt, depression, anger, other intruding psychological and emotional states that means you're upset.

2682
04:39:04.770 --> 04:39:05.250
iPhone: You let me

2683
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know. And you're pretty good at that. I will identify how my substance use. This will be in session. I will identify how my substance use all mood mood altering including THC substances are counterproductive.

2684
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This means verbalizing how all of them are counterproductive to my recovery. I will identify the psycho social environmental

2685
04:39:25.800 --> 04:39:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Factors that support my long term recovery. So we'll talk about those. I will identify barriers. Those psychological and physical to contribute to unmet obligations.

2686
04:39:35.010 --> 04:39:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll get into that. It's a pretty typical conversation with me, I will complete homework assignments. Those are my invitations. Hey,

Gwenevere Abriel: Three times a week. Do this go here. What do you think, you know, join join some sort of hobby thing or whatever they should actually give it a try. Okay.

04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:05.130

2690
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:06.690
