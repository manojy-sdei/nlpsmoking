15
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.300

16
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.000
Nicki Cummings: Okay, no.

17
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.220

19
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.880
Nicki Cummings: But I'm not 100% sure like

20
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:44.550
Nicki Cummings: I don't know the exact first date of my period. I know like i where i was during one day of it. So I just told them that day and I put it like in with his birth calculators, so

21
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.480
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

22
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.130
Nicki Cummings: It says I'm five weeks so

25
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.120
Okay.

26
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.030
Magalie Marcellus: So how you feel in the overall

27
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:18.330
Nicki Cummings: I'm feeling pretty good. And then I've been waiting for contacts to get covered concert $800 or 798. And I guess my insurance wasn't covering them and then so I can get my driver's license and get a job. And, you know, start getting my life back together and

28
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.950
Nicki Cummings: I'm I finally found an organization that would come from. And they're like, well, usually if you yourself that patient calls the insurance.

29
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.480
Nicki Cummings: Then they'll cover and it's just a matter of you calling them. And so the doctors, so they know that you know this is urgent, you do need this.

30
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.760
Magalie Marcellus: House. All right.

31
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:47.760
Nicki Cummings: Okay, so they said they would cover it. But then now I haven't heard from the doctor's office in a week. So I'm going to call them tomorrow, like, you know, just making sure everything's okay and insurance went through, because if not the other organization will pay for them.

32
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.480
You know,

33
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.460
Nicki Cummings: To get this going.

34
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.270
Magalie Marcellus: OK, so now your glasses.

35
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.350
Nicki Cummings: Um, I don't have any glasses right now. They were broken and my insurance only pay for one pair a year.

36
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.100
Nicki Cummings: Yeah.

37
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.940
Magalie Marcellus: Like, oh wow

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.610
Nicki Cummings: Okay, that's fair was not fixable.

39
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.590
Nicki Cummings: No. Um, but the my eyesight is really bad. I see without correction.

40
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.830
Nicki Cummings: That's what they say. I think I can see better than that.

41
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.730
Nicki Cummings: Like depending on where I'm at, like, close up if I haven't close enough to my face. I can usually see and read everything

42
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.840
Nicki Cummings: Far ways a

43
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:39.780
Nicki Cummings: Bigger thing for me. But with glasses. The closest I've ever gotten me corrected is 2040 which still is a restricted daytime only driving license, which is fine if I had glasses. Still, and could take the test, but

44
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.570
Nicki Cummings: My contacts that the lady fit me into she got me seeing 2025

45
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.370
Nicki Cummings: It was the best

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.890
Magalie Marcellus: Contacts. Yeah. Wow.

47
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.320
Nicki Cummings: Yeah, they're called squirrels.

48
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.660
Nicki Cummings: And I guess it over.

49
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.690
Nicki Cummings: Your cornea instead of sitting right on your pupil, so they're able to correct your vision, a lot more

50
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.750
Nicki Cummings: So yeah, she said, when we get yours that actually fit your eyes, and will you might even see 2020

51
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.010
Magalie Marcellus: So is it like a some type of disposable contact is

52
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.640
Nicki Cummings: Made. It's a special made contact the last a year.

53
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.710
Magalie Marcellus: Oh,

54
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.620
Magalie Marcellus: Man, that's good to know.

55
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.240
Magalie Marcellus: So right now, so how are you, adjusting you know without those glasses or some kind of visions assistant

56
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.300
Nicki Cummings: I'm sorry I'm used to it.

57
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:39.870
Magalie Marcellus: Are you okay so you're able to do you know whatever functions, you need to get them outside of your house travel and all these things all

58
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.370
Nicki Cummings: Right. Well, I don't have a license right now i got i don't VI, a year and a half ago because I had about a

59
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.670
Nicki Cummings: Public Defender that just basically talked me into pleading guilty because she scared me.

60
00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.650
Nicki Cummings: But I was on Adderall, because I have narcolepsy, and the state of, well, instead I had too much in my system for the state of Ohio.

61
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.810
Nicki Cummings: And she's like, well, if people are guilty, they're going to give you your whole sentence. But if you plead not guilty, you'll get the least amount of time and blah, blah, blah. And

62
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.680
Nicki Cummings: You know she

63
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.650
Nicki Cummings: Basically just made it sound like the thing I should do because she's like if you plead guilty and they don't want to get a specialist, you're going to get the maximum time

64
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.620
Nicki Cummings: Well, if I I found out via to plead guilty, they would have had to have get a specialist to see like this is what she is.

65
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.200
Nicki Cummings: Prescribing. This is how it should show up in her system.

66
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.990
Nicki Cummings: Hmm. So yeah, I got

67
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.150
Nicki Cummings: But I mean, it was like

68
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.000
Nicki Cummings: My first court and I was scared and she

69
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.300
Magalie Marcellus: So why was the

70
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.540
Magalie Marcellus: Consequence for pleading guilty on that.

71
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.320
Nicki Cummings: Well, what did you have a suspended my license for a year, I have to have

72
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.020
Nicki Cummings: As our 22 bond until 2022

73
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.380
Nicki Cummings: I was on probation for a year.

74
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.630
Magalie Marcellus: Oh wow, okay.

75
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.900
Nicki Cummings: Yeah.

76
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.680
Magalie Marcellus: Are you getting closer to get him back, which are license and all that. Now,

77
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.600

78
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.870
Nicki Cummings: Yep, that's all I need. I got the fines paid off so

79
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.260
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, good for you at least you're on the way now.

80
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.640
Magalie Marcellus: Getting

81
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.780
Magalie Marcellus: Your license back

82
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.830
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, right. So what you've been doing with yourself. I know the last those the incident, there was

83
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:28.890
Magalie Marcellus: Just trying to review what happened with the prescriptions that you were feeling having some difficulty and you were taking some of those skills.

84
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.640
Magalie Marcellus: To help you a little bit more than

85
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.640
Nicki Cummings: A little bit, yes.

86
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.810
And

87
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.400
Nicki Cummings: I shouldn't have did it and I mean I just

88
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.160
Nicki Cummings: I don't know. I was overwhelmed and just having cravings and I think

89
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.790
Nicki Cummings: A lot had to do with it with my hormones changing. I didn't

90
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.330
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

91
00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:07.290
Nicki Cummings: I don't know exactly what and then everything just going on in my life. I know I don't have custody of my other kids right now because of the whole narcolepsy situation. Children Services way for me so

92
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:16.410
Nicki Cummings: I'm just everything kind of hits at once. Sometimes, and other times you know I can. I'm able to shuffle really good and then sometimes

93
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.990
Magalie Marcellus: I'm not okay and you know there's gonna be difficult days and you know

94
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:32.370
Magalie Marcellus: Better right so so the focus would be when those difficult days happen. How do we cope with them so it doesn't becomes, you know, even more.

95
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.690
Magalie Marcellus: Even more challenging for you to get out of it.

96
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.490
Magalie Marcellus: So how have you been able to cope. The past couple weeks since you know those incident happened.

97
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.840
Magalie Marcellus: What do you do

98
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.840
Magalie Marcellus: What, what are you doing to help you.

99
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.360
Nicki Cummings: I have breathing techniques. Learn from a counselor that you sit like

100
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.510
Nicki Cummings: In a quiet spot if you can, if you can't

101
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.730
Nicki Cummings: You just focus on one thing with your palms up and you inhale as much as you can.

102
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.310
Nicki Cummings: Wait a second. The next house, much as you can.

103
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:15.930
Nicki Cummings: And then just hold on that until you, you know, and you can actually feel it like I don't feel weird but like tingling down starts in your head and goes your nose like feels like the strength is like just

104
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.480
Magalie Marcellus: The stress. Okay.

105
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.930
Nicki Cummings: Right.

106
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.250
Magalie Marcellus: That's good. And you've been able to do some of those exercises.

107
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.480
Nicki Cummings: Yes. Okay. Okay. And I've also looked into

108
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:36.360
Nicki Cummings: Pregnancy Yo guys been doing that for the past I've been doing it for three days in a row now. I know it's not a lot, but I haven't known I was pregnant for that long.

109
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.460
I you

110
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.790
Magalie Marcellus: Know,

111
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.410
Nicki Cummings: I love babies. I love

112
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.250

00:09:50.820 --> 00:10:00.030
Magalie Marcellus: No. Oh, OK. OK. And now, you mentioned that Jamison, so should be aware and making sure that you were

117
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.050
Magalie Marcellus: On medication that is not going to be affecting anything

118
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:12.180
Magalie Marcellus: Because I know there's other people that are still under Suboxone while being pregnant. So I guess that would be monitored.

119
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.530
Nicki Cummings: I'm allergic to subby Suboxone so I'm on somebody text anyway.

120
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.830
Magalie Marcellus: So yeah, let's I usually switch. Gotcha. Okay. Okay.

121
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.250
Magalie Marcellus: That's good. So now what are you going

122
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.020
Nicki Cummings: With a thing. Yeah, please see you have something that's going to help you still manage

123
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:36.120
Magalie Marcellus: Rachel craving and thing. So what's the status with your children and things that were going on with that.

124
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.420
Nicki Cummings: They somehow my

125
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:44.910
Nicki Cummings: biological mother GOT CUSTODY OF THEM BECAUSE SHE'S MY FAMILY. But she's an alcoholic.

126
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:58.200
Nicki Cummings: I know she doesn't want them. She didn't take care of me should raise any for kids I raised my brothers, my kids every time I see them. They say mama doesn't want us there. Why do we have to live with her. I want to be with you, mommy. And I just tell them like

127
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:07.050
Nicki Cummings: You know, mommy doesn't have a house right now and I don't have a car. I have to get my stuff together while you with smokes. I'm not gonna tell my kids like you know your mama got you taken away from me.

128
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.520
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

129
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:21.060
Nicki Cummings: Because she said I was a drug addict and you know I had a sleeping disorder. So, you know, that would just hurt my heart. It's not going to help them. I'm not type person to bad mouth anyone so

130
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.760
Nicki Cummings: It's hard, and she is not wanting to give them up.

131
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:36.180
Nicki Cummings: She likes the benefits that she gets from she's gone to Hawaii every year when she gets her income tax backs and she's had my kid, which has been

132
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.710
Nicki Cummings: Two years but you shouldn't ever go to Hawaii before that.

133
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.860
Nicki Cummings: So, yeah.

134
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.800
Nicki Cummings: I'm gonna have to take her to court to get him back.

135
00:11:47.610 --> 00:12:00.780
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so that was gonna be my next question. Is there any open cases with it a child protective services to kind of work with you to get, you know, do whatever testing me to do in order for you to get them back or

136
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.690
Nicki Cummings: I did everything is supposed to the first time and the

137
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:09.780
Nicki Cummings: judge ruled against me because he said I wasn't married and I have narcolepsy, and he just doesn't see that working out in a good way.

138
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:25.770
Nicki Cummings: I did parenting classes. I went over the hoops through fire like my attorney cried she couldn't believe it, like she was in tears when he made the judgment call. SHE'S LIKE, SHE'S DONE EVERYTHING YOU'RE ON A she has not failed a drug test and a year and a half. She

139
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:32.280
Nicki Cummings: To drug tests a week. One of them is random. One of them's not. She's like, What else do you want her to do.

140
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:41.430
Nicki Cummings: And he's like, I just don't feel comfortable making the judgment call for those kids to go back to her when she has a medical condition and she's not married, and there's no one else the whole time.

141
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.090
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, but it isn't your medical condition being managed right now.

142
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.440
Nicki Cummings: Is was it. Yes, yes.

143
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.840
Nicki Cummings: And that's no it was managed

144
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.140
Nicki Cummings: It was managed in and they had all my doctors access

145
00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:03.990
Nicki Cummings: I allowed them to go to my doctor's office appointment with me. I love them any information they wanted from my doctor they talked to my doctor and private away from me. So

146
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:11.850
Nicki Cummings: And the children service lady said that I just had my doctor eating out the palm of my hand. I'm like, no, he feels bad for me because what you guys are putting me through

147
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.750
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

148
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.490
Nicki Cummings: You're taking my whole life away from me for a medical condition that I'm treating

149
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.980
Magalie Marcellus: And was there any arrangement being considered to be made for you to have visitation on a regular basis with the kids or

150
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.450
Nicki Cummings: The deadlift up

151
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.440
Nicki Cummings: To my mom's

152
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.360
Magalie Marcellus: This question.

153
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.410
Magalie Marcellus: Yes.

154
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:42.960
Nicki Cummings: Would you oh crap because she's like an amateur person she always has been. So, my kids are at the point now they're five and four years old, where they're going to school and

155
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:56.730
Nicki Cummings: I guess I know I work here at their daycare. I talked to her Ellen, which is my mother who has them does not talk to me like she will not respond text messages to me. She won't let me know about the doctor's appointments, anything that's going on in their life.

156
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.070
Nicki Cummings: So Amanda, which is this girl that

157
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:14.250
Nicki Cummings: Is the teacher at their daycare informs me on things everything she knows and my mom actually relies on her quite a bit more than should to watch my kids, which I think is weird, but I'm glad because I feel much better when they're with her than when they're with my mother.

158
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:22.980
Nicki Cummings: But she has actually sent me a lot of incriminating evidence against Ellen. So I have been like

159
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:33.120
Nicki Cummings: stockpiling evidence against her. So when I do take her to court. I have proof that she's still an active alcoholic. She's not taking care of them. She's relying on someone else.

160
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.320
Nicki Cummings: they've missed seven days of school. I've read all that down, you know, made

161
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:50.910
Nicki Cummings: Documentation of it. I'll get documentation on the school that they miss those days, and it's for no reason. It's just because she said she was sick and didn't come pick them up from my grandma's house. She knows I'm here taking care of them. But they're in kindergarten. Yeah.

162
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.480
Nicki Cummings: Miss school whenever she doesn't feel like coming to get them, you know,

163
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.990
Magalie Marcellus: And is there other adults in your at your mom's house you meant Ellen. Is that your mom.

164
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.910
Nicki Cummings: Yes, that's my mom.

165
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.230
Nicki Cummings: Okay, sorry.

167
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.200
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, I just want to clarify who your friends are so

Nicki Cummings: My kids live here.

180
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.610
Magalie Marcellus: Shows. So is it because you're having a space or other issues that they don't

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.760
Magalie Marcellus: Like, at least to have, you know, some type of interaction with the kids.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.610
Magalie Marcellus: Is right what is filling that okay

187
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.180
Magalie Marcellus: Because whatever your house. So you don't have, you know, the space or whatever stuff that's going

195
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:35.790
Nicki Cummings: Have been single and haven't had transportation or my license. I'm just not able to get it back. So I'm working all that

196
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.760
Nicki Cummings: But since is one thing pregnant.

197
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:45.720
Magalie Marcellus: You getting the license. Right, right. And you don't want, you need to make sure you're taking care of yourself to social with a pregnancy.

198
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:48.180
Magalie Marcellus: Now,

199
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.840
Nicki Cummings: No, I'm able to sign up for low income apartments, since I'm pregnant.

200
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.440
Nicki Cummings: So,

201
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.550
I mean,

202
00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.900
Nicki Cummings: I'm not using that as but it's his first step. I mean,

203
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.780
Magalie Marcellus: When was the last time you saw the kids.

204
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.090
Nicki Cummings: It's been two weeks now.

205
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.990
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. And how often will you allow to see them because I know you said you're

206
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.710
Nicki Cummings: Bringing them.

207
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.550
Magalie Marcellus: Whenever

208
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.020
Magalie Marcellus: It was bringing one so

209
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.670
Nicki Cummings: She was bringing them over every weekend but she hasn't brought them over the past two weekends.

210
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:36.480
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, and the she talked to your grandma has some separation with your grandma that she can, you know, find out what's going on. Why the kids and I hear and things like that.

211
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:52.230
Nicki Cummings: She's Ellen's amateurish is not colic. And my grandma just babies her and acts like she's 14 and is going to be helpless, the rest of her life. But, you know, she should have custody of my kids because she's her precious daughter. I don't know the whole thing is sick. The families twisted

212
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.700
Magalie Marcellus: So right now the focus is getting yourself together things together, then you can

213
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.940
Magalie Marcellus: Get a primary caretaker of NGO kids.

214
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.870
Yes. Yep.

215
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:15.630
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, well, you know, again, if, like, say, if there's any concern for the kids, safety, whatever they add you know this step, you would need to take to ensure that

216
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:30.660
Magalie Marcellus: You know with godless if the quite makes a determination in there's reason to suspect that the kids not in a safe environment. And there's always a need to take action when it comes to that.

217
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.600
Magalie Marcellus: Then what the agreement back to me.

218
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.100
Nicki Cummings: Or would they not let them have me of the meters and they were taken away from me.

219
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.290
Magalie Marcellus: Well, they'll, they'll still need to make sure that you would be the appropriate have the appropriate housing and

220
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:58.980
Magalie Marcellus: Be able to take care of them. But what I'm saying. Overall, just to make sure that yes there with Ellen, but they need to make sure that Ellen is the able to take care of them and have a safe environment for them as well.
