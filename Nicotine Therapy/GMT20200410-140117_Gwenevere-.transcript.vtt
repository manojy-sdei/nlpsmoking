Gwenevere Abriel: On zoom room complete mess.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.680
Magan: Oh,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.820
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I liked it. Everybody's been asking me that that's how I started. Don't let me tell you it tell you how it went. So what I did is very spontaneous so like I you know so bunch of people that don't know each other in there.

22
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm

23
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Common denominator, right. Really divergent. I mean just complete I like all kinds of people. Right. So I'm like, so I'm I get along with everybody.

24
00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, everybody ready just get along with the problem. So, and I'm watching and this my friday so I'm like, No, really, like, none of, like, you know, this is not working. So I shifted into sort of group facilitator.

25
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.600
Magan: Oh, no.

26
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I said, Yo, yo, this, this, this. Is this a working. Yo, and they know me. Right, so they know I'm a bossy, bitch. And so, um, I was all

27
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be our topic we're going to focus here and let's go. And so I threw it out there and then it was fine and we all just like, Ooh, you know, we talked about that. I'm going to move. So it was, um,

28
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It got pretty intense somehow religion and God got involved. I don't know how it was just

29
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my

30
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: God, I was like, What is going on here.

31
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.830
Magan: It's Friday.

32
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: On a Friday topic. Okay. I want to gossip. I want to like play if you guys can even make fun of me. I mean, everybody gossip about

33
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.700
Magan: Talk about somebody

34
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.970
Magan: Best no joke.

35
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway, I'm exaggerating, obviously. But that's kind of those are big pieces of it are true. It didn't work very smoothly, because there's really what you know, normally when you're sitting at a table to people talk here.

36
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then someone across the table listens and they might. Oh my gosh, me to chime in, but that flow and tele health and doesn't. We don't hear each other. We talk over each other really well I'm

37
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.270
Magan: Communications.

38
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Missing it's it's a flow.

39
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Of talking that can happen because of the limitations of the audio.

40
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.690
Magan: And it's just natural human interaction.

41
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's missing.

42
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.950
Magan: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So I jumped in their head. My, my, my one friend. She's a smarty pants very opinionated. She's a

44
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.190
Magan: Doctor those ones are fun.

45
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To get but she's. Yeah. Well, there's no doubt. She's just came in hot. I mean, like,

46
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients fits for you. And I was like,

47
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

48
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, I was like,

49
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like what you have

50
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.890
Magan: Calm down.

51
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, just like this is my zoom room.

52
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

53
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like okay

54
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she has some good points. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. But anyway, yeah, it was, it was interesting, but a good, it's a good idea. I just think I need to kind of format a little bit, you know, around a book club or something like

55
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: A little thing that we can all be focused on

56
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.380
Magan: Yeah, and it's

57
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.000
Magan: Oh, go ahead.

58
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you. What about you, have you been using this social platform at all to increase connection with

59
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.680
Magan: No, I am cutting myself off from the world very well.

60
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in it, you're like, Hey, great excuse

61
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.680
Magan: Me. Yes, away from me.

62
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.910
Magan: No reason to six feet motherfucker making tall. I don't care. It's great.

63
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I, some people are saying that they're like, I have no problem with this. I'm like, I don't want to talk to these people anyway.

64
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.700
Magan: Yeah, well. So I have a few instances that I think will be proud of me.

65
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

66
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:37.770
Magan: So this morning or last night I got an email from my boss, saying, I need to meet with you tomorrow. So I'm worrying about it all night, of course, but I kept practicing all night belly deep breathing.

67
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.510
Magan: The entire night. Okay.

68
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.620
Magan: And then I saw him swipe his card and go into the office and then my blood pressure went way up because I was worried

69
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.800
Magan: Yeah, so I before I went into his office. I took like four big, deep breaths.

70
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:05.250
Magan: And I sit down and his first question was, So is there an issue between you and Stephanie that I need to know about.

71
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.400
Magan: I took a deep breath.

72
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

73
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Night and I can and I pause and I was like, how do I want to pop it in

74
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.860
Magan: So I was like, What do you mean issue. What do you mean by issue.

75
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:32.160
Magan: And so he explained the circumstances. And I was like, well, I had no idea that it had escalated to this point, I don't work with her on the same shift.

76
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:46.710
Magan: To be quite frank. No, sir, I do not like the as she's not my cup of tea. However, I'm here to do my job and I will remain professional and in that room I have her back beyond that she's not my buddy. Right.

77
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.880
Wow.

78
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.740
Magan: Yeah, I was really proud of me. I was like,

79
00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:12.630
Magan: Let's get straight to the point here because I didn't want to tiptoe around it and say, oh, no, I like Stephanie or oh no oh god she hates me. No, that's not how I feel. I don't like her. She's not a nice person. She's a selfish human being that only thinks about herself and

80
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:25.530
Magan: I'm not here to be her friend. So why am I going to pretend like I want to. So I made that determination, very quickly that I was going to be honest and say, No, I am not a fan of her. She's not

81
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:35.850
Magan: A No. But I'm here to do my job and I will do that successfully and I'm sorry that it's gotten to this point for you, especially during this time.

82
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:49.290
Magan: Because I had no idea that it was like this and then he asked me if I'd be willing to talk with her and I said, Yeah, I'm happy to clear the air. I was like, however, sir, I'm going to be honest, and he said, Okay. Oh.

83
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: My gosh, couldn't have gone any better.

84
00:07:52.230 --> 00:08:07.890
Magan: No, I was really proud of me. I walked out of there with smile on my face and she was looking to see if I was, she was there. So she was watching me. And she was trying to see if I was upset or if I got reprimanded or something. I walked out with shit eating grin. It was so big.

85
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:18.030
Magan: And I, it's not like I was trying to shove it in her face, but wow. Like, why couldn't use talk to me. Why couldn't you just bring it to me.

86
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:29.220
Magan: If you have an issue with me or if you feel there's conflict or or a disagreement, talk to me and maybe we clear the air, but apparently she needed to go way up the chain of command, all the way to

87
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.940
Magan: Higher management. So if we're going to lay it down in higher management lab. I'm going to lay down to. Okay.

88
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So they she made wasn't a formal complaint. In other words, she said, Make Megan is doing a and b. What were the action.

89
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:59.100
Magan: She didn't make a formal complaint. She just thinks that there's conflict between us, like there could be issues there that there wasn't an exact meaning as to why I was there.

90
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:12.030
Magan: And I, I said. Um, so I guess, yesterday I was in my locker putting my stuff away for the for the night, and she was coming in to get her stuff out of her locker.

91
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:21.900
Magan: Now there's a blind corner. I can't see who's coming and the lockers are in the way for anybody to access. You have to say excuse me to get past the money.

92
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:37.380
Magan: I didn't know she was behind me and I started to cough and I turned and I cuffed in my went to go coffee my elbow and I cost on her because she was literally walking past me at the same time.

93
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.690
Magan: I apologize to her immediately.

94
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.730
Magan: I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

95
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:49.290
Magan: She just got really huffy and Puffy got really upset and I apologize, and that was the end of it.

96
00:09:50.310 --> 00:10:00.600
Magan: I thought, but that was part of the reason she brought up and feeling that it might be because of that I cost on her on purpose or something, I don't know.

97
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.110
Magan: But I made it very clear to him. You know, I don't have any issues with Stephanie.

98
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:18.420
Magan: And I'm happy to clear the air and then let's see what else Sydney that whole investigation.

99
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.630
Magan: There's a pre determination hearing

100
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.200
Magan: Okay, so for her.

101
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that term. I don't, I'm not familiar with. You are optimistic about that term.

102
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:42.660
Magan: I'm hoping I am optimistic about this term. So it's kind of like it's kind of like saying that

103
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.200
Magan: The findings of the investigation.

104
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.450
Magan: There's ground.

105
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Holder. Now I recognize

106
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.610
Magan: Yes, there's there's grounds.

107
00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:01.380
Magan: Whether they're good or bad. I don't know, but she has the right to defend herself and explain herself.

108
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.340
Magan: But it's gotten to the point where they have to bring those

109
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.990
Magan: Grounds of their findings to her.

110
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.190
Magan: Like getting in front of a jury, but she's been indicted.

111
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah well acquainted with us.

112
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. This she's probably miserable.

113
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:31.050
Magan: Well, I did. So my supervisor, Josh, the one that I feel is a really good supervisor very supportive.

114
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:40.410
Magan: Very uh he's just a good supervisor. He's, he's got a good head on his shoulders and I would have aspired to be a supervisor like him.

115
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.790
Magan: But he, he said that she looked really scared.

116
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's just

117
00:11:51.750 --> 00:12:00.480
Magan: And I kind of feel bad for but then I'm sitting there thinking, wait a minute. She did a lot of horrible things to me and but

118
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.190
Magan: I know what it feels like to be in a place of unknown and it's

119
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.590
Magan: It's not a good feeling.

120
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

121
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's opportunity. Megan, if you could to to see that even

122
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Even in this prayer.

123
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Seems like the obvious vindication would be the emotion that it's still more complicated than that. But you can still hold compassion for someone

124
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do both. You can sit with those opposing

125
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Opposites that

126
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with it. Right. The more I think the more human. We are he can sit with

127
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the natural consequence of her actions, it will play out. It's already playing out it's playing out. I can also relate to having to defend myself not an awful feeling

128
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.050
Magan: Maybe of embarrassment, you know,

129
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.790
Magan: And I can

130
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:21.090
Magan: I don't, I can like I said she's been horrible to me. And yeah, there is some there is that feeling of haha I told you so, or haha. But then there's also that feeling of, oh, I know what that feels like. And it sucks.

131
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:32.910
Magan: She's not a bad person I you know I don't really know her well enough, but she was a bad person to me and

132
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:46.410
Magan: Maybe she'll learn from the situation and be careful how she proceeds in the future with people if I've done anything in this whole thing. I stood up for myself.

133
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, that is so cool.

134
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:57.480
Magan: So that's what I would say. Out of all of this, if even if nothing comes of it and she just gets a little slap on the wrist.

135
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:08.640
Magan: I, I still defended myself and I took it all the way and I didn't go like old Megan status, where I would have just beat the shit out of her in a parking lot.

136
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

137
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.030
Magan: And I didn't go clam up like a show like current Megan.

138
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.350
Magan: So I did something

139
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That both of those dualities, I would say, um, is it really current Megan.

140
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe both of broke eating and maybe you're finding right that that power of conviction in between explosion and immobilization, you're fine somewhere in the middle there.

141
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:51.960
Magan: Maybe I would hope so, because I don't want to be the closed off Panda Megan that shuts down, but I also don't want to be angry Megan that blows up.

142
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.680
Magan: I don't and I don't want to take like

143
00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:08.310
Magan: For example, I don't want to take that power that I feel from something possibly happening from this situation and letting it get to my head. Do you want. I mean, I want to be.

144
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.000
Magan: I want to have some humility with it and some compassion with it and

145
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.430
Magan: Help me be a better person. You want me but

146
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.980
Magan: Not just be

147
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.910
Magan: The way that I always am and where I put it on me.

148
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know, and, and you did it when you did it just just today. The fact that you could drift over

149
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To my kind of kind of feel bad for when you did that, instead of just how she's getting her just desserts. If you were only doing that one piece of it, then you were doing this old style of vindication I'm right, she's that

150
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing it differently. I can tell because you naturally I didn't ask you to do it. You did it spontaneously. I didn't say, well, well, what about what she's going through. You just did it by yourself, you already were like kind of feel for the yes

151
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's both.

152
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there, that's a skill Megan and it's something that you so you're doing it with this woman.

153
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Needs, you're going to be able to do it for you.

154
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Were once you would want to shame yourself and blame and all this like

155
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You might pull back and say, Wait, I'm not just one thing I'm at least 234 lots of different stuff. Wait. It's more complicated than that. But me, not me not go to shame. But be not good at being absolutely right and and perfect. No, that won't work either. It's this both this duality.

156
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the fact that you're practicing practicing it work.

157
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You can still apply it to the self to you're going to be able to find that habit of moderated opinion. I'm neither all good nor all bad. I'm just

158
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Me I'm accountable for what I do accountable for what I down to what do I want to do. What do I feel

159
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Sam. Today I'm feeling lazy. Well, okay, Luke. Today I'm feeling ambitious will hope today I fit someone's head off. Whoops, got to fix that one. We go fix that relationship. It doesn't stay stuck on bad bad Megan.

160
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, stay stuck on good Megan.

161
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

162
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just whatever is coming up. What's What's Now what about. Now what about. Now what about now. If you had the old way of thinking in that room with with your boss when you were pulled in.

163
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.740
Hmm.

164
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Your choices were few in an enraged by the accusation.

165
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.410
Magan: You could only yeah

166
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Easily enraged. She didn't

167
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:14.280
Magan: Yeah, I didn't get enraged. I was surprised. Like, I was like, like what we're at this level, like what, but um

168
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.730
Magan: No, I, more than anything, I was really proud of myself this morning because I was honest.

169
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:34.530
Magan: And I didn't cover up how I felt. I don't have to pretend to like someone I don't have to cover up my feelings at work, because it's the social

170
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:51.150
Magan: Socially acceptable thing to do. I don't have to bash somebody or dig myself a whole but I also don't have to pretend and worry about somebody else's feelings. I'm worried about my feelings right now and I don't like you.

171
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.850
Magan: That's just it. I don't like

172
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it in a really cool way said, you know what

173
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Professionally, I'm going to have her back. We're going to work well. We're going to succeed.

174
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is she my buddy know we're going to be pals outside the workplace. No, but that's not right. And then right you redirect. But that's not what the concern is

175
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering maybe maybe she's looking for a friendship and she's confusing the two, but I'm really clear I'm enjoying a professional relationship.

176
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:29.970
Magan: Mm hmm. Yeah. And that's what I said. Like, I'm happy to sit and clear the air with her. But beyond that, I was not interested not interested.

177
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.260
Magan: She's she reminds me a lot of my mom.

178
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.050
Magan: She really reminds me a lot of my mom and I think that's why I like her.

179
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.690
Magan: Like a lot. Very, very selfish human being.

180
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.240
Magan: So should I get to water bottles.

181
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a girl.

182
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.670
Magan: Okay, I'll go grab hold on one second.

183
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Get my blue light.

184
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Some target mapping. I just want to review with you.

185
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the inner weaving pieces that you can either organically do on your own, or you might catch me shifting gears.

186
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.980
Magan: I'm going to move to a different room.

187
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've got some

188
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.250
Magan: Background noise

189
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.320
Magan: Okay, let's see here.

190
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this one you want to have me

191
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.550
Magan: Yeah, I'm gonna

192
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.440
Magan: I didn't like that.

193
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.160
Area.

194
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:13.770
Magan: Right here.

195
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.750
Magan: Let's see here.

196
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.180
Magan: The do the things need to be at eye level, the water bottles.

197
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because in theory, this would be you'd be watching

198
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A light or you'd be watching my finger, which of course I would have up at eye level.

199
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.610
Magan: Is that good.

200
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.920
Magan: Or too high.

201
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't see your face. You're just a

202
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: dark black wall. Yeah.

203
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.460
Magan: Okay, let me try a different area.

204
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.710
Magan: Where you will get this.

205
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:26.940
Magan: But

206
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It was, that was a table, I could just turn see we're facing the light that might have worked. I don't know.

207
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.660
Magan: The lights far away in the room.

208
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Needs to be your face, not the back of your head.

209
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.990
Magan: I think I have a better setup now. Surely, this will work much better.

210
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing that I'm looking over the target.

211
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're exploring and I think I

212
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:57.660
Magan: Think

213
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what it is.

214
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.150
Magan: Okay, perfect.

215
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Look here. Alright, so right now I'm low. Let me just check and see I'm down so that when you're looking at me you're down here. So if I were to point at the top of those containers, which are just about shoulder length apart. Right. Are they are they down or are they up so that you're looking

216
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.180
Magan: There right at my level like where my head is

217
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I haven't you, I still can't see your eyes very well, but we're gonna have to go with it.

218
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.190
Magan: Here, let's try this. Then let me bring you up on this.

219
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Make that steak or

220
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little. Okay. Okay.

221
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.670
Magan: Is that good.

222
00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see your eyes, but don't move, don't move. You're in a great place. I don't want you to reset up

223
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to say a little indication

224
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe down the line.

225
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.760
Magan: I have a lamp.

226
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we're looking for that sits right

227
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: In front of your face line like these things.

228
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.340
Magan: Might

229
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: See how these little guys.

230
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So like a clamp.

231
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Their little lights.

232
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.040
Yeah.

233
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes up at Costco.

234
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.650
Magan: Better

235
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

236
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's want a nice refueling breath. We are just hustling around moving and let's let's bring it into

237
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That into that belly.

238
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And at your own pace to sort of do that breathing that you now know

239
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Gets you centered

240
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Get you grounded.

241
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to back into your body. Maybe noticing this morning is heat ours, they touch the floor.

242
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe imagining the strength of gravity.

243
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Gravity that pulls those those feet closer to the floor right almost to the center. The planet is very powerful force that gravity's there.

244
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So now the weight to move, but once may have been high have been a shoulder and neck just allow it to sort of drop down and just see that. There it is. You can actually notice gravity working

245
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: sort of brings us hands and arms and shoulders down.

246
00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So this morning. I want to do some

247
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just reminding and review of your resources being

248
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dog.

249
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your children and me.

250
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.170
Magan: And I'm

251
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask you something. Are you starting to include you

252
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.830
Magan: Know,

253
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If it changes if it starts to shift where that sense of protection nurturing and wisdom starts to shift and it becomes you the self, let me know. Okay.

254
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.390
Magan: Yeah I would like it to.

255
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.730
Magan: It's not

256
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.600
Magan: Often on the last one. It felt like I was

257
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.420
Magan: Big Megan watching little Megan.

258
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

259
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, not as a protection.

260
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the I just want those those resources of the the animal this dog, the sense of protection sense of nurturing

261
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The sense of wisdom from children want that very present in your imagery and try and just kind of have them interacting with each other at the dog.

262
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: When

263
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Children just sort of have them kind of in the same space with you.

264
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That imagery, we may visit again. That'll what, that's what I will mean when I say your resource team, they'll be what you're going to right now.

265
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm guessing you just correct me if I'm off what you have mentioned mentioned in the passes I pass is I don't I don't want you said, I would like to have less reaction to that song.

266
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

267
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what I'm thinking we might want to work on that one. Now this is a very specific work. This has to do with

268
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Narrow neural network that's not to say that there are not many connections to it, but we're going to end. So you're going to hear a pretty

269
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Redirecting approach from me today. Stay there. Right there. Hold that right there. Go with that your mind is going to be have other things that are going to come in. We're going to stay right here.

270
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. It is a very different there's like four different ways to go about this. This em, Dr. This one is very exacting, it's only in this very narrow

271
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.150
Magan: State. May I ask why.

272
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.910
Magan: Why you chose this one.

273
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.050
Um,

274
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to watch you. Number one, I want to see if you compensate

275
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.290
Magan: I want to make sure

276
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: To carry you. Because if it gets like this. I'm gonna reel it back.

277
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because we have this time limited thing with our we've got a half hour for something really I think this deserves more like an hour and a half. So I want to protect time and really you you're

278
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, and I get to watch and I get to see the success of it. I get to to shape what we do next, I get to see how how well it works.

279
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Other ones. It's not like that at all. We, you might want you might demonstrate in here.

280
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have this resilience that shows up the suds may go down your positive and cognition may come online quite quickly and will say, look at that we can expand it. Look at that, the resilience is there and my client comes to me and says, I'm ready. I'm ready for the next one. Okay.

281
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.320
Magan: Mm hmm.

282
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.210
Magan: Do it. Okay.

283
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm still going to be monitoring. No, I'm not just gonna just go

284
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want to protect you.

285
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's what we're up to today. Let me know if you ever sent any other questions come up. So today is going to look a lot like go with that.

286
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through the nose. Exhale, and let it go. Then there'll be a beat and I'll say what's coming up for you.

287
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to catch it might be in your body. I REALLY GOING TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S, BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S solid stuff going on in that body. I'm going to want to know what shifted what dropped what stung.

288
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What sank what twisted what shifted. I'm going to want to know that is equally as important as the thought as the emotion is the memory. I like I'm interested in all of it.

289
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So first I'm going to check

290
00:30:51.240 --> 00:31:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If I point to the top of these containers. I just maybe put me more centered. I feel like I'm off to your right. I'm not centered at this point I want to be really centered in this in the image so that when I'm pointing

291
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: At these these these things. So I'm going to set the pace and I just want to see your eyes for a moment and see if you're comfortable

292
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: maybe want to be about arms like

293
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.270
Magan: Oh shit, okay.

294
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen. So we're going to check on comfort. So you just going to kind of look at this rate. Is this a slow one

295
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't look at my finger. I'm just setting the pace. Hopefully you can see it out. I kind of peripheral. Is it working.

296
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. We're good. And notice stress in the eye socket muscle kind of orbital, whatever they are. Okay, cool.

297
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me check in. Now I already said what the target is.

298
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.480
Magan: I can feel it.

299
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.060
Magan: Was gonna say it right away.

300
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling it.

301
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.530
Magan: In my chest.

302
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's it doing not just

303
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.340
Magan: I want to

304
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.800
Magan: I want to do this.

305
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.950
Magan: Okay, okay. But I'm trying not to.

306
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, um,

307
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I encourage you to do all of what comes naturally protecting is what's wanted. I say that, let's do it.

308
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. Yeah, absolutely. So we'll go here and breathe into that that protection, perhaps, of the chest.

309
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And now how does it shift this idea of addressing

310
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This song is it feel improved having had this cross. No. Okay. No. Okay.

311
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's spend a little bit of time sort of leaving in these images, then

312
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you just think about the dog, and I'm going to do slow iterations will do some bilateral stimulation, but I want to actually do some integration of these some installment, they call it. I want you to picture the dog.

313
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And picture you picture the children picture me and let me know when you read a really clear he see us all interacting with you.

314
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.230
Magan: I got it.

315
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Open your eyes.

316
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And sit back just to type. So it doesn't strain and this is going to be slow want you to hold on to that image.

317
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.110
I'd

318
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to pay attention to your chest.

319
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture these resource team figures for protection.

320
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: nurturing your growth and development.

321
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Know wisdom for your children.

322
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: being present with it.

323
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do an inhale together nice inhale deep belly breath and exhale it all out.

324
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what it was like to sit with both the chest and that imagery

325
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.380
Magan: It's a little overwhelming.

326
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.440
Magan: It's gonna sound really weird.

327
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.040
Magan: But

328
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.840
Magan: You guys are all there. But I know what we're

329
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.270
Magan: What we're here to talk about

330
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.230
Okay.

331
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.000
Magan: And

332
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:24.360
Magan: Honestly, what comes up. This is cutting, burning

333
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so not wanting to feel the pain of that distress, you'd rather have this other pain right

334
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

335
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. What if we did

336
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back into it, but this time we're gonna we're going to work with other imagery that has been effective. I think for you in the past, which has to do with that that Rome.

337
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would like you to you decide what you want to do with this, but remember that space that you have in your, your anchor room.

338
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that remember your team. And also remember the container.

339
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to picture this song with the pain of that song and the whole neural network of it because that's a big one that the whole thing is

340
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In a thick metal train car locked itself within a right locks itself with freezer handled with a bolt right that one.

341
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.240
Magan: Okay.

342
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm right now I'm picturing what I would do. Like if I wanted, not only to be locked, but distanced so now I've also got

343
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.010
Magan: It's already there.

344
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:02.970
Magan: So as you're talking about it, you're all in the room, I'm we're in the room, the door shut.

345
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.260
Magan: All the locks are locked on just the door.

346
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:18.390
Magan: And that name. It's like lingering in the air. Right now, it's actually playing in my head, not the song, but the work for eating in my head.

347
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.070
Magan: And

348
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:27.240
Magan: I see the container containers, a nice spacious way away from my room.

349
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.640
Magan: And that's the imagery, I

350
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Read since this is about sound, can we expand and then I'm going to want to do an iteration. So can you expand the capabilities of that container that it does something transformative with the melody. The know stones sound the same. I did that on purpose. By the way, it was not so

351
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.130
Magan: Now, I know.

352
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There was your. It just doesn't

353
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the same sound if you slowed it down.

354
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or some other way that you want to corrupt shift change those notes as it go higher. Does it go deeper to the notes have all this piece in between them. And why is it about that container. We could sound proof it so even the sound can't get out

355
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Sick. We got imagery as long as you need. And when you're ready to open your eyes. When you're ready,

356
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to hold that imagery container and hold the imagery of the resources in the room, and we're going to sit back a little bit, so you're not straining yourself.

357
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Comfortable in the eyes.

358
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay close attention to pulling up container.

359
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Distance, you need the resource room and all the resources.

360
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing in the symmetry connecting the mind.

361
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And your breath.

362
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here to

363
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Be short

364
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly.

365
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, slowly as you can. So his breath.

366
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let there be a beat of nothing.

367
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: tuning in to what's coming up.

368
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.110
Magan: The songs playing now. Okay.

369
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.190
Magan: I see notes in a container.

370
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.520
Magan: But they're free in the container and it's bothering me.

371
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, we're gonna go with that.

372
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Get see what you need to do.

373
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To get you and your resources to address that problem that you just said let's get it addressed someone in there knows what to do.

374
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: See if a question needs to be asked someone spontaneously offers the solution.

375
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking quickly, what are you thinking about right now.

376
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I don't know.

377
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.130
Magan: I'm just

378
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling

379
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

380
00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.340
Magan: Really

381
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.780
Magan: I'm trying, I'm really trying to keep going.

382
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what do you

383
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.010
Ask us

384
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.080
Magan: To do something

385
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.040
Magan: With

386
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.000
Magan: It's just where it's suffocating

387
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

388
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't seem to ask for help and it's still there and it's suffocating

389
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we go back to the imagery

390
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the notes in that

391
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: SOUND Did you soundproof it in some way. What did you do to soundproof it. What did or didn't get

392
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.850
Magan: It. I can hear it. It's just playing over

393
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, and you couldn't

394
00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:57.780
Magan: Even note.

395
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:05.490
Magan: I can see the notes floating in there in the container and I can hear. I can hear it.

396
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.940
Magan: And I can see his lips saying

397
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

398
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello only go to

399
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This, I can't seem to ask a question of my let's just sit with that.

400
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

401
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Visit and you're not other piece, what's in the container. We're not going to visit that which is going to delve more into

402
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: The ability, the inability. We're going to see without a little longer to get the help you need. Okay, let's see what comes up with that. So again, go back to resource which is the room, go back to

403
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.320
The children.

404
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To the animal and check and see what's coming up for you wonder what's going on with that question that might need to see if there's a question. It can be asked. Let's see.

405
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

406
00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking for help.

407
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To do.

408
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: question or statement emerges, feel free to talk while the iterations happening.

409
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

410
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

411
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And let a nice quite

412
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: A bit of nothing. Just that space between what we did, how you are

413
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

414
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gonna be quiet inside

415
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up.

416
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.390
Magan: I'm sitting in the room with all of you guys.

417
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.120
Magan: And you can all see that something's wrong. And then I'm upset.

418
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.960
Magan: You want to know, but I just I can't

419
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.710
Magan: There's not a question coming to my brain.

420
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.980
Magan: It's just, it's not coming and I'm just there.

421
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going to come at this differently, let's instead

422
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: She do hold that same image go with that. Now, see, see if the animal knows just what to do to your dog.

423
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not up to you as a child to have been question. It's for your resource to kick in to be there.

424
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We all know what to do. What do they do.

425
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It breathing.

426
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Allow the uncensored

427
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission.

428
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You doing great.

429
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: anyone or anything.

430
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:11.820
Magan: We

431
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.480
Were

432
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.700
Magan: Discussing

433
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

434
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.360
Magan: We're discussing it amongst us

435
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.490
Magan: What we could do.

436
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.870
Magan: To make him go away the notes.

437
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.290
Magan: You said when said maybe we can let them know to float away.

438
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:38.640
Magan: And I disagreed because and they could still be out there.

439
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:41.520
Magan: And you said, Okay.

440
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.750
Magan: And it was like Lola suggested blowing the place up

441
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:48.390
Magan: And

442
00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:53.460
Magan: I said no because I have other things in there that I need to keep

443
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.100
Magan: And the kids suggested bearing it

444
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.610
Magan: And then when suggested cutting them up.

445
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:06.960
Magan: And then

446
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.990
Magan: And this my I'm afraid because

447
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:22.530
Magan: The pieces will still be there, even though their notes, they're still

448
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.050
Magan: There.

449
00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.470
Magan: And I can hear it.

450
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:33.390
Magan: And then

451
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.440
Magan: I can see him saying it.

452
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with what comes with

453
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Cutting them up.

454
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's see what comes with cutting them up if it is cutting, maybe it isn't cutting. Maybe it's some other transformation of those notes.

455
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what's coming up for me is

456
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things. One is that the notes in and of themselves.

457
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You here.

458
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In other songs

459
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're there. There's somewhere else that probably even groove to and play.

460
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The notes.

461
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: By just the note by itself.

462
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you just visit one note.

463
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe catch another song where maybe you just thought of it. No, it's just a note.

464
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go with that for a little bit and see what happens.

465
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can hear this other song.

466
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: On the radio.

467
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And its pleasant on groovy.

468
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a note, just one note.

469
00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.520
Magan: The note.

470
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.670
Magan: Turned into

471
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:50.790
Magan: I don't know how, but like, as you were saying it is a song. Think of a song that note, being in a different song, something I like, but this song.

472
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.800
Magan: It's for my favorite Disney movie.

473
00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

474
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.480
Magan: And it was. I loved the song, growing up.

475
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:10.200
Magan: But I don't know if it's like the song transforming into that, or the one note from it, but you've told me to think about the song.

476
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:11.550
Magan: But

477
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.310
Magan: I don't know how it's going into it.

478
00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.210
Magan: I don't know how it's

479
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let let your mind do it, just go with that.

480
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be

481
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: tuned into your body. You're doing great.

482
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the dog with this other song.

485
00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Transformation.

486
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And how your children respond to this transformation.

487
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an incomplete transformation, but it was starting to be thought about

488
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does Glenn respond to the transformation.

489
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: burgeoning, if you will. It's an almost their

490
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Transformation.

491
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how does Megan respond to this almost transformation.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.320

535
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You

537
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:55.620
Magan: I

Magan: Okay, always do.

542
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So do they feel safe enough to bring up their concern to you.

555
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.320
Magan: And you don't want to

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.130
Magan: Megan taking it.

561
00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just happened.

562
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of pay attention to feet, do a scan come up through the earth.

563
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That awareness through the toes.

564
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Are to the fee to the heels and calves have that energy sensation and awareness, moving from the cast the knees.

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Couch

567
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That awareness.

568
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the belly awareness of the breath awareness of the chest.

569
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: just tuning in to sensation.

570
00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And temperature and energy.

571
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to your hands, those fingers and to the wrist and forearms.

572
01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see what charges left

573
01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can

574
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Get some distance from it. There's any negative charge. Maybe this is the time to put it on a leaf and habit just sort of drift further and further away from you.

575
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And remaining on the shore, I'm there with you.

Magan: On. Sorry.

579
01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. Maybe that's why you're standing in your ok but picture you're on the side on the ground and drifting further away.

580
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Is any negative charge left in the body. Just see

581
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: See where that was. See if you can uncross see if it makes a difference really picture.
