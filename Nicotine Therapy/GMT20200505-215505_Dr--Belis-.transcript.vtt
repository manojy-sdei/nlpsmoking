00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:41.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: So tell me about you. I understand that you're seeking help for heroin and meth abuse. Is that right,

28
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah okay and will will certainly help you with that. And that you also have some like mental health stuff going on. Some PTSD, maybe depression.

29
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.260
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, so I have. So I've been in therapy, since I was six. I was molested when I was seven.

30
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.400
Lisa Arnegger: So I have a lot of PTSD and trauma, but

31
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.820
Lisa Arnegger: I was diagnosed with certain things. I don't know if it's

32
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.380
Lisa Arnegger: I don't really remember like getting tested for all that stuff.

33
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.750
Lisa Arnegger: You know, there's like a series of questions. You go through, but I just think I just know that they treated me with certain medications for it, you know.

34
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.500
A little

35
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.530
Lisa Arnegger: Pretty yeah like I would say like maybe like 15 probably since 15 yeah so like depression, anxiety,

36
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.460
Lisa Arnegger: I know I have a learning disability for ADHD.

37
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.550
Lisa Arnegger: Trauma

38
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.790
Lisa Arnegger: And then bipolar. But I don't know if I don't know that's

39
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did they say the bipolar was that diagnosis also made when you were 15 or was it

40
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.760
Lisa Arnegger: Later.

41
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.700
Lisa Arnegger: It was later. Yeah, it was much later. Yeah.

42
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: Bipolar you know it's it's. We'll see. I think that they're going to help you establish care, probably with the psychiatrists with us as well.

43
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:15.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you can kind of get into more details with that. But I can tell you that bipolar disorder is pretty tricky to diagnose, especially if they're

44
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:28.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: There is it's happening around the time of drug use, like if there's alcohol use, or any sort of drug use, it can really look like mood swings and ups and downs and mania and things like

45
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.010
Lisa Arnegger: That

46
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Pending on you know what's going on, so people can be misdiagnosed because of all the use, they were having

47
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.530
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, and and you know like I've

48
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.430
Lisa Arnegger: I've been clean before and I've been in recovery and there's been times where I've had to get on meds.

49
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:58.410
Lisa Arnegger: When I was coming off the map because my mind was so like out there, you know, I mean, so it stabilized me for a little while and then I got off of it. I don't like the Mets. That's why don't take them.

50
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.270
Lisa Arnegger: You know, I play soccer. That's kind of my joy and I haven't played in a while, but

51
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.090
Lisa Arnegger: But that's kind of like what I do to get everything you know how

52
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: To

53
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a good sport. Okay, cool. Um, and what men. What, what was the particular menu were just

54
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.950
Lisa Arnegger: Referring to they had me on Lamictal and will be trying

55
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.420
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

56
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you

57
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.260
Lisa Arnegger: And I've been on Suboxone to for

58
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:46.230
Lisa Arnegger: I was on it for seven years. And can I tell you that I told myself I would never get on it again. I swore that because I that detail was the worst of talks of my life. That was a very horrible detail. So I am

59
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830
Lisa Arnegger: A sinner. I'm going to keep using and lose my kids and lose everything I have or

60
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.520
Lisa Arnegger: I'll get on Suboxone but I do want to stay on it for very

61
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.670
Lisa Arnegger: Low like well

62
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

63
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: You were on it for seven years. What was your dose, then do you recall

64
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.550
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, because I had, I was pregnant and I delivered two babies on it. I'm

65
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.310
Lisa Arnegger: God I went from like

66
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.080
Lisa Arnegger: To do all the way up to 24 milligrams

67
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Per kilogram. Okay.

68
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:36.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: And when you got off and you're talking about the detox like the withdrawal from it. Were you all, you know, were you taken off in like a month, or was it like over a long time, or was it like a week or how did you do the detox.

69
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:46.470
Lisa Arnegger: So what happened was I went to see a doctor and I don't feel the doctor knew what he was doing. He just gave me a shitload of medicines and

70
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:58.590
Lisa Arnegger: Like, I don't even know half the stuff he literally gave me like 10 medications to help me with the withdrawals and he said, just, you know, let's just go every like every day. We'll just go down and down and down and

71
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Very quick

72
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:15.840
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, yeah. So I went down. I got all the way down to two and I couldn't take it because I was doing it around my kids and I had no support and it was the worst. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. So I ended up checking myself in the rehab and in which a mountain Vista farm.

73
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.940
Lisa Arnegger: Okay and so on two milligrams. I got off of it in 30 days.

74
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.830
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, yeah.

75
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:33.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so I see so so that that was a bad experience and I and I could see why. I mean, if you're all the way up to 24 milligrams and then you're

76
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:42.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Told to like go down daily by a certain amount and stuff. That's a very, very quick way to try to taper somebody if you know we

77
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:50.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I hope we will get you on this medication. We know that it works for you. It helps you stay clean right during your pregnancies and beyond.

78
00:07:50.700 --> 00:08:06.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we'll get you on, but we'll keep you like you said at the lowest the comfortable dose where you're not at risk of relapse, but you're not. So, you know, hopefully not as high as 24. We'll see you know whatever it takes to keep you from craving.

79
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:17.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: You we stay on the minimum dose possible. And then, and then when you feel like, okay, I'm in a stable place. Now, a couple of months have gone by, whatever.

80
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:29.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can, if you feel ready we can slowly start like very small I'm talking one two milligrams a month, you know, very small, very small papers on

81
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:40.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Doing it comfortably that would, because I have done that for patients after they've been on it for like a year, we very gently, very slowly and it's been successful for a couple people, you know,

82
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:48.960
Lisa Arnegger: Okay. Yeah. And I was thinking about doing that shop thing they have like a I forgot the name of it, but they have it at Kaiser so

83
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: This there's are you thinking vivid trial.

84
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.250
Yeah.

85
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.810
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

86
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could do vivid trial.

87
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:06.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: The trial is good because there's no withdrawal from it. So if you decide, I don't want to take this anymore. You don't have any problem you can walk away.

88
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:15.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a blocker complete blocker on the receptor. So if you were to like us or try to use you would feel nothing

89
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: So those are the pluses of that.

90
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: But to get on it is the challenge because you need because it's a complete blocker.

91
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.500
Lisa Arnegger: You really

92
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know opioids, not even Suboxone for like 14 days.

93
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.770
Lisa Arnegger: tend to fall.

94
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.450
Lisa Arnegger: I didn't know that. Okay, well,

95
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: You can get like 10 days clean like complete know opioid

96
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:48.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: You are eligible and that is when you can really you can go for it, you know, try it out as a trial because that can help cravings as well. And there's patients that do well with that though.

97
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.970
Lisa Arnegger: Is it, is it the only thing. The only thing they have is methadone or Suboxone Hall first to opiates.

98
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.290
Lisa Arnegger: Still opiate withdrawal.

99
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:13.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, they have they have. We have methadone maintenance. You know where you take it daily. We have you done and daily and then we have the trial, which is the the injectable naltrexone. So those are the like FDA approved treatments for opioid use disorder.

100
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.600
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, I'm just curious.

101
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:27.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could try the vivid trawl but it's like can you get yourself to 10 days like nothing. That's the most people get they're like yeah after three, four days they they relapse know

102
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.850
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah. Well, I had two years I with nothing no Suboxone, no nothing.

103
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:54.150
Lisa Arnegger: Nothing I and I and I recently just relapse. So, I mean, I didn't. Well, it's been since November of last year. So I've been using every day for shit six months now. So I tried to stop. I did actually try to detox myself.

104
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.600
Lisa Arnegger: Not too long ago and

105
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:08.640
Lisa Arnegger: I did it with methadone, because my I get can get methadone, so I had to drinkable stuff and I tried to win it that way.

106
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.810
Lisa Arnegger: And I was successful. Um, I was. I didn't do anything for a couple of days, but

107
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.450
Lisa Arnegger: For some reason, I just

108
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:24.600
Lisa Arnegger: Resumed I, I just got back again. So, you know, it's hard because

109
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.120
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, so

110
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you tried to do that with the Methadone like drinking that and then stopping the

111
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.310
Lisa Arnegger: The hair. Yeah, you're around other people that are it's yeah so

112
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.840
Lisa Arnegger: It's really hard. Yeah.

113
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: So tell me about your use. Is it IV. Now, are you ivy or poison.

Lisa Arnegger: I just had an infection actually really bad one was hospitalized for one

116
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.030
Lisa Arnegger: type thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: In your life.

118
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.890
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, I was like, right there. You can kind of tell that it's like

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.480
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, but it was huge. It was like a golf ball like the size of a golf ball. Yeah, so

121
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you were in the hospital for that, did they keep you overnight or did they

122
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.830

Dr. Belis Aladag: It got better. It looks better. I mean, it doesn't look

128
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.440
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

129
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.970
Lisa Arnegger: It's not as big, but

130
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.270
Lisa Arnegger: I've been, you know, been kind of just doing the same things so

131
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:51.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so okay and then tell me about the Matthews is that, like, together with it. Is it like if you stop the heroin. You think you'll stop the meth or

132
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like what relationship with that.

133
00:12:54.270 --> 00:13:01.290
Lisa Arnegger: Well, I think for me it was mostly just the energy. It's kind of like, it's like the together thing. It's like you have to have

134
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:14.940
Lisa Arnegger: In order to because I get really tired on heroin. So I'm just like, you know, some people get a lot of energy when they're on here when I don't. I just, you know, tend to get really sleepy low energy. And so I do this to keep

135
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.960
Lisa Arnegger: It up. Yeah.

136
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.740
I

137
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Had something you would crave or seek without if you weren't doing the heroin.

Lisa Arnegger: But

140
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.490
Lisa Arnegger: I think it's just the initial like couple of days because more. It's more of a mental

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.690
Lisa Arnegger: A mental like creating you know any mean so

142
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.530

146
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it can really you know fog up your brain, it's toxic to the brain.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.200
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, okay.

148
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:14.910

154
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:48.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's something we can try to quit as well. At some point, you know, we can try nicotine patches or if you're just smoking that much, maybe you just want the GM or the candies.

155
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.500
Lisa Arnegger: We'll

157
00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:01.080
Lisa Arnegger: Big ones, and I don't like those. I like the small tiny ones that a small loss, but they're so expensive, so

158
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: You try to order them if you want and see if it's covered

159
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.130
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, yeah.

160
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.030

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.630
So left so

163
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can see if this one covers it. So I can try sending the laws and is OK.

164
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK, just check it out and see how much it would be

165
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:38.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, okay, you are, are you married. Are you living with somebody, you said you have children. Tell me about your situation.

168
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.420
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, and they live with me.

169
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.700
Lisa Arnegger: And it's very hard because I'm doing it by myself.

170
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.700
Lisa Arnegger: I I do live with somebody. I'm with somebody

171
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.050
Lisa Arnegger: That's how I kind of got on drugs again.

172
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.590
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, I'm just making sure

173
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.350
Lisa Arnegger: It's very toxic relationship.

174
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.050
Lisa Arnegger: But it's very hard to

175
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.850
Lisa Arnegger: He's been wanting me to get off of it, you know.

176
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.100
Lisa Arnegger: He keeps telling me you know but then it, I don't know, it's kind of confusing. It's

177
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.820
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, I don't know.

178
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:56.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's hard. It's hard when. Yeah, you're too well you're trying to, you know, have a relationship. And then you're both struggling with the substance issue because everybody's substance issue is that a different point. You know what I mean.

179
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.910
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

180
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: It takes different things for people to sober get sober.

181
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:14.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not every it's not one size fits all. You know what I mean. And so you have like you have those kids and you're like, I gotta do this maybe, you know, we don't know where is that, you know, you know what I'm saying, like,

182
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.720
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, it's

183
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:23.850
Lisa Arnegger: Just really hard to be attentive to my children, you know, and be patient and, you know, and it's like I

184
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:32.010
Lisa Arnegger: It's it's it's it's hard. I feel like it's more harder for me than like some junkie on the street. I mean, it's harder for anybody but

185
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:41.850
Lisa Arnegger: For me it's like I'm trying so hard to keep it together. You know what I mean. So I'm like playing these different roles with everyone at work.

186
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.560
Lisa Arnegger: Out in public with my kids with my family, you know, and it's like it's exhausting. You know, it's really

187
00:17:50.040 --> 00:18:03.030
Lisa Arnegger: Lasting, you know, because before before this, I had two years and I was like really into my recovery. I was going to na meetings, I was working steps sponsor like I was really doing well, you know, and

188
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:20.430
Lisa Arnegger: I really thought, you know, because that was the first time that I had ever gotten two years worth of food like straight clean from everything not Suboxone not nothing. So I just knew for sure I wasn't going to go back, you know, and

189
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.420
Lisa Arnegger: I went through a divorce with the father of my kids and he was abusive and

190
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.440
Lisa Arnegger: I tend to go for abusive men, you know, and

191
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.880
Lisa Arnegger: I wouldn't say abusive men, but just men. They're very

192
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.180
Lisa Arnegger: Well, the last one was abusive. This one is more

193
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.400
Lisa Arnegger: He's

194
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:52.380
Lisa Arnegger: Aggressive yeah very angry with a lot of anger issues and he's nuts and He scares the shit out of me, but

195
00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:09.420
Lisa Arnegger: It's like this. And I think that's what I want to work on is just like learning how to be okay with myself, you know, because that was. That's the one thing that I that I lack, you know, even though I had two years, clean it was like

196
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:24.480
Lisa Arnegger: I was constantly getting into a relationship like I was in a relationship with this woman that was my best. She was one of my good friends. And, you know, was like bam right away, moved in, bam, right away, like it was just like, you know what I mean, like,

197
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.860
Lisa Arnegger: No.

198
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:35.190
Lisa Arnegger: You know so and it's more for me. It's more like I don't know how to be alone, kind of thing, you know.

199
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:43.230
Lisa Arnegger: So I think for me it's like something that I want to work on, you know, because I have some serious issues family issues.

200
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.690
Lisa Arnegger: Core family issues and like relationship issues so

201
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.500
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, so that's like a goal.

202
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.300
Lisa Arnegger: So,

203
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.620
You mentioned

204
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:13.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: You mentioned family. And you mentioned the molestation when you were so young and seven are you, what was it like, was it rope involving your life. Did your parents know or did it evolve your parents like what what's

205
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.980
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah. Well, it was my mom's boyfriend at the time and

206
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.380
Lisa Arnegger: You know, he was

207
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.350
Lisa Arnegger: I kept it a secret for a very long time and you know like

208
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.780
Lisa Arnegger: My dad notice because I was raised with my dad. My dad raised me

209
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.530
Lisa Arnegger: Oh my

210
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:38.520
Lisa Arnegger: Mom had left me even though she's still in denial about it, but she did leave me when I was very young and

211
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:47.850
Lisa Arnegger: You know, we're her in our relationship is very dysfunctional very dysfunctional. It's very sick and

212
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.580
Lisa Arnegger: There's a lot of resentment there with her and you know i i

213
00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:08.280
Lisa Arnegger: Not because of the molestation, but just because of just who she is, in general, and you know how negative she is, you know, like, she'll be there for me, she'll help me and she wants to see me succeed, but

214
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:15.930
Lisa Arnegger: You know she brings me down a lot like I had weight issues I've had weight issues because every time when I had a baby. It was like you're fat.

215
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:23.580
Lisa Arnegger: You're getting too big. It was like everything. Everything was about my weight, you know, everything is about the outer appearance, you know, I mean, and

216
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.960
Lisa Arnegger: She just so negative, you know, she's just really, really negative and it's very hard for me to

217
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.590
Lisa Arnegger: Deal with, you know, so

218
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.450
Lisa Arnegger: And she doesn't know how to admit two things, you know, so

219
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So she has a difficult personality.

220
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:54.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: It sounds like and you have this history of, you know, there's some resentments and some unresolved stuff you know and like you said. She doesn't apologize, or she doesn't really admit the wrong.

221
00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:03.450
Lisa Arnegger: Things that she's done and she and she she helped me raise my oldest my 18 year old. And so, you know, she feels some kind of

222
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.830
Lisa Arnegger: Like

223
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Entitled

224
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:16.020
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah entitlement with him. And so, like, you know, he's very spoiled and he very disrespectful and you know with me. And so like

225
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:34.890
Lisa Arnegger: There's always been these boundary issues with her and him and me and it's like it's like this sick, sick, twisted thing that she just involves him and all business and everything. And, you know, and so my relationship with my oldest is very, um, it's not it's not healthy at all either so

226
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. The triangulating situation with your mom.

227
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and then how is your dad. Is he still around.

228
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you close to him.

229
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:51.750
Lisa Arnegger: I was, I was really close with my dad, I really looked up to him. He has AIDS, he's had it for 30 years he was a drug user to

230
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.470
Lisa Arnegger: He was also gay will buy whatever

231
00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:07.080
Lisa Arnegger: And him and our relationship is not good either. It's not healthy. He's very angry very volatile very abusive. When I was growing up.

232
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:20.280
Lisa Arnegger: You know, it was like it was it was weird because he was abusive, but he was also this like loving positive person as well. So as like getting two spectrums of this person and I and I didn't know

233
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.600
Lisa Arnegger: Which one to

234
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:35.250
Lisa Arnegger: Expect believe. Yeah, or belief. Yeah, you know, and so then I now I see that I tend to go after men that are just like that person angry that that the abusive.

235
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.290
Lisa Arnegger: You know, put you down type of person you know so

236
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:49.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going, I'm sure they have some redeeming qualities that you're acted to, like, oh, you know, and then you have this dichotomy of like dark and light.

237
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:49.980
Yeah.

238
00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:00.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. Okay, so you have that with the family. And how about siblings do you get along. Do you have siblings like sisters, brothers.

239
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.300
Lisa Arnegger: I have a brother, but we're not close, we'll talk

240
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:14.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you mentioned your dad had like drug use drug issues. Any your mom does she have anything. Does any other family history.

241
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:20.880
Lisa Arnegger: Oh yeah, definitely. My mom has she took pups pills like there's no doubt, but she won't admit it. She thinks

242
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.390
Lisa Arnegger: She doesn't have a problem. She only takes it for her restless leg syndrome. But, but yet you been to St Alina for

243
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:35.520
Lisa Arnegger: Me, you know, rehab for for it. So, you know, she she takes it now she she stopped actually taking AND SHE WAS TAKING AMERICA.

244
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:44.670
Lisa Arnegger: And then she started taking them again because I've been seeing number person stuff. So, but I don't I don't say anything to her, just because it's not my business, you know, so

245
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so there's history there with mom and dad family history. Okay.

246
00:24:53.700 --> 00:25:00.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then okay work. Tell me about your work. What am I doing, what were you doing are you stopping

247
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.010
Lisa Arnegger: So that that was the other. I wanted to talk to you about. So I

248
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:14.310
Lisa Arnegger: So before all this started happening. I had gotten a job, etc. Really good job, probably one of the best jobs. I've ever read is one of the best jobs ever had.

249
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:23.220
Lisa Arnegger: I am a phlebotomist and I'm going to me and I was working in a methadone clinic for this believe or not.

250
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.540
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, and

251
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.570
Lisa Arnegger: At a mid market in Hayward, and then

252
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.440
Lisa Arnegger: Right after that I was started working at a place called

253
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.860
Lisa Arnegger: center point which is

254
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.700
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, it's a, it's a, it's just basically the it's an agency where we get people into programs and stuff. So I was, you know,

255
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:55.800
Lisa Arnegger: I was the yeah so I was working in recovery and I was going to like the jails and stuff like that. And I was kind of like the point of person to get people into programs, basically.

256
00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.630
Lisa Arnegger: But it was

257
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:11.760
Lisa Arnegger: It was also honestly quite triggering to do that because you know I have a tendency to I love for some reason inmates are like I have this attraction to them. You know what I mean. So like

258
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: I got higher

259
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.550
Lisa Arnegger: Because I I met somebody in there and, you know, totally totally totally cross boundaries and

260
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.330
Lisa Arnegger: And then. Yeah, so that was that. But

261
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:31.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wasn't it wasn't actually a very healthy job for you because of the triggers and the temptations and

262
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:39.690
Lisa Arnegger: In our know that those type of jobs. Honestly, working or recovery is not is not a healthy

263
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:54.330
Lisa Arnegger: They're not healthy jobs for me. And that's what I would. That's what I've realized coming from all of this because you know i sick goes after stick. That's just what it is you know it, what I've experienced my whole life and I've see it all the time, you know,

264
00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:07.020
Lisa Arnegger: So, you know, that's it, just, I just stay away from all that. So I got a job, etc. And I was super happy was a full time position, making really good money for benefits. It was just like, great. And, um,

265
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:16.350
Lisa Arnegger: I started working and then all of a sudden my performance started to get worse and worse and worse. I started missing days was late.

266
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:34.260
Lisa Arnegger: So she pulled me to the side. And she's like, You know what, I think you need to take a leave of absence or you need to go do you need to figure something out. Because this is a warning you get one more you're gone, you know, and she's really been trying to work with me. And, you know, finally.

267
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:48.120
Lisa Arnegger: Last Friday, she, it was my first week back. I wasn't ready to come back and to be honest with you. The reason why I had left was because I was going to get clean. You know, I was going to go into a place to get clean

268
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:56.340
Lisa Arnegger: And the reason why I didn't end up going was because I had nobody watch my kids. So of course I took advantage of it. And, you know,

269
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.060
Lisa Arnegger: I just kept using, you know,

270
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:12.330
Lisa Arnegger: Came back to work and last Friday. She said she pulled me to the side. Again, and she's like Lisa. This is your first week back and it's not looking good, you know, she was like

271
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:25.500
Lisa Arnegger: She was like, so this is what you know I'm going to give you a couple of options, you know, and let's see what we can do, you know, and so I talked to HR today. They gave me some paperwork, they're going to put me on some kind of program that's

272
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.880
Lisa Arnegger: It's basically I just need something from my doctor you or whatever, but you

273
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:50.250
Lisa Arnegger: Just basically what she wants to do is reduce my hours. So just pretty much reduce my hours to maybe 20 hours a week and then I can still collect disability because because it's I'm treating a disease and

274
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:59.850
Lisa Arnegger: Because I told her I was like, you know, the reason why I can't go down, reduce my hours is because of I'm financially. There's no way I can support for kids on you know

275
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:12.000
Lisa Arnegger: And so that's when she said well, cuz centers like amazing like they really work with their employees, like they're really, really amazing. And so she said yeah so it would be like a 90 day thing so

276
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.400
Lisa Arnegger: Basically for 90 days, they just reduce my work hours to like 20 hours a week or how many hours you think that I should work and then

277
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:29.850
Lisa Arnegger: And then basically, I would just do that until you thought or whatever we discussed when I was ready to go back to full time.

278
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.040
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

279
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we can do that. I think especially because

280
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:49.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're joining our hopefully you'll be part of our, our group, our treatment program here and that entails some hours, you know, it's not 20 hours of

281
00:29:49.920 --> 00:30:02.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Work, but it's, you know, a commitment. So I think, I think we should be able to do that for you and fill out like just say that, yeah, you can reduce your hours for now, as you know,

282
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:03.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then

283
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.760
Lisa Arnegger: Well, because the thing too is like, you know what I want to do, like, you know, if

284
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:20.220
Lisa Arnegger: The hours that I'm not working. So if I work 20 hours and you know and then because I seen online to you guys have an intensive outpatient program to which is that every day or

285
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:36.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the intensive outpatient program, I would have to look into what what that looks like. But my, my. So here's the basic program is come weekly like once a week, you'd meet with me.

286
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:42.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: In a setting with a therapist. So that's me and a therapist running a group

287
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:52.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I would check in with you medically. So I'd say, Okay, let's say you're on Suboxone and say okay, how are we doing on the dough so we good we adjusted, whatever. And then I do the same with others.

288
00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:07.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then it opens up to like a recovery group where the therapist helps us kind of discuss some, you know, issues that might be relevant to everybody, you know, and so that's one hour a week that you do. So every week. You do that.

289
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:18.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you have your own therapist. So you have an assigned individual therapists that you meet with individually and that could be once a week.

290
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: Doesn't have to be an hour. It could, you know, I think that varies, but

291
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:32.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: That could be as frequent as like once a week. And then I think the I O P is like the intensive outpatient is like more than that. You could do

292
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah groups, a week.

293
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:34.650
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

294
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, or a couple I

295
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.880
Lisa Arnegger: Think it was every day when I saw it on the internet. It was Monday through Friday or Monday through Thursday, and there was like

296
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:58.050
Lisa Arnegger: Daily. Yeah. Yeah. It was daily and that's kind of what I want to do, you know, in the days I do work. I can just do the groups at night. You know what I'm saying. So like, but that's what I want to do, because I think I think for me, I really need to

297
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:10.920
Lisa Arnegger: Work on myself right now. Like, take this time and really take advantage of it. And to be honest with you, I'm I know for, like, I'm going to be going through some kind of withdrawals, even though. It'll be on Suboxone like

298
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.500
Lisa Arnegger: Even with the Methadone I went through went through it. That's why I ended up. I just kept using you know this last time, so

299
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.320
Lisa Arnegger: So that's another thing, you know.

300
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:33.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: And, you know, for, for the especially for the Suboxone you will need to go into some moderate withdrawal before we start your first dose.

301
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't know if you remember that from way back

302
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:47.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Years ago when you first took it, but you need to be opioid free for a good. So it varies, person to person. Right. Some people go into withdrawal after four hours.

303
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:57.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then some people there okay for like 24 hours and then they start feeling it. So it depends where you're at, what your situation is your body and how much you've been using but

304
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:07.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: You need to physically have some symptoms at least two like the crying you know the teary eyed or the nose running or the goosebumps.

305
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:08.430
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

306
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: I area like yeah

307
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:17.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a cool sentence, not just anxiety or whatever, but just physical symptoms, you should have at least two before you take your first Suboxone

308
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:30.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you're right. I mean, you will have to be uncomfortable not severe but like you will physically have to be feeling like, not the best for a little bit before you take your first dose that's for sure.

309
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:41.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then once you're on it. Hopefully you've waited long enough so that when you take your first those you're feeling a bit better and a bit better and better and it just kind of goes from there, but

310
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's

311
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: A process right

312
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:57.960
Lisa Arnegger: Do you guys do prescribe because I asked another lady do you prescribe. Anything else for like the likes that certain withdrawals, or do you guys you don't for anything else just kind of the Suboxone and that's it.

313
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it's

314
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, I would say.

315
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:17.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: For people to get people on for the induction to get people on the Suboxone I think it's best if we try not to mask too much. I mean, we can, if you really were like

316
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:34.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, like my restless leg or like, you know, I just, you know, I think a muscle relaxer would help. I could give you a muscle relaxer if you were like, I think, you know, just feeling and see is going to be something for me just agitated us if we can give you a quantity and patch to calm.

317
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Calm your nervous. That's

318
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.620
Lisa Arnegger: What I usually have

319
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.260
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

320
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:52.590
Lisa Arnegger: That was my job. Yeah. Clonidine, that's what they usually give me Clonidine I do take Gabba Penton I haven't taken it since I've been using though, but I was taking it every day.

321
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.540
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

322
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.630
Lisa Arnegger: And then

323
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.060
Lisa Arnegger: He gave me like two, but it was only like two pills just first couple of days because I was like

324
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:23.880
Lisa Arnegger: It was bad, but it was a, I think it was Klonopin SOS for anxiety, but a lot of doctors don't because it's addicting or whatever so they won't, they won't prescribe it but he did because you know I had that wasn't my drug of choice. I didn't care. You know, that wasn't my thing.

325
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.040
Lisa Arnegger: But yeah, it was I think it was like that combination and then

326
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.780
Lisa Arnegger: On it. Yeah, so I don't know but

327
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.350
Lisa Arnegger: You

328
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you normally take gabapentin for anything.

329
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.110
Lisa Arnegger: I do. I have restless leg syndrome.

330
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.210
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, yeah.

331
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: What is your dose of that.

332
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.610
Lisa Arnegger: I take their 600 milligrams, I take one in one and a half a day.

333
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.080
Lisa Arnegger: Night at night.

334
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Tonight.

335
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:10.290
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, but I haven't. Like I said, I haven't taken it. I haven't because really what what happened was I stopped the Suboxone when I got off of it. I was everything was kind of like awakened, you know, so

336
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.310
Lisa Arnegger: My legs were just it was bad. You know, I couldn't sleep at night. So I just continued to gather pin so

337
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.330
Okay.

338
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: And do you have a primary care, Doc. Who's, who's giving you that now or not. Yeah.

339
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:31.980
Lisa Arnegger: I go to Kaiser, but to be honest I be, you know, that's the only doctor that gives. That to me is the Kaiser

340
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.170
Lisa Arnegger: And then

341
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:41.790
Lisa Arnegger: That's really where I go. But I, I could go. I'm going to probably switch my care to Sutter because

342
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.620
Lisa Arnegger: I really don't like Kaiser

343
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.000
Lisa Arnegger: I'm no fan, so I know you

344
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I totally get it.

345
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:58.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's okay. I'm okay. I'm just going to write the gap or pencil in here that you have this 600 milligram, and you take one and a half at night when you're taking it.

346
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.690
Hmm, OK.

347
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:04.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK.

348
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.660
Lisa Arnegger: Or

349
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Restless Leg

350
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:13.860
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, then I think they also gave me though. Fran to for the nausea, because I was

351
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I could do that.

352
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.280
Lisa Arnegger: Growing up and

353
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:19.980
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

354
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:27.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did you so when they gave you this. Were you just trying to get off of opioids without getting on anything else.

355
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.660
Lisa Arnegger: No, it was that I was getting off opiates with a low dose of the Suboxone

356
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

357
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.040
Okay, yeah.

358
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.380
Lisa Arnegger: But I mean, I

359
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:47.910
Lisa Arnegger: I mean, I have been on it since I think it came out really. I mean, it was so long ago that they didn't even know anything about it, you know.

360
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.250
Lisa Arnegger: Really, a lot of people don't know anything about it.

361
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.890
Lisa Arnegger: You know, I really did a lot of research.

362
00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:01.230
Lisa Arnegger: To when I had my babies, because I was so scared that my babies are going to go through withdrawals and luckily they didn't but

363
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now,

364
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, we've had, I've had patients go through pregnancies with it and it's okay.

365
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:16.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: In fact, yeah, better you know withdrawal risk is much less with it, and with the methadone, which was the standard

366
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:26.580
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah yeah methadone is definitely way harder. I, I don't know. People say Suboxone is some people say methadone is everybody's different. But

367
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:35.490
Lisa Arnegger: I don't like methadone, because it just makes me so tired. Like, I cannot function on it. I cannot function. So, yeah.

368
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:41.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm okay so so allergies to many. Do you have any allergies to medication. No.

369
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:42.630
Nothing.

370
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:56.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: That down. So, yeah. So in terms of getting you on the medication, I think, yeah, we can we can give you some so friend, we can give you a Clonidine patch the 0.1 maybe

371
00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:05.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know how that works. It's a blood pressure lowering medication. So if you feel light headed, you put your legs up, you could take it off drink water, whatever.

372
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: But it can help a lot of people feel like it helps

373
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now at the same time, we don't want to like mask your symptoms because symptoms in it's time to take your men so that. Yay. So you take your med and you feel better. So

374
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:28.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's kind of like it's, I don't need you to wait. I think maybe back when you first started it, like you said, we didn't know much about it. And nowadays protocols have changed.

375
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:38.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be back when you started it. They were saying you need to have at least 12 hours or 24 hours. You don't need hours. You just need symptoms. So it doesn't

376
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:48.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's only been four hours or a day if you feel in life. I think I'm in withdrawal. It's time to take your medication and start feeling a little bit better.

377
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:56.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so you don't need to take other medication to prolong this period. You know what I'm saying.

378
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:10.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so that's why I typically don't unless someone is tapering like. So let's say you're at the end of your treatment. You're like okay, Doc, we're tapering off Suboxone. I just want to be free of this and like I'm in a good place.

379
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:26.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then I would give you the stuff because I want you to not be. I want you to try to be as comfortable as possible when you're completely done with all opiates and you know what I mean, because you're getting on something, it's going to actually make you feel normal. You should be feeling

380
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.490
Lisa Arnegger: Good.

381
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: To get on to the right dose.

382
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.300
Lisa Arnegger: OK. OK.

383
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:44.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: So don't I would say mentally like just don't anticipate mad, you're gonna you're, you may have a period, you're gonna have a period where you're uncomfortable before you start a once you start. Hopefully it just gets better and better.

384
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:54.630
Lisa Arnegger: Okay. And, like, how, how long would you recommend because I was thinking like a week or something. But you're saying like months. A couple months.

385
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I would say.

386
00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:58.020
Lisa Arnegger: Yes.

387
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:06.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: I will go, you know, Lisa. Like it's obviously it's up to you. You decide. You know how it works. You're in the healthcare field.

388
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:13.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: You have autonomy, you can decide, but I can just tell you that treating patients with this problem like

389
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:28.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Suboxone the beauty of it is that it helps your brain heal and all those receptors that are used to being you know used and then drop used in the drop all those things will normalize because this will be steady state in your bloodstream.

390
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the longer you're on it, the more like healing time you give your brain. So

391
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:42.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I know you're scared because you're like, Well, doesn't that mean if I'm on it long that I'm going to be more dependent, it's gonna be harder to get off that that's

392
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:52.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's kind of a lost cause it's gonna be you're gonna, I mean it's a withdrawal thing. It is something that causes some dependency. Not as much as heroin. It's like half as much but still

393
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's something that you know does you do go through withdrawal process when to stop it. But if we do it very slowly.

394
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like I was just

395
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Having I think it won't be as painful as what you experienced in the past.

396
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: A lot more tolerable and

397
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:23.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, you're going through all of this. My philosophy is you're going to do it, do it right you know and do it all the way and do it the way it's supposed to be, you know, helping you the best because you're going through all of this effort.

398
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:31.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just being on it for a week is that's a detox. That's not a maintenance. That's a detox. And that model.

399
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:46.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is available. I mean, you can go like, you know, you can go to inpatient and they can manage you for seven days and then let you go and give you the Suboxone just for that long, but that doesn't seem to work. People just relapse because they're craving.

400
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they don't feel good, you know,

401
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.540
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

402
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: We want to like maintain you

403
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:57.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know, philosophy, a little bit as the same philosophy as the Methadone clinic. So you were there, right. So you're

404
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:11.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Getting a dose where you're stable and staying there, you know, for a period of time while you do your psychosocial stuff where you get your life in order and you feel like, Okay, I think I have a handle. And then we lower you

405
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.890
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, okay.

406
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's my recommendation, but

407
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.690
Lisa Arnegger: No, that's fine. Yeah, yeah.

408
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

409
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:27.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yes, we'll do that in terms of you said you have medical right

410
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.500
Lisa Arnegger: Medicare and I have Express Scripts so I have Sutter and medical

411
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:40.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. Yeah. So, but for the men's from us. I think you're going to use medical have a feeling

412
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.510
Lisa Arnegger: I think. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's free.

413
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, free

414
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.150
Lisa Arnegger: The other one isn't free

415
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.180
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, there's a copay so yeah I'd rather use the free one

416
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:48.540
Lisa Arnegger: So,

417
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: We want user for us.

418
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:56.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so, so the Suboxone film, the actual film is what's covered

419
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:08.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so what I will tell you is there's if you recall, there's the two milligrams and the eight milligrams doses.

420
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:18.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: I was thinking, well, we could go with the eight milligram. And you could start with half so you take like four milligrams for your first dose.

421
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then see how you feel like you should feel a little bit better from the withdrawal that you were having

422
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:31.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then like if you feel like, Okay. Later in the day, you want to take the other half, you take the other half, and then the next morning, you can take

423
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:47.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Either half and half again. And that felt pretty okay or you could take a full dose eight milligram and then see if you need another half later in the day so that when we stick to like either eight milligrams a day or like 12 milligrams something on the lower end

424
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:55.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, he see if that holds you or if you still feel like, Gosh, I'm still thinking about it a lot of still having some cravings.

425
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.970
Lisa Arnegger: Okay yeah i wanted i was doing it in the morning and at night because at night is when I was starting to have

426
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:16.770
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, okay. I think that's the hardest for me during the day, not so much during night is when it's really hard for me because that's where my rituals, kind of like get I and go to bed. You know, so I see

427
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:35.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And when you were on Gabba Penton or you also on the Suboxone at some point, like, did you take both together. Was it okay for you because sometimes you know they say, both are sedating right so like opioids. It's a partial Suboxone

428
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.820
Lisa Arnegger: So, yes.

429
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.440
Lisa Arnegger: You are. Yeah.

430
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: That it wasn't

431
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know you're tolerating and

432
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.240
Lisa Arnegger: I was so my my tolerance. I'm very high tolerance.

433
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.470
Okay, yeah.

434
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going to say this all

435
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'll just say

436
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's just say one film.

437
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: But, you know, you start with half

438
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.030
Lisa Arnegger: Okay, I'm just gonna, like, my question is this, because

439
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:21.300
Lisa Arnegger: I have medical but it's through Kaiser medical so it would be going to the Kaiser pharmacy. Now I don't know if they if they will accept us prescription from you guys, right, because they have their own

440
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:34.440
Lisa Arnegger: They have their own substance abuse thing, but they don't even what's really fucked up. This is how fucked up Kaiser is that they have their own substance abuse program, but they don't accept people that are on medical there.

441
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:54.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, yes, I know this because like I said, I used to work there. So it was such a dilemma because we had yeah we in addiction medicine department. I could not see you. Yeah, even though you are a Kaiser member and everything else, including psychiatry, you can see in kind.

442
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:54.570
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

443
00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:07.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: You weren't able to access our services because it was carved out by the state by California that you had to go through whatever local government stuff, whatever medical stuff treatment centers.

444
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.430
Yeah.

445
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: So now I know so I know what you're saying your medical is through Kaiser

446
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:21.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so your medication, does it have to go through the Kaiser pharmacy.

447
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:29.490
Lisa Arnegger: I have no idea. I've never tried it. So, I mean, I usually go to Walgreens. So I'm wondering if you guys if you call them the prescription

448
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.870
Lisa Arnegger: Let's talk

449
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:37.590
Lisa Arnegger: To them, you can give them my medical number and see if it goes through. I don't know. I don't know how that works.

450
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.820
Yeah.

451
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:44.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: So what is this Alameda alliance is that your medical or is that the other one.

452
00:47:45.900 --> 00:48:02.910
Lisa Arnegger: That's my medical but it's not. I don't think it's Alameda, like I don't it's Kaiser medical. I don't know if you look up if you guys have the website. Do you guys have the website. The, the medical website where you can look up the you put in their social and okay

453
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't know that. But here's what I'm going to do. Let's try you've gone to Walgreens.

454
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:08.880
Before

455
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.350
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah.

456
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.630
Lisa Arnegger: What if not

457
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:21.150
Lisa Arnegger: I'll just use my other insurance but i right now. I have no money. So I'm like, completely tapped out so

458
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:29.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, Walgreens. So here's the deal. When I was at Kaiser I do remember that some patients would want to go outside Kaiser for their funds.

459
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:37.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, just possible to still run the insurance to Walgreens. You just tell them, hey, like you said, we use the other

460
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Use the medical don't use the other one, and they run that

461
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:42.990
Okay.

462
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that will be, I think,

463
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Here, I think the easiest is when you go to get it.

464
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.570
Lisa Arnegger: You go, okay.

465
00:48:51.990 --> 00:49:01.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you say, Look, guys. Can you just have two different insurances I want the one where it's covered fully. So with that, and you know, go with that.

466
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:14.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And if they if they say, well, the film is covered by medical but we can't run it, we can run the other one but you to get the cheapest, we need the tablet, we can change it, we can

467
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Her works for you.

468
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: To be as

469
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.970
Lisa Arnegger: Well, because, you know, I, I've used both insurances before where

470
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:29.970
Lisa Arnegger: One covers the the the copay of the other. You know what I mean, that's the joy of having two different insurances but so I'm sure it'll be fine.

471
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:35.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: We'll work it out. Okay, but we'll try. We'll start with this Walgreens on isn't Maori Avenue.

472
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.080
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, in Fremont. Yeah.

473
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do that.

474
00:49:43.440 --> 00:50:00.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. So I'm going to say, I'm going to give you enough for 16 milligrams, which is one film twice a day, but you can start with half of film twice a day and then work your way up to one, one in one if you feel you need to

475
00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK. OK.

476
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:02.130
OK.

477
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then in terms of group.

478
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think Friday is good.

479
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, there's a Friday for PM group.

480
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.180
Lisa Arnegger: Now, if I have to work. How does that work.

481
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:30.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's a Friday for PM Thursday 4pm I have a Monday 9am

482
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.060
Lisa Arnegger: Or sorry 10 him.

483
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.900
Lisa Arnegger: Okay. Monday at 10am

484
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, is that better for you, maybe

485
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:48.000
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah, because when I talked to my my supervisor. I'm going to go over a schedule of what days I should work like what days would fit for me. So I think what I'm going to do is

486
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.130
Lisa Arnegger: Probably do Tuesday.

487
00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:14.430
Lisa Arnegger: Wednesday Thursday. And then, and then a weekend or the weekend or something like that. I don't know, maybe like three days a week or something. So, and then I could she said we can do from like 12 to 530 or you know whatever hours to so

488
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:15.300
Okay.

489
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:28.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you can do that. And then you can choose it. Yes, so that you have Monday 10am available to do this because like I said it's an hour. So you would want to log into the virtual clinic where you did today.

490
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: At like 945 930

491
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:38.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because they will ask you to do surveys about your addiction. Like, how are you doing whatever so that takes a little bit

492
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:50.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, get it, get in early and it gets traffic, you know, like they say, okay, wait 10 minutes. There's a wait times and stuff. So just get there early 939 45 and then we'll be ready to start group at 10

493
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.940
Lisa Arnegger: So is are these other people going to be on there like other

494
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.730
Lisa Arnegger: Clients so they're going to hear all my

495
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.170
Business or

496
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's interesting.

497
00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: An interesting concept of yeah you're opening up to these strangers.

498
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:19.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's, it's, like, you know, like a recovery group, but with a doctor's visit thrown in. So yes, you get a little more intimate, perhaps, than you would in a regular there, you know, group therapy, even

499
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:39.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I tried to not go into too much detail. Like if if you are like Dr Elena. I like I'm having whatever symptoms and I just want to go into detail of you offline. So can we have an individual visit, you can always book an individual visit with me and we can talk in more detail.

500
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:40.170
Lisa Arnegger: But, you know,

501
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: In the group setting I do my best to kind of minimize

502
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:59.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: The, you know, and I just say, okay, so, you know, how's it going, I try not to reveal too much, but it is what it is. I think everyone's in it, knowing that that's part of the process that we're everything that's revealed stays in the group, nobody talks about it outside and

503
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:07.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, for the most part, I mean, I've been surprised. I was worried about that too because I'm not used to doing group doctor visits, you know,

504
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.190
Lisa Arnegger: Yeah yeah

505
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:15.900
Lisa Arnegger: And so who do I talk to about like out like the actual intensive outpatient thing. Do I talk to you about that.

506
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:21.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a good one. Um, let me see. I will say,

507
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:30.810
Lisa Arnegger: Because I was telling the ladies that I talked to the last lady that I talked to that I was reading online that they have like different therapy styles.

508
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:39.660
Lisa Arnegger: EDM or whatever he d and the Queen Quinn therapy. The horses and stuff.

509
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:46.590
Lisa Arnegger: Oh yeah, I don't know. I really want to try that stuff, you know, because it's for people with trauma, so I thought maybe would help me. I've

510
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:57.420

Dr. Belis Aladag: That's exactly what

663
01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:20.820
Lisa Arnegger: Is that

664
01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's what you're being prescribed now so it's

665
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:25.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: It is the same.

666
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:34.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's just that it has two components buprenorphine and the last one. The last one is it's not active so you can almost ignore it.

667
01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:38.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that can feel them. But don't worry about it. The reason you felt

668
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:43.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Worse is because you took it before you were in substantial withdrawal, you need to

669
01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:51.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because okay when you're when you're like, when the opioid receptors are full, like you used

670
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your yeah

671
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:53.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: They're right

672
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:59.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, yeah, slowly start going to withdraw, you start dropping out Suboxone only gets you this

673
01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So if you're up here. And then you take the swag. So you're bringing yourself.

674
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Down what you

675
01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:07.650

Lisa Arnegger: Okay.

678
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:23.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's the point. So you want to really be feeling uncomfortable, like maybe even tomorrow morning. Like, that's what I'm saying maybe tonight is even too early, like you really want to

679
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like not well, you want to be like oh god I don't feel good.

Lisa Arnegger: You know, I'm okay.

681
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm in withdrawal. I need something that's, you know, that's when you use that instead of the heroin. Right.
