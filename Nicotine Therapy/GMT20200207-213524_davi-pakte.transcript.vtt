00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.730

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.870

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:57.480
Robert Maldonado: Okay. And I've been home. I've been struggling. I've never went to a rehab. I've never tried to rehab. I've been to jail and first pretty much to quit that way and I stayed off it as soon as I got out.

12
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:13.590
Robert Maldonado: I got back on it. I've only been pretty much off from the 10 years of heroin use I've only been off for about a year and a half at all at once. From doing jail time. And that's as much as I've had. I still feel being sober.

13
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:25.590
Robert Maldonado: I still feel missing something. Now, I don't know what it is or what it was. I'm missing something though. Like, and as I'm getting high. Now, I'm not even getting high to get high.

14
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.820
Robert Maldonado: I was getting high just to feel normal. Like, because it's all I've known for so long and I just didn't ever feel normal. So

15
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.720
Robert Maldonado: I took Suboxone I've tried this a boxing. I never tried methadone or nothing else of their, their site, the ones that are

16
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.280
Robert Maldonado: To try to like when you off heroin and when do you offer that I'm going to try Suboxone. It's amazing. I'm not gonna lie, it does what it's supposed to do. It does what it says it's going to do.

17
00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:04.830
Robert Maldonado: I didn't, I didn't think about heroin at all. I didn't want to do hair when I just wanted to continue working through my day go to sleep at night, wake up. Repeat. And that was the best thing I've ever felt in the longest time I can't even remember the last time I felt that way.
