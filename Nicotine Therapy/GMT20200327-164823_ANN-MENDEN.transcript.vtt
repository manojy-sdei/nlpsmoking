ANN MENDENHALL: Alright, so I am going to go through a number of questions here and

43
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:38.130
ANN MENDENHALL: So currently, this first of all, I just sort of wanted to get the his story in terms of you know how long he's been using currently how much he's using

44
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.670
ANN MENDENHALL: And you know what what exact

45
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.390
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, drugs, he is using quantity, you know, etc, etc. So currently, what did she catch me up on on what what's going on here.

46
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.920

47
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.700
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

48
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.440

iPhone: Okay, heroin.

50
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And presumably, that's probably been cut with fentanyl because most in California happened. Do you, do you know you know

51
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.930
iPhone: It's kind of fentanyl sometimes, sometimes

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.020
iPhone: Sometimes, yeah.

54
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.860
ANN MENDENHALL: The way it is now. So, okay, two milligrams a day and

iPhone: He went right back on it. Okay.

73
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.560

74
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.520
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah.

75
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.760

Okay.

83
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.270
ANN MENDENHALL: All right, and so this is really important in terms of, you know, prescribing this Suboxone

84
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.560
ANN MENDENHALL: When exactly what is your last use of heroin.

85

88
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:47.280
ANN MENDENHALL: Be as well. The danger precipitated withdrawal. If you start Suboxone too soon after coming off heroin. It's terrible. I mean, people

89
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:58.380
ANN MENDENHALL: Tell me, they just wanted to die. It's so, so bad. And so I always want to be sure that we wait at least 24 hours. So as long as it's been 24 hours.

90
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:06.150
ANN MENDENHALL: We can go ahead and I can send a prescription for the Suboxone so you can get going on that today, and I'll describe how we do that when we get to it.

97
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:49.260
iPhone: I mean, I think he's scared that I'm going to throw them out. I have a habit of not dealing with their crap. Very well. But obviously, I'm not going to do that now. You know what I mean, I think, yeah, he's trying hard not to be agitated, but he is agitated.

98
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Sure. I mean, that's, that's just one of the withdrawal symptoms.

ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

329
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:30.330

330
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.070

333
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.090
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And so I'm assuming he's pretty restless to that on a zero.

iPhone: Obviously want that and

357
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.280
iPhone: I know you are screwed over more

358
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:09.720
iPhone: I'm sure, like, you know, you just do the best you can. Okay.

359
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.730
iPhone: Okay. The good news is, this is going to end.

360
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.650
iPhone: Yes, keep thinking about that. Okay.

361
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.040
ANN MENDENHALL: It is going to end and you don't have to go through this again.

362
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.010
iPhone: Yeah, you don't have to do this again.

363
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.590
Okay, so let's put this in here.

364
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.660
iPhone: Ok ok ok

365
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.830
ANN MENDENHALL: OK, and so I am going to

366
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.730
ANN MENDENHALL: Describe what we're going to do with the Suboxone here.

367
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.280
ANN MENDENHALL: What we do I

368
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.290
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you know if you receive I'm holding this up to the camera.

369
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.140
ANN MENDENHALL: Have you received one of these by email.

370
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.430
iPhone: Now,

371
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:31.020
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, I'm gonna hit when we get done here. If you call the virtual clinic backup and ask them to send you that you pornography induction.

372
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.460
ANN MENDENHALL: So that's

373
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:38.910
ANN MENDENHALL: What I write that down. And I'm going to also tell them, but this way, it will kind of make sure you get it.

374
00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:40.920
iPhone: Okay, and what is it called again.

375
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.690
ANN MENDENHALL: It's called the

376
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Be buprenorphine. We'll just say Suboxone induction.

377
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.700
iPhone: Okay protocol. Okay.

378
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:55.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so how how this is going to work is I'm going to prescribe

379
00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:02.490
ANN MENDENHALL: The Suboxone strips. Has he ever taken Suboxone before on the streets or any place.

380
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.810
iPhone: I've ever taken on streets.

381
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.490
iPhone: No.

382
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.620
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so I'm assuming. His, His ensure what kind of insurance does he have

383
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:29.970
ANN MENDENHALL: Medicaid. Okay. So I think that will cover the Suboxone films or strips. If not, they'll, they'll fill it with tablets, but it's the same medication. So it's a combination. Excuse me. A buprenorphine in the locks on

384
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.510
ANN MENDENHALL: The lock zone is a medication that's in Norco

385
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.080
ANN MENDENHALL: It will keep him safe.

386
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:47.280
ANN MENDENHALL: Wow, so sorry. And so what we do is we kind of start a little more slowly. And I'm glad you're there, because you can help them with this induction.

387
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.980
ANN MENDENHALL: And so

388
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.150
ANN MENDENHALL: I am going to, let's see.

389
00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:10.140
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, I'm going to prescribe the eight milligrams with two grams a day of hair when he's probably going to need up to maybe 16 milligrams a day, but we don't go there right away because you know that can be dangerous. So

390
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:19.320
ANN MENDENHALL: I'm going to prescribe the eight milligram two milligrams strips. That's what you'll pick up and you don't have to remember this. That's just what the I'm just telling you what I'm prescribing

391
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:31.230
ANN MENDENHALL: And so what I want you to do is put half to strip kind of here, you know, so it's sort of between Dilip and in the

392
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.970
iPhone: The tongue teeth like

393
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.050
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, and

394
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:44.370
ANN MENDENHALL: And and so it has to stay there and dissolve because if not swallowed. It's not going to work in particular with him, you know, vomiting, you know it.

395
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:53.790
ANN MENDENHALL: But it's, it doesn't work in the stomach. It has to dissolve right into the bloodstream and so make sure that he doesn't really eat anything a little water is ok but

396
00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:04.230
ANN MENDENHALL: Nothing to eat or nothing else besides a little water to drink for 30 minutes before he takes it in 30 minutes after just because we want to get maximum absorption

397
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.580
iPhone: For him right sure that

398
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.850
ANN MENDENHALL: He gets you know relief as soon as possible. Okay.

399
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.040
iPhone: And so

400
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:24.330
ANN MENDENHALL: He will start out with taking half a tab or half a strap and you know wait an hour or so and see how he's doing if he's still in bad shape which I presume he will be give him the other half.

401
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:41.700
ANN MENDENHALL: And so at that point he will have had eight milligrams within an hour or two. You can wait one hour or two hours, but I really think based on his symptoms. Right now you're going to be fine to give it after one hour and that will, like I said, given relief sooner.

402
00:35:42.960 --> 00:36:01.440
ANN MENDENHALL: And then wait another couple of hours and you can give them another half strip and so that would be a total of 12 milligrams. For the first day because each strip is eight milligrams. So you're giving half a strip half a STRIP, STRIP.

403
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Right. So that's all for today. Okay.

404
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.710
ANN MENDENHALL: And and then tomorrow if the 12 milligrams helped, but still not quite enough.

405
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:21.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Will know that he probably is going to need 16 milligrams and so tomorrow. And if that's the case, you can give them eight milligrams in the morning.

406
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:32.220
ANN MENDENHALL: And eight milligrams later on in the day afternoon or evening. This medication last for 36 hours in the system. So, actually.

407
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:44.760
ANN MENDENHALL: Some people just decide to take the entire dose in the morning for the day. But a lot of people. And I think many people who, you know, have had some addiction issues feel like

408
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:59.550
ANN MENDENHALL: It's going to run out and they need more. And this is particularly true for people who've been taking Norco and Percocet and opiate pills, because that's how they work. They're short acting. This is long acting, but I find that most people do a lot better if they divide the dose up and

409
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.990
iPhone: Uptake like you know

410
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:09.900
ANN MENDENHALL: eight in the morning eight me afternoon, if he can get by on 12 milligrams, that's great because it's a kind of medication you take too much.

411
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:18.600
ANN MENDENHALL: And it just sort of makes you sleepy but it's not going to make you high, you can take as much as you want. You're not going to get high. You're just going to get sort of

412
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:28.320
ANN MENDENHALL: groggy and out of it not feel that great. If you take the appropriate dose. It's going to make you feel normal. And it's, it's going to

413
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:38.160
ANN MENDENHALL: Be in your system for a while. So I I'm finding people who take as much as Gabriel has been taking up here. When per day or more

414
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:54.510
ANN MENDENHALL: And they usually all do just great on 60 milligrams. So I'm going to give you enough for a couple of weeks. So, you know, we'll have like maybe a total probably will give you a see

415
00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.630
ANN MENDENHALL: 10 enough for 10 days and then the way that this works with

416
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:13.470
ANN MENDENHALL: With bright heart health is to get future refills. You need to come to a group. And so right now we have a Wednesday evening group, but pretty soon.

417
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:24.450
ANN MENDENHALL: I think in the little later in April. We're going to be changing people to a Friday morning. And so that would be the group. I'd like him in, but he can come

418
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:35.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Next week and check in with us. He's probably not going to be out of his he shouldn't be out of his meds by by next Wednesday. But at least I'll have a chance to check in.

419
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:42.360
ANN MENDENHALL: He can also you know if there's any problems. Any issues. Any questions you can always schedule an appointment.

420
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:56.460
ANN MENDENHALL: With me as a med follow up with 30 minute med follow up and then we can discuss any issues that are going on. I'm only here. I won't be available next Wednesday. But I will be next Thursday and Friday morning. Should you need to do that.

421
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.240
iPhone: I think

422
00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:14.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Like I said, I work full time at at three drug and alcohol rehab facility. So I have very limited available availability on soon, but I want to make sure he's doing okay if for some reason he can't get in to see me and he needs to see somebody, you know, just tell the virtual clinic that

423
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:21.840
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, they'll try and put them with me and that he'd be willing to to see another provider because

424
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.230
iPhone: There's

425
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:30.870
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, several California providers that that could help there. So I'm going to have them send this to you. It looks like a little cartoon thing but

426
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:39.270
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it was just something that you can kind of refer to. But so could you just sort of tell me exactly how you're going to dose it for him today.

427
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:51.300
iPhone: When I pick it up on my give them half a strip. Yep. And then I'm going to wait and then give him the other half the strip

428
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.010
ANN MENDENHALL: And how long will you wait

429
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.080
iPhone: A couple hours.

430
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:55.980
Yeah.

431
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:06.360
iPhone: And then the last strip will be like this evening, yes trip last half a stroke rehab strips today.

432
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:11.130
ANN MENDENHALL: Perfect. Exactly. And then tomorrow if the three half strips did it and he feels great.

433
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.570
ANN MENDENHALL: Then

434
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.560
ANN MENDENHALL: That's his dose.

435
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:25.200
ANN MENDENHALL: But if he doesn't, and I think that's likely that he's going to need more then you can start out with eight milligrams in the morning. Once one full strip and then one full strip, you know, in the evening.

436
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:31.530
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and then I'd also going to prescribe the XO friend and that's for the nausea and vomiting.

437
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.410
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and I'll send that to you.

438
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.750
ANN MENDENHALL: Perfect. So do you have either one of you have any other questions.

439
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.760
iPhone: Do you have any questions on Suboxone when I get Suboxone

440
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:51.900
ANN MENDENHALL: When well I'm going to send it right now. And like within the five minutes. And so it just depends on how long it takes your

441
00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:03.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Pharmacy to fill it. And I'm going to send them a little note and say that this is urgent that you're in extreme withdrawals and hopefully that will speed them up.

442
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Perfect. Okay.

443
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:10.170
ANN MENDENHALL: Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Any, anything else I can do for you.

444
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.050
iPhone: So when does he check in for group next week.

445
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.460
ANN MENDENHALL: Is it yes he should when you're done here.

446
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:30.360
ANN MENDENHALL: Call the virtual clinic back up again and say that I'd like him to be in the Wednesday night group for now, but he eventually will be in the Friday morning group.

447
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:46.290
ANN MENDENHALL: So he can come next Wednesday night, and so they can get that setup for you. And the other thing that needs to happen at some point once he's through the withdrawals. This doesn't have to happen. Obviously this week, the other wreck.
