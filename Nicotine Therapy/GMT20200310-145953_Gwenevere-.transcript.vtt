00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning.

2
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.680
Angelina C: How are you

3
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I had a last minute cancellation. So I reached out to you. I'm glad you were able to meet last minute and that's a pretty rare thing. Um, but what's been going on, you missed yesterday you missed this morning, what's going on.

4
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:56.250
Angelina C: Yes. Okay, so it's it's all has to. This is why I was going to go to the doctors. This is what they keep saying that my direct screen is it tricor since last month.

5
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.370
Angelina C: And I didn't point. I went, Wednesday, Friday, and I went yesterday morning to get my drug screening. And then finally, I went yesterday before I had to run into work.

6
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.680
Angelina C: And I just, I left it there because I said he says, I'm going to call them. I said, Okay, I said, I'm just gonna go ahead and pee because they say that it's here. It's been here since last month.

7
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.110
Angelina C: And then I got a phone call at five. And they said, no, that you there's absolutely nothing over there. Okay, so I went with my doctors today.

8
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.430
Okay I invited

9
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A physician in to join us today to assess how you're doing on your medication and see if if she can offer any information around what you're describing, I'm not in the loop around pieces like that.

10
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But I imagine that's pretty confusing and this program is supposed to be an easy process.

11
00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sounds like there's something that's making it a challenge for you. And I'd like to know what that is. So I don't know if it's at the faxes and they are someone mean there's a lot of people involved. Now I can't tell what the problem is. It's

12
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.800
Angelina C: Well, like Wednesday when I had my meeting with you. I had, I had said I would be there I go right after our meeting so right before I went to work.

13
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.690
Angelina C: I was sitting there for 45 minutes and I said, I can't wait. And so I left.

14
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.940
Angelina C: And they and they you guys keep seeing Angelina, everybody says there's a drug screening there since last month for me.

15
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:31.140
Angelina C: There's absolutely no dirt screen there. So every so I went again on Friday. There was still nothing. So I went again yesterday morning, nothing. So I went yesterday afternoon and I thought I could solve it and

16
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.200
Angelina C: And and you guys are seeing the bright heart health, Angelina, saying that there's been one since last month. So when I go to do it I it's been since last Wednesday.

17
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.310
Angelina C: So I canceled my doctor's appointment Friday with you or with my doctor because I you and I had talked

18
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:58.200
Angelina C: And we decided that I was just going to stay with you guys and we're going to work it out this way, but then when I go to do music screen. I don't have my meds today because I don't. I couldn't join group because I didn't have my drug screen.

19
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Well, that's why you're here today. Okay, I'm going to try and help with that.

20
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

21
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay here for with me for 45 minutes let's do some of the psychotherapy piece and then right at the end. Let's see if we can address what's going on with medication. I did ask for the physician to come in here today.

22
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: because something's I don't

23
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I've literally can't help. I don't. That's not I'm over here in Florida. I don't understand.

24
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.900
Angelina C: It's just frustrating. That's the reason that I was just going to do it all one stop at my clinic.

25
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:44.070
Angelina C: And then when we talked. I said, Yeah, that's fine. We'll just do it this way. It's always with the drug screening. So my doctor even said to though when you guys need one. I can always just go right there to her.

26
00:03:44.640 --> 00:04:00.210
Angelina C: Right, so anything is that I am taking Sudafed right now though, and for my cold, so do anything. Okay, just let because I'm gonna put my headphones in. Because every time I get a text or something from what my phone goes low. Okay.

27
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.680
Angelina C: Here we go.

28
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And your phones charged

29
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.120
Angelina C: It's charged 99% fantastic. Okay.

30
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so let me just see what she's

31
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.030
Angelina C: Writing

32
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This to see a she might be in a in an appointment right now. Let me just see what she says.

33
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it's one conversation away if it's one little thing away you know it'd be nice to have you know you getting the services in one place with us. But let's just see if she

34
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:43.890
Angelina C: That's as well. It's frustrating for me. It's been like this every since we've, I've come back out here, huh, and it hurts, because I can't join group. And that's what I told him yesterday, just really hurts my feelings. I can't join

35
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.860
Angelina C: I could see if it was my fault.

36
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.590
Angelina C: I would take the blame.

37
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.920
Alright, let's see if I can get ahold of her

38
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gonna mute myself for a sec.

39
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Join us

40
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to see if she can help elucidate what's going on.

41
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you've worked with Dr. Rob rail before. Correct.

42
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.430
Angelina C: Um,

43
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.530
Angelina C: Why

44
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Long gray hair.

45
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.240
Angelina C: I might have way been in the beginning.

46
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.150
Angelina C: But it's really system doctor on mine, but I'm probably

47
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

48
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.890
Angelina C: If not,

49
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll meeting, she's been here.

50
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The longest she's the one that started with the owner

51
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:45.900
Angelina C: So she's been here. I'm glad you got you reached out to me. I was actually going to text you that I made. I just made made a doctor's appointment, because they couldn't get me until next Tuesday. But with lupus is I get the kind of like where I get squeezed in

52
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:54.210
Angelina C: With the stuff so cheap I call today and my doctor was gonna let me in there because I said, Can I just do my drug screen there so you guys can get it.

53
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.520
Angelina C: So, okay.

54
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so Dr. Gabriel

55
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to come on to video and all. Oh, there you are. Okay, excellent.

56
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and Angelina, this is Dr brielle

57
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to introduce you to she's been here with Braveheart since it all got started and there is some some confusion. I think I'm the one that's confused.

58
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And mostly me

59
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But it almost sounds like Angelina is about to leave because of what's happening with the drug screens is getting

60
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So challenging such an obstacle such a barrier that she's I think if I'm not misrepresenting you'll correct me. It's so cumbersome. She's about to go get her medication elsewhere.

61
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm wondering if you with your eyes can see where the breakdown is happening. My second hand information and you'll correct me Angelina is

62
00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about. Hey Angelina, that's the message bright heart is sending. Hey Angelina, there has been a drug screen waiting for you at try core for blah blah amount of time to the point that she's not lead into group possibly when

63
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.890
Angelina C: Yeah, I was yesterday I was still hurt. Yeah, because I can't join group.

64
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.680
Angelina C: Okay, because I don't have my drug screening

65
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or cake. The hurt. We're just going to put over here.

66
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:20.790
Angelina C: Yeah.

67
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is just you talking about 9am

68
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Okay, so that's the part I'm confused. This is where I am ignorant and I'm not trying to be the centerpiece of this. I just were about to loser.

69
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I don't understand what the barrier is what is try core is this our go to. Can you see if there is a drug screen waiting and it's been there for a month. Like, I don't get it.

70
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.250
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I see two of them. One for December and one for

71
00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:02.130
Dawn Abriel: February. So Angelina, have you not received in the mail the cups.

72
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.800
Angelina C: No, I haven't. I

73
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:12.240
Dawn Abriel: That's the problem. That is the the main problem for some reason they do not have an accurate address

74
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:27.360
Dawn Abriel: And so by law. We have to have the results of the drug screen on record in order to be compliant with the regulations for running an opioid use disorder program so

75
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:37.560
Dawn Abriel: It's incumbent upon you. You're the one who needs to go to the virtual clinic and say this is it cannot be a post office box. It has

76
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.300
Angelina C: That's all I have. Because we live in the mountains where we get mail well

77
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.770
Dawn Abriel: You gotta figure something out where you have an address. Okay.

78
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

79
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

80
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just breathe. Everybody breed. There's more information. There's more

81
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So Angelina has been going to try our twice. She has canceled doctors appointment. She has creating the space for this extra effort kind of what you're describing, Dr. Rob real she's doing it and it's still coming back. There's no drug screen sitting, I try

82
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.710
Dawn Abriel: So I have another question.

83
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.490
Dawn Abriel: Nina.

84
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:24.990
Dawn Abriel: Have you told tricor that they must facts, the results too bright heart health.

85
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:34.500
Angelina C: They I've done it there before with them. I've used try quote here. I've been out here since December. I've used them plenty of times I just understand when I go in there. There's never a thing there.

86
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.640
Angelina C: Ever fun. There's no yeah there's nothing there for me.

87
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.480
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

88
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.620
Angelina C: That there's a kind of funny.

89
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.700
Dawn Abriel: Right, right.

90
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:58.050
Dawn Abriel: Right heart health has a contract with quest not try core. So when you go into try core, you have to have, you have to stay there call bright heart health and say, Please fax over an order.

91
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:07.830
Dawn Abriel: And then they do it and then you do the test and you have to tell try core facts this the results too bright heart health.

92
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.330
Angelina C: If you don't have that.

93
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.620
Dawn Abriel: Same gym.

94
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:23.580
Angelina C: He's the same gentleman. I've been working with. That's why he knows he called you guys yesterday there was no doctor available yesterday when I was there, there was not even a doctor available to even write the orders and you guys say there's seven there there's not any there.

95
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.940
Angelina C: There's absolutely no nothing there for me.

96
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.680
Angelina C: I'm looking at an

97
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.390
Angelina C: Order. We could even call them now.

98
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.960
Dawn Abriel: It says, try core reference labs.

99
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.120
Angelina C: I'm sure they'll

100
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:42.960
Dawn Abriel: Handle and it's right here to 17 it's it's just waiting there so

101
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.320
Dawn Abriel: I've been three times since last week.

102
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.810
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so that was ridiculous Friday.

103
00:11:49.380 --> 00:12:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so trying more. There's a communication gap. That sounds like happy between tricor and bright heart. Something's happening. There's already referral. What I wonder is, if it's sitting in. Is there a central database, you've mentioned that before, Doc, where there's a son.

104
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.670
Dawn Abriel: Oh, no.

105
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.930
Dawn Abriel: Only for Christ.

106
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.820
Dawn Abriel: Okay, nevermind. For try or

107
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I don't understand is how on the phone without schlepping all the way down there, Angelina, being able to get on the phone was trying for and saying, please check because I'm on I'm I've already spoken and bright heart health, you should be in receipt of the referral.

108
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.740
Dawn Abriel: No, that won't work going to do. Sorry. Love it. That's not how it works.

109
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.900
Dawn Abriel: Bright heart health has two facts to try core

110
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't they just

111
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it.

112
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand why it hasn't

113
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Already been done.

114
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:45.660
Dawn Abriel: Why it says that's because tricor is used by 1% of the clientele.

115
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.060
Dawn Abriel: So are not an automatic thing.

116
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Our Care navigators right now. Couldn't do it right now. They're the does it require you to press a button. Dr. All I meant to say go, does it have to come from try for requesting it

117
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.460
Dawn Abriel: Like, do you see, oh, no, it has to come from and

118
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:14.130
Dawn Abriel: Angelina telling the virtual clinic people that

119
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:22.290
Dawn Abriel: She's getting her urine drug screen done please fax over the order to try core

120
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.320
Dawn Abriel: And they don't even know there's something there.

121
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:35.550
Angelina C: Even though there's something sitting there, though you guys say there's still something there. Why don't they accepting my. I mean, I'm not getting I couldn't even go to, I don't, I don't understand it.

122
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:48.540
Dawn Abriel: The care coordinator. Yeah, this is, I think there's a lack of communication. I don't know if the care coordinators didn't know how to find the order I mean it really they're literally I'm looking at in their pre orders here.

123
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We go in there. Can we all go in there and talk with someone and just get this done.

124
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.470
Dawn Abriel: We're about to lose let's let's let's ask

125
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.900
Dawn Abriel: Let's ask and

126
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask someone to come in here and join us because

127
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.000
Dawn Abriel: I will. Okay, that'd be great. Thank you.

128
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Angelina, let's, we're going to get right in it. Let's because this is too many chiefs in the kitchen. So the way I see it.

129
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it's just a matter of type, type, type done like that. That just seems like

130
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:28.980
Angelina C: Because I know I got a voicemail yesterday from the lab and they were sick that he did get ahold of you guys but there wasn't a doctor. Right. The there wasn't a doctor to write the order for it.

131
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And what Dr. Our real

132
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Estate clients already sitting there in place. That's what I'm hearing. It's already sitting there.

133
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.250
Angelina C: That's a yeah that's what bright horse how saying, but they don't have it.

134
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.270
Angelina C: For some reason, and this is this

135
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.140
Angelina C: Are you seeing that tricor doesn't have right

136
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:52.560
Angelina C: They don't have any orders. Correct. And then when they called you guys yesterday there was a doctor, but they were in the meeting, so they couldn't send it

137
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: couldn't send it that makes

138
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:55.560
Dawn Abriel: Does

139
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't make

140
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.300
Angelina C: Sense when

141
00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: They couldn't send the order

142
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, don't need a doctor.

143
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That something's always put a pin in it and get more information. It sounds like the breakdown just found it might be right in here in the care navigator space. Let's just see what's about to happen.

144
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 58300 130 to

145
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.090
6132

146
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.390
Dawn Abriel: Well, that, that just must be a real hassle, they have to go to the lab each month.

147
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.000
Angelina C: You know,

148
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.860
Dawn Abriel: I I've been going

149
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:55.230
Angelina C: I'm not an act. See this is and then now I'm having car trouble. But no, I'm in Edgewood and see I can go to first choice. I've even said, I do my drug screening there my doctor has no problem with that she had nothing nothing problems with that. So I can even do a map first choice.

150
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.620
Angelina C: If that's because I think Dr Alamein said you guys are connected with first choice. That's why I got a doctor there.

151
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.160
Dawn Abriel: Were no we're not connected

152
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.630
Angelina C: Except if

153
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.910
Dawn Abriel: It was connections that you guys or

154
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.710
Angelina C: Is it an

155
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.720
Dawn Abriel: Urgent Care. It's a doctor's office.

156
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.830
Angelina C: Oh, OK. So it's lab, it's everything.

157
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:35.790
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, if you've got your drug screen done there. And you said please fax it to bright heart health. That's good enough. That's all you need. But you still will if you're if the doctor at first choice will will order one monthly than your home free.

158
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.020
Angelina C: Okay, but if you if you

159
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.670
Have an appointment at 1130

160
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.340
Dawn Abriel: Okay, if you need

161
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:53.490
Dawn Abriel: If you need bright heart health input that that's where it does get very confusing when people use a different lab.

162
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.330
Dawn Abriel: Other than quest so

163
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anybody get ahold of you.

164
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.930
I remember

165
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.780
Dawn Abriel: She says,

166
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:08.850
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

167
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:18.870
Dawn Abriel: Who Angelina must be trying to get in. Okay. All right. Um, I think I would see her manage participants. Yeah.

168
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Angela. The gal that's going to join us as the same first name as you so that's going to get a little confusing.

169
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.330
Angelina C: Oh wait, just come in G.

170
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.060
Angelina C: OK, I am at all. You can just call me Angie. That's what I go by.

171
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. I'm gonna call you Angie. Thank you for that.

172
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is how it's going to sound off. I'm going to say, hey, is there already a referral in there and Angie, where is it

173
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to go ahead and let's just follow through this one time with it all the way over to because she's here all the way to try core. Is that what we're going to follow through with right now.

174
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:57.750
Angelina C: Because I can tell her, or I could I could do it it but first choice day. It doesn't either or it doesn't. I'm going to be out anyway so

175
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.120
Angelina C: I know, but we've kind of need that first choice.

176
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.160
Dawn Abriel: It's up to you. I can go to

177
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.660
Dawn Abriel: Whoops.

178
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean rewriting something. So, all right.

179
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.760
Dawn Abriel: Not, not if, if the first choice doctor and you can give the first choice. Dr.

180
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.600
Dawn Abriel: My phone number, if you want.

181
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.950
Because

182
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:34.470
Dawn Abriel: If, if he or she needs to know that it has to be done every month. I think that would be the easiest thing for you is if that doctor said, Okay, once a month, I will get a drug, I will order a drug screen for you.

183
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.820
Angelina C: Okay, so

184
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we all in agreement, because we need to pick one.

185
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Place so that everyone's on the same page. We can document it. And everyone's doing the same thing, we're all in agreement first choice is going to be the provider of the drug screening

186
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.480
Angelina C: Is

187
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the request the referral going to be

188
00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Initiated from bright heart. That's what I'm wondering, because we have Angelina, and now here is a new referral needed. We're not going to analyze the breakdown at this point we're going to move forward with a new plan so is a new roof for referral needed for a drug screen. Just checking.

189
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To first choice.

190
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not.

191
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:35.490
Dawn Abriel: So Angelina, when I look in Cary. Oh, and I go to labs and studies I see to pending drug abuse panel waiting there. So those could have been used when she went to try core yesterday. I don't understand why these weren't just automatically sent to try core for her.

192
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.420
Angelina - CCT: Oh, actually, a good morning Dr rail.

193
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:51.540
Angelina - CCT: Right, okay. Actually, Dr. I resent the facts. I mean, the lab order yesterday to try core because the deuce barisan who called us yesterday and gave

194
00:19:51.570 --> 00:20:02.880
Angelina - CCT: Gave the fax number so I resent it. So I already received a message from our essential that it was sent or SUCCESSFULLY SENT yesterday.

195
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:26.610
Dawn Abriel: So somehow the patient got the message that it couldn't be done. And so she's really frustrated and because she has to get it done every month as appeal box right we're thinking that. I mean, it really is up to you. Angelina, whether you want to use.

196
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Angie Angie Angie Angie, the client.

197
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.160
And you

198
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.110
Angelina - CCT: Okay.

199
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:42.870
Dawn Abriel: First choice or if you want right heart health to generate it. But again, if you ask very hard health to generate it

200
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:55.230
Dawn Abriel: Someone's got to communicate with bright heart health to fax them over the order. So it sounds like it would be easiest if you can get the provider it first choice to order it every month.

201
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.790
Okay.

202
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:07.830
Angelina - CCT: All right, so whatever you I mean whatever you request Dr rail then Google to that. So since

203
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We have the address right now. Can we knock this out and have a have a plan in place.

204
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.610
Angelina - CCT: Okay, sure.

205
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Angie, do you have an address.

206
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.540
Angelina - CCT: gadget.

207
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.220
Angelina C: First choice.

208
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:28.350
Dawn Abriel: Well, she she shouldn't need it all she really needs is to tell first choice to fax the results too bright. It hotel.

209
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.370
Angelina C: Okay.

210
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're saying

211
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That forevermore. The bright heart health, and does not need a referral for a lab coming from us. She will just be told, please get a month free drug screen. She goes into first choice gets it done and has it faster Breitbart

212
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not

213
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.720
Dawn Abriel: You can talk if she can talk her doctor into generating net order instead of great heart health.

214
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.950
Angelina C: Okay, do you mean by that generate

215
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's a loose end right there. I can

216
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.400
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so

217
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.650
Dawn Abriel: Bright heart health.

218
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.000
Dawn Abriel: Generating making an order.

219
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.930
Dawn Abriel: Your private doctor at first choice.

220
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:17.130
Dawn Abriel: Would have to make the order and then you do the drug screen and then it gets fax to bright heart health.

221
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:33.360
Dawn Abriel: If your doctor is willing to do that. If not, we're happy to do it. It's just an extra step and if your primary if that doctor at first choice doesn't have a problem with doing it each month, then that would be easiest for you.

222
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.120
Angelina C: Okay, I have an appointment 1130 so I don't see why it wouldn't be she was on board with it earlier.

223
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.120
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so all you need now is the fax number for bright hotel.

224
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have that

225
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.430

Dawn Abriel: legal technicality. You just have to say it's okay if we talked to this doctor that we get the results. It's, you know, one of those

237
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.480
Dawn Abriel: silly thing. OK.

248
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.460
Dawn Abriel: Because they will send them to you.

279
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: For what's called a ROI release of information. It allows your primary care physician to send that lab work too bright heart health. That's

280
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Protected health care information if consents and releases that information to be sent to bribe her health. She won't send it, she will not send that lab work for office staff won't send it without a release.

Angelina - CCT: Yes.

282
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:36.510

Gwenevere Abriel: Here your energies, a little

343
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Low and it makes sense right

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.850

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's make the most out of the time that we do have here and

350
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk a little bit about, let's review, maybe some of the stuff that we covered last time.

351
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a chance to to use any of the belly breathing. Have you noticed for a lot of people. That's where they start

352
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:57.150
Angelina C: Yes, worth it. And when I do use it, I have to say, since I have been doing that.

353
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:04.680
Angelina C: Works been going a lot more smooth like i'm i'm really, it's really going good. Now we have a meeting this week so

354
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:10.590
Angelina C: You know I what I decided to do the other day is like instead of people taking it upon themselves and running and tattling

355
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:19.890
Angelina C: I just go up because we're there 30 minutes early to get an AR register. So I just go check whatever that they are not doing before me, like when they complain about the bathrooms, or whatever.

356
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.270
Angelina C: So I went in there and I took the grown other day and it was a mess. And I said, I said, See

357
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:35.160
Angelina C: I so I just follow them through with the things that are bothering me not anybody else. Okay. And when I get there early. I just walked through and I let them know it's bothering me if they could work as a team on it.

358
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.170
And that seems to be there.

359
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To hearing you.

360
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.580
Angelina C: They're receptive. Yeah.

361
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:48.510
Angelina C: It is. It's what's what's hard as the morning crew. The kids are young are so young.

362
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.520
Angelina C: Yeah, they're like 18 yeah they're really young, so

363
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't, they don't take pride in their work, you know,

364
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.530
Angelina C: No, no, no, no, no. I hear that

365
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, it's been a lot

366
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's let me just take a peek at what we what we had done last time I'm looking at a prior note. Um, I was sick on Sunday.

367
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: blood work going to try for today and get it done instead of Friday have an appointment yesterday there forever.

368
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.310
Hello reviewed dead.

369
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.010
Okay.

370
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.090
Ah, oh

371
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.210
I see something did we start that

372
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We did, you know, we, um,

373
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We started to develop that anchor real a little bit. We had just started

374
00:32:52.650 --> 00:33:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now on a zero to 10 distress level, how much distress to you in right now because I know you haven't had your medicine. This morning how distressed because it tends to last about 24 hours, how

375
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:12.330
Angelina C: I'm okay. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not feeling anything I I'm not feeling it that I don't, I'm not having it but

376
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:22.860
Angelina C: It doesn't give me the I've usually when I take all my meds. In the morning are getting kind of just like a but I'm six still too, so I don't feel it, really. I guess I mean all of it, but

377
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

378
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Then let's go ahead, first are developing this anchor them a little bit. Let's see how far we get because we were just starting to

379
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can prop me up somewhere. So you're not holding on to me. I don't know.

380
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: On a bookshelf or

381
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that.

382
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.510
Angelina C: I can do over here.

383
00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:01.590
Angelina C: To do it this way just because of my headphones, because of the when the phone rings. I can't hear you. After that, for seven days and

384
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want, you can put yourself on Do Not Disturb under the settings that might also help

385
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.330
Angelina C: I do the same thing. Oh.

386
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.830
Angelina C: That's what I do when I go into groups. And that's a good idea. Yeah, do that cuz

387
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

388
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't want to do it right now. You don't want to

389
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:26.280
Angelina C: Put it on. Do Not Disturb I can try. I don't know how I can try. I have the ring off. But let me see. I just only issue here. Hold on me see.

390
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll still get the buzzing

391
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.750
Angelina C: Well I okay hold on. Whoops. Hold on. Stay there. I'm here.

392
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you

393
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.910
Angelina C: Get logged out you just log back in

394
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't take it personally.

395
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.280
Angelina C: I would do not disturb

396
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.670
Angelina C: Yep, that's one understanding is probably okay. Okay. Beautiful. Here we go, let's try them.

397
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.470
Angelina C: What

398
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Flooring had to do with

399
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You identify yes I continue to have what you identified as being blocked around an anger issue right there was some

400
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Domestic violence that started at about age 21

401
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You've had some some hurt from an infidelity. And then there's this coming up husband on the road in Texas.

402
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A sense of being criticized recently was a recent trigger around how you drive that was a recent trigger

403
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there was a mention of some Lucas. I don't think I oh now I remember what happened.

404
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some much right on your mind that it was like okay I couldn't start developing the room because it was more like

405
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to be heard. You don't mean because there's not a lot of people that can kind of really hear what you're going through. So check in with yourself, energy and see

406
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel better. You kind of venting and letting out the concerns going on or starting to develop one of these anchor rooms with me. We feel better.

407
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.040
Angelina C: I think when we meet next because I did that one time, I know it's and I noticed because I

408
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:25.380
Angelina C: I let things build. So I think one day you'll just hear me, and I'll just go on and I feel bad because I think I did that to Jessica. I just went on and I'd be one here, and I'd be way over here and I come back and be way over here.

409
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.620
Angelina C: I just and she did. She let me for like 30 minutes just

410
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:41.790
Angelina C: And I just let it all out. So that helps it does, but I, I just, I think it's because I do hold so much and I don't have friends to talk to you. Yeah. So I think when. Yeah. So when I get in there. I'll just be

411
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.830
Angelina C: Like okay,

412
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you want to do today. Do you want to because your energies, a little lower. This might be good timing to actually kind of slow down and do a little bit of the development of the anchor room. What do you think

413
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.220
Angelina C: Can try that. That'll work.

414
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.110
Angelina C: See what happens. Yeah, so

415
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what, what would feel different about today for you is probably it'll be a short answer, you'll just answer my next question. Because I've got question after question after question. And basically, it will guide us through the development of this imaginary room.

416
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a story. It's just a response. That's what will feel different for you. Normally, you'll

417
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your typical way, I think, is to share and then you share why you shared that and then why you shared that and then you why you shared that and what's connected to this connection up today would just be

418
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Response and then my next question. And then your response. Okay. It'll be like a little volley back and forth. Is that going to be okay.

419
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.000
Angelina C: Okay.

420
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see how it goes. Here we go.

421
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So if the, the challenge that for you is still around this anger piece.

422
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And we were trying to identify how old this was my think let me go up in my notes and see if we identified how old

423
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:07.230
I can't see how old might have been 21 maybe might have been the youngest age.

424
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:14.160
Angelina C: Like the abuse. I'll say that you started with my mom's girlfriends. When we were younger.

425
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:24.690
Angelina C: The two things are different, like I did have infidelity. And I did have verbal abuse with my husband and stuff too, but my mom's girlfriends used to beat me. My brother.

426
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.920
Angelina C: However, that

427
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, how

428
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.560
Angelina C: I was in kindergarten. Okay.

429
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there.

430
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put age five. So the only time this exercise we're going to do is not about a memory. This is really different. There's total of three things that will be reliant on memory already did one that was age done and then it's going to be. Did you have a nickname at age five.

431
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.240
Angelina C: Janina yeah

432
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.040
Angelina C: Hold on Janina

433
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:54.270
Angelina C: Yes, these

434
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.550
And then you, Roy.

435
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And now now.

436
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

437
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And now notice how hard it is. Right. You want to tell me a story.

438
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So hard. I know.

439
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But we will, we won't be able to get this exercise because this is all I'm asking is, your age and a nickname.

440
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the only memory.

441
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's one more that will happen much further into this exercise. The rest of it is not you forcing yourself to pull a memory up. It is not that it is from the right side of the brain. It is the creative imaginary response. Now, hold on.

442
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a combination of something that comes up for you.

443
00:39:48.210 --> 00:40:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That may have something to do as a memory. But what happens with people when I do this exercises. They force themselves to say, oh, no, that's not how it was. It was like this. I remember that's not what this exercises. Don't force your response to come from our memory.

444
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to see what I'm talking about when we're doing this exercise together. You may be tempted to go, what was it, what was it, no. Now in this room that you and I are going to

445
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.200
Angelina C: Cultivate

446
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with getting what you want.

447
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.940
What you need

448
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Not what was there at age five. That is not what we're doing this room never existed when you were five

449
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're still getting calls and texts.

450
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:44.070
Angelina C: Even though. Yeah, my I don't know my Texas. I don't, they're just kind of what's like the doctors, the pharmacy or that they're just coming

451
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.740
Angelina C: Yeah, I'm sitting in Texas.

452
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.210
So,

453
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, we've got 20 minutes I'm

454
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.260

Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, five nickname to Nina.

Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to look around your room. Just look around.

457
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture the rest of this home that you happen to be staying in now.

458
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to imagine a room that is attached to this one imagine any room.

459
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets to be exactly what you want it gets to be as big as you want, as bright and all the things that you want in it. And once you to tell me what you think of and try not to censor your response. How big is it how bright is it what's in there first thing that comes to mind.

460
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.840

00:41:51.570 --> 00:42:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Okay, so we've got me God big we've got white and the the white. Is it because it's paint is there plaster on the walls. What do you see, if you were looking at

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see, why don't you take a look down at the floor in this space. And just imagine what kind of flooring is there in that room.

474
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.230

00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can notice the temperature of the room. This takes imagination. This takes really being present with if you want to close your eyes, you can see

480
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.710
Angelina C: These are going to get cold.

487
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.600

520
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a feeling response to it being locked on both sides, like I like it. I don't like it.

521
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:17.550
Angelina C: I do. I have anxiety, but I like it because I'm safe there.

522
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

523
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.250
Angelina C: Okay, but I have anxiety.

524
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's glass. Now can you see through this class, or is it like frosted or

525
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.530
Angelina C: Austin, like a foggy Boston. Okay.

526
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.440
All right, we got a funny frosted out there, right there, funky.

527
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've covered what you see in there, take another look. See if you can see the heater.

528
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it is in the room.

529
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.780
Angelina C: Like a wall connected to the wall. It's like a long one.

530
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to turn it on and warm it to a temperature that you like.

531
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Any sort of picture yourself doing that might as well as our imagination. Might as well. Turn it on. Right.

532
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like the sound, guess what.

533
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.100
There isn't.

534
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: One and I bet, like, Wow, I can't even tell that it's on.

535
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Your maybe like knowing that calm. Maybe it's reassuring in some way. So just pay attention. That's all. And it's warming up.

536
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But for now, I'd like you to see.

537
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you say in this room there's anxiety.

538
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What part of your body is activated around that anxiety. So see if you can locate

539
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's a tension. If there's any kind of pressure pinching heaviness somewhere in the body. When you notice that you're anxious

540
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:25.830
Angelina C: Yeah, I get my I just get real my lower back really locked up like I get real intense anxiety. Like I tense up. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: I think I may have gotten an eyelash in there so

543
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's inconvenient.

544
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.990
Angelina C: Okay see things happen.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It has magic and off on the side of a wall somewhere is a secret little compartment that

562
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Janina knows about.

563
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And get to it and outcomes, a magic wand and she gets to

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:26.670
Angelina C: Yeah.

566
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To get in touch with this five year old self in this magic and be really open to what comes up because something might change. You might notice that the thing that's needed for Gina. With this magic.

567
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What does she need in this room for her back to feel better.

568
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.520
Angelina C: For her to have to lay on the bed.

569
00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. So, magically, what do you see

570
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.840
Angelina C: I see a couch and

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and the bed scrub the bed.

576
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.940
Angelina C: And the badge. Just a little tiny single bed.

577
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything unique about the bedspread or anything on there. That's kinda

578
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:38.370
Angelina C: Just reminds me of when my godmother got us our first ones when we were little, but that was blue. Mine was. That's what it reminds me, yeah.

579
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And and how does Janina feel now that that bed in a blue kind of Comfort Inn and a blue couches in their house, Gina doing

580
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:51.900
Angelina C: Okay, so have anxiety.

581
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we got to keep going because in this role.

582
00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to feel good, good, good, good, good.

583
00:51:58.650 --> 00:51:59.130
Angelina C: Yes.

584
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah it all in here.

585
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.190
Angelina C: Yes.

586
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have a slow way way way down. And this might be a time to truly turn in

587
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To them to that back to those muscles, way in the back. They've been informing and sending a message for quite a while. Might be time to really tune in and see and give give the imagination of this little girl. This Janina a chance because she might have a great idea.

588
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What the back needs.

589
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to

590
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Relax, its muscles just to sort of relax the muscles around the vertebrae, things like that. What it's going to need now a kind of a cookie way of doing it.

591
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. My ears on a hot mess today my ears are

592
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:48.690
Congested

593
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to give a voice to the back.

594
00:52:54.750 --> 00:53:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagine those back muscles themselves could shout something out or make a request. What do you think those those back muscles like say

595
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.690
Angelina C: Or what they might screen, probably to see screen.

596
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think the screen.

597
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:19.800
Angelina C: Does the pain, just to let it out. I just wish to go away like this release it.

598
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would listen

599
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.430
Angelina C: To the wall.

600
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.070
Angelina C: I guess just the walls would you hear me.

601
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that enough though, right. So think about what magic is possible in here just picturing what this little girl needs in there who really needs to hear her.

602
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that comes to mind. Try not to censor

603
00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.440
Angelina C: Hmm.

604
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.610
Angelina C: Don't know I can't

605
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to tell.

606
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.210
Angelina C: But

607
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's go back to how she's doing in there. Let's for a second.

608
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:17.640
Angelina C: She's

609
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: She's sitting on the couch right let's go to tactile we missed that we missed that one. I want you to just imagine Janina has her little hand and she's reaching over to the side and I want you to describe how that couch fields from her little fingertips in her hands. How does it feel

610
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.230
Angelina C: This rough

611
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it is.

612
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what she wants.

613
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:52.860
Angelina C: No, I went, smooth, but it just feels to me like on my hands and I would be like, bumpy, for some reason, okay.

614
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be worth it to get this room just right.

615
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't overuse this magic, we can use it as much as needed to get exactly the texture temperature, taste, smell emotion and physiology that's needed

616
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Put you can have exactly what you need right with this couch. You want it to be smooth. What would, what would it be made of

617
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.480
Angelina C: probiotic of Elvis. Elvis.

618
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.970

Angelina C: Yeah, now, though.

622

Gwenevere Abriel: You baby and you know when you move your finger kind of goes from for him, kind of, you can move it like hopefully you're moving

623
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:40.500

626
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:53.880
Angelina C: Just like a real light blue. Okay, there we go. So it's a velvet light blue

627
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of get a sense that she's kind of touching in it feels good.

628
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When is it squishy. Is it a firm couch.

629
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.030
It's soft

630

Gwenevere Abriel: Check in with the back. How's the back doing

631
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.550
Angelina C: Better. It's not so hot, either.

632
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:25.140
Angelina C: I always put my it's an eight usually gets real hot but like when I'm real tense. So I'm relaxing not it's not hurting as much

633
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, I like that she's getting what

634
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.410
Angelina C: She

635
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.360
Angelina C: Isn't here. So yeah, it's not

636
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the temperature with the heater on does it seem like

637
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.780
Angelina C: It's starting to know a little warmer.

638
00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:38.250
Angelina C: Warmer

639
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the emotion. See if you can catch it. What's the emotion right now in that room.

640
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.010
Angelina C: Just lonely sad.

641
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.400
Angelina C: Supposed to be happy. But it's lonely and sad.

642
00:56:53.580 --> 00:57:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We gotta, we gotta go with exactly how you're feeling lonely and sad, pay attention to that and justice, you said it. Where did you notice the body registered lonely and sad.

643
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:08.880
Angelina C: Just to my chest, just like and it starts getting anxiety and

644
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:11.880
Angelina C: Just hurt.

645
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.290
Angelina C: Yep.

646
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To feel anxiety and hurt.

647
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get that. Let's get that sense of chest for a moment and let's give that a voice.

648
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important, right, we're wired for for connection. We're wired to to sort of have that social medicine connect to people talk with them feel love to give love, friendship, or we're wired for that we're sort of, you know,

649
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. OK. So the chest is registering some sad and and some lonely.

650
00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if you can give that a voice. What would the chest say right now.

651
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.460
Angelina C: Just heavy. It hurts like it's just sad. Yeah.

652
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows how to help with that chest. This is the tricky bit right here.

653
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:14.280
Angelina C: Just breathe. Thank you, Tom and belly breathing Ok so now he's

654
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing helps, but sometimes it's literally a person we think about what lonely.

655
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:23.670
Angelina C: It says, Yeah.

656
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's someone that you want in the room or something you want in the room that would help. What does Janina want, which is the chest need

657
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:42.480
Angelina C: I don't know, it's, I don't know, it's, that's where I've always felt so lost. Yeah. Like you know you do.

658
00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But in this room, we give her a chance. There's no wrong answer, we can get it all wrong 10 times

659
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you will correct it. Again, notice how we we had a temperature and then we changed it. We haven't

660
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Had this

661
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:01.890
Angelina C: And we had. Yeah.

662
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to get it just right, and it'll take as long as it takes. Because you're worth it because having this space available to you is worth it.

663
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:10.680
Angelina C: Yes.

664
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This room is

665
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: too important in therapy with me. We use it when we use it and we use it, we come here. We were solved challenging issues in our lives here safely where we have all of our needs met. It's a great place to have. So I want to get it just right.

666
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:29.220
Angelina C: Okay.

667
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:33.000

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.140
Angelina C: There's literally

669
00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No long way. Okay.

670
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.020

Gwenevere Abriel: What would bring lightness to it. What would lift.

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.130
Angelina C: My grandmother, my grandmother always do.

673
00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.200

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay.

683
01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens to the tightness in the chest.

684
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.160
Angelina C: It's going away. It's not as tight.

685
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:42.600
Chest.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is still something

687
01:00:55.290 --> 01:01:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if there's still some tightness. We still want to keep keep modifying and keep modifying until we get it just right.

Angelina C: A little

690
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything out into the room that would kind of make it more fun for five year old.

691
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:20.460
Angelina C: And

692
01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.590
Angelina C: I can't see anything right now. I mean, I just don't see it. Right. I just, I don't know, it's weird.

693
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.380
Angelina C: Okay, it's the summer, I don't want to go kinda

694
01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can tell.

695
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can. I got you. But in here. There's not going to be any fighting

696
01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, won't be. We won't we won't have fighting. No one knows how to get in. You have a lock on the inside. Right.

697
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:52.470
Angelina C: Yeah.

698
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You may decide to change the locking

699
01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: System initially has it locked from the outside and the inside. Maybe you'll decide there's different keys. Maybe it's a magic door and no one sees it, but you you get to create whatever you want to increase that sense.

700
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's particular people that know how to see the door.

701
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.840
Angelina C: It's hard. I know I don't even want to do it.

702
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, your grandmother, for example.

703
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you trust her to know where the door is or even her

704
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.010
Angelina C: Oh, yeah.

705
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so she might be someone who knows where it is. Is there anyone else that you trust enough to know

706
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your to this room is

707
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:40.920
Angelina C: No.

708
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. That's it. It's just grandma.

709
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:44.400
Angelina C: Yeah.

710
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just fine.

711
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very common people need that sanctuary that that space that's very precious to them, you know, no one can get to. That's, that's kind of where

712
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:02.790
Angelina C: That heart speaks it yeah that makes sense.

713
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So because we're at the top of the hour. I want to be gentle and sort of come out of this. This work that we're doing right now. We'll pick this up again and we'll keep will develop it, but I want to

714
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:15.900
I want to

715
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: praise You, you know, hey,

716
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:20.640
Look what you did.

717
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You developed it this far right.

718
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a hard thing to do because you know sometimes our mind wants to go to memories of what wasn't what isn't. And this one asks, this is what I want.

719
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What I need and really pushing aside that other history and saying, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna make this happen for myself and giving yourself permission to do that and you were able to do big pieces of it.

720
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We're about maybe a third of the way through the exercise, we still have a long way to go.

721
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.450
Okay.

722
01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:02.580
Angelina C: That's good, though. It's hard. I didn't. Jessica, try to go there and I avoided it every time I could like that.

723
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.710
Angelina C: But yeah I I tried to avoid it as much as possible, but

724
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a positive thing. This is a

725
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Real resource not asking you to tell me stories about your childhood that you'll decide on timing. If you want to do those things.

726
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So whatever it is that you're feeling that's unwanted right now. Maybe you want to put some of those negative memories in a container.

727
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of put it, I don't know if you have already developed one but maybe you can picture a container of some kind. Kind of put it in there and maybe send it on down on a little raft down the river. Just have it send on down, you can kind of picture it moving further away.

728
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then go into your breathing.

729
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of put those two things together just spend some time right here at the end, I'm going to do it with you.

730
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that belly breathing.

731
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Net on on your terms. You get to decide what you want to think about where you want to focus your attention and you can kind of picture moving further and further away down the river.

732
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: A container, maybe it's in a raft or something just moving further away.

733
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're breathing into your belly reminding your mind that you are safe.

734
01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This there's no danger right now.

735
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That what you were thinking about earlier is actually in the past. It's not happening right now.

736
01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead just focus on how it feels to have that breath know how does that tell me feel as it hits the t shirt, you know, just focusing on the viscera and the skin, your body right now. It'll get you back in this moment.

737
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Our future scheduling here and

738
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See, see what we've got. I know.

739
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

740
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means you do not. You're welcome to keep it if you want to. We had originally a six in the morning appointment on March 13. You don't have to keep that one. If you don't want it because you met with me just now it's

741
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:58.350
Angelina C: All text. What I think I'll do is I'll text you because I was so upset that I couldn't even make group that really like I told them that means a lot to me when I get to group and do my one on ones. So when I couldn't do it really hurt me. So now,

742
01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:10.920
Angelina C: I do want to keep up the weekly even with you. But yeah, let's see if we could do like a 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, but I'll do group tomorrow, probably at 11 or Thursday to live in.

743
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Berkeley this I'm going to cancel you for six o'clock.

744
01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:14.880
Angelina C: Okay.

745
01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:15.990
Angelina C: Because it's okay.

746
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A really big deal for me to show up.

747
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: As our given my other obligations. So I'm going to cancel it. We met

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's, it's, I'm not going to forget the important thing you're saying you keep using this word hurt.

750
01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.050
Angelina C: Right, I'm going to catch

751

Angelina C: Someone doesn't know some

755
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something in your heart and I don't want to be heard from

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:53.490
Angelina C: Learn more about that.

757
01:07:54.990 --> 01:08:06.030

758
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:06.720
Angelina C: I mean,

759
01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I would invite you to not take it personally. The people

760
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, are in virtual clinic I don't tell them, but someone's telling. Don't let clients in. They didn't say Angelina, specifically, she's no good. Don't let her in.

761
01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:31.440
Angelina C: That's what they said Wednesday, if I didn't get it. I couldn't drop the group. So I went Wednesday after right away. I know what you're saying.

775
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna have to go grab something to put in my stomach for some reason. I've got some nausea, I

776
01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.510
Don't know why. So grab something

777
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.220
Know,

778
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little distracting. Yeah, I was just about curled

779
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:07.680
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, I hate being anxious. I'm the biggest baby when I'm nauseous or throwing up

780
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.510
Katrina Gutierrez: I can't do it.

781
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see if it passes, maybe I just need a little song in there.

782
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see.

783
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Last couple weeks for you, what's your, what's it been like

784
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:29.820
Katrina Gutierrez: It's been

785
01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.270
Katrina Gutierrez: It's been busy. I'm

786
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.940
Katrina Gutierrez: Just, you know, keeping an eye on Trinity and

787
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.690
Katrina Gutierrez: She ended up getting kicked out of school.

788
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:43.830
Oh, that

789
01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:46.290
Katrina Gutierrez: Huh.

790
01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:47.310
Yeah.

791
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:51.720
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, she's got a hearing on Wednesday.

792
01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've come to the conclusion that she's gonna go with her mom okay hospital that's been a while you've been working on that one.

793
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you already talked with her about it. Yeah.

794
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that

795
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.220
Katrina Gutierrez: Three years ago.

796
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, any additional acting out. Is she crying. She angry. What's happening standing in a room that was going on.

797
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.320
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, pretty much. Um,

798
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:32.370
Katrina Gutierrez: She did. She did get a job. But that's just to keep her busy. Well, her mom gets things together.

799
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:34.200
But, uh,

800
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:49.950
Katrina Gutierrez: That's about it. Yeah, she's no actually yesterday she was on out with Matthew in the kitchen, and it was for the first time in a long time, I'd actually heard her laughing and conversation with him.

801
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or she wasn't agitated with him so

802
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:58.950
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm thinking the school might have been a little more stressful than

803
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:05.340
She could handle. I don't know. She just wasn't doing well at that school

804
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: She was acting out a lot so she can end up changing schools, when she stays with her mom.

805
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:22.050
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah. Well, I mean, I hope, I hope the whole reason you know anybody's really been doing this is to make sure she does, and

806
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.500
Katrina Gutierrez: You know, I mean, we've been doing it for her too. But, you know, the whole reason

807
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.350
Katrina Gutierrez: I have always been on her about it was to make sure she finished school

808
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.690
I guess it's gonna be really up to her mom and her, but I would hope. I think her mom is gonna make her

809
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Change schools.

810
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.320
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, yeah, just start schools out there.

811
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What I don't know where out there, you have an idea.

812
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't tell me

813
01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, oh, oh my, I see definitely changing schools, obviously. Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.

814
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.150
Katrina Gutierrez: Sorry, I did wasn't sure what you were

815
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know whether she was 20 minutes away.

816
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.630
Katrina Gutierrez: Easier.

817
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, okay, Tennessee.

818
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

819
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so how is this impacting you

820
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear all about it. Pros, cons, a whole deal.

821
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:42.180
Katrina Gutierrez: Improves would be that she would, you know, be with her mom and her mom might be able to help her better than I can. Okay, you know, she right now it seems like she needs a parent and more of a

822
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:50.670
Lot more than what I can give her in the sense of like being nurturing or understanding or even just

823
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:56.880
Katrina Gutierrez: Being, you know, a more of a nurturing type

824
01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.100
You know, more the

825
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:07.680
More nurturing more maternal

826
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's not the right word. It might be

827
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you took on the responsibility.

828
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember for

829
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: For Trinity. Because why

830
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:34.350
Because I love her and I want her to succeed and

831
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.160
Everybody else head.

832
01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:50.160
Like never even given her the chance. It's like they just kind of walked away. And it wasn't fair to her and I didn't want her to not succeed.

833
01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:52.260
Okay.

834
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know those things for her, but she don't see yourself as the best resource for that.

835
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.830
Katrina Gutierrez: No, there's just certain things. I can't give her or I can't be there for her. I mean,

836
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.680
Yeah, there's certain things. I can't

837
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:09.420
Do for her.

838
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:16.170
You know she needs a parent right now and

839
01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.850
Katrina Gutierrez: No matter how hard I try. I'm not that parents

840
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your mother's name.

841
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.100
Katrina Gutierrez: Tori.

842
01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What is Tori.

843
01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:36.540
Katrina Gutierrez: Tori saying that she's worried and she is

844
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, going to get stuff together to get her down there and

845
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:49.140
Katrina Gutierrez: That it was just a little hard, the timing because she just started a new job and you know they're

846
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:58.320
Right between like paychecks or whatever. So just to give her a little bit of time so she can get that. So she can get a ticket for and

847
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:12.780
You know, just some of the stuff that she had been doing when we told her mom her mom was like, what, how, what do you mean, she was just really confused like there's a lot that

848
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:20.610
Katrina Gutierrez: She has those milestones that she's missed because of the neglect. Yeah, and they're showing

849
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:26.340
And we've tried to work with her on and we've, you know, a header and Calvin. We've tried

850
01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.700
Katrina Gutierrez: You know, basically all that we

851
01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:39.750
Katrina Gutierrez: Can think of and not a whole lot has changed, it seems like right now she's going through something that she she

852
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:41.490
Has to

853
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.070
She needs more

854
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:52.050
I guess.

855
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.600
Understanding or

856
01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So Katrina, you're my client.

857
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I notice you spend time talking about Trinity Trinity. TRINITY.

858
01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm indulging that but let's shift gears for a moment.

859
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what this is like for you.

860
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: really slow down on this because this is not a small issue. This is

861
01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I get a sense of what this is. So notice here, this is you like this.

862
01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you're doing.

863
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That is still stimulation. You're coping with something right now. What is that

864
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.680
Basically, it's just

865
01:17:51.420 --> 01:18:04.080
Katrina Gutierrez: I feel like I never had the choice in saying no, or no, I never got to be that fun and I never, you know, got to feed her sugar and send her home.

866
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I

867
01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.470
I never

868
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.130
I always had to be the hardest or I always had to be

869
01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:16.050
Katrina Gutierrez: The responsible one or

870
01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:19.380
You know, I'm tired of

871
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:25.440
Doing it and I am not. I don't know what to do at this point because

872
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:33.660
Katrina Gutierrez: It was going good. But now she's, she's going in a different direction that I don't know. I don't know what to do. And I don't want it to get worse.

873
01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:38.490
So I, I just feel

874
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.480
I feel like I've come to

875
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:53.310
Katrina Gutierrez: The point where that's all I can give. I don't want to. At this point, I feel like I'd be more harmful than helpful to her and myself.

876
01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what I have to give

877
01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it going to be like for you.

878
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about when you hear how she's doing over there.

879
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:09.510
Okay.

880
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This new you typically

881
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Are jumping in and rescuing not rescuing right now.

882
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That is going to be new territory.

883
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your new thought

884
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When she goes through something you hear about it.

885
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that what is the meaning out of it.

886
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm asking a really hard question might as well take a look at these now.

887
01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.470
Katrina Gutierrez: Something good or bad.

888
01:19:58.770 --> 01:19:59.340
Bad

889
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:11.250
That

890
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.540
That you know i think i can't blame myself for it that

891
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:25.560
Katrina Gutierrez: I did what at the time about right and what I know. Done.

892
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.990
For my own

893
01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.100
My own mental health.

894
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:38.310
So whatever happens out there. Of course I don't want anything bad

895
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.330
But whatever choices she makes I can't

896
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.430
I can't make

897
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.880
That choice for her. I can't live her life for her and

898
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:55.320
Katrina Gutierrez: I trust her mom more than I do. Anybody else

899
01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.180
To

900
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:00.060
Be able to guide her

901
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:06.630
And get her on track. I mean, every time she's been with her mom. I've never had to worry

902
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Why hasn't

903
01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:14.280
ended up going to prison.

904
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.910
Well, because

905
01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:32.730
It's kind of

906
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.060
Katrina Gutierrez: Doesn't make sense because I just said that. And then the prison thing but

907
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.810
Katrina Gutierrez: No, because I've seen her with Trinity and

908
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:51.840
Katrina Gutierrez: I've seen the habits and stuff that Trinity displays when she comes back from her own opposed to when she's with my brother.

909
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:56.910
Katrina Gutierrez: And right now, Tori is on

910
01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:06.000
Katrina Gutierrez: He's on probation, she's you know has to check in. She's got a all these

911
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.430
She's got all these

912
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.870
She's got all these things that she has to

913
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.800
Katrina Gutierrez: All these steps to be able to make sure

914
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.110
She maintains

915
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:20.550
Yeah.

916
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.690
Katrina Gutierrez: You know, good silver state.

917
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Philosopher

918
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.380
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm not sure how long I'm probationers but I know she's gonna be on for a while.

919
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:45.870
She moved. She was in California. She just moved to Tennessee specifically to get away from anything of her past

920
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There are three. No, but if you just need a moment just say

921
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to spend the next couple of years.

922
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Dot dot dot. How do you finish that thought.

923
01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:13.500
I would like to spend the last couple next couple of years, focusing on me.

924
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've never got to do it. Mm hmm. What's that feel like to say that out loud.

925
01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.580
It feels

926
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:26.490
It feels like it's

927
01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:30.930
Katrina Gutierrez: Earned but it's been a long time.

928
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:35.700
Like a too long coming, they should have done it earlier.

929
01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:37.170
But

930
01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels good. It feels good.

931
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

932
01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.630
Because, for once, I'm putting myself.

933
01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.930
Before anybody else, and

934
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.490
Katrina Gutierrez: I didn't know that for a long time. I didn't realize how important that was

935
01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:02.070
Because I constantly was worrying about my mom and my niece and

936
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.770
Katrina Gutierrez: In in a lot of ways that did have an effect on me.

937
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:14.070
Katrina Gutierrez: In like physical and mental health. You know, I can't blame it on it, but

938
01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.110
It did.

939
01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.200
You can't help anybody if you're not

940
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:21.900
Okay.

941
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.990
Katrina Gutierrez: You're not healthy yourself. You can't help

942
01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.150
Anyone, yes.

943
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That Tori makes mistakes that Tori.

944
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Does the best that she can do

945
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you continue to progress you continue to live your life and now part of the family. Right.

946
01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Trinity is tory's daughter.

947
01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That wasn't your choice. You didn't adopt her. You say, I want, I want to take care of this person here.

948
01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Lost her daughter.

949
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it okay if you separate and say, I get to

950
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel success. I get to feel growth.

951
01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're going to go at their own pace.

952
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they may catch up, they may go ahead of you at some point in their lives that you get to work on yourself.

953
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. And that's, that's pretty new, because you you've been compelled right to do it the other way for a long, long time.

954
01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:56.430
Yeah.

955
01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How does this align with your just want to check in and different domains. How does it align with your spiritual beliefs. How does this lineup. Alright, thanks.

956
01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.940
Katrina Gutierrez: I think that's a big reason why it's

957
01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.130
Okay, now

958
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:16.980
Able to separate is because

959
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's part of it. It's a big part of it. How so,

960
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:31.560
Katrina Gutierrez: Well, it's like finding myself and finding what my purpose and passions and just finding myself again.

961
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:36.000
Katrina Gutierrez: Finding out who I am as just me.

962
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:38.640
As an individual

963
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:47.640
And then be able to work on any kind of outside relationships and. See also another thing that I'm seeing right now is

964
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.440
You know,

965
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:55.320
Katrina Gutierrez: There are areas that I don't know how to be an adult, I don't, I can't teach it.

966
01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:11.670
Katrina Gutierrez: So I'm seeing those areas fall on a lot of other people that it really is not their responsibility. Yeah, and that's not fair to her to them to me because it makes me also feel like

967
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:13.380
Katrina Gutierrez: You know,

968
01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:38.520
Katrina Gutierrez: Not a failure, but like it just, it points out the areas that my mom didn't do the best didn't do it that all really and it, you know, it kind of it bothers me when you know she needs help with something. And I'm like, I don't, I don't know how to do it. I want to tell her that I also

969
01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:47.670
Don't want to show the wrong way. So I see where it falls on other people. And they sometimes already have enough on their plate.

970
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.670
Especially with, you know, their own

971
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:55.200
Katrina Gutierrez: You know kid that they're having to worry about and teach as well and

972
01:27:57.090 --> 01:28:02.190
Turning doesn't learn is quickly sometimes on some subject.

973
01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like for the rest of us to not say her name.

974
01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.710
Katrina Gutierrez: Every great

975
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we do that, let's see what happens.

976
01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to focus on today.

977
01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.840
Katrina Gutierrez: So I had a question.

978
01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.410
Katrina Gutierrez: Is what you the, what is their code that we were doing.

979
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The FDR

980
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What is it, so it's I'm movement. Well, the I move it, even though it has I movement in the name. It's irrelevant. It's basically

981
01:28:47.490 --> 01:29:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I movement desensitization and reprogramming but the eye movement is secondary to the fact that it's bilateral stimulation. So what part do you want to know about. Do you want to know why people say it works. You want to know what it treats, do you want to do it. What

982
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.370
Katrina Gutierrez: What is a treat because

983
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.380
Katrina Gutierrez: I want to know if it's something else that I've come across is the same thing of what I'm thinking is, I can't

984
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it down. Yeah, so

985
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: MTR is a specialized therapeutic technique.

986
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And what it's actually doing. There's a lot of theories about the mechanism of change and the ones that I've read some of them are just just sound ridiculous. So, the ones that I think might actually be true.

987
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Katrina.

988
01:29:49.110 --> 01:30:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We can kind of only measure where blood flow is in the brain when we do our measurements. Right. We, the mind is still a mystery. Mm hmm. Yes, we can say there's neurotransmitters. Yes, we can say that, but

989
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you two theories that I think seem logical. And actually, there's really only one that I think is probably the one that's happening.

990
01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The first one has to do with working memory. Okay.

991
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So this bilateral stimulation that in here that I've been doing with clients, it seems to be working. Even in here, even though you guys don't have the little

992
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Pulsars in your right and left hand because you're not with me and you don't hear the sounds. But you guys are able to have bilateral movement like this, you're able to have bilateral movement. So the one the, the theory that I like that's most palatable and digested by me as the following

993
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to use an example.

994
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I am asked by my therapist to pull up the worst image of a negative event.

995
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I hold it in my working memory, which means I pulled it from my hippocampus. It's a part of the brain that holds stores a lot of memories, just like massive amounts of memory, the alphabet, all the way to

996
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How that zipper felt when I was first day of kindergarten no right like crazy amount of information. It just stores it

997
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I'm not thinking about how that zipper felt every day. I'm not. I don't have it sitting in my working just imagine

998
01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We pull up that working memory and at the same time, I say, What's this sponsoring negative belief that you have. And we've identified. Whoops, I just switched to you being the client I have better stick with me.

999
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: My negative cognition is I'm not enough. So I pull up this this little image. Let's say I'm six years old I pull it up.

1000
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have this negative cognition of I'm not enough with this bilateral stimulation does because that's the third piece I have my

1001
01:31:54.090 --> 01:32:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: My image from the hippocampus. I have my prefrontal cortex now have thinking about my negative cognition and now I have this bilateral stimulation

1002
01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the mechanism of change, it's, it's a distraction. I think this is

1003
01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A distraction. Now, whether it's really what's operating is the fact that it's left and right hemisphere. I don't know that the other theory that seems palatable might be that the left and right hemisphere is being activated, but either way. I think it's a distraction.

1004
01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that geez sensitization happens because those two negative things that I just asked you to build on while you're doing this.

1005
01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body is not in the level of distress than it was when it was happening when you were six when I was six, I keep getting lost in to the client is in the scenario but um

1006
01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are reworking that memory, it is less distressing. You're getting desensitized to it, but you don't tell me what the story is, notice I didn't tell you what happened to sex.

1007
01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What's really unique about this for a lot of people, they have their molestation survivors.

1008
01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There D developmental trauma, day after day neglect abandonment really long standing trauma on top of that they've had shock trauma and their car accident and were incarcerated. I mean, this is these are the people I work with. Right.

1009
01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So what it does is if people are interested in telling those stories, they can still have healing around those those memories.

1010
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people have intrusive thoughts that come into nightmares. They might show up out of the blue.

1011
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They might feel a response to something that's so intense, and they can understand why am I feeling so intensely about something when I, when I look around. Everybody else is kind of like chill about it, but I'm freaking out.

1012
01:33:53.100 --> 01:34:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's one piece. This is a really complex I'm doing. I'm going to try to break it down into simple terms, but this is a very complex phenomenon, what goes on in her mind.

1013
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece that I want to tell you about has to do with also they have a campus right I was telling you that's the big story part of the brain. The part of the brain stores memory.

1014
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically the original event that was happening. Let's say on sex. I was flooded with stress hormones, right, the cortisol.

1015
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And what it did is it cut off the ability to get all the way up here to language to other parts of my brain completely cut off. Not only did it do that. But all that cortisol, of which this amygdala has it's covered in

1016
01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: cortisol receptors. So it's flooding this hippocampus with cortisol and it's got lots of receptors. So in this event. I'm age six

1017
01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It corrupts the memory, which means really important pieces of this memory are forgotten.

1018
01:34:58.410 --> 01:35:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not remembered really important pieces.

1019
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only that, but the timestamp is missing because this cortisol wash it's constantly going because right my clients are constant stress.

1020
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress. Stress. Stress this event that happened. They got stored in here. It's all corrupted with missing events and no timestamp when the neural network gets triggered. There was a smell and taste some sound something that resembled it gets pulled up the client you me

1021
01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We feel that memory as if it's happening right now.

1022
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so catastrophic Lee intense

1023
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What am Dr can do remember. I remember that word desensitization is

1024
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So as we desensitize it we're putting the proper timestamp on it which means it gets to be in the past.

1025
01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We get distance from it.

1026
01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that was awful.

1027
01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not reliving it right now. I can now look at it. That was in the past. That's not happening now.

1028
01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The neural network changes. So we get a proper timestamp. We get desensitized to it in typical Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment is this exposure therapy was the go to. It's now em, Dr. For

1029
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Em, Dr.

1030
01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I movement Desensitization and Reprocessing

1031
01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it isn't actually an evidence based treatment. Now for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms. So I know you asked, kind of, how does it work, so I won't even go into the bilateral thing because I, I'll just stick with I think that's what

1032
01:36:53.400 --> 01:37:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Treats go to treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. So right Vietnam vets people that are coming out of really intense crisis moments can have

1033
01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Some reprocessing of it. It's good for anxiety.

1034
01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or depression. It's good for compulsive disorders.

1035
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think it's a good fit for you.

1036
01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.750
I was looking at something and

1037
01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:30.450
Katrina Gutierrez: I listened to a lot of stuff on the body.

1038
01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:38.310
Especially when it comes to like the mind and the brain.

1039
01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:46.170
Katrina Gutierrez: I had it written down, it was they use it a lot to be able to test for

1040
01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Water personality disorder which one

1041
01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.600
Katrina Gutierrez: For borderline personality disorder.

1042
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.680
Katrina Gutierrez: They use it to test for that.

1043
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A sound.

1044
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying there is a test a sound test to test for borderline personality disorder.

1045
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.310
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't wanna sound test. It's just, this is just what they used to

1046
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.910
Katrina Gutierrez: Do is safer sometimes would

1047
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we

1048
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Were just coming from

1049
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.120
Katrina Gutierrez: I was looking, I was reading about

1050
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:32.370
Katrina Gutierrez: About bipolar, too.

1051
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:38.760
Katrina Gutierrez: And they were saying how sometimes it can be misdiagnosed, and then they got into the

1052
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:49.980
Katrina Gutierrez: That test and I wasn't sure if that was the testing that we do not the test, but this stuff because it was like broken down like like words abbreviated

1053
01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:54.360
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't know it. I guess it's not important, if that's

1054
01:38:55.050 --> 01:39:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What it is, right, so you're taking a piece and then one thing is connected to another thing to an actor. Why don't we start with your curiosity around bipolar disorder. Why don't we talk about that woody what's going on around your curiosity around that.

1055
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:18.000
Katrina Gutierrez: I just never really knew much about it. And so a lot of the things that I've been diagnosed with I absolutely either

1056
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:29.910
Katrina Gutierrez: Realize that some of them are not necessarily a mental illness. It was just whatever I was going through at that time. And they've been misdiagnosed

1057
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:32.940
In that

1058
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:42.840
Katrina Gutierrez: Some of them do have because the thing about spiritual awakening is it can make you look crazy.

1059
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:51.660
Katrina Gutierrez: And a lot of the things that I had been going through, because I think that it actually started before I knew it.

1060
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.870
And I just barely started

1061
01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:02.430
Became aware at one point that it was happening. And so, you know, like

1062
01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:11.370
The anxiety, you know, that can tie in with just the fact that I absorbed people's energies more

1063
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:15.300
Katrina Gutierrez: I've always been like that. I can't stand conflict.

1064
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:31.740
Katrina Gutierrez: When I was a kid. When I go to school, I was this big or social butterfly. But then I had to come home and I had to be in my room with my door shut, to be able to like recharge didn't realize that's what I was doing. But, you know,

1065
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:37.350
Katrina Gutierrez: So a lot of it. I don't think necessarily was anxiety. I think it was

1066
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.240
You know,

1067
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.310
The situation and then the

1068
01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:50.460
The being, you know, having extreme empathy.

1069
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.230
Or

1070
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.580
Being empathic where

1071
01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The situation and that just was overwhelming and it looked like, you know, generalized anxiety anxiety disorder, and I wish I had someone in your life. It could tell you oh you're taking care of yourself.

1072
01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of pathology using it.

1073
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand

1074
01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be replacing a whole new set of labels for the ones you had before. And you might end up dropping those in 10 years or five. I'm not one upon labels. I play with them for a little while. Then I play with some other ones.

1075
01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't get attached to them, you're calling it a spiritual awakening all those words you use I could use in from psychological terms. Yeah, I'm

1076
01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty me the fundamental piece is it adaptive is what you're doing.

1077
01:41:51.030 --> 01:42:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When you played with your friends and you were funny entertaining and you've had the witty thing to say. And you knew how to bring out the best in people and you were all that dance and having fun with them.

1078
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you came home and you needed quiet because you gave and gave and gave and gave and gave and gave

1079
01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you came home. Close the door.

1080
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you refueled. Why does that have to be pathological

1081
01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it working. Did it work.

1082
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you go to school the next day.

1083
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you get your homework done chef friends. I'm sorry. That sounds like a balanced person to me that knows how to enjoy friends and also a long time. The likes the company. She keeps if you were in your room crying, your eyes out throwing up and smoking weed. That's a different conversation.

1084
01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you understand. Yeah. Yeah. Is it adaptive

1085
01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is this someone who's learning how to pay attention to the constant trends in changing needs of the human condition.

1086
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: 20 minutes for now. You might want something else prefer something else needs something else.

1087
01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What will you do with that need. Will you repress it will you shame it will you say I shouldn't have this. I don't know what you're going to do with it. I don't live your life is what you're doing, adaptive. There are big pieces when you came into this treatment with me.

1088
01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That you could stay. These are not adaptive. I can't leave the house.

1089
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we labeled it agoraphobia right we label, we gave it you already had labels. I didn't have to do any labeling you already had a bunch of them. I didn't do it to you.

1090
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

1091
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I just want to talk about it. I want to know, how are you in your way, is this working for you. What can we do

1092
01:43:46.410 --> 01:43:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We did some therapeutic intervention. We see a lot of experiential stuff. And you've been changing. You can call it, call it whatever we want to

1093
01:43:56.910 --> 01:44:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're doing. We have to get grounded somewhere is what you're doing, working for you.

1094
01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not a happy life.

1095
01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't look like hers. It doesn't look like mine doesn't look like his who cares. This is adaptive for you.

1096
01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: People are going to think we're crazy people are going to think you're crazy.

1097
01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: They have every right I can't make some change that the most important thing is, is it adapted. Is it healthy. Are you happy with the way you're doing your life is, is what you're doing, working for you.

1098
01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What good is it going to be to compare it to me or to hurt him. I mean, it's just

1099
01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to help much.

1100
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you go one layer underneath. Why am I finding out about bipolar disorder go one layer underneath that I heard you say, yeah, I wonder stand if this label was real.

1101
01:45:01.110 --> 01:45:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Go underneath that I want you, because every label has a 566 and a half six out of seven symptom cluster. Okay.

1102
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear about the cluster of symptoms that you're questioning your own intuition about whether it's normal, or am I crazy is this what other people do. What are the symptoms. We're really talking about what do you wonder about

1103
01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have any woman really know why you can get up. It was just because

1104
01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:31.860
Katrina Gutierrez: I wanted to

1105
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:41.850
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't want to be one of those people that I'm not crazy and actually be sick in an area that I don't realize what I'm thinking because

1106
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.610
Katrina Gutierrez: There's the possibility, where people don't know they're sick.

1107
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so label the symptoms. What are people saying, and it and again there is such a thing as I'm

1108
01:45:55.950 --> 01:46:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting feedback from this auxiliary people were we here. Let's actually let's hear from the people in her life.

1109
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Issue really running down the street naked.

1110
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:16.350
Katrina Gutierrez: And there's there's nobody that's crazy. They all said I'm not in my own like logic on it.

1111
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the symptoms Katrina label them that you are not trusting your intuition label them. What are we talking about. I can't. We got fluffing here. We got all the first year.

1112
01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:34.980
Katrina Gutierrez: Just I did I. That was the only reason behind it. I didn't want to be one of those people that thought they weren't sick when they are

1113
01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.060
Katrina Gutierrez: There are no symptoms. I just want to make sure that what I'm going through

1114
01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you, what's the, what are you going through

1115
01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:45.510
Katrina Gutierrez: The Awakening everything

1116
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Label Katrina. Do you

1117
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:50.670
Katrina Gutierrez: Know more to the world than what I see.

1118
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.390
Katrina Gutierrez: Or what I've been told, you know,

1119
01:46:55.170 --> 01:47:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll either find it adaptive and people will be sitting here like enjoying the conversation or they'll look at you like your cuckoo bird and you'll decide, do I want to keep talking to this person or not to get it.

1120
01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, most of the time people

1121
01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:16.470
Katrina Gutierrez: Actually everybody's really supportive of it. They don't, they say, I'm not crazy but

1122
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

1123
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:30.120
Katrina Gutierrez: Okay, for instance, astral projecting i thought was crazy. That was just crazy. And I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't like being a crazy person thinking I was having experienced that I wasn't

1124
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:37.890
Katrina Gutierrez: Or that was is real to me but not, you know, you know,

1125
01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta tell you something. I think there's enough trust here that you're able to hear this. You spend a lot of time at home, do we both agree.

1126
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what you're going to be like when you get out

1127
01:47:52.680 --> 01:48:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if this astral projection will be there. I don't know what what you call astral projection is what people call a deja vu. I don't know enough about the brain to say this, notice how you don't like this word.

1128
01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, I can't be expected to know this if you want to spend your time feeling sort of specialness around this thing that you have. Okay.

1129
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what you're going to be like when you get out into the world and and you have to pay your rent pay tax pay for car insurance and gas. I don't know. What do you think you're going to be preoccupied with

1130
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.820
So be preoccupied with

1131
01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then find out, then that's all you'll do it. I personally, I noticed when I have to do these things. I just described.

1132
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to really focus. I can't do two things at once. I have to do one

1133
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you you can do two things at the same time.

1134
01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:06.480
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, even when I went before when I was living on my own and doing work thing ran you know, having to pay water gas, electric

1135
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:09.840
Katrina Gutierrez: You know my car insurance, all that stuff. It

1136
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:17.010
Katrina Gutierrez: It's still stuff like that still was on my mind. I don't know why just always kind of

1137
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:20.490
I've always wondered about

1138
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If we're not seeing or knowing. Yeah. And someone else is going to call that right a spiritual awakening someone's going to call it crazy someone's going to call a hallucinating. There's going to be 20 different labels and I'm going to ask you.

1139
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it working for you.

1140
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna care whether the way you're interpreting it is useful.

1141
01:49:52.530 --> 01:50:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it adaptive. Now, if you say it's taking up 36 out of my 48 hours questioning, is this real. I don't even know if this pen is real and you literally forget to eat Bay's your relationships with deteriorated. You understand what I mean by adaptive

1142
01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

1143
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not like an obsession. Is it working for you or not.

1144
01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:18.900
I'm sorry, hold on.

1145
01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:20.820
What

1146
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.410
Katrina Gutierrez: Trinity. I'm in a meeting you need awake.

1147
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember, we started right. I want to know. Am I crazy, crazy people don't know they're crazy and you've asked me in session. Once you had a really big fear response. You were concerned, I was going to label you crazy.

1148
01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I huh

1149
01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe I'm thinking you're crazy right now. How do you know

1150
01:50:58.740 --> 01:50:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

1151
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What's crazy, the person that gets along fine with an absolutely insane environment is that, I mean, cuz sometimes I think that's what we got going on here. I think the world's going crazy. Do I really want to get to. I want to be like, maybe I'd rather just be crazy.

1152
01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the world congress

1153
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:27.750
Katrina Gutierrez: Really, yeah.

1154
01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So let that just all fall away.

1155
01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're happy if right now we want to focus on

1156
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Really a deep connection to your spirituality and it's changing its label you're calling it this far before it was

1157
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Jesus God Catholicism and heaven and hell, you know, the terms that you're using in here if they change like

1158
01:51:56.070 --> 01:52:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been very adamant about certain words and they're starting to change your focus on particular words are changing. I'm watching you, but you really like your words you really get a good strong hold on them and you like them.

1159
01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:16.710
Katrina Gutierrez: Is this because I don't know how to explain something without like a label or a certain word. I don't know how to

1160
01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:18.720
I don't know.

1161
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that I like labels. It's just I don't, it's just it's a way to explain what I'm trying to get across, I guess.

1162
01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're you had years where you didn't have a chance to show the develop that

1163
01:52:37.170 --> 01:52:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that is what it is. Um,

1164
01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:48.750
Katrina Gutierrez: You can say, like, whatever. I'm not gonna get offended. It is there is open trust here. I don't

1165
01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:54.720
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm not super sensitive to where I'm going to freak out or anything like I have in the past.

1166
01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I think on the other side of this

1167
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Identity that you're developing

1168
01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I have my interpretation, I think, on the other side of it years from now, a month from now whatever the time so I don't have any idea about time that I don't know what that is. You're going to go, oh, I worked it out. Hey, turns out I'm okay.

1169
01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a label.

1170
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: For what faith is

1171
01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Its faith, it means there's a abyss.

1172
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Between now and there I don't know what y'all are calling it

1173
01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't know how I'm gonna get over there, but I know I'm going to be okay. And when this is all figured out. And you've run through 20 different labels of things, I think,

1174
01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to come to terms with your enough, you're fine with the label you got this summary that you came up with whichever one which one it's going to be when it all settles in,

1175
01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want it to be adaptive. That is my concern though my concern is, I really do want to know whether it gets in the way.

1176
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Of communication with people. If it's getting in the way your relationship with yourself, if it gets in the way of you accomplishing the goals that you want to play with, whether it's this this business plan.

1177
01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm always curious, are you, is it helping you. Because faith is supposed to kind of let you free from having to analyze a bunch of stuff just yeah faith.

1178
01:54:33.150 --> 01:54:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your faith you just you stop analyzing it just sits there.

1179
01:54:41.610 --> 01:54:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You can call it any number of things.

1180
01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's faith.

1181
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You sits. You don't have to keep going at it.

1182
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And relabeling it are our words are made up of little letters.

1183
01:55:01.050 --> 01:55:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there'll be this this religion or this philosophy that's got something in common with this one, or which ones. Right. Well, which one is it. It's true. The truth.

1184
01:55:11.250 --> 01:55:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Spent a lot of time doing that. I mean, there's whole right that's what philosophers, they spend their whole time kind of analyzing this thing. I can't do it. I can't spend all my time doing that, I get it. I've done it. I've looked at it and then settled into something

1185
01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I could accomplish those little you know bills and things right.

1186
01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your approach adaptive for you or not. That's really it.

1187
01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:40.230
Yeah, okay.

1188
01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are focusing on you. What are some of the goals that this spiritual awakening is helping you move toward. How is it helping

1189
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:55.080
It's helping towards

1190
01:55:56.370 --> 01:56:00.030
Me being more creative expressing my creativity.

1191
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:02.250
being scared to show it.

1192
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:06.840
That's cool. I'm being so

1193
01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:09.870
Obsessed with

1194
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:14.280
Matching or if my hair looks perfect.

1195
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.630
Katrina Gutierrez: My hair is like crazy. These days, I don't know what's going on. I

1196
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:26.850
Katrina Gutierrez: Just got this free thing going on. So it's it's making me more comfortable with myself, I'm

1197
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:35.700
Katrina Gutierrez: More just expressive and not like the outer like expressing outer it's more like the inner like

1198
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:40.260
Katrina Gutierrez: What really makes me happy. What drives me what

1199
01:56:41.610 --> 01:56:45.540
Katrina Gutierrez: I can bring to the table in the sense of

1200
01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:53.790
If no buddy that was created every earth people that were creative never shared you know their talents.

1201
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Get the world would be so boring. Oh, so

1202
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:07.350
Katrina Gutierrez: So it's making me realize that, you know, there are many talents that I have

1203
01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:24.420
Katrina Gutierrez: That I'm learning still, you know, I mean, I'll be graded them at first, or maybe spectacular Adam, but I'm learning them and I'm expressing them and I have the poor, the perfect group of people around me right now that are very supportive of that.

1204
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:26.160
And

1205
01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.860
Katrina Gutierrez: I have the time and

1206
01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:33.150
So it's

1207
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:37.800
It's helping me find myself and what makes me happy again.

1208
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:49.770
Katrina Gutierrez: And not be so stuck on who I used to be, because I am grown compared to that little kid or teenage version of myself. I'm a different person completely

1209
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:58.500
Katrina Gutierrez: In if you even looked at it in like cellular term I'm, I'm a different person. So I'm going to be different.

1210
01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:06.060
And not living in the memory of who or what I used to like or want

1211
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:12.960
Katrina Gutierrez: That that's not who I'm going to be and not where I am so

1212
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me get a second

1213
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't have time to get into refining, some of these other goals for through 11 but I did write a few

1214
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Things down last time. So let me just check in one one statement. Okay. Because we've only got a couple minutes. Pretty sure this client will show up on time, ready, one of your goals is I want to remain a non smoker. Are you remaining a non smoker today.

1215
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you accomplishing that

1216
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:48.540
keeping busy. I'm

1217
01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:50.610
Staying busy.

1218
01:58:51.870 --> 01:59:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And when the thought comes or a trigger happens someone's outside smoking. What do you do, what do you do good to go. There we go. Beautiful. And I want to wake up thankful and smile for no reason. Are you doing that. Yeah. How are you doing that.

1219
01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:17.610
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm just when I wake up I immediately just say thank you because I know

1220
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:37.920
Katrina Gutierrez: That especially just looking at our world these days. It is a very big blessing to wake up and be okay and not be in any of the, you know, what have what the world's going through right now you know know diseases, no hunger. You know, I got everything I need. I have been water.

1221
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:41.250
Not surrounded by Lucas, I mean,

1222
01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.410
Katrina Gutierrez: There's a lot to be thankful for. Yes, there is.

1223
01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're remembering to think about it, when you wake up.

1224
01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Find my calling or purpose by following my passions and heart. How are you doing around that.

1225
01:59:58.650 --> 02:00:02.730
Katrina Gutierrez: Are still just following the passion. Okay.

1226
02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's her. Yeah.

1227
02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's that that business plan you for yourself. Right. Okay.

1228
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:13.410
Katrina Gutierrez: I got all the info for Nike to

1229
02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a really cool idea is I think they're gonna go. I know they're gonna go for it.

1230
02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think so too. I like formulate this whole idea of what you're talking about. I've made something up in my head and I sure hope you follow through with it. I really really do know I'm going to work on it as soon as

1231
02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:34.560
Katrina Gutierrez: I get off with you. I gotta do my my coping and then I'm going to work on it.

1232
02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then there's, I want to do something physical and make sure I would be okay climate and if I

1233
02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Go outside finds

1234
02:00:48.060 --> 02:01:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, alright. So when you identify the okay i want to do something physical. I'm assuming you mean outside maybe what have you done over this last couple weeks that demonstrates to you that you're going to be okay. Physically

1235
02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:08.010
Katrina Gutierrez: I was well I've been doing

1236
02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.380
Katrina Gutierrez: It's not like it's not

1237
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:27.600
Katrina Gutierrez: Couple it up, but it's like this. Yeah, it's like, but it's the, it's the martial arts part of it. The Brazilian and I have this over there so wooden sword.

1238
02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:41.100
Katrina Gutierrez: And I just been messing around with that jumping around. And what I'm trying to do is you see those people that can do like the crazy flips and they look like they're like papers like the the way, nothing. Yeah, I'm learning how to do that. So,

1239
02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:50.070
Katrina Gutierrez: Inside, I'll do the flips and stuff while trying to outside. I will do, like with the sword where I'm just like messing around, but

1240
02:01:51.390 --> 02:02:07.260
Katrina Gutierrez: The kids shouldn't tell Lisa sister came into town with all the kids. So I was out there with them. I have a video where they're harassing me because I'm working on the car and they just like come just harass me, but I was a weekend I was out there working on the car.

1241
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:19.230
Katrina Gutierrez: Learned how to I mean when I started, I had no idea what I was doing. By the end of it. I know all about timing and topped it center and the crankshaft so

1242
02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:21.390
That's me.

1243
02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:23.970
He gets a miracle.

1244
02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:35.580
Katrina Gutierrez: Make sense to me. I don't know if I can figure it out. The hardest part is trying to Google, what this big, you know, square thing next to this other you know round ish thing.

1245
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:40.410
Katrina Gutierrez: Name. So I'm like, I don't know how to Google, but Elena finding it somehow.

1246
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.870
That's neat.

1247
02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:51.000
And then I'm still been doing my dancing that I always do out in the garage or in the living room, but

1248
02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:58.320
I've been starting on the side of the house because there's this little area that's just a little gated area.

1249
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:06.690
And I was able to put down these titles. What's this Florida snap together with the extra I put it down like a breakdancing

1250
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So this goal of developed goals to increase satisfaction pleasure in

1251
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: In unsatisfactory non using areas of life. I feel like this is just not relevant anymore developers to increase satisfaction and pleasure.

1252
02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

1253
02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too. Let's close them and it's been achieved, but 310 20 calls that puppy out, you are much happier gal much much much happier.

1254
02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm excited for you. And what I noticed today. Was it sounds like you've lifted the burden of guilt, like I'm responsible for this other human being. You've lifted it and giving yourself permission to enjoy your life.

1255
02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's huge. And so I want to check in on that a little bit and I did you let me poke there a little bit.

1256
02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you can keep it. If you backslide just let me know. Okay.

1257
02:04:12.330 --> 02:04:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I will

1258
02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:23.820
Let's go cut I'll drop this into the completed area again achieved here.

1259
02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:25.290
Chief

1260
02:04:26.490 --> 02:04:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Paste. Okay, let's schedule another time to meet you.

1261
02:04:33.630 --> 02:04:34.920
See close

1262
02:04:36.690 --> 02:04:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been working on music to I believe it's

1263
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Got this little thing that you've got to the computer. Oh, yeah.

1264
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.180
Katrina Gutierrez: Oh my god, it's so funny.

1265
02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Noon. On March 24 324 at

1266
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The Tuesday.

1267
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. So, if you don't mind. Let's she hasn't come knocking on the door. Let me just hear a little bit about what your takeaway from today is what are you going to walk away with today feels important to you.

1268
02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:46.350
Katrina Gutierrez: That I need to just believe that my intuition is really that I'm not crazy and I need to not focus on that because everybody

1269
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:53.130
Literally everybody that I'm in contact with doesn't think that's the case.

1270
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:57.000
Katrina Gutierrez: And I think that it's just me.

1271
02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:02.070
That's projecting like insecurities about it and it's it's

1272
02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:04.770
Katrina Gutierrez: It's blurring.

1273
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:10.410
This blurring the actual image of what's really going on.

1274
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:14.280
Katrina Gutierrez: That I'm going to make myself crazy by thinking I'm crazy.

1275
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, maybe. Right.

1276
02:06:18.090 --> 02:06:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay.

1277
02:06:20.130 --> 02:06:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: locks into it. Yeah.

1278
02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:27.480
Katrina Gutierrez: And it was believe my intuition, because I do. That's what I feel like that. It wasn't

1279
02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:30.690
What was going on and it's not what's going on.

1280
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:33.210
Katrina Gutierrez: Yeah, I mean not be

1281
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:39.780
Katrina Gutierrez: Not I might. I might have trauma or PTSD, but it's nothing from what

1282
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.570
What is

1283
02:06:43.710 --> 02:06:45.600
been diagnosed. Okay.

1284
02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:49.050
That would be okay.

1285
02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So if there are those tangible things around.

1286
02:06:54.480 --> 02:07:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be able to go without distress, because you work through some of them. As far as being in the car and checking on texts and and Find My iPhone and things like that. Like you've made a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of progress.

1287
02:07:06.210 --> 02:07:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's still things you want access to meaning resources. I want to be able to go here there without

1288
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: uncertainty and fear or I just won't go if there's still some of that that comes up, we can define those

1289
02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And there might be an opportunity if you wanted to, to do some of that work that I was describing the downside. There are some downsides to doing em, Dr. For a little while for some people.

1290
02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It can bring up a fragment that you had compartmentalised because the other thing that happens with a trauma network is it's separate from the rest.

1291
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Of basically the neural networks, it gets sort of isolated and so it's not connected sometimes to positive things either. It's just sort of sits there and isolation by itself.

1292
02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:55.920
You know if

1293
02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:57.330
So,

1294
02:07:58.590 --> 02:08:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me get this thought out because

1295
02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative side effects of em Dr can be increased distress for a little while.

1296
02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: While your work through it. Not always the way I do it is attachment focused em dark em, Dr. Which means I'm using a lot of positive in imagery. While we're doing the work. I want to integrate positive stuff into it. So it's not just the desensitization. So what I do is a little different.

1297
02:08:32.070 --> 02:08:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just different.

1298
02:08:35.130 --> 02:08:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway, we'll talk more. We have another appointment and. Do you need anything for me as far as the

1299
02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Medication goes, Are you you're good to go to group because

1300
02:08:49.050 --> 02:08:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I find
