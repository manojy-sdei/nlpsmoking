53
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.400
Nicole Roybal: No, I woke up sweating blood drenched like dripping in sweat and then all of a sudden like

54
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.580
Nicole Roybal: I didn't feel that it really didn't feel good. I had been going up and I felt my hand side to cramp and I've had that before but last time they come to like that this

55
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.570
Nicole Roybal: Guy was weird stuff like that and they called me like yells for her mom any actual triangles, like I don't know what's going on and

56
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.810
Nicole Roybal: She told her again. Oh, she was like, I told her, get a cool. Tell me on my head and out for a second and then also in my body is really

57
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:29.370
Nicole Roybal: It's shaking like not like shaking, shaking, but it's kind of like jumbling my chest and everything and then I told her I need to give him a bath and you give him a bath.

58
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:40.410
Nicole Roybal: Run a warm bath to me and I got in with all my clothes on and just like lead in there for 15 minutes in ships like pour water on my chest. My throat started like

59
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:50.880
Nicole Roybal: So like not being able to talk for a second. Like, oh like that was weird. And then she started pouring the water with a cup over mind like neck right here.

60
00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:02.970
Nicole Roybal: And then finally, like it calmed down, and I just like doing, trying to breathe in the breathing exercises basically write them as much as I could hold it in because if I could barely breathe and um

61
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.950
Nicole Roybal: And then finally I calmed down after like 10 minutes and my hands. Finally, with my hands kept like all day like kept like

62
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:21.510
Nicole Roybal: cropping up but they weren't getting stuck there like cramping and all the way up to here was hurting and they kept going, dead all day and I have to just I laid in bed all day and I kept like sweating and

63
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.390
Nicole Roybal: It almost happened one other time later on in the day, but I call myself down to where

64
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.880
Nicole Roybal: It was honestly it scared the crap out of

65
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.380
Nicole Roybal: Them.

66
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.320
Nicole Roybal: Like don't go, Nicole. The ambulance was like, No, I don't want to go to the hospital right now.

67
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.610
Nicole Roybal: We'll figure it out.

68
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if Nicole, we do no change to see

69
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What the variable is

70
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

71
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If I want to rule out something I make no change, except one tiny thing or I basically just go I make no change. And I see what's going on with me.

72
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

73
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're tapering off the gabapentin if you're tapering down off the buprenorphine if you're

74
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing something specific, with the marijuana. If you have just gone really you're smoking so much more only you, you know, so it's, I'm not going to do anything different than yesterday and tomorrow. I'm just going to go go. Steady on, what I'm doing to see

75
00:07:47.130 --> 00:08:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If I then change one little thing. What was that notion crapping all about. I want to rule it out. I want to want to figure out, I want to deconstruct. What was it. Now the hard part with the with the psychology piece with the stressor around arguing with boyfriend. Those are harder.

76
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm deconstruct

77
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes when we do the ones around eating, sleeping ingesting substances is then it informs okay I've tried I've rolled out everything else.

78
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it is psychological

79
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we could do.

80
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:34.230
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, well I know for like I i feel like for a fact that eating definitely had a lot to do with it once I ate. I felt

81
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:48.300
Nicole Roybal: So much better. Yeah. She was the first day I finally eight like all three Mills okay breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I felt so much better shield. I got so much better and to do a better job of just getting out of bed, but

82
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.490
Nicole Roybal: I know it's eating. So I know like world. I know. That's what's making me

83
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.300
Nicole Roybal: Get sick if I get sick. Like if I start going up or anything. If I've been eating enough and then

84
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:14.730
Nicole Roybal: But what I'm eating and enforcing it down. That's what I can't, I don't know why I'm feeling sick while I'm eating. That's what drives me nuts. So that's I guess what you're saying. I gotta figure out why it's happening.

85
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just, let's just sit with that one for a second. Yeah.

86
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.000
Nicole Roybal: That's the

87
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.010
Nicole Roybal: Main point I'm

88
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing great.

89
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When just first response, don't, don't do the analysis of it just first response.

90
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: When you Daniel are calling around and everything's

91
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You guys eat together.

92
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.530
Yeah.

93
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.320
Nicole Roybal: Even if we are fighting I eat as long as I'm with him. I eat the noise. I'm just like there with him.

94
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.400
Nicole Roybal: Like when I'm honest, I don't even want to cook and I'm over there. I always cook or what

95
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So something's going on. Maybe while we're getting closer to it.

96
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about being in that house.

97
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.640
Nicole Roybal: Maybe

98
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:16.770
Nicole Roybal: It like, as I said before, I always feel like my parents don't mind having me here and stuff but I get annoying after a while and it felt like a burden, sometimes

99
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.760
Nicole Roybal: I don't think they think that I feel that way.

100
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on, hold on.

101
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch.

102
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To try and say that out loud. See what happens.

103
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a burden. I'm a burden to my mother, see where that lands in the body.

104
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.520
Nicole Roybal: And a burden to my mother.

105
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.840
Nicole Roybal: I'm trying to, yeah.

106
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.930

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure, why don't you go grab grab something to nibble on

110
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.730
Nicole Roybal: There's really nothing

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

112
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

113
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.240

117
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So you eat the bacon in the potato.

118
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:20.700
Yeah.

Nicole Roybal: I don't know why excellent me God

121
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.700
Nicole Roybal: And I love eggs for some reason they made me God for like the past 45 years

122
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.550
Nicole Roybal: Maybe longer

123
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.800
Nicole Roybal: Is making me say that out loud.

124
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell me what you're thinking about

125
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.850
Nicole Roybal: And I guess just like

126
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.510
Nicole Roybal: Don't ever feel like I belong anywhere.

127
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.530
Nicole Roybal: Everybody

128
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.810
Nicole Roybal: eventually gets tired.

129
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.940
Nicole Roybal: So I can't even get away from me, because I am we

130
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever check that out with your mom checked out. If that reality you just shared with me.

131
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If that is true.

132
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.830
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, we've had, like,

133
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:33.060
Nicole Roybal: Like in the past and I stayed here. We've had like joking memorization about it but not like a real conversation. Yeah.

134
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: John conversations that does so, but not in a intentional.

135
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Discussion, you haven't done it that way.

136
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.220
No.

137
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then, every day, you're stuck with

138
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This assumption I don't belong here. I'm not wanted. I have nowhere I have no tribe.

139
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an awful feeling, you know, all and

140
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're one conversation away from being done with that. I think that's not true.

141
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.420
Nicole Roybal: And

142
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I think if you heard it from a credible long meeting one that's sober. SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE CREDIBILITY. Remember drunk and we were just it loses credibility that one, don't count.

143
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: For anything right. It's an inhibitor so well.

144
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So that one doesn't have credibility.

145
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But this might be underlying a lot of what's holding you back.

146
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If you knew

147

226
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.560
Nicole Roybal: I remember it. I was like, Yeah, but I bet I'm like yeah, this is your middle child and you don't care. Bye. But it feels Isaac that you'd like us remember

227
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.800
Nicole Roybal: It's just something I'll shut the hell up and walked away.

228
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can, can we just sit with that for a second.

229
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.220
Yeah.

230
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not sitting with it.

231
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang hang in there.

232
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You started this with Grant. I'm going to tell you a story.

233
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I told my mom.

234
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I think you treat me differently. I think you love me less than my siblings and then I heard how you did it. And I'm so glad I asked those questions because I isn't what you said.

235
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What you said

236
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Was you don't remember what I like because I'm the middle child.

237
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't say

238
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, do you love me the same. You didn't say mom when you don't remember things like I like butter cream, ice cream on my cake and I only like butter on my pancakes and I want bone out pork chops the meaning I make out of it is you love less

239
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't say that.

240
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait, what you do is you hope.

241
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way, she hopes that shut the hell up.

242
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Equals. I love you.

243
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You hope that you don't care because I'm the middle child you hope that your analysis is us analysis. When you say you don't care because I'm the middle child on allies. This is because I'm going to show

244
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't love me in the same sentence you hope that you've communicated the same thing as mom.

245
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you love me the same as you love my siblings.

246
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But they don't

247
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, they don't communicate the same thing.

248
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you know, when in working with me. My the way I do my little role plays are very direct. They're like, they're like razor blade sharp right I don't mess around. I don't play with metaphor I just

249
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I just

250
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I just go right in there. Now, I assume that people are uncomfortable with that because it is is

251
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a difficult thing to do.

252
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very foreign you have a whole lifetime of this thing. You don't care because I'm the middle child that's passive

253
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: aggressive communication you sent to your mom and she gave it right back to you and you summarize it with. We had to talk about it this morning.

254
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna be like

255
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.000
Nicole Roybal: Talk more about

256
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you never said the word love

257
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You never did. You never asked her, Do you love me the same you never said I feel less love what you did was tell stories about pork chops and being middle child. You were a little psychoanalyst in there and and guess what a mom moms don't want to hear that.

258
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.520
Nicole Roybal: I know of course it doesn't

259
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

260
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:28.020
Nicole Roybal: We ended up all the hurt her feelings too and that's it makes me feel a little more shooting.

261
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.350
Nicole Roybal: Probably hurt her feelings by saying that

262
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.660
Nicole Roybal: That's something I need to like stop doing it better. Like I keep putting like

263
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:49.320
Nicole Roybal: Like my feelings like sometimes like sometimes like it might like just like always put others feelings before mine and I'll be looking out for the way they feel. Before I looked up for the way I and you

264
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost right almost

265
00:24:53.580 --> 00:25:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Spoke your truth but your way of communicating it around on the middle child was indirect. Yeah.

266
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.780
Nicole Roybal: It's different. My mom. Looks like I said, I can't do that book. My mom, I didn't eat it or don't I guess.

267
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What she

268
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Drinking when you had this you don't care. I'm the middle child.

269
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.050
Nicole Roybal: No. Okay.

270
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.680
Nicole Roybal: Yes. In the morning Schmidt pork chops or breakfast.

271
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you weren't worried about her feelings. If you trusted that she can take care of herself.

272
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you wanted to hear it once and for all. Or maybe you want to hear it every week. I don't know how many times it's going to take. Or maybe for the rest of your life. You might need to keep hearing it. Would that be okay if you needed to hear it.

273
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Austin.

274
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For quite a while that you needed to keep hearing it your way. Like, yeah, this is the way you know I got a lifetime to like be a little confused about my place in this family, a little confused there.

275
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We love him on

276
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, is it okay that you need it the way you need it.

277
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.430
Nicole Roybal: No.

278
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.560
Nicole Roybal: Selfish

279
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So until you get over that part. There's no way you can be direct because you are saying you don't deserve it. So we got to get past that part that you even deserve.

280
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The same portion as anybody else.

281
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:51.660
Nicole Roybal: I don't know if this matters. My thing like part of what has to do it like not feeling like I belong, because like going up every time, like a big family force.

282
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.630
Nicole Roybal: And every time. Like we go to like a birthday party or Thanksgiving already Earth, our family when I was younger.

283
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:10.740
Nicole Roybal: There was always people that were my little sister's he was I'm hanging out. There's always people that were older and my older sisters each and hurting out. There's no one never known for me anything out socially with the way to grown up kids, there's a way to young kids.

284
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.300
Nicole Roybal: Right. And I never

285
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:21.030
Nicole Roybal: I was always just like, kind of like lost like where do I go to I hang out with, you know, I think that might have something to do it. Not feeling like I belong.

286
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.410
Yeah.

287
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it looks like it's true because look, you're saying like, I bet it's true.

288
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't belong. I don't know.

289
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Where the older kids. I was a little red bells bugging them. And if I was with the younger kids and all their little runs are bugging me. So it was just like

290
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.510
Way.

291
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.390
Nicole Roybal: So those irritated.

292
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is, there is that last and people are irritated with me.

293
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever remember feeling

294
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.250
Like you belong

295
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: With some of your friends when you're

296
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheering or something like that.

297
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.610
Nicole Roybal: Oh god.

298
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.030
Nicole Roybal: I can't think of anything. They do I have, I'm just trying to think of which group of friends. I thought the most

299
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.740
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

300
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.180
Nicole Roybal: Doing

301
00:29:50.340 --> 00:30:04.980
Nicole Roybal: I guess. Yeah, my friends from West Mesa the like my last senior year I had to them. And those friends actually really we're super nice to me and like accepting and every judge me and

302
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's one

303
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Good God, you had it. Did you was the thing that you had in common.

304
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: A sport and activity, drinking, smoking vandalizing, what was it,

305
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.390
Nicole Roybal: Probably drinking, smoking, honestly. So we did every day and go

306
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.160
Nicole Roybal: drink and smoke was like our main thing.

307
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.280
Nicole Roybal: Or flyers and things flying around me. IT'S PISSING ME OFF.

308
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.910
Nicole Roybal: I know I don't. I think it's like a Mac. It's not big enough to the way

309
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.910
Nicole Roybal: They came in from outside.

310
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And how old is this West Mesa age. How old are you, West Mesa

311
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:13.980
Nicole Roybal: Graduated I was 18

312
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What else was going on at that time. Tell me more about that time.

313
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.670
Nicole Roybal: I had became friends with this girl Raquel show my friend no more, but

314
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.390
Nicole Roybal: When she was on the Phillies on the dance team. And I don't mean there's got really close. And then we just

315
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:46.620
Nicole Roybal: Me and her sorry hanging out and then somehow my friend Monique Gladden mix. And then my friend Erica got in the mix and

316
00:31:47.190 --> 00:32:03.780
Nicole Roybal: We're all just like four best friends are always hanging out and we're always together, just so we really, we go to school, go to our first class and then we have like a little break after that. And during that break. We just need we go and get a friggin gallon of vodka and drink it.

317
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.680
Nicole Roybal: And so we're just hanging out with all of our like a

318
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.480
Nicole Roybal: guy friends all day and stuff, ones that weren't in school tomorrow dropouts.

319
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:22.200
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. It just really good times. Now I put together. We didn't hurt early five foot tall girls are but

320
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.120
You

321
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.580
Nicole Roybal: Know,

322
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.800
Nicole Roybal: I want to get it with my hands. I think I got it.

323
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you say there's some significance around a change in the pattern of drinking

324
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: prior to age 18 and after like that seemed like that was an important time period where it went up. Was that an important time period.

325
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.550
Nicole Roybal: Well yeah cuz when I graduated

326
00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:06.840
Nicole Roybal: I don't even know. Like what does ditching all the time, you know, how the hell is depressing. But what significant and what do you mean, like, like it was an important time in my life or in drink.

327
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just around the amount, maybe in the frequency of the drinking. Do you think that was a

328
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Say a milestone in okay the progression of the drinking changed, right around that time period.

329
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.100
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's when I started drinking in the morning.

330
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.590
Nicole Roybal: I think that's about needs to drink in the morning.

331
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:42.120
Nicole Roybal: Yeah because yeah after that was when I did start drinking heavily with all the time. Like I drink in the morning and it wouldn't be a problem like steak. Yes, drink.

332
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.610
Nicole Roybal: Not good.

333
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And your parents didn't know

334
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.090
Nicole Roybal: When I was teaching at school. No.

335
00:34:55.890 --> 00:35:01.410
Nicole Roybal: Did they know you have to come home and go straight to sleep after school, so I don't know, maybe, I don't know.

336
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

337
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't know. Maybe they didn't know and maybe

338
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.670
Nicole Roybal: They probably did that.

339
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.490
Nicole Roybal: Or they knew, and I was drunk.

340
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on a second, hold on.

341
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.820
Nicole Roybal: I'm trying to think, actually, like, think about that.

342
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.800
Nicole Roybal: Of course, once I was 21 they knew

343
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.870
Nicole Roybal: That before 21 i don't think Daniels drinking that much.

344
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Did they know during the time

345
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were becoming chemically dependent on opiates. Did they know about that part.

346
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:04.110
Nicole Roybal: No, they didn't know I was on heroin. So basically I got off of that.

347
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:19.110
Nicole Roybal: They had their suspicions and stuff, but they didn't have nothing like no concrete like proof that I was doing it. So they would like think I was, but they weren't sure like in the back of your mind. Basically, like, I don't want to believe it or not, I mean,

348
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:30.060
Nicole Roybal: Then, once I got off it. And I told them how it was getting off. It was so like disappointed in me. I was doing it. But then once I got through it as clean. They're really proud.

349
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.010
Nicole Roybal: That

350
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:36.840
Nicole Roybal: We both knew my sister that's on it now.

351
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:47.430
Nicole Roybal: They finally stopped giving her money and stuff, but they wouldn't even give me $5 when I was on it. They suspected that with my sister. They've given her a bunch of money because she has a baby.

352
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:54.540
Nicole Roybal: And it's like, that's something that's always got me really mad. Like, why do you help her with her dress with these will be without me if my

353
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Drug Abuse help me pay for the drugs you paid for my sister's heroin, but you won't pay for mine.

354
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:16.050
Nicole Roybal: Basically well because you'll see any money for diapers any $20 for this for the baby and they'll give it to her knowing. She's lying, but they know what she's using it for. But they still get richer, not anymore, but they used

355
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would have liked your parents to fund some of your heroin use to

356
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.790
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, it sounds bad. I know what I mean by it is, it's more of like a deeper

357
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.980
Nicole Roybal: Another way of feeling they didn't care for it, but they'll give her money but they wouldn't give me money because they don't care about

358
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.660
Nicole Roybal: Is how I think.

359
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how you think.

360
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:48.750
Nicole Roybal: I'm, I'm glad they didn't find it. I'm happy, I'm happy about that. But for somebody in the background. I still get really upset about that.

361
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.720
Nicole Roybal: Situation. I know, I know.

362
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so now you're

363
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Smoking there we'd

364
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Go anywhere. Don't go anywhere just if you give this away. I will be gone.

365
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.320
Okay.

366
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep breathing breathe funny.

367
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If you smoke their weed.

368
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And it turns out that they're pissed off at you.

369
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You might run the risk of interpreting that is they don't love you.

370
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.380
Nicole Roybal: I'm confused. What do you mean

371
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If they say

372
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't smoke mind, we'd

373
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.620
Nicole Roybal: All go

374
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Go slow

375
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you going to feel they say

376
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't smoke my weed.

377
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:01.770
Nicole Roybal: I'm good.

378
00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.300
Nicole Roybal: Without I do to get this punishment reserve this punishment.

379
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:13.950
Nicole Roybal: I them by probably understand and I did okay well because my database housing one hand washes the other

380
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.720
Nicole Roybal: So I'll be like, well, I'll catch you back. Oh, go by Simon smoke with do it that way, just kind of, you know, getting

381
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:31.440
Nicole Roybal: Us all the joy, joy, joy, awesome like next time. Not right after each other, but I don't know, I probably have come up with some bargain.

382
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.850
Nicole Roybal: So bad looking like that.

383
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.070
Nicole Roybal: I know it's not good. Sophie.

384
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In your house, much like the heroin.

385
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Funded for sister not fair. There's no judgment. It's we're looking at it objectively and saying how

386
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How is communication of love exchanged in your house.

387
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In your house. No one calls each other out and says, Are you drinking. Nobody sleeps in like this. I don't understand, and they love could look like that where they checked in on school checked on to make sure you are attending that isn't how your family worked

388
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It was

389
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: About

390
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't call anyone out. I won't get called out.

391
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just drink together so together and and we don't have to own the fact that neither one of us doing this as healthy.

392
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:50.670
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, my family never calls each other on anything. I'm the only one that does. And that's why guys but next I'm going to say something no one else has anything

393
00:40:53.700 --> 00:41:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But a child, Nicole. When you rely on your family for shelter and food and everything. It is very difficult to call a family out. So you've had to

394
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: repress

395
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your best

396
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: instinct to go to school to do the things that you want to do.

397
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family environment didn't match what you wanted to do.

398
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's happening again around prevention of virus, your intuition is over here. Maybe you heard it in here. Wherever you want to be careful in just in such way and it's coming up again.

399
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You want

400
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To be proactive.

401
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But that doesn't match the family norm, the family norm is shush, let's get by, let's get by skin. Hi, just

402
00:41:54.150 --> 00:42:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you're doing with clean and careful doesn't match, it means they're going to have to see other things like

403
00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.860
Nicole Roybal: You know, did you get sick. One of us for years freaking serious now.

404
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.300
Probably

405
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you want to go at it but but the same way you want to go out with the virus like someone like me would be going at it around, how could you possibly drink or smoke with your child. How could you do that. But wait, hold on. Don't go anywhere. It's different. It's just

406
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not right, it's not wrong. It's just, this is how your family operates. Are you going to keep fighting it or accepted for exactly what it is.

407
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:56.220
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, it was like, I'm always like fighting them like trying to, like, get them to like be better change their ways, you know, and I can't force them doing things that helps just want to be helped.

408
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:06.060
Nicole Roybal: And I keep trying and keep trying and I even just like like their habits will gather habits of like cleanliness and stuff and they have been washing their hands and stuff.

409
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:13.410
Nicole Roybal: It's men, my little brother and my dad, they will not take it seriously, I'm just like, What the hell's wrong with you guys.

410
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:21.570
Nicole Roybal: I got my little brother taken as a joke. Why don't you just take it as a joke. Every time I tell him to Washington. He says that it pisses them off. It makes them not want to watch it.

411
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.850
Nicole Roybal: Because I'm pushing him and my God, we've been pushing as hard as I've been pushing everyone else.

412
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:40.050
Nicole Roybal: The two guys in their house just don't want to take it seriously. That's what's been driving me nuts like I just tried to try and trying to like push make them be cleaner.

413
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.510
Nicole Roybal: And going crazy.

414
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.660
Nicole Roybal: But keep trying and trying and nothing's working

415
00:43:50.220 --> 00:44:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You can either give up, keep doing what you're doing present facts from right CDC pulling it out and getting information this these are real. These are these people that are dying this these are facts, they can still not pay attention to it.

416
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's you moving out. There's you getting a job getting out there, going back to school do what she needs to do.

417
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You happen to have an environment right now. That makes it that much more difficult, but you we don't know that to be 100% true. Maybe you are in class and you're doing it online or you whatever

418
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots can be done, but you're pushing it them is having the exact opposite of what you want. So you got to say, who's crazy, the one that keeps doing the same thing, getting the same results.

419
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not working.

420
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your environment isn't used to anybody doing the right thing. They don't like it. They don't want to hear that.

421
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They want to hear what's going on.

422
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.890
Nicole Roybal: Because I asked her, What's wrong with them.

423
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are yet again in a in a situation where you are the odd one out now. It's a really uncomfortable one. You just told some some stories about not fitting in. And here it is again I don't fit in again. Again, I don't fit in.

424
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're so we're in my house means you're the freak.

425
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.880
But that

426
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean that it's not right for you.

427
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.620
Nicole Roybal: That's why I'm feeling so much more left out.

428
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.960
Nicole Roybal: Because I'm not drinking with them.

429
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.900
Nicole Roybal: Right. That does make sense. Like the oddball out like

430
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And now you're adding now you're bossy little cutie pie over there telling McLean their hands and they're not feeling it. So,

431
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's revisit

432
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put aside virus for just a second. Let's just revisit your psychological stability for just a moment. Okay. Okay.

433
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

434
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You have far and above what it takes to

435
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a doctoral degree in whatever you want far and above the ability to get a masters degree far and above the ability to get a college degree far and above the ability

436
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a reciprocal respectful loving relationship far and above the ability if you so choose to start family have a family raising family far and above the ability to stay sober for the rest of your life. You are not sober now.

437
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But, you know, getting there in a very meaningful way you've cut out one of them.

438
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.350
That's

439
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes faith.

440
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: With this unknown that I just talked about, that it will be reached.

441
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:06.870
Nicole Roybal: I hope so.

442
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes faith in yourself.

443
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:23.670
Nicole Roybal: It just sucks, like how you're saying like to move out. We'll get a job and move on and stuff like that isn't like it's not that easy. You know, I got to get a job and then figure out how to save money when I'm literally

444
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:35.610
Nicole Roybal: Sitting here and then Daniels and my grandma's house looks like three houses my food stamps and I'm just, I think. So if I have a job and I have many of them still spending money in three places.

445
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:42.810
Nicole Roybal: And to save money and they take forever to save up enough money to get an apartment like $1,000

446
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.610
That's just

447
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

448
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.890
Nicole Roybal: My point though these what you said it like it's so easy, but it's not. I'll be here for

449
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say it was easy. I

450
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.110
Nicole Roybal: Know, I know you didn't mean it sound like it's so easy.

451
00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, I believe that you have what it takes to above and beyond.

452
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Above and beyond. You have everything that it takes

453
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that gets in the way is you think you have some magic that can predict the future. But you and I both don't

454
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to whatever degree.

455
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A belief in you. Sometimes I believe in you more than you believe in yourself.

456
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.210
Nicole Roybal: Probably

457
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.220
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

458
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody needs to

459
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Not yelling you but say you've got the stuff you've got it.

460
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Day after day after day, you've got the stuff

461
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Most important person is you the believes it. But for now, you can borrow mine.

462
00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So incredibly smart and you don't know it because nobody's telling you. Holy shit.

463
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing,

464
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.990
Nicole Roybal: Live always tells me I'm smart.

465
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:13.980
Nicole Roybal: Okay so much yesterday.

466
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can minimize mine too.

467
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

468
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.570
Don't

469
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to read the crystal ball. You just do one thing. The same way you schedule an appointment St. It's it takes the exact same skills. There's no possible way I could have written all of the papers that I wrote. If I did what you did.

470
00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I never written a graduate school paper before. Why on earth would I think I could

471
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I get a written one

472
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wrote one and it just about killed me because every sentence. Every word was agonized over

473
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.150
Nicole Roybal: What does that mean,

474
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It means I needed it to be perfect and so

475
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.130
Nicole Roybal: You're an agony over every word. Yeah, okay, good. I get

476
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That meant that that paper took this much time when really you only this much time.

477
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.700
Nicole Roybal: But it felt like that was chatting. So you're saying

478
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It took this much time because I kept rewriting re looking up.

479
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:51.750
Nicole Roybal: To

480
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Like all of this, but but here's the problem. I had five other classes.

481
00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:58.860
Nicole Roybal: And oh, gosh.

482
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was not adaptive was not efficient something needed to change the papers were still going to be do somebody needed to change. I'm not going to get my professors to change. I needed to make a change.

483
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: My approach to the sentence might approach to I'm good enough that they let me enter this during school, surely, I've got what the stuff

484
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To write a paper they let me in.

485
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me turn one in

486
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not getting my other work done. I'm not studying these other exams, because I'm focused on a perfect paper. Now, I don't even know what to put it up against what would a purpose paper look like I've never even written one or seen one.

487
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.080
Nicole Roybal: Wow, okay.

488
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.060
Nicole Roybal: We get what you're saying.

489
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I was trying to be perfect, right. This is an analogy for what I think you're doing

490
00:51:53.670 --> 00:52:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to imagine into the future. All of the things that could go wrong. And I'm trying to get ahead of them. I don't want to ever hear you use the wrong APA style for quotation, or whatever it was. It's so detailed so many little details.

491
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to hear it. And I don't want to hear it because I'm sensitive to criticism.

492
00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say pretty common thing.

493
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:19.170
Huh.

494
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But it meant I might fail out of school. So is this really what's needed

495
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If this if I spend this much time on this one paper but I fail on a school is that efficient.

496
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:41.520
Nicole Roybal: No. Oh, OK. OK, I see, I see.

497
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.630
Nicole Roybal: Focus on one thing, too much because then you're gonna

498
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.400
Nicole Roybal: miss out on all the other things right away. I don't know.

499
00:52:52.170 --> 00:53:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So now we're going to take it to you, but it has to do with projecting into the future. Perfect. I want to know what is it you know what the next move is for you. But you are waiting for the perfect recipe.

500
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll go to it. What's the thing that you really know you need to do.

501
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.870
Nicole Roybal: A job.

502
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's keeping you from doing it.

503
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.710
Nicole Roybal: Oh, this week working

504
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:30.540
Nicole Roybal: Well, I guess I think I need to do is I need to get that

505
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:44.520
Nicole Roybal: I need to call my grandparents insurance and get that figured out so I could become their caretaker. Okay, that's kind of the job in China, get you know i mean i need me, and I don't mind helping them. Okay.

506
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:51.690
Nicole Roybal: So that's something I should sit on my mind a lot and I keep not doing it, but I need to be there with my grandparents, do it.

507
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.940
Nicole Roybal: I mean, we've seen them this week yet because of the network.

508
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So just so you know you. This has been on your plate. Long before the intensity

509
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Of virus was in front of us.

510
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.170
Nicole Roybal: True, so

511
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.090
Nicole Roybal: More scattered now to

512
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just convenient for you to use this because no one's gonna argue with you but me, I will, because that's how I roll, but

513
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a good excuse you got a good one. Now, you really got a good one.

514
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:26.880
Nicole Roybal: Huh.

515
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There was, there was an excuse you were using before. This came up

516
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.270
Nicole Roybal: I'm smoking.

517
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Really okay but you

518
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, well, you were going over there and you were taking care of them. You were smoking less

519
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:43.920
Mm hmm.

520
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.060
Nicole Roybal: Well, I was afraid about them knowing that I see.

521
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:49.800
Nicole Roybal: Well,

522
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: They found out that you smoke cigarettes. So now all that's left is the weed.

523
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so I'm not going to get into what cognitive dissonance is but it might be

524
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.450
Nicole Roybal: For next time. All right. Um,

525
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it. Let's do it just happened here.

526
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.200
There we go.

527
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.730
Good grief internet

528
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.710
Okay. This is really weird.

529
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, since I can't find it, just talk about it what what is if I were to write down

530
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If the goal is

531
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To become

532
00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Care, the actual title is caregiver or caretaker because they're different in my world, so what what do you know, that was the proper term is

533
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.020
Nicole Roybal: Let's suppose caretaker.

534
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.920
Nicole Roybal: Okay, so this question.

535
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I use the word caregiver. Because to me, a caretaker is someone that takes care of a dead body.

536
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.750
Nicole Roybal: Or your

537
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your or your lawn. So for me, it's a giver. So, um, I always get this feeling. Every time you say, kind of like the caretaker will move the body into the

538
00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.670
Nicole Roybal: City and caregivers.

539
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The last person that takes care of me. It's good to be the caretaker.

540
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.840
Nicole Roybal: Not seeing everyone calls it caretaker. I don't have that everything became a thing.

541
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm can be the one that's wrong. That's how it goes and

542
00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:56.880
Nicole Roybal: I don't know.

543
00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.430
Where the heck

544
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I'll look it up if something's going on with my electronics here. So this is what we'll do, we'll say become I'm going to say caregiver and

545
00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not. I'm wrong, but will say caregiver first steps of client will. What's the first step.

546
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:22.920
Nicole Roybal: Call their insurance.

547
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now why is it that you have to be over there. Why can't you ask them for the number

548
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:41.460
Nicole Roybal: Because I can't talk to the insurance on behalf of someone else unless that person like consensual meet you or says it's okay so my grandma business has to get on the phone and say yes. Okay. Like this is Connie, it's okay for her to

549
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.010
Nicole Roybal: Can you talk to her about my help.

550
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:47.070
Nicole Roybal: She can't call them.

551
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't be on a three way call with you. I don't understand why I

552
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:59.970
Nicole Roybal: Guess. Yeah, last time we did. That was my mom did that she was so confused. As you know, what the hell is going on. She's all

553
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But but but Nicole, you're a part of to. It's actually hard to get you to stay really concrete, you get right you know how you giggle and you, you kind of

554
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.320
Nicole Roybal: What you think we're

555
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're very intelligent. So you go, you go a lot of different places and your grandma may only hear the change in topic. So it might be grandma, you're talking to.

556
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah.

557
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:33.060

Gwenevere Abriel: Yes sweetie. Of course, it's okay. I want you to be my caregiver, Sarah. Did you hear her. Do you want to ask her a direct question. So, Grandma, you're on the phone with me.

565
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're on the phone with insurance, Sarah, we're all together. She needs to know it's okay that I be your caregiver. Notice how slow and agonizing that is

566
00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:34.140
Nicole Roybal: I know I that's how I do have talked to my grandma, but you're some awesome. My mom did that it took them like 20 minutes just to figure it out like just to be able to

Gwenevere Abriel: Get there so they get so lost you understand

568
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:43.470
Nicole Roybal: It's hard. I'd rather just be able to share with them. And I'm going to be able to go over there. Now that word school

Nicole Roybal: So I got to school and

571
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget the other part, right, there's this virus. So it's not it's not the same. You waited. Now you've got another challenge in front of you.

572
00:59:55.530 --> 01:00:02.310
Nicole Roybal: You ate him. That's true. Well, even if I'm the caretaker. What am I, I mean I have to go there. Either way, I started doing they're here to here, so

573
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:07.560
Nicole Roybal: We're kind of not sure what to do either. And that's why I'm so scared because it was a frickin virus.

574
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.720
Nicole Roybal: I don't want to consider.

575

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:32.250
Nicole Roybal: And I don't know what they're going to want to like know what they're not want me to talk to their medications or anything like that. So that's where I'm nervous. I don't know what they're going to know

578
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:36.810
Nicole Roybal: And do you need to call and find out.
