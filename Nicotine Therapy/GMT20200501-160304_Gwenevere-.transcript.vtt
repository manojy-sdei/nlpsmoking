Lyndsey Lorett: So they're shutting all the roads that lead into our county

Lyndsey Lorett: So I came back and now if something happens with my daughter. I don't know how many get there.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up seeing your daughter last week.

16
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Okay. Hey,

17
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I got that in my head that you were going to visit your daughter.

18
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. All right, so I'm Lindsay. Yeah.

19
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to worry about that, that that's not happening right now.

20
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.700
Lyndsey Lorett: What's not happening.

21
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Your daughter's Okay Isn't she

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, she is. Okay.

23
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What good is it going to do for you to worry

24
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Not good. No.

25
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not and

26
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to make you less available to your son to making sure that you you kind of keep taking care of yourself. It's not going to prevent anything so

27
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just focus on the things you can control the things that are right in front of you. Alright, so let's focus on that today.

28
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But I get how scary. I get it. I went there with you too, for a second. I just thought, Boy, that that's unacceptable and yet it's happening.

29
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's real. It's not like

30
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your imagination. This is really happen so but your daughter's okay and she has your grandma. Your parents so

31
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So now, tell me a little bit about what your mind what your heart. What's your spirit. What's your emotional life has been like over this last week because you didn't talk much in group and kind of wanted to different to 10 here today.

32
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Well, the reason I did that is because

33
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I was really woke up Tuesday morning really sick. And I was trying really hard not to throw up during group.

34
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.950
Lyndsey Lorett: And then as soon as I left the meeting. I opened the car door and threw up.

35
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Oh my god.

36
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:42.570
Lyndsey Lorett: And then I threw up yesterday and today, and I know, I know this sounds so I'm a woman. It seems normal but i i got my period. And I haven't had one since before I was pregnant, and even then it was only once, and then I didn't have one for five years.

37
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

38
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.990
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's just like, thrown. I feel like my body shutting down on

39
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Shutting down

40
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, shutting down

41
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It just opened up. It just started working. It's interesting you phrase it like that. Tell me why shutting down

42
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:18.150
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know, I'm not supposed to get a period of my my ovaries were taken by the infection. I'm not supposed to have a period. So I don't know what's going on.

43
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.190
Okay.

44
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, who was a physician. Have you told about this.

45
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I have it. I just figured it out today. This morning, why I've been

46
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.920
Lyndsey Lorett: So sick, I guess.

47
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I thought my wound was leaking yesterday. Um, but it's no it's a it's a period

48
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know the difference.

49
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:56.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Because the leaking. Is it coming from the wound, when I change it. It's just a little bit wet. There's not blood, um,

50
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.200
Lyndsey Lorett: It's purely yeah it's def. It's a period

51
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.150
Lyndsey Lorett: And then my first thought was, in my bleeding somewhere. I'm not supposed to

52
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:15.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, but then my moon was like no, your body is probably you're probably getting it back working and I don't. I guess I just don't see that.

53
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so, but notice your language was it's shutting down

54
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.250
Yeah.

55
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mom saying is actually

56
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Turning on working again and I'm saying it's working again assuming right this nothing bleeding that shouldn't be bleeding.

57
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do think getting doctors involved besides mom and therapist might be a good idea. So

58
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: At a minimum, I would have invited you to make sure you pulled a you're feeling miserable but say I want a breakout meeting with you Dr. Raphael. And if I can't meet with you then can I schedule an appointment.

59
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, okay, okay.

60
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because at least you're getting physicians ear, you know, they can think of things that we're just not trained in

61
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then. Okay, you know what I'm trying to say we want as much information from that medical field as possible. And I would definitely let your, your doctors know that. Okay. You did.

62
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:34.080
Lyndsey Lorett: I let the womb doctor's note, but I can't travel to Farmington to see them so their advice was to go to the ER.

63
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.030
Lyndsey Lorett: And I guess if I guess if I need to go.

64
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.140
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just like things are crazy right now.

65
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How open, would you be if Dr. Maria was available right now would you. Would you welcome her visiting

66
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.370
Yeah.

67
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Cuz at first. I just thought it was anxiety, you know,

68
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.560
Uh huh.

69
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

70
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I think she's in a in a meeting.

71
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.370
Okay.

72
00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, you're suspecting that it's the stress from from what

73
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.880
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm just, just everything. It's getting really bad here.

74
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:26.490
Lyndsey Lorett: And like 10 times worse than any other county in the state. And it's just I don't know. I was over it, when it first started. So, you know,

75
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:38.310
Lyndsey Lorett: And then you would think if I was really that stressed, how the heck would I get my period because stress usually stops and period right

76
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.210
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow.

77
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me hear how else this is affecting you you you've, you've also got some symptoms of vomiting and that's been going on since since Tuesday or were there more days.

78
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.550
Lyndsey Lorett: No, it was Tuesday. It started Tuesday.

79
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:04.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Tuesday morning before group. I actually was able to dissolve all of my text and have it in me until after group.

80
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.470
Lyndsey Lorett: But Wednesday I threw up with it in my mouth and then continue to throw up.

81
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:18.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Yesterday, the same thing happened and I the suppositories, they meet, we really sleepy.

82
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Dodge April gave me they work. They are great. They work very quickly.

83
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.530
Lyndsey Lorett: But it's very sedating

84
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.800
Lyndsey Lorett: And so I try not to take them.

85
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.390
Lyndsey Lorett: But something is going on that I need to take that, take it.

86
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Earlier.

87
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Than I do

88
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.670
Okay.

89
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe setting.

90
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it setting an alarm, just to wake up to get the Soviet texts dissolve. Do you think that might be the case like setting an early alarm. Is that what you're thinking.

91
00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.570
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm thinking that I think that I need to set an alarm to take the Finnegan suppository

92
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.440
Lyndsey Lorett: About

93
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:09.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Two or three hours before I wake up so that I can get. And it's not just my sub you text. It's my sorry

94
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

95
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.330
Lyndsey Lorett: All the medicine.

96
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're facing a lot of challenges, aren't you

97
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.980
Yeah.

98
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're feeling it.

99
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell me a story about hanging out with your daughter. What was it like

100
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.660
Lyndsey Lorett: We went on a walk with her new dog. She's got a golden doodle.

101
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:55.560
Lyndsey Lorett: And, um, she just runs runs runs with the dog and they just go, go, go. And she is just so much energy and just loves to explore

102
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.840
Lyndsey Lorett: I love seeing it.

103
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you seeing her that she's

104
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally Healthy and physically healthy

105
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:22.110
Lyndsey Lorett: She is physically healthy. There's some stuff going on with my parents, some arguments that have been happening in front of her. They normally don't argue in front of her. And so she she feels like her family's falling apart.

106
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Honey, you know, she feels that way.

107
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Because she called me crying right before I got on with you.

108
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What did she say

109
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:41.700
Lyndsey Lorett: She said that, me, me and Papa got to a big argument and she feels like her family's going to break up and she's going to be an orphan.

110
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your response.

111
00:12:50.610 --> 00:13:03.480
Lyndsey Lorett: My response was that she's very loved and very cared for and that we would do everything in our power to take care of her that she saved. She has a home and she has a family.

112
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have an idea of where she would come to the conclusion that arguing would lead to her being an orphan. How are those two things connected. Do you think

113
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:29.070
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know because my parents don't they don't argue in front of her at all ever

114
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.930
Lyndsey Lorett: And so, and my dad just blew up.

115
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.940
Lyndsey Lorett: The other day just he's probably feeling stress of his own.

116
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:53.250
Lyndsey Lorett: And he blamed it on my mom and left the dinner table, and he doesn't normally do that. So all this stuff that doesn't normally happen is happening. And it's creating a fear in her

117
00:13:53.970 --> 00:14:01.830
Lyndsey Lorett: And she knows I'm sick, so she's worried I'm gonna die. I mean you pop are gonna split up and she's not going to have a home.

118
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I see it. It's it. I couldn't quite figure out why the orphan. It's this additional piece that you might get sick and and won't be won't be mom anymore and won't be around. I get it. Now I see it couldn't quite figure that part out.

119
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

120
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Sorry, when my pen is overheating.

121
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Oh.

122
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I gotta pull it off.

123
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead and log out cool it off.

124
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go grab a drink of water. It's okay. The timing.

125
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just let it

126
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

127
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then come right down for like two minutes.

128
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.440
Lyndsey Lorett: cooled off. Yep. And I have the air blowing right on it.

129
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your daughter know anything about and I don't, but I want to know more, but does your daughter know anything about that program. Tick tock. The dance thing.

130
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.070
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I don't think so.

131
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I was just curious, it might be kind of a fun

132
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: A fun way for you guys to connect

133
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Where was because right it's on my mind only because I had time to stand here and thinking about creating a video challenge so that some kids can

134
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the the dance most

135
00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Likely, I thought it might be an interesting thing for you to to do where your daughter does some basic dance moves. And you don't have to be really moving and grooving but you can stand right

136
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah so

137
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't really know what it is exactly, but what it looks like is I think the kid.

138
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: comes up with a dance move their basic moves. And then what we do is we do this. It's this program where our videos right here and we do it to the same music. Our kids are and then it looks like we're both dancing the same moves with

139
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It and I'm, I'm trying to think of a way to incorporate it into this this this party thing that I'm doing because we can't meet some trying to kind of make it fun. And I just thought, I wonder if that's something that Lindsay might like to do with her daughter.

140
00:16:50.640 --> 00:17:01.350
Lyndsey Lorett: You know we SHE HAS HER WE dancing and I will watch her dance do stuff when we video chat. Um, so that sounds like a good idea.

141
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because it's a kind of a competition where she'll create say okay, give me five moves or maybe only three moves. So, for example, I'm trying to think of. It's like it's going to be this, and something like this.

142
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that and then doing it to music and then you have to do it. And then these two videos together and how cute is that mom and daughter dancing together so

143
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, right. That's what I thought.

144
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Music

145
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you I don't know yet. I haven't quite figured that out. Um, I don't know if I'll take the time to learn. The Tick tock.

146
00:17:45.480 --> 00:18:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's already written for example, I put the app on my phone. I looked at, I think it was Jessica Alba had a little thing. And there were other there are people like stars that do these little competitions and then you try and match them.

147
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know. It looks complicated, I didn't get all the way into it, but I thought if your daughter and you wanted to have something to sort of learn together that might be fun.

148
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.300
Lyndsey Lorett: I like that.

149
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, you always have ideas.

150
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not you know

151
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.770
Yeah.

152
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Different thinking, right, it changes how you feel when you start thinking about something playful and something fun.

153
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It can shift all of that worrisome got

154
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of along those lines. Have you had a chance to when you're doing the wound care, you were doing it as much as twice a day. Did you use some of the imagery

155
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have that fabric that terry cloth there in your hand.

156
00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:01.260
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I have it and it's frayed and it actually because I moved do something with my hand. Anyways, usually when I'm nervous.

157
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.790
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. I'm just always doing something so it helps

158
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:19.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Take the focus off of what he's doing in that moment until something hurts really bad. And then the pain goes away and then I rub, rub, rub. So, yeah.

159
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So also part of the preparation part the 10 minutes before the 15 minutes before

160
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Really working hard to be at peace in those moments to that there's no trepidation about you're about to go have that that wound care.

161
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. That was the part that I was kind of hoping not only what you're doing with it, but also

162
00:19:49.410 --> 00:20:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The friends that might come in the Minutes beforehand, like this is going to hurt that you do some of that imagery and that tactile connection. Have you had a chance to do it before.

163
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.320
Lyndsey Lorett: So I've tried like the deep breathing, trying to get to come state.

164
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:16.740
Lyndsey Lorett: And some reason I can't pull during while I'm doing it and rubbing so much better. But before I just

165
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.900
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. I don't know what

166
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.030
Lyndsey Lorett: I will literally just lay there. Breathing deep breaths, deep breaths.

167
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.100
Lyndsey Lorett: But I don't have something that I'm thinking on. I'm just breathing.

168
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

169
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, I'm still thinking about the

170
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.090
Lyndsey Lorett: You know,

171
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think what happened is I think you're forgetting the the imagery. So let's go into that for just a second note. And I think if you can recall what we had done was in your right hand.

172
00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now for you. I can, I can see that that you typically are already kind of self soothing. It's called we're doing this.

173
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so either hand so you're you're doing that and the piece that

174
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I was hoping would be integrated was including God

175
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Including the feeling right of being with this nurturing figure the wise figure and the protective figure and it's, I think you may have forgotten that part.

176
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.590
Lyndsey Lorett: I did definitely forgot that part. It's hard to pull your mind away.

177
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.610
I know

178
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

179
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let so we'll just do this as broken record reminder, this is what I do. I know today.

180
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to want to be my best. I'm going to want to feel in my strength and wisdom.

181
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And my skin is designed

182
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To notice when it's pulled and stretched. It's designed it has nerve endings right there for a reason to register that something's off.

183
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And they will be working

184
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But my relationship to that pain can be filtered through this additional

185
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll look at that. What does this pain mean. There it is. I wonder how much longer. That would be there. There we go.

186
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're you're able to do it in the moment. But it's this. I think the preceding what 20 minutes or when do you start having fret, that it's going to happen.

187
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:41.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, well, usually like an hour before because I have to set up, I set it up myself.

188
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.420
Lyndsey Lorett: And then that's

189
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.810
Lyndsey Lorett: That's usually when I take the Xanax

190
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.630
Lyndsey Lorett: And I lay there.

191
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.970
Lyndsey Lorett: waiting for him to come in, usually gives me a minute to calm down.

192
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:05.970
Lyndsey Lorett: So I would say a good hour before it's like a routine you set up you lay in bed you freak out and then you get through it.

193
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:07.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

194
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess what I'm hoping is that the freakout part will be the necessary part that instead maybe somehow when you're getting the different layers that are necessary, the different pieces.

195
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That you do that mindfulness meditative prayer practice of bringing your protective team into your mind as you're touching it.

196
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And just being aware, maybe even taking it and putting it to your skin kind of feeling. This is what it's going to feel it's going to be here. It's going to feel it is what it feels like. And this is in my mind.

197
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being sort of present with that.

198
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Given that the additional piece that maybe isn't there.

199
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've told me that I don't know the freakout part

200
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just look at whether that's an important part or not.

201
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is part of the freaking out, being able to tell your father in law. I'm scared or is it necessary, because then he'll be more careful if he sees you freaking out, like what would happen if the freakout part wasn't there, what would happen.

202
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.670
Lyndsey Lorett: I try to not let him know I'm freaking out.

203
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, that's why I'm in the room alone for a little bit.

204
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.010
Okay.

205
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

206
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's really not going to impact how he treats you

207
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.280
Lyndsey Lorett: If no, he does it. He

208
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.250
Lyndsey Lorett: He yeah he's, he does what he needs to as best as he can. Okay.

209
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're directing him, as I recall. He was pretty careful if you needed to pause for a second. He's pretty responsive.

210
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.560
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yes.

211
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Mine is quite as good as the guy.

212
00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The physical therapist type and wound care is not quite as good. Um,

213
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And is is that because

214
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't taught your father in law what you like.

215
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Know he knows. He's seen it so much. He knows

216
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.270
Lyndsey Lorett: He knows it's just, um,

217
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:31.080
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know, going into the physical therapist office with my womb supplies and I would sit there. There was just a lot of distraction and a lot of

218
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:39.360
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean, I remember having anxiety driving there like, you know, but I didn't have that huge freakout moment.

219
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There was distraction.

220
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, meaning there's a bunch of people in the lobby to. There's a lot of machines there. What I wonder what got your attention.

221
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.480
Lyndsey Lorett: On everyone's just really nice and caring and

222
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I love older people and they're in there and they're fun to talk to

223
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.000
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know.

224
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wonder if it's that lay down

225
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That period right there. It's off that you're already in that room getting yourself psyched into to do in this. I wonder if that needs to change.

226
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.270
Lyndsey Lorett: So are you saying that I prepare myself to freak out.

227
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's the laying there, then I'm wondering if needs to change like that because we got to do what's already working and if distraction is is a

228
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a useful tool, then maybe what could you do instead of laying there thinking, okay, well in 10 minutes now in five minutes. He's going to come in and we're going to do this.

229
00:26:46.680 --> 00:27:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of doing a distraction and we're talking about funny YouTube video talking about a prayer, we're talking about some kind of, I don't know what, whether it's, you know, just upper body stretching. I don't know if it's coloring

230
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you be doing that can parallel and be similar to this one I like older folks, everyone's so nice. How do you get that. What's the emotion you feel when you're talking with those folks.

231
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.170
Lyndsey Lorett: I know it's just peaceful, it's just

232
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.590
Lyndsey Lorett: A very simple feeling

233
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, peaceful, simple, and you're talking the the people there at the facility are a little older, and they're they're nice

234
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.710
Yeah.

235
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. So now think about how you can recreate something like that really all we need is the feeling. We don't need the exact same people, but we need to be feeling we need peaceful and what was the other word

236
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.520
Simple

237
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Simple and by simple is that meaning there's no drama.

238
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it's just very easy.

239
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, yeah. Okay, so now I want you to think about people in your life.

240
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Where

241
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no mixed message.

242
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to overanalyze. You don't have to question your own intuition. You don't have to question your own judgment. It's just, oh, I'm just, this is easy.

243
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, who, who do you have where you have a feeling

244
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.770
Lyndsey Lorett: No one in the house currently

245
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

246
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Okay, keep going. Who else you got

247
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.100
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, I guess maybe while I'm laying there. I could video chat. One of my friends.

248
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:47.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, to do i do check ins with them during the week. So maybe if I have a scheduled check in with the same friend.

249
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:55.080
Lyndsey Lorett: During that time, just real quick and distract. That's a great idea, actually.

250
00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it. And if I mean seriously, your friend will know that that's when the check in, is they might even have a funny little anecdote or a funny little jokes itself people

251
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Are funny little picture and they're ready to go.

252
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like

253
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.140
Lyndsey Lorett: It. I like it too.

254
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Yeah.

255
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the build up that's going on while you're laying there. Ooh baby. I don't like that all

256
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Night, and I thought that I was breathing myself into calmness.

257
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sound like it.

258
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.010
Lyndsey Lorett: I would not

259
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.940
Know,

260
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

261
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's not the same thing to just be taking deep breaths. If the reason the breathing. Just like that alone isn't going to cut it is it's habituated meaning you already know how to do this.

262
00:29:51.870 --> 00:30:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: whatever it is you're doing deep breathing. It's not new anymore. So it's not taking enough attention for you. You're not doing it, probably with as much

263
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus. Yeah, and your, your mind is able to wander. It can just wanders over to fear. This is going to be awful. This is gonna be awful, why me. This isn't fair, like those kind of things.

264
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.210
Lyndsey Lorett: They hate it. I hate those words.

265
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, no.

266
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's the name of the friends that you could set up over the weekend.

267
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.170
Lyndsey Lorett: My friend, Michelle is usually my

268
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Michelle.

269
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Like her already.

270
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.750
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, she's a a caregiver. So she knows how to

271
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.190
Lyndsey Lorett: You know, and she's funny as heck, so

272
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so

273
00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Your task is to message her set up a time coordinate with your father in law that that is going on. You could also, I don't know whether this is true if she

274
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Can either have this recording and you're listening to it as you're getting the care done but you what you want to do is tap into things that you are already doing that are working just found one. It just took a little bit of looking

275
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, peaceful, simple, easy, Michelle.

276
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.390
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I

277
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it

278
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.030
Lyndsey Lorett: I like it too.

279
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Awesome.

280
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.890
Lyndsey Lorett: You're just checking things off my list.

281
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but notice. Notice the emotion that you have right now, just tap into that just go in and tell me how you're feeling

282
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:53.160
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like, Well, I'm so damn emotional today.

283
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:58.410
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just like this whole week and then today.

284
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:11.760
Lyndsey Lorett: But I feel like if I just take a moment and really look back at the situation. I'm not so in it that I can figure out things that are helpful, which is usually my nature.

285
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:20.010
Lyndsey Lorett: To change things that aren't working. Um, and so it's a good. It's like a happy feeling I'm like happy cry.

286
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.230
Lyndsey Lorett: I think that that really might work and help a lot.

287
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. Oh, I'm excited.

288
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what would be fantastic.

289
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:39.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, and then didn't take the Xanax and just be in a good place and have a good day. And it just be simple and in and out.

290
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do an experiment with it. You can kind of talk with Michelle about like we're going to give this a shot. Let's see how it goes. And if it goes great

291
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we can even do a recording and then I could laugh about that one. And then we do a real time one and we just kind of keep keep that creative juices going there.

292
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, well into changed my wound before

293
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

294
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:11.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, so she knows the steps and um, it's just a good thing, really, really good thing.

295
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.080
Excellent.

296
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the other things that happened just now was

297
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You change what you were thinking about here, and your emotion changed.

298
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have access to that choice when you want to, um, it may seem like that's over simplified.

299
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.300
But

300
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It does work.

301
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Sometimes I just don't know how to pull like it's so heavy.

302
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.370
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know how to

303
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.950
Lyndsey Lorett: It takes me a bit

304
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to Toronto, a little bit here from last time and just see

305
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: See where we had left off.

306
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:16.260
Lyndsey Lorett: And they were emptying the dumpster today by the camper. And so I knew it was going to be just too loud, to do the EMT are today.

307
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.710
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't know whether to text you and tell you that

308
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.150
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't like breaking things up when we're on a roll.

309
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that listen. Life is like that life gets talking to. Now I gotta adapt.

310
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I am not bothered at all.

311
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But what we can do is we can

312
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue. Why don't we continue with the anchor room.

313
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Sure, yeah.

314
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do that. Okay, so here's what the notes that I have so far are

315
00:34:52.110 --> 00:35:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically, with an anchor room. I'll say to someone, well, what's the, what's the block. Where are you kind of have some unfinished business. And you said, uh, my sexual abuse history. I never dealt with it. I refuse the feelings.

316
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I

317
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I have an incomplete sentence I have it might be. And then I didn't finish it. And then I have I have intentionally chosen to explore and then I didn't finish my sentence. So I only have a couple tiny little notes on it.

318
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, why don't we do a little bit more on this.

319
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This anchor room. And look, let me tell you, again, the destination with this anchor room is happy.

320
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.450
Yeah.

321
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the anchor room itself everything in it is the ideal. It's perfect. It has magic even it's going to be in a magic wand kind of tucked away in a secret little compartment on the wall or somewhere. Cool.

322
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So, this room is like awesome sauce. Okay.

323
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to get that ahead that it's not going anywhere in the room. No. Yeah.

324
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:58.650
Okay.

325
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There are three things.

326
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There are three questions that do get into memory. One of them is age. One of them is a nickname. And then the third one I can see what time it is. We won't have time to even get to that part.

327
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one of these little therapy questions, but the rest of it is all pulled from your imagination. It's not from memory.

328
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.270
Lyndsey Lorett: And other

329
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So even though you're going to be tempted to want to force. Well, that's what it was when I was this age that isn't what the goal is. It's

330
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To get the ideal to get what you want. Not, not what you had and force that into this room know it's what do I want or what did this younger self want didn't get well by golly, we're going to have it in this room.

331
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So day it'll be it'll be tricky. You'll be tempted to go, oh, this is the way it was. And then you'll want to drop it into this room, and that's your choice.

332
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But just know that that's not coming from me i i'm not saying go grab memory and let's have it exactly how this room was when you are whatever age.

333
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The only time I'm pulling from memory or these these three questions. I'll say, I'll say, how old are you, I will say, What was your nickname. And then the third one will be when the room is more developed

334
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a cookie questions. Sometimes after repeated like 10 times. It's a weird one.

335
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But a

336
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Brain and gets the brain going okay so let's keep building this thing.

337
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is how we start, I have an idea of what what the dilemma is where there's some blockage. Right. It's in those one of those lock boxes.

338
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Um, oh, and the doctors calling me to

339
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Thank you.

340
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she's gonna join us.

341
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell her what the symptom is so we'll probably not get to this anchor room will pick it up another day. All I said was, Hey doc, can you come in Lindsay's experiencing a medical issue that I

342
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I have concerned about. That's all I said so she doesn't know anything

343
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:59.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, I feel bad, taking her away like this, though.

344
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm she'll bill for the service. You don't need to feel bad.

345
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, okay. That makes it so much better. She'll bill for this service.

346
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so, um, that's I told him, I said,

347
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a billable thing he told me it is this is this kind of interesting thing, and hopefully that anyway. So you just stay focused on what you want to say to her with the time that we have. Make sure you're really clear.

348
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This is when it started. This is how much blood and why you've ruled out whether it's not the wounds. You don't think it's something else and maybe other things like you may be feeling a little bit more emotional to

349
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Not sure.

350
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You should be here, two seconds.

351
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.210
Lyndsey Lorett: Pandemic who is an emotional

352
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

353
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling it.

354
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So Dr.

355
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Weil, and we only have a few minutes, but could Lindsay. Could you share what what has changed.

356
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:18.390
Lyndsey Lorett: So I'm Tuesday during group. I was getting really nauseous immediately when group was over. I opened the car door and threw up. Um, but that morning, I was able to dissolve my sub sub you text. Well, before I threw up.

357
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.720
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't see Dr. Embryo

358
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

359
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking yes funny. I thought you were

360
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Here you have Dr. All a minister. Dr.

361
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.130
Dawn Abriel: No, no, she means she can't see me on the screen.

362
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, go.

363
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to the top and hit gallery or where it says speaker view just chap that, see if you can grab that. See what you can do there.

364
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

365
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Yep, there we go. I could see both of you. Hi.

366
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.690
Lyndsey Lorett: Hi, I'm

367
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:07.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Sorry, I don't know where I was at Wednesday when I was taking the subway text. I always start out with the sublime text before I take my depression medication and my ibuprofen for the day.

368
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:24.870
Lyndsey Lorett: I've just been getting really sick throwing up not being able to get my depression medication in me until after I have taken a suppository which works really well, really quickly. Um, but it's more sedating

369
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:31.080
Dawn Abriel: I may have taken a dating is yes, it's very sedating and

370
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.760
Dawn Abriel: You have to take it daily would just be wow so

371
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.390
Dawn Abriel: I don't have

372
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.860
Lyndsey Lorett: A hard time with it.

373
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.240
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

374
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.510
Lyndsey Lorett: But I

375
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:49.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Figure out why was throwing up and getting so sick. I thought it was stressed out like extremely stressed out. Um, but then yesterday, I started having

376
00:41:50.940 --> 00:42:01.770
Lyndsey Lorett: blood spots in my underwear I thought my wound was leaking we changed it. There wasn't any excess blood on the sponges or around the area.

377
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:13.230
Lyndsey Lorett: And then this morning when I got up the same achy feeling throwing up and then I went to the bathroom and there's just a lot of a lot of blood. So I would assume that

378
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.320
Dawn Abriel: From you from your rectum. There's blood

379
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.750
Lyndsey Lorett: No vaginally

380
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But she says she has her ovaries were taken by an infection.

381
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:33.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, they said, My ovaries don't work anymore because the infection was so bad with the Murcia,

382
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.510
Dawn Abriel: But you still pass your stool through your rectum. Right. You don't have a philosophy.

383
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.710
Lyndsey Lorett: No no no no no class to me. I put on pooping. There's no blood coming out of the breach.

384
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:58.980
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, but to have that gentle blood when you don't have ovaries is pretty. Yeah, yeah. This is more than I can evaluate over telemedicine Lindsey.

385
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.450
Dawn Abriel: To have a little bit of blood and then more blood

386
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.370
Dawn Abriel: My worry is that you have a fistula somewhere.

387
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.030
Dawn Abriel: I it really needs to be evaluated. But here's what I can say about the nausea.

388
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:15.990
Okay.

389
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.150
Dawn Abriel: I'm wondering if

390
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:33.810
Dawn Abriel: You switched up the time you took your medicine and you did the suppository at night then took your buprenorphine.

391
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:35.850
Dawn Abriel: If

392
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:49.500
Lyndsey Lorett: It normally take the suppository at night and it covers me through the night of nausea and in the morning. I don't wake up sick like this and for some reason. It's just intense this week.

393
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:50.640
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

394
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I ask something

395
00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is it possible the suppository is I'm just going to just say it and then you guys can work it out. It's just stronger, more potent. Then she wakes up in withdrawal. Is that possible.

396
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:07.950
Dawn Abriel: That it's

397
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.910
Dawn Abriel: More boat.

398
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then she's feeling the withdrawal I you know I don't really know what I'm trying to say. It's just, since this onset seems like didn't coincide almost right exactly when you started with this depository.

399
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:28.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Know, I've been on the suppository for I a good week before you start getting

400
00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: nauseous and I'm not on to anything. What if it's the bleeding and nausea onset, same, same time

401
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tuesday.

402
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:38.940
Ya.

403
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:46.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Know, cuz the bleeding didn't start, start until yesterday, but the nausea started on Tuesday.

404
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But there was a little bit of bleeding on on Thursday.

405
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yesterday.

406
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, very similar to a period

407
00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.500
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, very, very similar.

408
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have told which physician about this spotting and now additional bleeding.

409
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.340
Lyndsey Lorett: My wound doctor

410
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:14.370
Lyndsey Lorett: We call him, Dr. Bill, because I don't know how to say his name. I'm in Farmington at the wound clinic and he said

411
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.500
Lyndsey Lorett: That I that I'm probably need to be evaluated.

412
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you told him about that.

413
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:31.260
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I did. Yes. And he said that it could be many things not getting I'm not getting the proper medicine in me at

414
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.740
Lyndsey Lorett: On a very scheduled basis like I've happened for so long. I'm

415
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.090
Lyndsey Lorett: And he said something else. I'm sorry. Don't

416
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Which which medication. Are you referring to. That's all.

417
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:56.040
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm not getting I can't keep in my sub you text my ibuprofen my depression meds. I'm having to retake them all. After I've taken

418
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:02.520
Lyndsey Lorett: The suppository um it's just I don't, I don't know.

419
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:24.990
Dawn Abriel: I, I really cannot tell you I would really have to do an ultrasound and I'm evaluate you do a vaginal exam, they're just they're just too much that needs to be explored here before we can put our finger on it.

420
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:31.920
Dawn Abriel: Then I don't know if the nausea and the vaginal bleeding or or any way related

421
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.540
Dawn Abriel: So,

422
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:42.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't, because I haven't had a period in so long. I can't tell you what I experienced when I was on my

423
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.760
Dawn Abriel: Right. But let me get this straight. You had both ovaries taken out.

424
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:55.260
Lyndsey Lorett: No, not taking out one of them, they said was not working properly because of the infection.

425
00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.360
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so it is possible that it was a period

426
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.930
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Ah, OK. Oh.

427
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, no one has

428
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:12.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Confirmed that my ovaries don't work. They just said that the infection was really bad and that you may not have a period

429
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:13.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

430
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:27.660
Dawn Abriel: Well, I guess they've healed or one of them at least it's healed because you know if it's, you know, you're, you're not having fever or chills or huge

431
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.080
Dawn Abriel: Gushing of blood. It's a normal amount

432
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.400
Dawn Abriel: Of period blood. Yeah.

433
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.660
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I think you can breathe easily around that one.

434
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:48.480
Dawn Abriel: I thought you'd had both of them out and then it's really a mystery why you'd have that, you know, the blood but have to be coming from other than the uterus, but

435
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:53.040
Dawn Abriel: You know you're if you just normalized and

436
00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:58.830
Dawn Abriel: What, especially if one of them is working fine. And you might have a period every other month

437
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And elevated emotional to. I mean, it's hard to pull apart the pandemic and there's, it's hard to pull that apart. But there's also been a little elevated a vile mood to

438
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:14.310
Dawn Abriel: Just before this happened.

439
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.180
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah that's

440
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.990
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

441
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but here's the dilemma.

442
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.390
Strong

443
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To go not to go to go not to go and and I wanted you to weigh in on this doc, because this can't be an easy decision.

444
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.490
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so if

445
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You initially said go now you're starting to roll in that this is a menstrual cycle. At what point does she go. And what about the vomiting. What do we do

446
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

447
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:55.920
Dawn Abriel: I think that the menstrual stuff. We can just let go of because that's just normal female stuff what what needs to be addressed is the nausea and

448
00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:04.050
Dawn Abriel: I would like to revisit the idea of you're taking your Suboxone at night.

449
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, you mean instead of in the morning.

450
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:09.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Like I

451
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:19.350
Lyndsey Lorett: We, we just we started recently when I started seeing, you know, instead of doing it in the morning. You want me to do it at night after the suppository

452
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.180
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. After the suppository and then because if if that

453
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:33.360
Dawn Abriel: relieves the nausea all through the night. And then in the morning. You can take your other medicine uncomplicated by

454
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:47.910
Dawn Abriel: What the, it's, it's, I'll tell you, Lindsay, I haven't had anyone have problems with the buprenorphine all by itself, causing nausea. But everyone's different. And you certainly have a very different system.

455
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.130
Dawn Abriel: So,

456
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:56.610
Dawn Abriel: It. I think it would be worth a try. Because if that worked where that would just

457
00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:02.310
Lyndsey Lorett: It would solve a lot. Could I also take my depression medication. Then, as well.

458
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.240
Dawn Abriel: There's no reason why you couldn't

459
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.100
Dawn Abriel: Um,

460
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.900
Lyndsey Lorett: So then throughout the day. The only thing I'm taking is the ibuprofen and Tylenol.

461
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:17.400
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

462
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.960
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's an idea, you know,

463
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.750
Dawn Abriel: And you're taking really high doses of the ibuprofen, aren't you

464
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.060
Lyndsey Lorett: I am I am taking

465
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Everything.

466
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.230
Dawn Abriel: That's, that's pretty scary.

467
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:35.310
I know

468
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:51.690
Dawn Abriel: Yeah so. Okay, let's do it this way, do them one at a time. And let's see what combination of what is eliciting the problem. So,

469
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:52.530
Dawn Abriel: At night.

470
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:59.460
Dawn Abriel: Take the subway. Take the support nausea suppository and take the buprenorphine and do that for a few days.

471
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:15.690
Dawn Abriel: And then your other medicines in the morning and see if if everything's groovy. Then, and then the next week. Take the buprenorphine and the antidepressant at the same time at night and see if that holds you

472
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.010
Okay.

473
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.590
Dawn Abriel: But if you take things together. We don't have a way of

474
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.140
Dawn Abriel: Separating the effects.

475
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:26.130
Okay.

476
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.860
Lyndsey Lorett: That's usually just my routine, though, is get it all in, and then go about your day.

477
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.410
Dawn Abriel: Well, that would be ideal.

478
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:35.880
Dawn Abriel: And

479
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.930
Dawn Abriel: I would I would

480
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:46.950
Dawn Abriel: I, I wish that were possible, but buprenorphine is so hard and the Ibuprofen is so hard on your gut.

481
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.450
Lyndsey Lorett: I never, I don't

482
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:55.890
Dawn Abriel: Know like my guess is that it with anything else is is what's wreaking havoc.

483
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I've been on it over a year, every day.

484
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.030
Lyndsey Lorett: But I can't help it.

485
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:08.640
Dawn Abriel: No, I'm not saying that you can I just, it's just so so unfortunate.

486
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.390
Lyndsey Lorett: If there was something else, some magical, you know,

487
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:18.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Thing that's not as harsh as ibuprofen, I would be all for it. Yeah.

488
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:29.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. Okay. So you're saying to for for the first week do suppository and buprenorphine at night.

489
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:37.650
Lyndsey Lorett: And then next week. If I'm okay. To start the depression medication with the buprenorphine.

490
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:40.140
Dawn Abriel: At night and see

491
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.840
Dawn Abriel: Because it's so if you have the nausea.

492
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.990
Dawn Abriel: With the depression and your anti inflammatories during the day.

493
00:52:53.970 --> 00:53:01.200
Dawn Abriel: Then it makes more sense that it's the ibuprofen with the other things that's listening this

494
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.680
Lyndsey Lorett: So I need to definitely space it out then.

495
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Not be taking it all at once.

496
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:19.860
Dawn Abriel: Do you also have something on your stomach a test some toast. Some

497
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:29.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, yes, yes I am. I do a protein shake before, if I were to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach. I would be sitting all day.

498
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.750
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

499
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:31.590
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, all day.

500
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:42.510
Dawn Abriel: And that the nausea starts before you have anything you wake up with the nausea.

501
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:59.430
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, went yet Wednesday and Thursday. I was waking up with it Tuesday was spaced out a little bit before I actually threw up and it hurts so bad to throw up so

502
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Really hard not to

503
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:02.940
Yeah.

504
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:26.700
Dawn Abriel: What I just, I feel this is where telemedicine is just not ideal, and there's nothing else that's changed. You don't have a new rash, you don't have more belly pain, you don't have difficulty pain or no, nothing else.

505
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.420
No.

506
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Would that make it easier to solve.

507
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:34.950
Dawn Abriel: Well,

508
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:45.360
Dawn Abriel: I just I, you know, sometimes it's a with the combination of symptoms, it points to something specific, but with

509
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:56.490
Dawn Abriel: Nausea by itself is so difficult to pinpoint because the things that cause nausea, the list is huge.

510
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:09.660
Dawn Abriel: That's why your other doctor said, and, you know, it could be lots of things we all end up doing that shrugging their shoulders and saying, you know, I would want to see what your, your blood clot.

511
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:18.270
Dawn Abriel: Your, your liver function and your CBC and make sure you don't have a smoldering infection somewhere.

512
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.570
Dawn Abriel: But without these other symptoms. I doubt it.

513
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.340
Dawn Abriel: Are you someone who, when you get an infection, you get a fever.

514
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.970
Lyndsey Lorett: I do and I have increased pain.

515
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:39.960
Lyndsey Lorett: I just, I've had been so infected so much over the last year. I just know I don't know how to explain

516
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:46.170
Dawn Abriel: No, I, I hear you. I, I believe you people know I'm

517
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.360
Dawn Abriel: So this is all I have to offer at this time.

518
00:55:51.870 --> 00:56:01.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And I would say if something changes if this is the early part of something more significant and anything gets added on here.

519
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.480
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so get it checked out.

520
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:12.060
Dawn Abriel: Call you call you call the emergency department in Farmington and you say, I mean, they probably know you right

521
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:21.150
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Say, You know, I'm on my way in. What's the protocol. Now, do I need to bring my own mask. Do you supply them.

522
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:28.500
Dawn Abriel: And no, you tell them highly doubtful that this is coven 19 I'm

523
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:29.040
Lyndsey Lorett: You know,

524
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.420
Dawn Abriel: This is my other problem.

525
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:44.250
Lyndsey Lorett: So my next question then is, I'm going to be out of medicine early and I'm going to be out of my depression medication at the end of the month early and I don't know what to do.

526
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:47.040
Dawn Abriel: Well,

527
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.340
Dawn Abriel: So that would be

528
00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:05.880
Lyndsey Lorett: So I'm I'm supposed to have enough through Sunday, taking it in the morning. I'm right. Right. I won't have any for tomorrow or Sunday.

529
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:13.500
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah, I can easily right they might not pay for it. The insurance might not pay for it. You might have to pay out of pocket.

530
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:14.490
Okay.

531
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:21.990
Dawn Abriel: And for some reason, I don't have the, the name of your depression medicine.

532
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:24.750
Lyndsey Lorett: I take Prozac and Wellbutrin

533
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.080
Dawn Abriel: Oh, wow. How did I miss them.

534
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:28.860
Dawn Abriel: Ever wonder

535
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:35.760
Lyndsey Lorett: You've never prescribed it. I've had so many refills. I'm just going through the bills, is that bad.

536
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.040
Dawn Abriel: No, no.

537
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.840
Dawn Abriel: It's just it. I almost always

538
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:48.690
Dawn Abriel: ask people what medicines. They're on and I have it listed in their chart. So it's the 20 milligram capsule or the 10 milligram tablet. What do you take of the Prozac.

539
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:56.910
Lyndsey Lorett: I take a 20 milligram capsule and I'm 300 milligrams of well future and it's a tablet.

540
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:05.370
Lyndsey Lorett: I've got the capsules for that Prozac.

541
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.890
Lyndsey Lorett: And then the well future and that they're bigger tablets.

542
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.600
Dawn Abriel: The Wellbutrin is the ASR or the XML.

543
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:21.570
Lyndsey Lorett: XML 300 milligrams

544
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:27.660
Dawn Abriel: Gotcha. Okay, so I can, I can go ahead and order that

545
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:33.300
Dawn Abriel: You are you take one by mouth every day.

546
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:40.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Are they going to charge me for the Wellbutrin and the Prozac to for being out two days early

547
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.410
