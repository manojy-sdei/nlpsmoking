104
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.630

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Friday, June 5 I am in a training.

112
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some constraints there.

113
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, I really think you would benefit from. Let's put this one in can hear me okay

Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be able to see you for individual therapy on that day. Let's get you into this group, you've been in IT BEFORE THE 11am group. So what you want to do is set the alarm for like either 1030 or 1045 and what that means is you're going into virtual clinic at that time.

119
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I would set it for 1040

120
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And put a check in to group as your title of your alarm.

435
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:36.240
Laura Lujan: We know and it wasn't worth it to me like Chris, how about making them out of respect because again it

436
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But Kyle could have remembered when you forgot Kyle could have remembered he could have remembered. Oh, if someone comes knocking on the door in the middle of the night. Yeah, that's not appropriate. He could have remembered when you forgot. And he didn't remember either right

437
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.850
Laura Lujan: Where he is right.

438
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a team. You guys are working as a team.

439
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:59.130
Laura Lujan: I'm sure

440
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There's things you do for him to you help him remember things and he helps you remember things

441
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

442
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Alarms in his phone alarms in your phone sticky notes on the fridge and talking about what boundaries are what boundaries look like in on a probation status and in recovery.

443
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:35.910
Laura Lujan: Or whatever you show me that chart. And I don't think it's funny because I took a picture right and I look on his phone and I don't know what to buy and he's all this and I'm like, oh, it's the thing

444
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:52.350
Laura Lujan: Picture with one he's all. Hey, hey, and he read the whole thing right and you know you know you and I'm like, I know, I know, I know. And, you know, like actually pop rock. I'm like, I know in this conversation with me about

445
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The boundaries and stuff. Let me

446
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, I know finish your sentences with the

447
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I knows finished those thoughts.

448
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.000
Yeah.

449
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you mean by I know

450
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.950
Laura Lujan: Like okay so

451
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:13.680
Laura Lujan: He thing. You know that, like we do all the things that I know. I know we do like folder, like, you know, I'm here to support

452
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.190
Laura Lujan: Because, like, we already know that we do. And if I didn't know

453
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.410
Laura Lujan: I knew that I didn't know

454
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:26.310
Laura Lujan: I didn't know. And so that's why I understand, generally, honestly I didn't realize I was on your phone. Yeah.

455
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:45.090
Laura Lujan: You know, literally everything in the old like chart I was doing wrong all about, you know, I can get with them as approach or anything as a good way to start like. Finally, I guess what the figure out what's the orange.

456
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why I asked you how Kyle is around boundaries and about his what's called ego strength.

457
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know, because I didn't know if you to if he thinks therapy is a waste of time. That's okay. A lot of people do, but

458
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If he was ever interested in sitting with you like this, if there's ever anything you want to talk to him about with me here.

459
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome to do a couple's intervention with me. I can be there with you if something comes up. Did you know

460
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.650
Cool.

461
00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.290
Laura Lujan: Thank you. Yeah, so

462
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So this might be something to think about with him. You may say, yeah, you don't have to. She's not going to be our therapist will always be mine.

463
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: she'll always be my therapist, but part of my stress is our relationship and she wants me to feel centered and. Okay. And when we are in this agreement and disharmony I get really upset and so she wants me to kind of be chill if. Hey, Carl, would you ever be interested in

464
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.910
Laura Lujan: She wants to know the way to voice it no

465
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she wants to teach us of really basic a communication skills. She's not going to do therapy. She just wants to teach us both the same communication skills so that we can have healthier, more productive arguments.

466
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.780
Laura Lujan: That until they get, like, you know,

467
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.250
Laura Lujan: Like

468
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:27.750
Laura Lujan: Like, I don't think it's not like you're throwing out whenever I stop. Are you. Oh, no.

469
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say that again. I didn't

470
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.030
Laura Lujan: I always say don't worry my never argue with you but worry about whatever stop arguing with you.

471
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.430
Laura Lujan: Then you have fallen, like, you know, because you know you're not worth fighting more

472
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.150
Laura Lujan: You know anyway.

473
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, I get it.

474
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's how

475
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.230
You

476
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How you argue the way this works is, once you guys both have these I feel skills and mirroring and then the validation skill.

477
00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What takes days.

478
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Take can take like 10 minutes or 15 minutes for a disagreement.

479
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Over with really fast and you can get back to being friends again.

480
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

481
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's efficient.

482
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:19.860
Laura Lujan: Oh my god.

483
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:28.830
Laura Lujan: Oh my god, look at this point in time that the problem that we're having right now is like Kyle bad guys are fighting and I don't like that. Like that. And that's why, you know,

484
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you're in. So Laura, Laura. That is, you're in. Hey, Kyle, my therapist has an idea for us to be able to work on our arguing, so it doesn't escalate because I don't want your dad to kick me out.

485
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.290
Laura Lujan: Or

486
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.600
Laura Lujan: You think I heard

487
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.830
Laura Lujan: You think of

488
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to sell the idea to him.

489
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.210
Laura Lujan: Okay.

490
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't

491
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys don't have to talk about anything important to you, you could talk about a toothpaste on a to cap it doesn't matter of what we talked about

492
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:10.770
Laura Lujan: The argument.

493
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.320
Laura Lujan: That all the parts right

494
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So right the content doesn't matter. I can teach the skills and we can be talking about red is a better color than blue

495
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, duh.

496
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.980

Gwenevere Abriel: I love blue
