Gwenevere Abriel: Peace, peace, peace, peace pasty

2
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.220
Alicia Noedel: You're cutting out a little bit.

3
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.770
Alicia Noedel: It's my phone. Let me clear some tabs or something.

4
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you do that and I'm going to keep updating a note here see

5
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. No, we don't need to

6
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.210
Alicia Noedel: Optimize my data, real quick. I usually do it before I check in, but I forgot.

7
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.460
Alicia Noedel: Nope. We're good.

8
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.050
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

9
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.540
Alicia Noedel: Are you today.

10
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.230
Alicia Noedel: Not bad. That's good.

11
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel special and it and really acknowledged on on Sunday on Mother's Day.

12
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, good.

13
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Good, good. I woke up to breakfast in bed at about 10 o'clock.

14
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.780
Alicia Noedel: Okay to sleep in.

15
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.550
Alicia Noedel: Weeks.

16
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And Joaquin really really understands the importance of motherhood and how important this is to you.

17
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.560
Alicia Noedel: Oh yeah, I was really, really, really sweet.

18
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm remembering

19
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Something you had mentioned in group. I don't know if that's still sort of present with you.

20
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if anything else is is kind of coming up.

21
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything you wanted to share to sort of continue that conversation from group.

22
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.620
Alicia Noedel: Which which one

23
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.920
Alicia Noedel: What, what were we speaking about

24
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

25
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing pressing. In other words, it's not still on your mind right now. It sounds like since it's not remembered, it's probably not pressing

26
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.580
Alicia Noedel: Right now I'm you know I just woke up, I can't really think about

27
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.860
Alicia Noedel: Group last week.

28
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'll go take a look. I just signed that think this morning. So it's kind of fresh

29
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you mentioned

30
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that the topic had been on sort of radical acceptance.

31
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.790
Alicia Noedel: And inviting. Oh.

32
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients to look at where the most resistance, where the know sort of popped up first and turning it into sort of this internal yes this is happening, not necessarily that you're going to

33
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: subject yourself to pain, suffering of it, but rather, this is happening, sort of acknowledging this happening, and something you mentioned was

34
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I realized how much distress. I have caused myself over the years. I could change the outcome in certain situations, but I am quick to jump into something and be defensive

35
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.020
Alicia Noedel: Yes.

36
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that means

37
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:53.640
Alicia Noedel: I was speaking from my times with my ex boyfriend who is really abusive and how I could have

38
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.090
Alicia Noedel: Sometimes, think about. Like if I made that Situation Escalate or if I would have done things differently if the outcome would have been the same, or

39
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.020
Alicia Noedel: I think about, like, why did I leave sooner.

40
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:23.700
Alicia Noedel: And you know I caused myself, you know, years of distress longer than I needed to. If I would have just took the red flags and, you know, ran with them and left.

41
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:39.810
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, things like that. Like I i I'm one of those people that like when I am in an argument or I'm mad I react with pure emotion and little thought

42
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200
Alicia Noedel: And that has gotten me into a lot of

43
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Which emotion is that

44
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.570
Alicia Noedel: I mean, it depends on the situation, like

45
00:04:49.590 --> 00:05:02.580
Alicia Noedel: Anger. I'm just complete turmoil, you know, being very emotional very sad. I'm making things affect me more than it needs to

46
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:13.860
Alicia Noedel: So like taking something that I could have you know really seen the situation and just being completely destroyed about it.

47
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.540
Alicia Noedel: Or

48
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.990
Alicia Noedel: The reactions I give I sometimes don't think about my

49
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.920
Alicia Noedel: actions and reactions, I guess.

50
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: After

51
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me just say this notion of radical acceptance is is not a small feat, and

52
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's one of those difficult skills.

53
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.500
Alicia Noedel: It's like rewiring your brain.

54
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is. It's, it's a tough one. It's worth it. But it's hard. It's hard. A to remember. So let's just check in on remembering

55
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how wasn't readily available this morning, not because of the deficit with you, but that just some checking in to say, did it linger. The next day after group wasn't there. Did you try it on. Did you give it a fair shake or was it pretty quickly sort of forgotten.

56
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.630
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I wish I would have

57
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:39.870
Alicia Noedel: I haven't had any situations where it's, you know, really important that I, you know, take a step back and decide what I'm going to do, because that might change the outcome of the situation because think nothing like that has really happened to me lately. Since group, but

58
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:53.220
Alicia Noedel: I thought about it. All that day. I did. I'm about my life and I actually started wondering whether or not the way that I

59
00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:02.220
Alicia Noedel: Interact with people and the way I react to situations, whether they be, you know, really like scary situations or, you know, like arguing

60
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:14.160
Alicia Noedel: I feel like maybe, you know, watching that with my parents for years, the way they react to situations and how unhealthy. It was that, you know, you learn what you see

61
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's investigate. Just a little further whether let's just think about how many things you had to solve. Now maybe you're used to doing them. They don't take much effort because

62
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You've solved this similar problem before babies crying. Well, I know I get up and I rule out wet diaper. Is there a burp. Is there any rule certain things out, you just start problem solving.

63
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But remember radical acceptance is not for

64
00:07:50.520 --> 00:08:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: No planetary misalignment it's not this massive thing. It's not always someone's threatening physical harm someone's threatening your psychological well being. They're also in these small little inconveniences and insults.

65
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: They're small, they can happen really little, too. So now that that's reminded go back a little bit over the week and see if you did indeed practice radical acceptance, where you said, oh, this is what is happening. I don't like it but there it is.

66
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.800
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I guess I did.

67
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.370
Okay.

68
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Where was it

69
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:44.910
Alicia Noedel: Um, yeah, day before yesterday, um, my mom's husband's sister and her husband came over to fix our door doors been broken for a while.

70
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.770
Alicia Noedel: With, like a two foot hole in it from my dog chewing through the door.

71
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:59.760
Alicia Noedel: And so they were replacing the door and my mom was just going to get someone professional to do it. But this guy insisted he knew what he was doing.

72
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:12.210
Alicia Noedel: And they were here from, like, eight o'clock in the morning to, like, eight o'clock and I and through the whole thing my dog was outside and she broke my new garden, the border.

73
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:24.060
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, she completely tore apart all the boards and everything. And I was going outside because we went to go visit his dad for like the first time in months working on that.

74
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:34.830
Alicia Noedel: And it was saying bye to my mom and she was just very like upset and I know she wasn't upset at me, but she was like very short.

75
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:44.190
Alicia Noedel: And right away. I started saying, Oh my God, it's my fault, you know, what do I have to do to fix this and start you know freaking out because that's just

76
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:55.590
Alicia Noedel: How I've thought about things for a long time. And instead of starting to argue with her and being like, Well, what did I do wrong. I was like, all right. Oh, I love you mom, I hope you feel better. I'll see you later.

77
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

78
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.930
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I didn't. And usually that situation, I would be like, What's wrong with you. Why are you mad at me. What did I do

79
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay that's big.

80
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you remember that so that what that took was consciousness that literally took you

81
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say

82
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called meta cognition, where we're thinking about our thinking.

83
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You took a second at fractions of a second, and maybe you even caught that first one it's my fault, you default to something I did wrong, but it sounds like you caught it quick enough and what you didn't do. Was roll with that.

84
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.100
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

85
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't use anger, which is a defensive posture. He didn't cry and get small you didn't puff up overly big or play smaller than who you are, you just

86
00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepted things the way they are you decided now this is all my language. I don't know what was going on your head, I'll learn more. But for some people but I invite them to do is not to interpret people's behavior.

87
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, person to be snappy snorts right or snarky knows, typically what we do is we interpret it, and we go oh, this is my fault. I've got to fix it. I can't possibly have this this mother upset.

88
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: might lead to an insider threat threat threat threat threat, but if you don't interpret it.

89
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you let her handler own emotion and you get to say, Bobby, Mom. See you tomorrow. Hey, thanks for you guys coming over and putting all this effort.

90
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:42.840
Alicia Noedel: I mean, it's something that I would like to, you know, really, really like genuinely practice on

91
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:53.430
Alicia Noedel: Because it's one of the things that causes me when I can think about right now problems that I have with the way that I think

92
00:11:54.270 --> 00:12:00.840
Alicia Noedel: That's one of them is thinking that everyone's upset with me when a reading when no one when someone's not in link.

93
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:13.740
Alicia Noedel: You know the best mood or or overly happy. I think that it's my fault. And they're upset with me and what can I do to fix it or I'm going to argue with them because I know I didn't do anything.

94
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:23.700
Alicia Noedel: And why are they acting like this, you know, and I don't want to think like that anymore because it really does cause me a lot of turmoil it bugs me. It hurts my feelings.

95
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so prop me up somewhere. The lady. So you're not having to hold me up. Take your time, no rush.

96
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:46.110
Alicia Noedel: Or wait, let's see if I can get it right here. Do you have to see like last time my shoulders are just like that.

97
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's good. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Okay, well, that's great. Okay, so there's

98
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm hearing you say is we touched on something that probably presents itself quite a bit.

99
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.300
Yeah.

100
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpreting

101
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Aspect, other than happy.

102
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Whenever we see someone's aspect that's is and face and subtle facial muscles right or body posture, whatever.

103
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We perceived threat. So when you see it, you tend to sounds like you default to vote.

104
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You quickly scan. Is there anything I've recently done as in last 10 seconds or whatever to upset this person you run it through. If you can't think of a really clear certainty.

105
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you question yourself when you do think I'm clear certainty. You're pissed and you're going to defend your position.

106
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.460
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

107
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you don't want to feel guilty. And so then you argue why should I have to and but so you use anger to stay sort of engaged and defend defend itself and you don't like it.

108
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's time consuming. It takes up a lot of time and can suck a whole day and just get your mind, that's all you think about right. What I do, which you do this, Socks has always been like that's always going to be like that it can really

109
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of bring the whole day down the drain. Hmm.

110
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.920
Alicia Noedel: Definitely, even after it's over. Like, it's still

111
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.540
Alicia Noedel: stays with me.

112
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.380
Alicia Noedel: And it bugs me because I'm like, trying to figure out whether or not

113
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:41.100
Alicia Noedel: I'm overreacting, or they're really being, you know, kind of snippy with me right not everyone's going to be in the best mood, all the time, understand that. But I like I feel like I want everyone to be happy and I cannot control other people's emotions.

114
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.540
Alicia Noedel: I know, yeah.

115
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's right there. Then you already know. So, intellectually, you can say that, you know,

116
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't control other people and I want them to always be happy around me.

117
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.450
Alicia Noedel: That's unfair, honestly.

118
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.590
Alicia Noedel: About it.

119
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.920
Alicia Noedel: That's really unfair of me and very selfish of me.

120
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:15.300
Alicia Noedel: To was you know I you know I get upset if someone's not being sympathetic to, you know, me not feeling happy or whatever, you know that's not

121
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Let's just stay right there. So notice that you picked up on that. So it's almost like I think you picked up on like it's almost a demand like you have to be happy around me. In order for me to feel good and you just caught you live without.

122
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.750
Alicia Noedel: Cell never thought about it like that.

123
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's weird. But you did that work. I didn't analyze it, you came up with that. And it's almost like I've been demanding these people outside of me to present in this way that I feel better.

124
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Like right so I need them to reflect back happiness around me so that I feel good about myself and I'm okay. I'm not meaning to stress.

125
00:15:49.560 --> 00:16:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And and almost you get mad at if it's not there. Like, why are you not happy. Show show happy. I didn't do anything wrong. What's the deal. What's the problem and then you flipped around and you had empathy for hey sometimes

126
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just, I'm just in a funk ain't got nothing to do with nobody. I'm just funky.

127
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.860
Alicia Noedel: Mm hmm.

128
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just, you know, I might say, I'm just bad company as a you know on hang out with me. I'm on the back.

129
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

130
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we don't want our loved ones to think it's their fault.

131
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.160
Alicia Noedel: Right.

132
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you caught that you flip the story and you were able to feel what that would be like to be around your demand on them that they'd be happy for you felt it for a second. You did that on your own.

133
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:47.730
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I never thought about it that way ever. And that kind of makes me you know reevaluate that all of everything, all of the situations.

134
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we're right in there right in this word this choice of words. The, the notion of oscillation, we might say oscillation is this, it's just

135
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving back and forth is an exciting one because it's in motion, and it is interpersonal and that's kind of the way we're word so digging that the only

136
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing I kind of get concerned about is this the landing pad of selfish. It doesn't if that's really true. Is it really true that you are selfish or could we label that something else instead of selfish that awareness, you just had could be label it.

137
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, you don't do things for nothing you do things to adapt, you have developed what you do over many years.

138
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So wonder if we could change that wording, a little bit.

139
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.840
Alicia Noedel: I think that, you know, one of the things that I think about is

140
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.550
Alicia Noedel: Like, is this going to start something bigger than it needs to be. Is there going to be

141
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:07.050
Alicia Noedel: Is this person having this attitude or being upset the way they are going to start a violent situation around my child.

142
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.130
Alicia Noedel: With

143
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:18.420
Alicia Noedel: You know, my mom and her husband, or you know me and walking, even though I know that these people, you know, do not have an abusive relationship with each other.

144
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:38.280
Alicia Noedel: It's so, so much from thinking back to my parents, you know, having the smallest argument and it blowing up into the biggest things of, you know, fighting fist fighting in the kitchen, throwing things at each other, tripping each other, you know, crazy stuff.

145
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.640
Alicia Noedel: My mom dislocated or hip because my dad tripped her

146
00:18:42.750 --> 00:19:01.170
Alicia Noedel: And she fell on our heart tile floor, and then he threw a TV at her because she didn't want anything from McDonalds. You know, it's just a little example of how you know I feel like I'm, you know, it scares me. Pretty much. So I'm trying to like

147
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you being selfish. Is it

148
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:16.920
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I still think that it's kind of, you know, selfish for me to, you know, try and cut people's emotions.

149
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.690
Alicia Noedel: Short

150
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But Elisa listen to your own

151
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.840
Alicia Noedel: Fear is real.

152
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, write

153
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own stories. You just, you just told stories that little girl. Is there any possible way. We could label her and selfish. The fact that you have developed

154
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A protective mechanism of predicting into the future, trying to keep yourself, your psyche psyche. And now, of course, your little one safe house. That's a fish. Right. How can we even

155
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

156
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.510
Alicia Noedel: It's not the feelings that I have aren't. But the way that I

157
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.990
Alicia Noedel: That I execute it is

158
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to keep working at that word because I still disagree.

159
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It does more damage that's why this word selfish. It cuts you off. That's really the cut off as if you no longer have a right to the last collation you see what it does is to static

160
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes I feel my own feelings. Sometimes I oscillate to come out and I feel other people's feelings and then I come back and I go out that allows me to stay connected with people.

161
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to only be you worrying about someone else or only worrying about you, it will stay in motion back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. So let's just for now. If you absolutely are so in love with selfish. You can have it back the end of the day.

162
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play with other words. So this little girl who had to adapt to that kind of violence.

163
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And develop a brain right which the precursors to that violence were this face this tone this body movement. You understand me do that again. That little girl that you were and still have a little bit left in your right, it's still kind of that lived trauma.

164
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You learn the precursors to violence.

165
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A way of looking way of not looking

166
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A certain speed at which motion happens between a hand and arm a leg a response, a type of phrase a pitch and tone of volume of voice, you know, the precursors of that virus and you know it unconsciously.

167
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Very well. Yes, you do. Now what do we call that that you know that. Is that selfish.

168
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.720
Alicia Noedel: Know,

169
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that

170
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.590
Alicia Noedel: Explain.

171
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want your daughter to know how to

172
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.880
Know,

173
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.600
Alicia Noedel: I would never want her to go through any kind of trauma. It's trauma. That's what it is. Honestly,

174
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the event. And so what you're doing is you're you're trying to

175
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.580
Alicia Noedel: Create a coping mechanism.

176
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It is definitely a coping mechanism and you're trying to create you're trying to get ahead and mitigate danger prevent dangerous trying to create safety. It's a coping mechanism so that you can be safe.

177
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And your baby can be saved. On what planet. Is that selfish.

178
00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I really fought hard there for that because that will write that, that that's kind of a toxic word, especially in psychotherapy. It's like, well,

179
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What

180
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Know period adaptive smart brain smart girl intelligent woman and so

181
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Self preserving coping skill adaptive creating safety.

182
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So now that we have a new a new word. What's the word. We're going to use instead of selfish. What do you want to use because we're going to go back to this interaction with mom here in a second. So what do we call that instead of selfish.

183
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Coping that which we're going to do.

184
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. So now we go back and we say, ah, at least. Yeah.

185
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You were coping.

186
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: With

187
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Terrain that looked very similar to an old map Netflix a danger.

188
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:09.930
Alicia Noedel: It wasn't just you know her, and my dad either me and her had a few instances as

189
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:22.530
Alicia Noedel: Probably like preteen teenager years that were very scary and so she's one of the people that I do it the most with

190
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:29.760
Alicia Noedel: And she you know like I told you she has bipolar manic depressive she's up and down some days.

191
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:36.780
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, if I can figure out how to, you know, deal with it.

192
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.920
Alicia Noedel: It would make things a lot easier on me.

193
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:56.190
Alicia Noedel: A deal with so many things throughout the day. No, I'm running on like like to, like, three, four hours of sleep, you know, my, my daughter's in there crying and teasing right now I you know I deal with a lot of stuff through day

194
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.310
Alicia Noedel: You know, if I could not deal with that it wouldn't be thing so much easier for me.

195
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's stay right there. Notice, you're calling it we're calling it coping.

196
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you don't want to deal

197
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But

198
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you still want to stay connected to mom this relationship you have now with her means a lot to you.

199
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to stay communicating with her. Is it that you want to cope differently when you are around

200
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The precursors that used to lead to aggression. So let me say that again. Do you want to feel differently when you unconsciously sometimes consciously right recognize. Oh my goodness, this looks familiar. This could lead to aggression. Do you want to feel differently around her.

201
00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Would that equal sign. I'm dealing differently that being equal to dealing differently if you ended up feeling differently. I think you did. It did it once. Anyway, which is by law.

202
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how long did it linger. Let me see how true that is did you continue to ruminate over it and question yourself for hours.

203
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:31.140
Alicia Noedel: It bugged me I'm not my decision that I made. But the way that she acted

204
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What tell me how she again just

205
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: described what her face, what was going on.

206
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.240
Alicia Noedel: I walked outside and I had the baby.

207
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.900
Alicia Noedel: In her carrier and I was going to put her in the car and

208
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:53.250
Alicia Noedel: I said bye mommy and she was in the garden. So she was about, you know, 10 feet away, and she was trying to fix the garden for me okay and

209
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.250
Alicia Noedel: She was all she was just like by

210
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:14.730
Alicia Noedel: And it was always like, are you going to come kiss the baby before I go gonna come say hi to the baby. And she was like, well, if you give me a second to get over there. I'm going over there right now. Give me. Second, but like, she said it, you know, with an attitude and then

211
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.480
Alicia Noedel: She brought me over to the garden and

212
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:27.330
Alicia Noedel: She's she told me that the garden was a really big thing to take on and that

213
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait for you for her.

214
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: She said, this is a big thing for you to take on

215
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:47.880
Alicia Noedel: It. That is a big responsibility and it's a lot of work and that she doesn't want or I'm trying to figure out how she said it. She was like,

216
00:27:49.950 --> 00:28:02.820
Alicia Noedel: You know, you're going to this is all just a big waste of money if it's if it doesn't turn out. If we don't get at least 70 to $90 worth of vegetables because your dog ruined it.

217
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.910
Alicia Noedel: So I mean like it wasn't just like, oh, you know,

218
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.460
Alicia Noedel: Like

219
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:21.810
Alicia Noedel: passive aggressive like hi by like she would, you know, being really like it felt like she was trying to argue with me.

220
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So can we just stay there without that that sequence is is is just jam packed with me.

221
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: is jam packed so right what you just said to me is when it wasn't just a fight.

222
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It was jam packed with what you called she's trying to argue. Now, I would say I have more words to describe the phenomenon of what she was doing

223
00:28:50.940 --> 00:29:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And remembering that the goal is for you to feel what around we can come up with lots of different words to describe her behavior, but ultimately you want to feel what around this relatively predictable behavior of mommy's. What do you want to feel

224
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.210
Alicia Noedel: Able to let it go.

225
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, yeah, it was there. So notice it able to let it go. It's not an emotion. So that's a, that's a phenomenon.

226
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: When you don't let it go, and it's there and you're holding on to it was the emotion.

227
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.370
Alicia Noedel: Of upset.

228
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get closer to a core emotion.

229
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry scared disgusted surprised surprised.

230
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.950
Alicia Noedel: I'm

231
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.610
Alicia Noedel: Hurt sadness.

232
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.290
Alicia Noedel: The tad bit of it not like a lot of anger. But, you know, little annoyed. I guess I'd say

233
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to, let's go with sad and annoyed.

234
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because annoyed is right. It's the sort of a dial down anger.

235
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

236
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you don't let it go.

237
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel sad and annoyed.

238
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.650
Alicia Noedel: Mm hmm.

239
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to, what do you want to feel

240
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.390
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

241
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She's gonna keep doing her thing. So in essence of this behavior and it's men, it's going to come at you with many, many, many, many different forms. How do you want to feel inside your body.

242
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.700
Alicia Noedel: How do you want to feel anything.

243
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:56.790
Alicia Noedel: Because I, you know, I, I've even tried taking a sympathetic approach and it feels like I'm you know i don't get anything in return. I mean, so I really just don't wanna. I don't want it to affect me at all. I really don't. I want to be able to just let it roll off in the back.

244
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a little thing about humans.

245
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's unlikely to happen.

246
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry.

247
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.480
Alicia Noedel: It's true. I know.

248
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean a drug does that, right, it can make you a zombie. That's probably why it was so appealing and then wait. However,

249
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of what makes you so incredible. Right. Is this disability to feel deeply and when you feel deeply it informs Oh boy, you really care about this.

250
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It can guide you and tell you what's important to you.

251
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's not look at it from such a I don't, I don't want to. I don't want to have any of it.

252
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming this don't want to feel sad and annoyed.

253
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And this idea that there might be notice she just said my tried sympathy and you didn't get the outcome you wanted

254
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I said what if you ended up feeling proud confident strong, empowered wise.

255
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you like those know those words just came up to you.

256
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that was an alternative to being around and being in you right being you around.

257
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The label whatever her behavior is. But did you get to feel grounded at peace, confident, proud.

258
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Intelligent

259
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibility. Yeah.

260
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

261
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.670
Alicia Noedel: I never thought that was an option.

262
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, absolutely. I think it really is.

263
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what you picked up on.

264
00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconsciously and it knew what to do, which was adaptive and new to cope. It knew what to do. But those are the things of

265
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The three and four and five and six year old. Those are the solutions of a little girl you're brilliant and you can make them work for the rest of your life. Plenty of people do, but they have a lot of tumult

266
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's such intense emotional experience. But what you can do.

267
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.630
Alicia Noedel: Is

268
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Honor that that this, this is coping of a little girl. And so we're just going to say, well,

269
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't over something new. You're going to learn something new.

270
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have consciousness and then you have choice.

271
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did all of that you have survived all effect.

272
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And no one taught you how to do it. You did that all by yourself.

273
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's amazing.

274
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.510
Alicia Noedel: He just I

275
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.010
Alicia Noedel: I

276
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:15.420
Alicia Noedel: I've let it affect me for so long, so long. My mother's one of those people that like her emotion like her. She can be the sweetest sweetest person.

277
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:26.400
Alicia Noedel: And then she can be so cold and you know she has a she's not like like the way she was when I was a kid, by far, but

278
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:35.640
Alicia Noedel: She's I still see like little peaks of like when she gets annoyed and you know she, I want to talk things out.

279
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:55.050
Alicia Noedel: I like to, you know, communicate, I like to, you know, solve the issue at hand. And I know that I can't come at her with argument and miss. Because I know that that's not going to get anywhere because, you know, no matter how loud I can yell, she can mile yell louder as you will not listen

280
00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:01.980
Alicia Noedel: You know, I don't go that route because my, you know, even though I do like to be, you know, like, very

281
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:10.740
Alicia Noedel: Responsive to the situation with whatever emotion and feeling at the time I take a different approach with her because I know that that's not going to get anywhere.

282
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So certainly doesn't work either.

283
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:20.550
Alicia Noedel: But I mean, I mean like, no, it doesn't like when she's really upset. Like what's wrong.

284
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.020
Alicia Noedel: Nothing.

285
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.680
Alicia Noedel: No matter how many times as

286
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:38.400
Alicia Noedel: He want to answer or she'll give me an answer like oh no one helps me clean but like that's not the root of what's bothering her. She doesn't know what to talk about, I think,

287
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I

288
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Do

289
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can use just just radical acceptance really quick right now. This is the story about the garden. I took some notes.

290
00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, if you give me a second. And oh, you know, this is two biggest thing anyway. And, you know, if you don't get money back $70 worth and really just, this is just a bad investment your dog grow into it and

291
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Basically

292
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

293
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the story. Then there's you

294
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The old coping, which is you try to figure out what you can do to fix it. You'll conform you'll do introspection, you want to use this this coke communication skill with her.

295
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance might look like what with this presentation of mom, what would radical acceptance, what would it be in your head. How would you know you were doing it right. As soon as you heard her say I'm trying to get there as fast as I can.

296
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:57.510
Alicia Noedel: And I would just think, you know, I'm not even gonna engage in this because it's not going to lead to anything that's healthy for you there was

297
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.300
Alicia Noedel: I'm not. So that's how I thought about it when it came down to it, I was like, You know what, I'm not even gonna

298
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.880
Alicia Noedel: Start. I'm just gonna leave because that was the best option.

299
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a solution. Absolutely. So

300
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.040
Alicia Noedel: Even when we were leaving, when

301
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:24.840
Alicia Noedel: When I was driving away it about Santa Fe, we were going to send a it's about 60 Miles FOR ABOUT IT THAT TAKES ABOUT 3540 minutes I'm

302
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:34.410
Alicia Noedel: Even when we were leaving, I was thinking in my head. You know the old me would have texted her and started

303
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:40.860
Alicia Noedel: A big old thing and made it her way bigger. And what's wrong with you why he's upset. I didn't do anything to you.

304
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:51.840
Alicia Noedel: And, you know, even there was a little piece of me that he thought, you know, should I text her and be like without and I remembered you know that, how many times has that worked for me.

305
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:59.430
Alicia Noedel: When is that ever brought in on the kind of outcome that I wanted or needed

306
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to

307
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm saying

308
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance. Now your solution. How that manifests in the universe is

309
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I put the phone down

310
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I was about to text or have the thought maybe I should text, what the heck. Mom, I didn't do nothing.

311
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance.

312
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom is doing the sweet the cold up the down. This is just how mom is

313
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's acceptance.

314
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a wish to change her not a wish that something was different, letting go of that.

315
00:38:47.250 --> 00:39:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And holding on to you instead what it feels like to you in that moment, really going tenderly to us disappointing dog gone. It's hard to see. Hard to see it again that my mom.

316
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is engaged in the psychological project if I get identification, where she right uses intellectual ization and she rationalization, and all these antics that she has honed over the years.

317
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Where she does not take responsibility.

318
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: For her own emotions. She does not take responsibility for her word the

319
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.820
Alicia Noedel: Story that everyone else's

320
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, period. You say that again. Your mom engaged in rationalization justification.

321
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And blame.

322
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But she did it because she's coming

323
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:45.900
Uh huh.

324
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.320
Yeah.

325
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It has nothing to do with you, not the same thing. Is it not affecting you. It's a

326
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Different translation or her behavior. It's a compassion. It sits here not sympathy. Now what's wrong. No, it's

327
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you stay in your own truth. This is just a pointing to see hot and cold and there she goes, it's hard to see my mom using those same skills right

328
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To avoid accountability. I don't like seeing it in her. I don't like seeing it in myself. It's hard to watch

329
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: For mom poor mom, you can have compassion for that from a distance.

330
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's healthy

331
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Disengagement it's healthy.

332
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You stay back just a little bit. You let her

333
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: do her thing not demanding night. That's where this earlier conversation came up

334
00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where anger right anger demands change for me so that I don't have to feel blamed change, change, change on it, mom. She's not going to the radical acceptance is, this is my mom.

335
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's labeled bipolar. Fine, we'll go with that label, but it's so much more. It's all of these

336
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Painful stories.

337
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the moment what radical acceptance is just

338
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There she goes again on it and then you come back, all it is. You don't continue to analyze it don't interpret it. You just summarize a quick little there that's that sweet cold bipolar. There it is gone. It

339
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: For Mom That's all she knows what to do. She's doing her best. And then you come back. So now the oscillation. You come back to you. How am I feeling

340
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how do you take care of yourself.

341
00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Around disappointment. That's the next step, you will not get it from her you know about a conversation, no amount of texting. This is the big assumption. This is the big change. This is the rewiring of the brain part right

342
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Here right there. What do I do to take care of me in my disappointment in this garden.

343
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to do all this BS instead of just say

344
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I really thought this guy could help. I'm so sorry. And then the dog came out and ruins your garden. Oh, I feel so guilty. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.

345
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish she said

346
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:50.190
Alicia Noedel: And I wasn't sat with her. Either you know like I wasn't she was just annoyed with those situation there's, you know, I'd never showed any

347
00:42:50.520 --> 00:43:01.950
Alicia Noedel: It wasn't provoked or anything. And that's how it is. And it's happened so many times that like I know how it's going to play out every time because I know how I mean I know myself.

348
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you cope with disappointment. So we all of this work.

349
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's back to. So if we do this oscillation. If we say cuz she did most of it right, you just said.

350
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, mommy. He pushed, pushed a little bit with. Aren't you going to kiss the baby. He wanted her to do something else wanted her to be this mom that remembers on her own that can push past this guilt that she I wish you would actually feel

351
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:39.930
Alicia Noedel: Around the Garter. I think I also wanted her to make her feel better. You know, do I wanted to kind of get her mind off it, like, oh, you can you shoot the baby always makes her happy.

352
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.270
Alicia Noedel: You know, I didn't expect her to react like that.

353
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't work, you're, you're, you're doing. What maybe would help you

354
00:43:50.340 --> 00:44:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus on the things that's most important. It's not about a friggin garden. It's about relationships, she doesn't get that she doesn't get the rupture. That just happened like back to back to back to back to back, and she does not know how to repair it. I'm telling you.

355
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's acceptance.

356
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:28.740
Alicia Noedel: is unfortunate, too, because that's what's like really impressed with our relationship. That's one of the things that I've always you know she is, she is unable to communicate without getting upset and, you know, yelling. She can't do it. And it's just her

357
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:37.830
Alicia Noedel: And I just, you know, I need to accept that and I kind of have because they know better. Now, to just

358
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Not even

359
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.340
Alicia Noedel: My age.

360
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.020
Alicia Noedel: But I feel like that's unhealthy.

361
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.150
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

362
00:44:51.240 --> 00:45:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's going crazy you expecting her to change or your mom who is completely comfortable in her denial and you're

363
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that keep here kit. Don't you want to kiss the baby. No you rewind it far enough back if you have true acceptance.

364
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You would hold that child and your arms and enjoy her just stay there like this, I see you, Mom. Right. It's in your head. I see you don't Kennett How unfortunate she can't come here and enjoy this. Will you hold this little girl.

365
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm deeply connected to this little girl right now and for fussing over some projection about a garden and just the silliness. Oh, Mom. I hope you have a good day. Mommy, and you just sit here and rock like this, see the difference. I'm taking care of myself. I'm staying connected to my daughter.

366
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm watching my mom and it is sad because for a moment you oscillate you imagine how helpless. That would be to not know how to connect

367
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: With daughter granddaughter to own right to sit with I'm sorry about the garden or any of the door. I mean, there's so many different things that she could have connected around in a

368
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.570
Meaningful

369
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Way, they're all missed opportunities, but you stay here with the baby.

370
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, What do you do Elisa when you are in the thought of that's unfortunate that my mom doesn't know how to repair that's unfortunate that my mom does not know how to take accountability that is inconvenient and disappointing.

371
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But that right there is for you to manage

372
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The days of going to mom are gone.

373
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Until they're not. And we'll look at that, when she changes and looks like a saved person come back in here and you tell me I'm seeing profound change. I wonder if she's seeing a therapist. She's

374
00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing something different. She looks reliable and safe now when I want to trust and I'm going to open my boundaries, a little bit more but for now.

375
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference between

376
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting putting baby like right you want to fix it. But total acceptance of what is to see your mother.

377
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And accepted and loved her anyway.

378
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you taking care of you. Just, just you don't push baby, you just

379
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this. Okay.

380
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See you later. If she remembers to come over and kiss, baby. That's fine. But guess who is enjoying her I'm holding her and

381
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine

382
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And she didn't push that next piece.

383
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it hard to believe that she might forget to kiss the Baby Goodbye.

384
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.310
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

385
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.230
Alicia Noedel: Because she you know she loves her so much.

386
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the same, but that was about you.

387
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:25.470
Alicia Noedel: Here, Kim that situation. I mean, you know, I think it was just me trying to fix it. Yeah.

388
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:34.920
Alicia Noedel: You know, she would have said by to the baby. Regardless, but you know, I wanted to, you know, change the conversation.

389
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

390
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.020
Alicia Noedel: Make it something about happy. Yeah, that was me trying to fix it.

391
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on that, like, once you really get this this oscillation back and forth and back and forth. Once you really get that you

392
00:48:50.760 --> 00:49:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just needed to take care of you to stay connected to your daughter just holding her and feeling, feeling what it's like to stay connected to her while you're seeing your mom doing her thing.

393
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're taking taking care of yourself. You have nothing to prove you have nothing to demand. You just in the presence of someone who's not tuned in, but it doesn't prevent you from tuning into yourself and saying, Why am I disappointed. I'm seeing my mom do this tug on it.

394
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to see.

395
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you come back you feel her. What if you had just brought your eyes down for a moment and looked at her and just stay here with her like that.

396
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine and stop trying to save that out here.

397
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Like here, but you just did.

398
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That repair in here with her, you just love her and stay connected and almost, almost even started to forget.

399
00:49:52.860 --> 00:50:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That rupture that happened with your mother. But indeed, it just went to what's important to you and that is staying connected with your daughter and feeling well. I know I'm not living this craziness. I'm here with her being congruent.

400
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's being present.

401
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.230
Alicia Noedel: I just

402
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.050
Alicia Noedel: Wanna eat.

403
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:36.930
Alicia Noedel: I think that this is also, you know, helpful because usually, I don't think about changing the way i think i think about

404
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:46.260
Alicia Noedel: Running away from it. Yeah. So, you know, I literally just ended, as you know, well,

405
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:53.400
Alicia Noedel: I just want to have my own place. I don't live here anymore. And, you know, and I don't feel like that all the time.

406
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:59.340
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, because I love being here. I love you know for now this is where I need to be

407
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:07.560
Alicia Noedel: But, you know, obviously, you know, I'm 22. I don't want to live with my, you know, my mother forever.

408
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:19.290
Alicia Noedel: I feel like I should have been, you know, I was on my own. When I was like 14 I was on my own and I, you know, came back after, you know, five years.

409
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.870
Alicia Noedel: But I

410
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:33.960
Alicia Noedel: I always try and run from it. I don't I just go, you know, I just really, I just need to. We just need move. I don't, I can't be here anymore and that's not how I need to deal with it.

411
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.480
Alicia Noedel: Because it's not going to help

412
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we need to start to bring today to a close, but let's take what you just said about the

413
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to run from it.

414
00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to add more more skills to what you're already doing just take the ones you already have. There's seeing what you're seeing accepting what's right in front of you, my mom.

415
00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is coping she's dealing with her own demons or issues, whatever you are bipolar right there. And that's how it works its way, but I'm not going to interpret it, and therefore there's nothing to solve.

416
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There's just no I'm gonna take care of me.

417
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How, there's nothing to solve. Now, there's no argument. Now, there's no I have to leave now. There's just, you're going to see your monster around and there'll be a change, because you will not be

418
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to demand suggest help. Nothing, it's just going to be her having to deal with herself.

419
00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see what happens. Let's see what happens with her. Maybe she'll come full circle. Maybe it'll escalate neutral cheap sort of provoking.

420
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And will you hold on to yourself, please stay there and your truth of who I don't really like that behavior. She's doing a three more. She just did five more of them.

421
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm all right. I don't need her to change, she's behaving exactly as I predicted she's doing the best she can and i doing the best I can. And I'm here.

422
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: staying in contact with my daughter.

423
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't need to go any more complicated than that. It's just breathing. It's just tuning in to the self, how, how are you doing, how, you know, how am I doing

424
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel this. I'm anxious, I'm here, I'm here, I'm breathing for me connect with my daughter.

425
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me stop trying to change this.

426
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Acceptance.

427
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For you brief to an inward to how you doing, and take care of yourself.

428
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Do what feels good. It feels good to hold your baby.

429
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You want your mom to feel it. What are you notice her

430
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You tune into her

431
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what, then you're going to feel better. And although you didn't say exactly the emotion that you want to feel when your mom is doing her thing.

432
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We played with some words I threw some out there. See you investigate how you feel when you use those skills.

433
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see if there's less of that sad less of the irritability and see if there's other words that I threw out there or your own come up

434
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

435
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else we

436
00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I gotta run over and start a group

437
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: 95 fruit. What do you know

438
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So are we still good for

439
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh may 18

440
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: an idiom.

441
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.560
Alicia Noedel: That sounds great.

442
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And I'll get to see you in group.
