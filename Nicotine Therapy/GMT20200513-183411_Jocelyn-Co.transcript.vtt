Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned that

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:20.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Before saying anything you thought about things you think about things before you know so as you would not hurt anyone in, you're not letting your emotions trigger your moods and stuff.

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.160
Jocelyn Corrales: And you have been very careful.

19
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.100
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're doing self reflection. When you have anxieties or mood problems.

20
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.630

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.710

Timothy Kushner: I'm supposed to be for 30 days right

23
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.400

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.920

26
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.820
Timothy Kushner: So, so like you teach me things. But a lot of it is repetitive.

27
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.560
Timothy Kushner: It's more about

28
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:12.060
Timothy Kushner: Like what i'm doing outside of the therapy sessions baby sister sessions are just a microcosm of everything that's going on.

29
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.000
Timothy Kushner: Just a small thing.

30
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.700
Jocelyn Corrales: At least you know little things. Let's start with, you know, little things like baby steps until you're able to get back on your feet.

31
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.460
Timothy Kushner: True.

32
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're not having any problems that

33
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.300
Timothy Kushner: Medications may can be kind of slow. I think it's also like my choices like

34
00:02:47.220 --> 00:03:02.880
Timothy Kushner: I just like when you get into that lifestyle like not doing healthy activities, not being nutrition not exercising as much as you should be, and you're on psychiatric meds, which also make you slower it

35
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.130
Timothy Kushner: Has a thing. It makes you just by

36
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.070
Timothy Kushner: Like a zombie. It's not

37
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.230
Timothy Kushner: I don't like it at all.

38
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.160
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, I can still talk, but it's more like

39
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.570
Timothy Kushner: In person react like in person.

40
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:34.860
Timothy Kushner: Like conversations, which can be hard if like you're just have like a low self worth, or self esteem. At the time of the conversation.

41
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.180
Timothy Kushner: So, yeah.

42
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.540
Jocelyn Corrales: So if you like a zombie.

43
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.640
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, pretty much.

44
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.110
Timothy Kushner: Just

45
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.600
Timothy Kushner: Talking to you. I guess I like

46
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.620
Timothy Kushner: I feel like it's someone just

47
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.340
Timothy Kushner: It's like it's it's hard though because like, yeah, like in regular life.

48
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.540
Jocelyn Corrales: You're going to deal with people you

49
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.260
Timothy Kushner: Don't always like, but you can't like you have to be careful about how you approach those types of conversations

50
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.400
Timothy Kushner: Because if you're young, or you don't have that like

51
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.860
Timothy Kushner: That energy you just won't react them the best way or don't get like the

52
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.790
Timothy Kushner: Wrong idea out of the interaction.

53
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Especially you working in a mall or grocery

54
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you have to interact with people that

55
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.300
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, your mood definitely affects your work life.

56
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.830
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to your medication. Does it also affect your mood right now.

57
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.610

58
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.150
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

59
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.910
Timothy Kushner: And I just

60
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.540
Timothy Kushner: Don't feel the best like

61
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.100
Timothy Kushner: I don't know, like I just don't like

62
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.890
Timothy Kushner: It's just hard. You know,

63
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.260
Timothy Kushner: I don't know, it's just I gotta take it one day at a time and

64
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.290
Timothy Kushner: Slow down, but

65
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.360
Timothy Kushner: I'm not really enjoying myself, either.

66
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.690
Jocelyn Corrales: That's okay, I understand. Maybe it's a try, you know,

67
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.620
Jocelyn Corrales: When you wake up in the morning, although I know you wake up early.

Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and

79
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:23.250
Jocelyn Corrales: We could try to do something about that. Maybe when you wake up, try to wake up maybe around eight o'clock instead of waking up.

80
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:38.400
Jocelyn Corrales: A nine o'clock, maybe seven o'clock or eight o'clock. Try waking up earlier did in the morning, try to do some exercise to energize yourself so that you would not feel weak and you would not, you know, you would not

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.540
Timothy Kushner: That was true.

88
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's do

89
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.040
Jocelyn Corrales: after waking up.

90
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.060

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.730
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, sleeping will

92
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:34.830
Timothy Kushner: All through the night, not like we can up. I never really had that problem. It's just, it's more about their energy

93
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.510
Timothy Kushner: Levels. Yeah.

94
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.740

Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

97
00:07:45.150 --> 00:08:01.590
Jocelyn Corrales: That's why I like a working out before I go to sleep because you know it tiresome down it relaxes my mind. So it's like a mixture of exercises and yoga, so it tears me up and relaxes me. Sometimes, I sleep on the yoga mat.

98
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.120
Timothy Kushner: Oh yeah, like the those meditations, and they're making

99
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

100
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:28.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Because when you when you do exercise. There's like a tried to take things slow at first, before you do something heavier in the middle. And before you end your exercise tried to do some relaxation. After that, and you would feel, you know,

101
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:37.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of, you know, especially if you want to go to sleep, try to do some, you know, relaxation technique afterwards so that you know you would feel sleepy.

102
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.790
Jocelyn Corrales: But in your case, maybe you could do some acting work out to make you feel energized.

103
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.380
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

104
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.520

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.380
Timothy Kushner: It's just something my mom wanted me to do. And also I wanted to. So it's like a mix of our own self.

119
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Interest, but

120
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.010

Timothy Kushner: Yeah, that is true. You know, my sister. She changed her major like 20 to 30 times before.

157
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.490
Timothy Kushner: What she wanted to do.

158
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.770
Timothy Kushner: I think I'm exaggerating.

159
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:52.560
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like to study for the whole probably how many years just been studying and shifting from one course until she's able to find the one that she likes

160
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.830
Timothy Kushner: The Happy SPOT. YOU KNOW, SHE GOT LUCKY TOO because she had like the full scholarship

161
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.270
Timothy Kushner: And I was the one who was on that path. And then I lost my way

162
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.210
Timothy Kushner: School became like just as interesting to me, or just like keeping up with it.

163
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:16.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes that's true and stress, China, you know, try to take things slow, maybe, you know,

164
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:32.190
Jocelyn Corrales: But, you know, at least it's something that would keep your mind off things, you know, studying, but are you still going to continue working when you're going back to school or you're going to school part time and working also part time, something like that.

165
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.800
Timothy Kushner: Um, I think I should focus more on school but

166
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.750
Timothy Kushner: It's, it's, like, half and half.

167
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.800
Timothy Kushner: Because I have to pay for my own expenses.

168
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.740
Timothy Kushner: I guess so. My family is trying to tell me

169
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.630
Timothy Kushner: Because they always said like, we won't pay for your school, you have to get in yourself.

170
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.070
Timothy Kushner: For free or

171
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.150
Timothy Kushner: Pay yourself, you know, just something to do

172
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:07.770
Timothy Kushner: But um but yeah I it's online, too. So if I think if I get the right schedule. I'll be able to balance it.

173
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so it's like part time school and part time work where you're not able to get scholarship, just like your sister.

174
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:39.960
Timothy Kushner: WASN'T ABLE TO because like I said my high school, I wasn't, I didn't balance. It was more i like i was i was still intelligent. I just wasn't like it was more of my diligence and my I wasn't like responsible and like focusing. I was focusing more on fun and like procrastination than doing

175
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Great.

176
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.850
Jocelyn Corrales: You know teams are like that, you know, instead of focusing on studying, you know,

177
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.700
Jocelyn Corrales: I want to do these, you know,

178
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.090
Jocelyn Corrales: That's part of the fun at school.

179
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.230
Timothy Kushner: Definitely getting the things done before the other things.

180
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

181
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:09.030
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so instead of prioritizing your studies, you have to do these things, you know, and do those things.

182
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.680
Jocelyn Corrales: So we take us to spiritual self. Do you consider yourself spiritual

183
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.770
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, I like meditating.

184
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:43.170
Timothy Kushner: Trans transcending like trans. I don't know the the word transcendental, I think there's something like that. Those types of meditation like chance I like Buddhism, like I i just searched up the. They're all over YouTube like the certain guided meditations, or like frequencies. And I like

185
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.380
Timothy Kushner: It helps me with my energy

186
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.780
Timothy Kushner: helps me be remain focus too.

187
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.020
Jocelyn Corrales: So what type of medication. Have you tried

188
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.730
Timothy Kushner: I kindness wishes. I don't put myself in one box, it just

189
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Depends like a mixture of everything.

190
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:13.470
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, depends what's happen mood. I am if I feel like one thing is failing or like a certain area of focus on that.

191
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.480
Also foods.

192
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you also really

193
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:31.890
Timothy Kushner: Um, yeah, but I don't, I'm not like all income all religious. You know what I mean like I just pick and choose what fits me or

194
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.900
Timothy Kushner: If someone has appeared offer that I haven't heard or something like

195
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.050
Timothy Kushner: Helps me out.

196
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.590

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:21.900
Timothy Kushner: Hello.

198
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Hi, Timothy.

199
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.940
Timothy Kushner: I'm back.

200
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Sorry, I

201
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Think I lost my connection.

202
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.930
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, like or something, I don't know.

203
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.930
Jocelyn Corrales: I think it's my intern has

204
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:03.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Steadily got gloss, though. Okay, let's go back to a religion.

205
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.390
Jocelyn Corrales: We were talking about religion and you said you are religious, but

206
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.280
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, but when that's all I focus on. It's like a trap.

207
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:28.770
Timothy Kushner: It becomes like too much and then people because like, not everybody wants to hear you, like, teach them things like a lot of people just want to be in the moment, just have fun, but

208
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:34.650
Timothy Kushner: It can be kind of a letdown of all you do is like, oh, I'm teaching you when my

209
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.650
Timothy Kushner: Mother would like you just want to like chill out, like, not everybody has to hear that.

210
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

211
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.860
Timothy Kushner: That's true, especially when you're out where

212
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:51.300
Jocelyn Corrales: They would sometimes they wouldn't they wouldn't take you seriously, you know, especially, especially if you're not, they're not into that.

213
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.440
Jocelyn Corrales: They have to be careful. Yeah.

214
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.230
Timothy Kushner: About because it is a powerful aspect.

215
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.080
Timothy Kushner: Not everybody believes or has that

216
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:08.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes and what particular religion. Are you into. Are you a Christian or something else.

217
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.530
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, say I'm a Christian.

218
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.270
Timothy Kushner: I had to choose.

219
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:24.870
Timothy Kushner: But I don't buy into all the reviews, because a lot of them are controlling and I see through it, but I just like

220
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:38.460
Timothy Kushner: The ones that like lift you up. You know when you're not like all serious because like some Christians, take it too far. Like, oh my religion is like better than all the other ones like I don't like that.

221
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

222
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.370
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not into all their views, but you're just into the

223
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.830
Timothy Kushner: positive uplifting facilities. Yep.

224
00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.020
Jocelyn Corrales: That's true. Sometimes they are the most, the most religious person.

225
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Can be the most judgmental person.

226
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.540
Jocelyn Corrales: That he could meet

227
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:07.980
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

228
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.530
Timothy Kushner: I'm against that, like all those holy wars that we're

229
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:16.920
Timothy Kushner: All just for a plot of land that's supposed to have spiritual significance.

230
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.800
Jocelyn Corrales: So it's better to, you know,

231
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Just like you said you're a Christian. It's like just following Jesus, you know, you don't have to

232
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:41.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Follow what everyone does. But you just have to follow his examples and he's ideas just like what you're telling me you know positive uplifting morals and not you know

233
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:54.000
Jocelyn Corrales: There are, you know, many who says they are very active Christians, but the irritable Satish judgmental type of person. It's not. It's like that. It's, it's, it seems like it's against their faith, you know,

234
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.360
Timothy Kushner: Sure.

235
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.740
Timothy Kushner: You don't have it today, someone if

236
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.480
Timothy Kushner: They don't believe

237
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

238
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.740
Timothy Kushner: Slaves ways to uplift people without bringing religion into it.

239
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true, that's true. Yes.

240
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.420
Well,

241
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.970
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm a Christian.

242
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:20.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually, but I actually didn't promote you know I'm a Baptist, but I actually, you know,

243
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.540
Jocelyn Corrales: For me religion does not save you, you know, religion does not

244
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:46.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Save a person, but it's your faith that saves you the faith that you believe in God is the faith that you believe in Jesus Christ. You know, you try to walk the things that you talk to, you know, you try to encourage people, you know, you try to, you know,

245
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:55.680
Jocelyn Corrales: For example, like for example you use some devices you know about things like this and that any also try to walk, what you

246
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:09.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Talk about so it's like you practice what you preach and that type of person because there are a lot of Christians, you know, it's like they're just Christians by name, but the the didn't

247
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:18.060
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, didn't they do not apply to themselves. It's just like, Hey, I'm a Christian, like that. And that's all. Let's say it in. They're not trying to apply it to their life.

248
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you pray

249
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.770
Timothy Kushner: You pray

250
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.330
Jocelyn Corrales: You pray, you know, it doesn't have to be a formal for your

251
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.420
Jocelyn Corrales: As long as you talk to God. Talk to Jesus.

252
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.450
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, I believe that the listen

253
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.330
Jocelyn Corrales: All things happen for a reason.

254
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.590
Timothy Kushner: Everything's a lesson. It's not a mistake.

255
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.440
Timothy Kushner: It's just so but yes yes we do.

256
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:56.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, it's like everything is a learning process everything that you experience, you know, don't take it bad. You know, take it positively take it positively instead of thinking about it as a bad thing that happened.

257
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Think about the positively that you know

258
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Those things may, might have happened for a reason to teach you a lesson to make you a better person.

259
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.290
Jocelyn Corrales: I always believe that

260
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.470
Jocelyn Corrales: So you know those things that have it, the bad things that happened to you previously.

261
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:23.580
Jocelyn Corrales: You could think of it as a learning lesson, you know, don't, don't linger on it, try to move forward, you know,

262
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:36.780
Jocelyn Corrales: And of course, do not forget about it because, you know, always try to look back of the things that has happened to you and put it as an example, your life to be, you know, to move forward.

263
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.660
Jocelyn Corrales: But China to linger about it, you know.

264
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Okey, so

265
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:55.200

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:12.990
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, they're supportive. They have their own problems just like anybody else. But I'll see. I'm the one who's going through it.

269
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.950
Timothy Kushner: They just want me to feel better about myself.

270
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.950
Timothy Kushner: Just get back to where I was just happy.

271
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.280
Timothy Kushner: happy go lucky carrying

272
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.320

Jocelyn Corrales: Are you still in contact with your sister. Do you have, how many brothers and sisters. Do you have

274
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.600
Timothy Kushner: I have one sister and yes

275
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.250
Jocelyn Corrales: And how is she doing right now.

276
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:57.270
Timothy Kushner: She's doing all right, pretty good. I was supposed to. I hope to see her sometime soon because it's been a while since I've seen her in person.

277
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.040
Jocelyn Corrales: And she's she also is very supportive of you.

278
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:20.070
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, she is. She, she understands me in ways that my own family doesn't like my family gets me, but because she's like more my age. Well, it's not a tenure difference, but she's still like she went through the same thing. Growing up in this household

279
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

280
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.310
Jocelyn Corrales: So it's like she can relate

281
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.070
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.020
He knows

283

284
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.570
Timothy Kushner: Definitely

285
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you have other, you know, like France that you tell your problems to

286
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.340
Timothy Kushner: Um, yeah, but I've been kind of not talking to people.

287
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.250
Timothy Kushner: Because a lot of them were doing.

288
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:09.150
Timothy Kushner: I don't, I don't know. I'm just kind of more introspective at this point in my recovery.

289
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.580
Timothy Kushner: I only talking to others more like

290
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.480
Timothy Kushner: reclusive

292
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Trying to communicate with your family. Do you have a girlfriend.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.540
Timothy Kushner: No I do not. I'm single.

294
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.070
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's fine.

295
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.770

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.670
Jocelyn Corrales: For a summer class.

339
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.640
Jocelyn Corrales: It's a good thing that's it's online.

340
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:20.580
Jocelyn Corrales: At least you get to stay at home. But, you know, even if it's online, you know, you still need to be active at home.

341
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.730
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, work those muscles.

342
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.860
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, definitely.

343
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:27.930
Do you

344
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Mean it. Let's see here.

345
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:42.330
Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned that you like walking, biking or playing basketball, but I don't think you could play basketball or, you know, go walking or biking at this

346
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.670
Timothy Kushner: Able to

347
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh yeah, there's not much many people there your area.

348
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.100
Timothy Kushner: So, so, but it's like it's like a beach town so

349
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.140
Timothy Kushner: A lot of things can go

350
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.260
Timothy Kushner: Like you're able to exercise and

351
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.980
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you wear your mask when you're outside

352
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:13.650
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, when I need to go like inside of a store from planning today. And yeah, we're

353
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:27.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Every time you try to go xi, like, you know, you want to go one or walking or biking a try to wear your mess. You know, it's better to be safe than, you know, get infected.

354
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:35.850
Timothy Kushner: That is true but breathing in the same pheromones also isn't good for you either

355
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe when you know when there's no one around. You can remove your mess probably

356
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.190
Jocelyn Corrales: But when you see a lot of people around, try to wear your mask.

357
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:57.300
Jocelyn Corrales: So we digress just spiritual self. Could you see something you know that's not working out for you.

358
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.160
Timothy Kushner: Well, that really, it's more like my social life. That's an issue at this point.

359
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.820
Timothy Kushner: And everything that's going on. I just feel more grounded.

360
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.500
Timothy Kushner: So,

361
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:14.850
Yeah.

362
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.080
Timothy Kushner: I don't, and it's causing me to be more stressed out.

363
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:27.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Why do you think you feel like you're more grounded. Your parents are very strict right now.

364
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Just feel

365
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.480
Timothy Kushner: Just other aspects of my life. The emotions. I feel

366
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.870
Jocelyn Corrales: With regards to financial you want to see better

367
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.350
Because you need to

368
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.370
Timothy Kushner: Be just better at budgeting. That's the word for

369
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.000
Jocelyn Corrales: That right

370
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Up for your own school

372
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.050
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

373
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

374
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to wake up, probably around eight seven or eight

375
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.210
Yes.

376
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:09.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of waking up around nine so that you would have time to work out and exercise into more into d

377
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you like doing crafts.

378
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:27.600
Timothy Kushner: Arts and Crafts are fun, but I don't really have much of a setup at my house at awards was really easy because they have all the Koreans and although I said

379
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.890
Timothy Kushner: It was really easy.

380
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.390
Timothy Kushner: The

381
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:38.040
Timothy Kushner: Here, I just don't have to like get like some art supplies, if I want to do that but

382
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.750
Timothy Kushner: It's definitely something I have a passion for when I like need something

383
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.830
Timothy Kushner: Like something to do the get my mind.

384
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:47.820
Timothy Kushner: The right

385
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.380

Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

391
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.680
Jocelyn Corrales: I think with regards to eating. You mentioned that you're on an intermittent fasting.

392
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Can you try eating a piece, maybe twice or three times in a day instead of snacking.

393
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.770
Timothy Kushner: Because you have

394
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:47.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Your mentioned that you have medications that you need to take lead food. So you have to really eat breakfast and dinner.

395
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe just a light breakfast with do

396
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.720
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

397
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:53.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:54.840
Timothy Kushner: So they've been doing

399
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:05.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to skip meals probably instead of skipping it tried to eat light meals. If you know if you don't feel like eating heavy meals.

400
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.210
Okay.

401
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.790
Timothy Kushner: Sounds like a good plan.

402
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Try eating meals.

403
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of missing out.

404
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat healthy foods.

405
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.290
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat healthy meals and snacks.

406
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:35.730
Timothy Kushner: Yeah.

407
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.710
Jocelyn Corrales: And after waking up to morning exercise.

408
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.030
Jocelyn Corrales: And since you are working, although

409
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:51.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe when you're not working, are there any things that you do around the house. Aside from chores.

410
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:55.770
Timothy Kushner: Says,

411
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.300
Timothy Kushner: Um, any work I do.

412
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

413
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Just around the house, you know,

414
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.450
Timothy Kushner: Because there are times are there are days that you are not working.

415
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.830
Jocelyn Corrales: So what they usually do.

416
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.440
Timothy Kushner: Will like

417
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.560
Timothy Kushner: Vacuuming around the house.

418
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Course that's chores.

419
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.950
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, well,

420
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:25.950
Timothy Kushner: What would be work inside the house other than toward like work on my like work that I can do for myself like reading

421
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.870
Timothy Kushner: Yes. Yeah, like

422
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.680
Timothy Kushner: I do that.

423
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.490
Timothy Kushner: Something that engages my mind.

424
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. So household

425
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.690
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, like household activities, just

426
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you do gardening. Also, you know, at least to make

427
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.920
Timothy Kushner: My parents have a garden, but I don't really help out with that.

428
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.020
Jocelyn Corrales: You know,

429
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.620
Timothy Kushner: Let me help.

430
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:52.980
Jocelyn Corrales: You know,

431
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:53.790
Timothy Kushner: It's like a soul.

432
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:10.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Heavy. Are you interested in gardening, you know, at least you know plant some vegetables in the pop, you know, at least, that would be take your things might have things and you know that's also something interesting that your new see your plants growing you know it.

433
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Feels good.

434
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe when you know when you have your online classes, probably you don't have work.

435
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:37.980
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know you have bacon time aside for doing chores, maybe do some gardening or do some of your arts and crafts, maybe just showing you know, instead, you know, because you don't have access to many of the things you know that

436
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.060
Jocelyn Corrales: That you've mentioned, we could do some drawing

437
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.870
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, definitely.

438
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:55.680
Timothy Kushner: I've been listening to too much music that's what I think like controlling my tone of voice, making more and more consistent

439
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:10.500
Timothy Kushner: Definitely is a thing I can work on to because I yell a lot. Because of how much I listen to music or like sometimes I yell sometimes I'm T quiet about a happy medium.

440
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.930
Timothy Kushner: Because people notice like

441
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:19.020
Timothy Kushner: But even if you've listened to music that much or have the headphones and all the time like

442
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.080
Timothy Kushner: It's the tone of voice is hard to control.

443
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.010
Jocelyn Corrales: So what type of music do you listen to

444
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:33.360
Timothy Kushner: Um, I like melodic music that's kind of modern but I also like old school.

445
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:39.450
Timothy Kushner: Rock r&b honestly just whatever I'm feeling. I like all the genres.

446
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:48.270
Timothy Kushner: Even something that like people like, Oh, that's weird all like find a reason to like it if it fits that

447
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:57.660
Timothy Kushner: Like tone of voice that are just like it like I can just feel it in my soul, you know,

448
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.800
Jocelyn Corrales: So it's like when you're listening to music. So your mood also depends on the

449
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:12.030
Jocelyn Corrales: The type of music that you listen to it. And it also reflects out

450
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:23.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Those, those are flex. So maybe try listening to maybe some some kind of a mellow music. Maybe instead of rock music, old school and music is fine.

451
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.640
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, definitely.

452
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Now classics, you know,

453
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.660

Timothy Kushner: Yeah, I'm a little bit old school, but I'm also in the school. It's weird.

459
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:06.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Because

460
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:17.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you've mentioned know when you when you when you listen to music, sometimes you know the the tone of your voice depends on the music.

461
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:32.310
Jocelyn Corrales: China listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers China, China, try not to listen to Red Hot Chili Peppers peppers, maybe try the Beatles is fine. Maybe you could also find other alternatives that are not that loud.

462
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:41.700
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, absolutely. So yeah cuz it's weird. The Red Hot Chili Peppers. It will be like a smooth song and then read all the other know

463
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.660
Yeah.

464
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.920
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like it. I don't know. I don't know if it's a heavy metal or so it's something like that. It's a mix of, you know, mild and

465
00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.830
Jocelyn Corrales: heavy rocks or something like that.

466
00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:58.530
Timothy Kushner: Yeah, the soul music is what I like the blues.

467
00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes.

468
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:06.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, the loser. Fine. The Jazz are fine. Maybe you know maybe to listen to music like that better.

469
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:18.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Listen, let's put that here in China to watch too much TV since you're going back to school are you watching too much TV. No.

470
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.710
Yeah.

471
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.730
Timothy Kushner: But when I'm at school. I won't be able to

472
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.210
Timothy Kushner: Cuz it definitely does rot, the brain and that feeds you ideas and

473
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:30.810
Yes.

474
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:41.580
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually addicting once you get started watching TV. You want to stop watching. So try to try to limit your

475
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Your time on TV.

476
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:56.580
Jocelyn Corrales: So instead of watching TV, you know, maybe that's what, that's probably the reason why you're always tired.

477
00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:09.810
Jocelyn Corrales: At home, so try to move around, instead of watching TV. Maybe you could watch TV at all maybe 30 minutes or an hour and it's fine, but maybe more than that. It's not good anymore. So try to, you know, walk around the house.

478
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Do some things like do some graphs. You know, you could do. You could

479
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Draw well you are listening to music or you could do gardening.

480
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:24.630

484
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:39.660
Jocelyn Corrales: And what time would you would we agree on probably 10 o'clock is fine.

485
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.670
Timothy Kushner: You know, yes. So, but I guess that's up Sunday. Right.

486
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.520

487
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Things that you would do.

488
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's do

489
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.030
Jocelyn Corrales: 12pm

490
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:09.660

492
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.770
Jocelyn Corrales: The plan so that you'll be able to see it. Where is it

493
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, can you see my screen.

494
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.310
Timothy Kushner: Yes, I'm able to

495
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:41.040
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm still going to edit this one so I have written here, all the things that you've mentioned you know about your life or what's working out for you. What's not working out for you. I'm just going to fill in.

496
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:59.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Some of the information here because most of them I place it here on what's working well. But then just going to edit this leader in feeling feel everything in. So wake up at around seven to 8am and eat meals on a regular basis and take medications.

497
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.640
Jocelyn Corrales: We'd meals.

498
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:12.150
Jocelyn Corrales: And avoid snacking. It's okay to take snacks. If you're able to take meals. So instead of, you know, snacking.

499
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:22.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Because probably sometimes if you do snacking you miss your meal. So try to eat light meals instead of missing out a meal and in between those music you do some snacking.

500
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:31.980
Jocelyn Corrales: So try to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner doesn't have to be heavy this this light meals to just eat the sandwich. That's fine.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.180
Jocelyn Corrales: And advice. Eat healthy meals and snacks.

502
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.710
Jocelyn Corrales: You've mentioned that you always feel tired and heavy because probably because of the medications and, you know,

503
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.550
