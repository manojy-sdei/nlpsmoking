Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know, just this concerned with

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

14
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: A losing a best friend is a sometimes I don't know. It's like our chosen family almost

15
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Closer than our blood.

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd wondered how you are doing around that and I know your daughter was going to come is that

17
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.610
Christina haro: I'm actually pick her up later this evening.

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.750
Wow.

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

20
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.340
Christina haro: She was she I probably won't be living with me because my son got her a mobile home.

21
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.290
Christina haro: Oh, yeah.

22
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So why is intense.

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.100
Though

24
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And her daughters, with her.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
Christina haro: Yeah okay kiddos. Yeah.

26
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.220
Right. Beautiful.

27
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

28
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I do need to review some treatment goals with you that you had set spend a little bit

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They might tie in well let's just see

30
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

31
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to learn. I want to be happy and not bring baggage was a goal of yours, but I had encouraged with some belly breathing grounding in the five senses.

32
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just make a little note today about how you're doing as far as using remembering emotional regulation skills, how do you think you're doing with that.

33
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.040
Christina haro: I think I'm doing good. Like, especially with my son and the breathing really helps me

34
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.110
Christina haro: Okay, hopefully that'll help me with my daughter when she gets me stress.

35
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

36
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

37
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see. Was it a number of times it doesn't. I didn't say, well, this one just says learn it. So did I teach you the grounding in the five senses, already I believe I did.

38
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.700
Christina haro: Yeah, we went. We went over it. Um,

39
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.360
Christina haro: Can we kind of review it a little bit.

40
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no problem. So let's see, that is that. So let's say you're having

41
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now you think of maybe something a little bit stressful. That might might be a little upsetting for you. Maybe not at 10 out of 10 but maybe at about a five.

42
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice. Notice how your body responds to it, maybe something gets tighter sort of heavier.

43
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And so seeing

44
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.060
Christina haro: I think my son.

45
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.320
Christina haro: Is yeah my son.

46
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, last one. So what you're doing is you're you're aware of a stress, you're, you're thinking of something and your body's responding to it. So this grounding in the five senses, which I'll bring up the poster again.

47
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll do it together.

48
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also, if you wanted to have a visual. This is kind of nice.

49
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what it is. It's basically if you're using. If you're experiencing panic or when you need to stay calm or anytime you are starting to feel sort of disconnected from your body.

50
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a way for you to get grounded back into the body.

51
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So the way it's written is you look at

52
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Five things you see four things you feel meaning touch tactile that's with your, your fingers. Three things you're here, two things you smell. And one thing it taste.

53
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're more than welcome to do it the way this is written, I teach it differently.

54
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why I teach it.

55
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I do as many things as I can describe

56
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: With adjectives.

57
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: With one thing instead of looking around the room and naming you know candle plant mirror couch like instead of that.

58
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I find my my approach takes more concentration, which is what you want, want to get out if the stressful.

59
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought content. So for me the way I teach it, it takes more concentration and so I kind of think it's more effective, but that might not be true for you. So, you know, go for it. Maybe try it both ways. So this is the way I would teach it.

60
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this. So what I want you to do is many

61
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Adjectives as you can. In other words, colors, shapes angled shadows, just anything you see

62
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.740
Christina haro: Okay.

63
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.740
Christina haro: So it's pink, blue some orange.

64
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.300
Christina haro: It's, it's got some some little stuff on there got leaves. It's got hearts.

65
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.290
Christina haro: Kind of bumpy

66
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.420
Christina haro: Feels a little round probably

67
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.720
Christina haro: As a flat into it.

68
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.560
Christina haro: It hasn't. Yeah, it has a hole in it. So you stick your hand in there. It's got colors on the inside. Also,

69
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.420
Christina haro: I'm a little bumpy

70
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. I don't know.

71
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now close your eyes and just listen.

72
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: For all sounds around you.

73
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if you can describe them.

74
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.170
Christina haro: I can hear cars. I can hear birds. I can actually hear my dog barking.

75
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.170
Christina haro: You're a car honking

76
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now with your hand just take something in your hand and just sort of describe kind of hand if you have something with some interesting

77
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.310
Yeah.

78
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice just describe what you feel.

79
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.260
It.

80
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.420
Christina haro: Is and it's got

81
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.680
Christina haro: A wire thing on the end.

82
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.450
Christina haro: Um, it's a little he it's big. It's big.

83
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: About the temperature. What's the temperature

84
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.320
Christina haro: Cool.

85
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

86
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. And now, see if you can notice a smell in the air.

87
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.920
Christina haro: I'm like a small coffee at this my waffles because I thought I had earlier, um,

88
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.040
Christina haro: I can actually smell the breeze for this great simple freeze earlier.

89
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What about how your T shirt to bring that one closer. Bring your shirt to you kind of see what's what's there.

90
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.050
Christina haro: About perfume.

91
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.010
Uh huh.

92
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.770
Christina haro: I can actually use about coffee. Maybe it's not on I feared, but it's not mocking

93
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, see if you're aware of a taste in your mouth.

94
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.330
Christina haro: Hockey

95
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:37.770
Christina haro: Actually

96
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:40.920
Christina haro: To face.

97
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit meant left in there, huh.

98
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. So now, open your eyes.

99
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you notice that your stress level went down your distress in the body from where you started.

100
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.910
Christina haro: Yes.

101
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.160
Christina haro: You forget a little calmer.

102
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Did you forget to sit there and think about your son. It took focus and that's why this this way I do it when you have to come up with as many as you can.

103
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's, it's, it's kind of like bent and angled and curvy and orange and blob and

104
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: melty and pink and blue and orange and leaf and hard and blended and lines and ridges and writing you just trying so hard to give as many as you can. It's that effort and concentration

105
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It can pull you out of the negative neural network. It's your mind is busy in yourself. That's, that's why that one so effective.

106
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can bring you back into your body. If you're noticing. Let's say you're starting to associate, meaning you're starting to go a little spaced out or unconscious

107
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a way to get back into the body, especially with with the tactile or you're feeling like this would have been a great one for feeling to, you know, there's lots of little bumps on it.

108
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, let's say they're going to a job interview, they're nervous about they might put something that has a lot of feeling in it and they might keep it in their pocket.

109
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of focus on that to pull their mind away from the what ifs in their head.

110
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So nice review a really, really handy.

111
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Regulations regulation technique and of course you're doing the

112
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: belly breathing inhaling for four seconds into the lower abdomen and holding in the next hailing for four seconds and holding it out and then inhaling into the lower belly for four seconds. That's the one you're doing or you kind of adapted your own

113
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.600
Christina haro: So that's the one I'm doing

114
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Cool. Excellent. Okay, so let me just see this one was just learning it then you've got accomplish that goal, which I think you have, I think we can close this.

115
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Chief

116
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:43.980
27

117
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

118
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one we have y'all.

119
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want a job. I know that's not an easy thing wasn't easy before it ain't easy now.

120
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.830
Christina haro: Oh, no.

121
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I, it doesn't mean that you aren't still thinking about is still doing something around it. So it's this is your goal, not mine. Remember, so pressure for me. But let me write a little statement about that goal. And let's just sort of market and time. What do you want me to write all

122
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:36.990
Christina haro: Well, I'm still looking so hopefully here in a couple of weeks when everything opens up and you know, start opening up slowly. I can, you know, find something

123
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was something, is it really just sort of

124
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That in working at a hotel is kind of dissolved at this point. Yeah. Okay. All right. When everything opens up hopefully I can find something. Yeah.

125
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

126
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to be

127
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then spirituality. You know, when you think about spirituality. As you identify it.

128
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you maybe give me an example of when maybe spirituality has been available to support in some way or has helped you cope in your recovery.

129
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:51.690
Christina haro: Up before this happened. I had gone to church, a couple of times I had started slowly connecting back to my church, but then everything closed. So really what I've been doing is just watching it, you know, on TV since they run it on TV. And then, um, you know, I just

130
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:59.100
Christina haro: Yeah, getting back to my prayers and reading the Bible, a little bit actually.

131
00:13:59.610 --> 00:13:59.970
Okay.

132
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, that's in general. Has there been a time when you've actually gone to that when you were having thoughts of distress.

133
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:28.050
Christina haro: Um, yes. In fact, like a couple weeks when, um, I just had to kind of isolate myself. I'm in my room. I had a lot of things going on, especially with my son. So I just went in there and prayed.

134
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:42.480
Christina haro: Yeah. What it's just been a big thing. It's been a little bit of everything lately with me. Um, I sent had a really good friend that actually just lived on the street and

135
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.420
Christina haro: got arrested for triple murder.

136
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.070
Christina haro: And, you know, the kid was actually the kid was always here in my house.

137
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:01.740
Christina haro: So it was kind of painful and I had just seen him like two days before that, because I've given him a birthday party with some money.

138
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:12.990
Christina haro: And I told him. Happy birthday, and then like three days later he was arrested for murder. So that kind of hurt me. I did a lot of crying and praying and

139
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.420
Christina haro: Yeah.

140
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: He's that kind of the same period, because I was watching you.

141
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Withdraw from bright heart a little too. And I know you're telling me this and this. But usually I can see it. I can see when people are pulling back

142
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why is it because he didn't want to share those things you didn't have it all kind of figured out or or maybe

143
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It was

144
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:51.330
Christina haro: Just a little bit of everything. It's like, is it was just like one thing after the other. It was like just so much. I was like, you know, no. You know, it was just

145
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.830
Christina haro: I don't know.

146
00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I do notice and I invite you, there's there's quite a few of you. In fact, most that thinks that they have to show up with particular way in group you work really hard to be sunny and you share your beautiful smile with us, which you truly don't have to do that.

147
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I know show up as a taker where you take, take, and say, I need a FM minute I need a minute I am overwhelmed. This is too much. I'm glad I'm showing up here, all you know that

148
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're going to feel like you're suffering alone in that room isolating it's next level misery Christina.

149
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to be a part of that support for you.

150
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is just show up and then the momentum of being there. You just, you just let it flow like maybe it's 10 minutes in or half hour in are almost right at the end and

151
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you might say, you know, I haven't wanted to share. But now I do and just having a really rough time and maybe that's all you share maybe you just say I need to pass today, but that's okay.

152
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It just does something to us when we think we have to do this alone.

153
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And I mean, right now it's just, we've got to use the resources we have to talk and at least show our faces and feel known

154
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: She's terribly sorry that's heartbreaking.

155
00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:03.270
Christina haro: You know, the sad thing is that this kid didn't even kill anybody. Yes, he was there. And yes, that day that all that happened. He

156
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:09.750
Christina haro: Actually came over here is, you know, scared, but didn't tell me what was going on. I wish I would have known.

157
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:26.070
Christina haro: I would have taken them straight to the police department so he could leave, you know, but instead of doing that, he decided to leave from here in Ohio, and they found it interesting for murder because he was scared they're gonna kill him.

158
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.210
Yeah.

159
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Christina.

160
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell you're feeling the fear of that young man.

161
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And just all that he has ahead of him.

162
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's it's his to face.

163
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back. Go.

164
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to you. Okay, come back to you.

165
00:18:51.390 --> 00:19:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of turn your attention to the things that you want to be today, you know, the kind of woman, you want to be how you want to feel today.

166
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You touched into compassion and empathy deeply just now.

167
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The sorrow of wrongful accusation.

168
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But something you know very well.

169
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: He's definitely given me the chills, just to, to think about that. And there are a lot of those those folks in this program where they've been incarcerated and it wasn't anything they did.

170
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a pretty broken so

171
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to share more about the other things going on.

172
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.360
Christina haro: Well, then my granddad died.

173
00:19:52.470 --> 00:20:03.720
Christina haro: I have been friends with this man three years and you know I was friends actually with him and his wife and, you know, they always opened up their home to me. And then she died.

174
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.560
Christina haro: Three years ago, and I hope to take care over and then he

175
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.100
Christina haro: He had called me.

176
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:29.850
Christina haro: And I told him I would go see him and i didn't i didn't i didn't go I Tomoko. See you tomorrow. And I didn't go then next morning. I'm a friend of his, called me and told me that it's not over there.

177
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:41.160
Christina haro: And he was thrown on the floor and I just he had had a he had a heart attack, basically. So then they took him to the hospital. Of course, I couldn't see him and

178
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:49.290
Christina haro: They let him out, but he had a bad heart. He died at home. So I never even got to go see him.

179
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not part of why that hurt so badly.

180
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:54.930
Because

181
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know those things do we, we don't know.

182
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna miss most about him.

183
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.210
Christina haro: Showing me about football.

184
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:37.440
Christina haro: Football. Football, but when I go over there. We are always watching football and told me what this year, he says, if there's a, you know, the football starts, you know, God willing, if everything goes back to normal. He says in you will be sitting here watching football.

185
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.490
Christina haro: And he started telling me a lot about football. So, yeah.

186
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so now that's with you, you have someone that's really kind of touched you. And when that season comes back and we're all sort of settling back into our normal again. You can remember him there.

187
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.950
Yeah.

188
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: you're grieving a lot. It's just so much to grieve all at once.

189
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There any other mixture of feelings like maybe with what's going on with your son. Is there a mixture of feelings with him.

190
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.260
Christina haro: Well, um,

191
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:28.860
Christina haro: Yeah, I was pretty upset with him when all this happened because you know i know he didn't hang around with that group people that I knew you know

192
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:38.250
Christina haro: His friend had, you know, other sets of friends to hang around with. So, you know, but you know, I was kind of so my son because

193
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:55.920
Christina haro: I tell them. So, you know, what are you doing out there. I told her you know you could have been you. And he says, no money. So you don't understand. He says those people that he was with were part of my friends, he says, he says, I don't even really know those people

194
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.450
Christina haro: So I was pretty upset with him. You know, I

195
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:08.040
Christina haro: Worry I worry know that that adds to my you know List of worries with him because

196
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like he's honoring that and he's coming home.

197
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.900
Christina haro: at a reasonable hour no more.

198
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.110
Christina haro: Yeah, he's been home where he hasn't really gone anywhere so

199
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.110
Christina haro: Some, yeah.

200
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Did that turn into an event where there was arguing yelling any of that.

201
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:41.700
Christina haro: No, no, actually we had. We know we had a couple of good talks, nice and quiet. You know, we sat down and talked and

202
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.660
Christina haro: You know, he agreed with me that

203
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.500
Christina haro: You know,

204
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:57.450
Christina haro: That I had a reason to worry, not because he gave me reasons but because, you know, me being a mom, you know, he told me he's I understand where you're coming from. He says, but

205
00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:06.390
Christina haro: He says the people that he was hanging around with me. So I didn't even know them. He says, so whatever he did. He says, I don't even know.

206
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.330
When he had

207
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.220
Christina haro: When

208
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: He does go out. What we're really going on.

209
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.210
Christina haro: Here. Yeah. Yeah, as a best friend that

210
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:28.200
Christina haro: He usually hangs around with but you know this kid was our neighbor, you know, as a kid. They went to school with, you know, as a kid I started regularly that would stop by.

211
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.620
Christina haro: That was the hard part about it. Yeah.

212
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You Have you had a chance to talk to his family.

213
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:47.340
Christina haro: No, I haven't. But he went over there and he talked to them. Yeah, he told them what happened. He told them that you know his friend.

214
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:58.290
Christina haro: Came over here that that next day I told him what happened and told it just told him you know that they're getting him a really good lawyer, but there were using all his college fun

215
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:06.720
Christina haro: We had a really good college fun for him to the supposedly this kid was a had an IQ of a genius is a really smart kid.

216
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.470
Yeah.

217
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.960
Christina haro: So they had a setup. All done. Let me get a Kleenex

218
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:30.990
Christina haro: So they had him a really good college fund, because the dad had won a lawsuit and set up set him up a really good college fund if he was the oldest of the kids so he he taught my son, I'm

219
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:44.520
Christina haro: I used to call it fun and gotten my really good lawyers. So, you know, this is the way it looks. Now he says he's not looking to do more than they dropped the murder charges and got him on conspiracy

220
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:57.990
Christina haro: Okay, so it looks like a might be able to get it down to 10 years instead of, you know, doing life or anything else but still you know 10 years

221
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.530
Christina haro: Little boy just turned 18 I

222
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.820
Christina haro: Know that's hard.

223
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I hope there's an even better outcome.

224
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:10.080
Christina haro: Oh,

225
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've noticed that that

226
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:14.880
Christina haro: You

227
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Know we lose inventions, we lose you know our civilization moving forward. I think they're all incarcerated.

228
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we're we're missing out on some really great minds and it looks like so much of it is just opportunity and particular neighborhoods. It's just there's just no opportunity, you know, and then you end up getting pulled into a gang life that once you're in there.

229
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for people to get out. It's hard to see.

230
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I kind of what his story was

231
00:26:53.820 --> 00:27:00.480
Christina haro: Yeah. And then my son tells me you know as smart as this kid was he says, Why does my friend was

232
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:16.890
Christina haro: Seeing you at all. He says he was doing everybody's taxes and stuff. He was that he was just a very smart guy. He says he had no common sense. It says, I always told him. What are you doing, you know, local you're hanging around with it says he had no common sense whatsoever.

233
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, different parts of the brain. He's got good good left brain nice storage of knowledge, but the emotional processing and that frontal frontal lobe.

234
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the part that your son's brain isn't done grow and either. So that's why when when you're please be home at this time, keep it up because that part won't come online for years, still

235
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it was 18 but it's not

236
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.610
Christina haro: I know

237
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's keep keep going here. I made a little note about this piece I want to feel normal and work and not dependent on drugs.

238
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've been faced with a lot of adversity. Have there been times when you've either taken a short acting pill maybe drank or taken more medication and is prescribed

239
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:10.890
Christina haro: Know,

240
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at you.

241
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.910
Christina haro: I just basically just

242
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:24.720
Christina haro: I just locked myself in my room and you know put on, I put on the, you know what I did I put on sad movies. So I could cry.

243
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know, right.

244
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:45.510
Christina haro: I know I felt like I couldn't cry or for a while because I was by myself. I don't know. So I decided to put out those side, you know, movies or something where I could cry and let it out and then I tested and I talked to my mom and I said, you

245
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

246
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.550
Christina haro: We were here.

247
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.540
Christina haro: You know,

248
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.650
Christina haro: This is hard, you know,

249
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.660
Christina haro: I just sat there for a little bit. I talked to my mom and I talked to

250
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.310
Christina haro: Describe. You know, I just

251
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:21.360
Christina haro: For a few days and then after a while. I started feeling better. You know, I started looking at it this way. Oh, my friend. What he was sick, sick from his heart and a lot of other stuff, you know,

252
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:37.680
Christina haro: Wasn't suffering anymore because he's always tired, he couldn't walk around and I I told myself, you know, he's in a better place. And I felt better about that one. But then I started thinking about, you know, our little friend and you know my son's friends and they said, well,

253
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:49.710
Christina haro: You know, hopefully that will help him and he won't be in there that long. You know, you might still, you know, have time to do something with himself. You know, he gets out early.

254
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.260
Christina haro: Look at the bright side on both on both ends.

255
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.290
Christina haro: That made me feel better, you know,

256
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:08.460
Christina haro: And then I you know I thought about my assessment and I kept thinking, well, you know, maybe, maybe this was the, you know,

257
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:21.690
Christina haro: A way for God to to you know put him somewhere at least he's you know he's not out here on the streets and, you know, maybe it was for the best. You won't get killed up there in the streets, you know, hopefully he's okay and do

258
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:24.420
Christina haro: As possible.

259
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.490
Christina haro: He was hanging around with some really bad people Mason said so.

260
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm looking at your we were talking about how you managed to cope through and it does sound. Yeah, what you did is instead of

261
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Escaping you actually met those feelings head on, you gave yourself a chance to actually cry and those sad movies are a great way to get those going

262
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking in the prescription. I don't know. I don't quite understand why do you have your, your bottle. Your by of sub

263
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.960
Christina haro: Yeah. Well, good.

264
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it.

265
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.420
Christina haro: Give me a second.

266
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.470
Christina haro: Okay.

267
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.020
Christina haro: What were you looking at

268
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So I didn't understand the

269
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The dose.

270
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it read what's the dosage on the bottle.

271
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.580
Christina haro: And I grabbed the wrong one. We're in April. Right.

272
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, bartered on Friday. Oh.

273
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he did two of them. That's confusing.

274
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Into orders.

275
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:02.940
Christina haro: Or

276
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, which is there should be one dated for 24 and I don't know if you picked up.

277
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

278
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.910
Christina haro: Yeah, I picked up the 424

279
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Which on eubank

280
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.260
Christina haro: No. Okay. Oh.

281
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay, yeah. So that's what's confusing.

282
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll look into this

283
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.300
Christina haro: Kind of check it out and send it to another pharmacy.

284
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna I'm addressing the doc here.

285
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: gotta write him.

286
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:46.680
Christina haro: Yeah, see, I picked up the one that says, For 24 you see that

287
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

288
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.570
Christina haro: And he only gave me five or

289
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the milligrams

290
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.360
Christina haro: Of to one day.

291
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:06.030
Christina haro: So he gave me five of those for just two days until I see you with us today.

292
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.510
Okay.

293
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be right back. I gotta go walk outside

294
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.970
Christina haro: That's fine.

295
00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see.

296
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.690
Christina haro: Yeah. Cuz remember he he put it.

297
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.380
Christina haro: In he wasn't going to prescribe me any until I saw you today. So he just gave me for two days.

298
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See

299
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm acting notes.

300
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.980
Christina haro: Yeah. So you're telling me that I did the right thing with

301
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.170
Christina haro: myself cry.

302
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

303
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.450
Christina haro: I did a lot of crying. Yeah, I finally let it out.

304
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you mentioned also that you went and you did do a letter to your mother and that felt like it had a meaningful impact.

305
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.280
Christina haro: Yeah.

306
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:12.750
Christina haro: I

307
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:30.870
Christina haro: I actually wrote a letter to my mom and then I actually went to my room and read it to my mom, I read it to her I you know I just sat there and I figured I'd read it to her and then I

308
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.970
Christina haro: I burned it

309
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:38.430
Christina haro: Yeah, I was. I was gonna, I was gonna let it off in the balloon.

310
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:51.450
Christina haro: But then I said, I felt kind of weird because you know if it lands like to my neighbors or something. And I don't know, I just didn't want them to think I was a cuckoo or something, you know, I said no offering it, it's good.

311
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was that like to go through that sort of ceremony.

312
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.380
Christina haro: It felt like

313
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.210
Christina haro: It felt like I was

314
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.800
Christina haro: Like I was

315
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.690
Christina haro: I don't know how to explain it. I

316
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.740
Christina haro: I kind of felt like I was talking to her, and I was telling her goodbye.

317
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.710
Christina haro: That's what I thought.

318
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.530
Christina haro: I don't know if I like, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it to you. But that's how it felt.

319
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like I missed it somehow.

320
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.610
Christina haro: To it out.

321
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.510
Yeah.

322
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what those letters can be useful for

323
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Us.

324
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't sound like there was. Will you tell me. Was there a mixture of the anger leftover or does that seem like

325
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're kind of working that through here with me and we'll

326
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:00.570
Awesome.

327
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.850
Christina haro: Yeah, I think.

328
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:16.260
Christina haro: I think that the more I thought about it, the better. I feel because I've really never talked to anybody about this stuff other than my kids. They know some about it but not too much.

329
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And which brings us to this last goal here which is I want to be happy and not bring baggage. I think that's what you're talking about is is bring that baggage into the relationships.

330
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Like with your son, and with your daughters.

331
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you share a little about maybe your concerns.

332
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.730
Me media people

333
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:55.200
Christina haro: Yeah, a lot of that stuff that I tell you about baggage is not so much. I think it does have a lot to do with my mom.

334
00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:08.670
Christina haro: In a way, because I connected to. I told you my first has been used to abuse me a lot. He was very abusive and, you know, I kind of blame my mom for it.

335
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:18.750
Christina haro: Because I don't blame her for the situation. I got myself into. But I was only 18 years old when I met this mess.

336
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:42.240
Christina haro: And yet, when I tried to go home and you know I don't know if my daughter came home or beat up. I think I would probably be very upset. I would probably kill somebody if they hurt my kids like that, but my mom, instead of being angry.

337
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.940
Christina haro: She invited him over for dinner.

338
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

339
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need to hear how how totally inappropriate that is

340
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That that was a failure on your mom's part that wish you'd have done has been enraged called the police and never let you see him again.

341
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly protected you

342
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.170
Christina haro: Do it. She invited him over for dinner, not just once a few times.

343
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So confusing for

344
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:25.770
Christina haro: A living sitting there, sitting there quiet evening, you know, no beat up a little

345
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.050
Christina haro: Bit you

346
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's unacceptable.

347
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the park. Christina I worry that you haven't given yourself a chance to be mad about

348
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one I worry

349
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that message that gets sent to you that this is this is how you get love this you compromise what you believe in. And what is right for you.

350
00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you knew you knew that was wrong and you needed your mom to tell you this is wrong.

351
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.430
Christina haro: So that's the bad good don't talk about, you know,

352
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're connected, it's not

353
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Your

354
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

355
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So that letter you wrote was it just

356
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweetness and gratitude or did you let out some of the resentment.

357
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:36.300
Christina haro: I know it wasn't sweetness and it was, you know,

358
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:38.910
Christina haro: It was

359
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:51.630
Christina haro: Like me configure a calendar. Why did you do this. Why did you do that, you know, I never understood why you did that, you know, why did that to me.

360
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.090
Christina haro: It wasn't a sweet letter.

361
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of me kind of pleased you know you got a chance to

362
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Set it straight, not your job to punish or forgive right that's

363
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's God's job.

364
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you not holding on to that anger, so that it doesn't stay in that sort of toxic space.

365
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like you still live in some people that are abusive in some way.

366
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:48.060
Christina haro: No, actually, you know, that's one of the reasons I don't day to make don't I just kept I kept

367
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.070
Christina haro: I

368
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:58.770
Christina haro: I feel like if I do, they are going to ruin the relationship because I can't

369
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:10.380
Christina haro: I don't know, there's just, I get scared I get scared I get scared that if I date and I do meet somebody and if

370
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:26.490
Christina haro: Something happens like I don't know I guess our first problem or our first discussion. I'm going to, you know, I'm scared. I'm going to explode and I'm going to lay everything out, you know, I'm an anchor on the other person.

371
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not worried

372
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that was a really honest disclosure. Thank you for saying that out loud because I have wondered, because right it's this composed you present so composed, but it has a charge to it.

373
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having been able to sort of

374
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Protect the self when you were 18 and all those years, and as a kid with your mom, I mean me to

375
00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I think that is important, that one piece of it was putting it in writing to your mom but i think i think addressing

376
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The anger, letting some of that charge go i think that that might be a useful thing to do. And I think we will be able to pull that off in the work we're doing

377
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I just really invite you to

378
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how to say it's like I don't ever see the anger in your app fact it's in your face. I see.

379
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweet. I see sorrow.

380
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A little anxious, but I won't ever see

381
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't ever see any of the anchor. Do you know it's okay that anger is an important emotion.

382
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:59.580
Christina haro: So my daughter tells me she says, Mom, how could just this outcome with things happen. You can cry and you go out

383
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:24.120
Christina haro: You don't get angry. You don't get angry at things you should get angry at this is if I was you. I'd be angry and I tell her I don't know. I told her I just thought I. That's how I grew up. Maybe that's how I ended up. I think I feel myself from a lot of things by just smiling.

384
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah well you can keep doing it. No, I'm not going to invite you to get rid of anything until we put other stuff in place. Okay, you can keep that smile appalling you want or as little as you want.

385
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to feel like you don't have that protective armor. Okay. But there's some real vitality in what anchor does right. It exists to protect you.

386
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And the answers are easily found in psychology to say if you'd gotten angry with your mother, you might have been

387
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hurt bad worse. So it was smart, and it was intuitive and it was instinctual. And it was adaptive

388
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're not saying get rid of the skill of adaptation and smiling, what we're suggesting is that you balance it out with some of those other emotions to

389
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That anger. That's almost turned inward. Like, that's what that looks like. That's kind of what depression is it's, you know,

390
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of anger turned towards and against itself.

391
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can get pretty bad and pretty dark

392
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So one piece was this this journaling or this letter that you wrote

393
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we try a little bit in here.

394
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A little expression of some some anger. I promise I won't tell anybody going to tell you your daughters, but why don't you just just squeak out a little one.

395
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What you might might be angry about something you might resent I promise I'm not gonna say anything, but I'm just going to validate it.

396
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.110
Christina haro: So something I'd be angry about in the past or the present.

397
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, it just doesn't matter any which one that came to mind truly

398
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.350
Christina haro: Angry at my dad.

399
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.860
Christina haro: Very good.

400
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.560
Christina haro: He never did. He did it set up for me. Yeah.

401
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:15.060
Christina haro: It was worth. He was more scared of my ball by anything. I don't know, but

402
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:18.810
Christina haro: You know, I always

403
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.490
Christina haro: I said this.

404
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:29.370
Christina haro: Think about my dad in a telling God. What the hell is wrong with you. Why did you say so you go

405
00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:31.530
Christina haro: You go

406
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.680
Christina haro: Ahead stick up for me.

407
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.480
Christina haro: No, he

408
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.730
Christina haro: Didn't tell you

409
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:48.000
Christina haro: This

410
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.730
Christina haro: I do, I do get angry, I get angry at my kids evil, I get upset you know

411
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:10.890
Christina haro: Just like I told my daughter. The other day because her mother daughter don't get along. I told her this is my down house. And if you don't like it, just don't come. It's that simple. You don't have to be here.

412
00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:29.070
Christina haro: You don't have to come in here. You know, I told her you know this simple until I had four kids. I said login for kids. And I'm going to take care of. I said, I have to be there for all of you guys. I said, I just can't pick one and and support one and support the others.

413
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:49.170
Christina haro: You know I do. I do get angry, I get angry know there's times I probably get too angry and I catch myself but you know I'm not out of time. I kept myself getting angry, but I don't get to the abusive and, you know, raising my voice to me is angry.

414
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:51.780
Okay.

415
00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:06.180
Christina haro: I've never, you know, I've always told my kids. If you ever see me getting ugly and abusive, like, you know, you've seen before, like my mom is stuff. I said, then I want you to tell me, but

416
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:15.450
Christina haro: I don't need been angry is raising my voice or slamming the door. You know what I mean.

417
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.110
Christina haro: There's never been an ugly side to me. I don't think

418
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.450
Christina haro: But angry yeah I

419
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:32.910
Christina haro: I've heard with my mom and I'm angry at my dad because you know he didn't stand up for me.

420
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:35.700
Christina haro: You know,

421
00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.630
Christina haro: He would tell me, is your mom's crazy your one screen on this.

422
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:47.280
Christina haro: Go.

423
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Not enough. That's not enough.

424
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.600
Christina haro: It wasn't even

425
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:52.410
Know,

426
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is

427
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That your dad probably grew up in a similar environment. My guess is that he had a family upbringing. That was similar. And then he his ability to tolerate that kind of behavior was familiar to him and it got passed down to another generation onto your generation.

428
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's stopping with you.

429
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

430
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.560
Christina haro: And I tell you

431
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.380
Christina haro: You know I never

432
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:39.780
Christina haro: hardly expect my kids say a spanking you know know

433
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:41.850
Christina haro: As always,

434
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:48.900
Christina haro: You know, my kids to tell you if they could tell you the topic to talk to you. They tell you

435
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.200
Christina haro: As a very chill mother.

436
00:51:53.400 --> 00:52:03.540
Christina haro: You know, but then again you know I did discipline and they knew it. You know I discipline, but not in an abusive right now. We told myself I was never going to be like that.

437
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:17.580
Christina haro: And maybe that's one of the reasons I walk around with a smile on my face because I don't want them to see that side of me know or I don't want anybody to see that, you know,

438
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.500
Christina haro: Angry cited me maybe, I don't know, but

439
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we, what if we looked at at anchor a little differently. You know, that's

440
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your, what's your mother did was was abuse. Right. That was emotional and physical abuse anger. You want it to.

441
00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To represent what what precious thing it's protecting me needed in order to protect right the precious inside of us. So in other words,

442
00:52:51.600 --> 00:53:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know if dad represents like this sort of failure to protect you. Your mother failed to but this failure to protect you know actually what dad needed was some anger.

443
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To protect you. And so you're absorbing sort of that same modeling inside yourself.

444
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know psychology has this interest psychic ego states, you know, and so it's it's almost as if you've absorbed that passive Father also. And what's needed is not rage what's needed is firm.

445
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And consistency. We're not saying that anger is this ugliness anger is it, it means it's showing up to protect

446
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't think in and of itself, it's a bad thing.

447
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you mentioned one time.

448
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: On that one of your daughters.

449
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You had wondered if you're chill parenting contributed to maybe her sort of

450
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

451
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, I don't know how you worded it

452
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That Kareena maybe

453
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: More something more or something.

454
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But less of the chill. I can't remember how you

455
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.420
Rap

456
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.700
Christina haro: And then you know i i look at her and, you know,

457
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:41.220
Christina haro: Just living with her dad and her dad is the the abusive husband. The one I told you about. And, you know, she

458
00:54:42.570 --> 00:55:02.070
Christina haro: I don't know. I didn't really grow up with him. So they she started having a relationship with have probably when she was probably Gavin 12 more hurt than my son, and it's weird because she you know she pulled towards him, and she wanted her death so

459
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:10.200
Christina haro: You know it through the years. She ran back to that run back to that ran back to that and you know he

460
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:16.680
Christina haro: I don't know he he is not how to tell you

461
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.760
Christina haro: He's not all in his right tenses.

462
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:31.950
Christina haro: Yeah, so he's got a new wife and stuff and you know her step mom to teach me and her, you know, I know her. We talked and everything on the phone, we get along great. And

463
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:43.590
Christina haro: She's just, I don't know, to, to me, she was. She's over there. She's like a little girl with her daddy.

464
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember she said it's manipulative. It's unfortunate.

465
00:55:50.100 --> 00:56:04.020
Christina haro: She's coming back and she she she's already telling me you know I hate being over here. You know, I can't stand there, I want to come home and and it's just it's just all over again.

466
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:10.050
Christina haro: So she's doing every two years. She does the same little thing, this will come over here until

467
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.770
So I'd say around

468
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill that might be needed with her might be

469
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Really distinguishing how she's saying things to really holding her accountable to the content of what she's saying. So there's a process. There's our tone.

470
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: There is that style of communication. That's all in this category of process meaning body language tone, how we phrase a sentence. And then there's content. And so it's just

471
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well Kareena. I wonder what she'll do with that.

472
00:56:48.810 --> 00:57:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what your normal way I think typically is to take it on as if it's your problem to solve. Finding a way we'll get there if you want to go that route is to turn it around just Kareena. It sounds like you've got some challenges and living here and wonder how you'll solve it.

473
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's not normally your style. Right. You would take it on and feel what she's feeling and feel like the maybe some mixture of sadness and resentment, maybe like it's not my problem. But really, not knowing what to do with it but truly, it is for them to work out.

474
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can say it. You can put, put it on the shoulders and where they belong, not on your shoulders, but on hers. That would be challenging. Let me know how I can help.

475
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Great Kareena like I know it's a challenge coming out here. It sounds like you're you're already started struggling with it and let me know how I can help. So

476
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just take a minute and

477
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment.

478
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.730
Christina haro: I thought we had to do separate Masons.

479
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We do at 7am we got it. Yep. May six 7am

480
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:06.510

Gwenevere Abriel: Next client just came in, I, I'm really glad you're I'm glad you showed up today.

482
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. You want to name sort of unpack a couple of things. And let's keep

483
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It let's keep it going. Maybe by next time right on the second. Let's see if we can maybe do some some processing up maybe one of those pieces, whether it's around

484
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: With dad maybe maybe it'll be around. Dad, something like that or or your x. Let's pick a target. And let's see if we can. Let's do some end our processing with it.

485
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to send a message, right, that you were here to dr off okay so

486
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Christina.
