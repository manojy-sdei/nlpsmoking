Christina Haro: I don't know, I just

19
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.350
Christina Haro: I just kind of

20
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:15.600
Christina Haro: I stressed. I think I stressed for a couple of days. And then I said, Okay, you know, it's just one of the things I have to deal with, you know, I went through stuff similar like that with my other kids, you know, little things along the way. But I'm okay. You know I I dealt with it. Okay.

21
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.900
Christina Haro: And you know my other kids tell me that I'm over protective and I tell him while he's the youngest he's the last one I have to put through the world. So I kind of, kind of,

22
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.050
Christina Haro: It's hard. I don't know. Maybe it's because he's the youngest I just dealing with it differently. And then I'm older. And I don't know.

23
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.900
Christina Haro: My stress levels higher

24
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's something unique about him, maybe something last sort of last born and

25
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.740
Christina Haro: And

26
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.050
Feeling protective

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to put your phone on Do Not Disturb if you want to, because then you're you won't have the buzzing going on. Do you know how to do that.

29
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.990
Christina Haro: Um, no, but give me a second. I'll do it all that in a sec. Just one thing

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's take a look at your notes. See where we left off.

35
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.570
Christina Haro: Oh, baby.

36
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.620
See, we talked about

37
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Around older daughter some discussion around your older daughter, you know, feeling sort of blocked around her and the relationship with hear her.

38
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.860
Yeah.

39
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like what I feel like maybe what she's going through is my fault. The meaning to you.

40
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that the worst sort of cognition. There was, I'm a bad mother and we had put that as a distress level of 50 I'm not angry or upset.

41
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I've gotten past that I'm just sort of worried. Right.

42
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.460
Yeah.

43
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel it in the center of the stomach fluttering feeling like I'm worried and anxious at the same time.

44
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.220
Okay.

45
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.190
And let's see what else did we do

46
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.660
These glasses to start working. Try these

47
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.020
Filthy

48
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.460
Christina Haro: Like me, I do the same thing. Healthy see

49
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.130
We do.

50
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we started. Yeah, we started to develop this anchor room. I'd like to continue that today.

51
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Um,

52
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But before we do this is real close to each other. They're sort of inner connection. Let's go back to

53
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you develop with me in group your protective image and figure your nurturing figure. You're wise figure

54
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.700
Christina Haro: Yes.

55
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't landing in this note. So let's see if we can track it down. Do you remember who you're protected figure was

56
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.410
Christina Haro: I think is that when I went back to my little self.

57
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.660
Christina Haro: I was the girl.

58
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably did it in

59
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, you can certainly do that. But this is a bit distinct. Let me tell you what it would be. And we can do it again right now. It doesn't take long. So do this now with me just sort of get in touch with either real or imagined.

60
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What's a protective image or figure

61
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That comes to mind.

62
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined.

63
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.750
Christina Haro: Does it have to be myself or is it like

64
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Be someone else it's, yeah.

65
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.380
Christina Haro: Yeah, to me, my protective bigger was always my dad.

66
00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. And what is it about dad that sort of brings to mind the really envision the protective nature and he really embodies protectiveness. What do you envision

67
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.310
Christina Haro: It was always real strong know he's, he's very strong hard working man that just

68
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:31.200
Christina Haro: He just in reality he protected me because he was the one that always said, you know, mom's crazy, you know, to stay away from her, don't talk about, you know, and those even time to hold are off of me. Yeah.

69
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So he literally protected you so that might be a great one right there. So you just can envision dad.

70
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then move to another figure a nurturing figure real or imagined what comes to mind.

71
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.560
Christina Haro: I know huh

72
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, go into fantasy, a little bit you sometimes people in when that piece was missing. They have to go a bit into the imagine they go into maybe they read a book and it was like, wow, that seems to embody nurturing and

73
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And and this ideal or maybe a movie or a TV character or you saw it in another family but you witnessed it and it looks like nurturing

74
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.800
Christina Haro: And could it be something that really happened to me.

75
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.870
Christina Haro: There was years ago, years ago when I was married

76
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:56.520
Christina Haro: To my first husband, he, he was the one that really a business. Yeah, but was one time just he would hit me for any little thing.

77
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:05.040
Christina Haro: But there was one time we were arguing and I knew he was going to hit me. And we're walking, we, we were actually walking down some stairs. Right.

78
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:25.470
Christina Haro: And he said something and I turned around to look at him and his fist is close to me and I i was like i stood still, because I figured if he hits me. I'm gonna fall down the stairs. All the sudden I am not kidding. This was the weirdest strangest thing. All of a sudden, this big fight bigger

79
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.930
Christina Haro: pushed him back.

80
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:37.530
Christina Haro: In that me didn't let him hit me. And at that point I thought I was imagining things. And I close my eyes because I got scared.

81
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:48.540
Christina Haro: And when I opened my eyes. He was standing there so fly in the face and he tells me boy, you're lucky he says, even though he says, even your guardian angel saves you

82
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.940
Christina Haro: Because we follow it to

83
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.060
Christina Haro: Whatever it was pushed him back and didn't let him hit me.

84
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Guardian Angel.

85
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.780
Christina Haro: Guardian Angel.

86
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Big white figure is there more to it. What do you, what do you see, is there any shape like where do you see

87
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:20.310
Christina Haro: No, it was like the shape of a person, it was, it was in shape of a person, but it was just the quite ghostly figure me didn't have been you couldn't

88
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:30.420
Christina Haro: I didn't feel him, but he felt it when it pushed him. And that's all I saw was this white thing that just appeared and disappeared. Okay, got it.

89
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's the one will use okay guardian will call it guardian angel does that work.

90
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.600
Yeah.

91
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you envision it, it'll be this big white ghostly figure

92
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. So we've got dad this embodiment of protector and nurturing is this guardian angel and

93
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Have there ever been times where because what sounded about this this guardian angel was also a protective behavior. Notice how he guardian angel. It's a man or no. Do you know

94
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.310
Christina Haro: A male figure. I thought it was a milk. Okay.

95
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll go with that. But did you notice that it also protected you, is it possible week maybe this protector is a bit like that figure with dad that it's also a protector and work a little bit more and seeing if we can cultivate

96
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of the definition of nurturing. Why don't you kind of define that for me.

97
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.560
Christina Haro: I'm nurturing

98
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:51.750
Christina Haro: Uh huh.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.600
Christina Haro: Just

100
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.870
Christina Haro: Inside, to me, is just something that

101
00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.850
Christina Haro: You know that

102
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.770
Christina Haro: To meet this is the way I see nurturing. To me, it's something that takes you in takes care of you. Um,

103
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.880
Christina Haro: I tell you, you know,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.220
Okay.

110
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So this if you just plug it in right to the internet. This is what they give you

111
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.260

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And walk alongside me stay right there with you.

145
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.990
Christina Haro: Yes.

146
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: At all times.

147
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.200
Christina Haro: All times.

148
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Alright, so we'll go with that. And now I want you to picture a wise.

149
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture of an image someone something real or imagined that is wise.

150
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:31.980
Christina Haro: So, this is this other figure would be somebody. Um, other than that one.

151
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have to be. But is that what's coming up for you as I, as I say it. What do you think enough

152
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.970
Christina Haro: I was picturing myself.

153
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.180
Christina Haro: Myself.

154
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, exactly as you are now or what are you picturing

155
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.160
Know,

156
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.010
Christina Haro: Somebody something

157
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.180
Some

158
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.910
Christina Haro: Somebody that's me, but a different me

159
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What is there that you don't have

160
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.480
Christina Haro: A do the other me would be somebody really, really smart.

161
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you know it to not be you. Sometimes we we contrast it with this and how do you know yourself to not be smart than you might be comparing somehow, what are you comparing it to

162
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:43.740
Christina Haro: To me, I'm comparing it to, if I could go back in time and this other person to just go back and take my place and do things differently.

163
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: They would have made smarter decisions. Is that what you're thinking.

164
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.740
Christina Haro: Yes.

165
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Would they have that you didn't have

166
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.750
Christina Haro: Um,

167
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.500
Christina Haro: This person would have more of an insight of maybe

168
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.660
Christina Haro: They knew more and maybe were

169
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:35.790
Christina Haro: They had more of an insight of what was going to happen, they more or less this other me. But go back in time and say, oh, no, this is going to happen. I have to make things differently.

170
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.970
Christina Haro: I have to change things, not so much smarts. It's more of maybe

171
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:55.500
Christina Haro: If I could send them back with the knowledge of all the things that were going to happen and they could go back and say, no, I can't do it like this, because this is going to happen, like they already know what's going to happen. Okay.

172
00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So if that does actually sound a lot like who you are today because you do know what you would have done differently. No, or do you do not see that

173
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.610
Christina Haro: I do I see that

174
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe the wise figure is you now as an adult, Christina. What if it is

175
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.650
Christina Haro: Um, maybe. Yeah.

176
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little bit of that.

177
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.370
Christina Haro: Yeah yeah

178
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a little bit of that. So this wise person has lived experience and knows. Now, I know I would do it differently, right. That's what wisdom is it's a lived experience of now I know

179
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can't get it until we learn it. You don't know it until we've learned it. Okay, and you know it. No one can take it from you. It's yours.

180
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's anything else that you can get in imagery

181
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Around wise figure

182
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:18.660
Christina Haro: Know, the only wise big Gracie was my dad you know my dad was my dad was a really smart man you know he

183
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.070
He

184
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:28.830
Christina Haro: He he he told it the way he saw it, you know, and he always always tried to

185
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:44.070
Christina Haro: Tell us, you know, he like he showed me how to change the oil in my car, how to change a tire. How to do all these things. And then he would tell me. Don't ever depend on the man because men are not going to do it for you. You need to learn to do it on your own.

186
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so part of this wise is independence.

187
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.690
Christina Haro: Yes. Okay. And are you independent. Yes. Okay.

188
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you get a combination of this

189
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Encouragement

190
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And parenting.

191
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And teaching from him where he's teaching you how to do the things of the world, how to solve problems and

192
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And be independent, a new you notice in yourself insight and independence.

193
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And that wisdom is that's where it feels the most salient is it's in the self and in dad is that right

194
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.170
Christina Haro: Yes. Okay.

195
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what water.

196
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's continue with

197
00:23:47.370 --> 00:24:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, you know, holding those let's not forget this embodiment of protector figure in it. This is actually seems almost like a combination of basically your dad your guardian angel and you today with this wisdom.

198
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that about right.

199
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just sort of sit with that for a moment just really be present with it. And just imagine it as a team, you know, your support team.

200
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of picture them all getting along, or that it's just maybe this one figure somehow I'm not sure how it comes up for you, but just be present with it until it really settled in

201
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it all feel just right in true

202
00:24:53.730 --> 00:25:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, beautiful can stay there with your eyes closed, and I'd like to review the anchor room that you started to develop and see if we can complete the exercise. It may take more than one session or two or three takes as long as it takes. There's no rush.

203
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We get it just right is really the goal.

204
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to kind of bring back that imagery of

205
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This assessment of yourself of

206
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: A bad mother, you had thought

207
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And you added a room on

208
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: As you went into deep thought and got more comfortable and

209
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: In this age of this little girl, page five comes up and

210
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It starts as this big room.

211
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My sister's there.

212
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's pictures of us all.

213
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Memories no windows plain white walls. It's bright

214
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure where it's coming from.

215
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't see it ceiling.

216
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You saw different sofas

217
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It was similar to one your mom had it was big brown leather sofa.

218
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know there. One is an older sofa kind of soft plaid looking blue colors and white.

219
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a big rug.

220
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: maroon color in the middle, I noticed no windows.

221
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice they're talking and drinking coffee all seated are facing faces are happy.

222
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were feeling good.

223
00:26:54.570 --> 00:27:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice the temperature of the room was warm was just right like from the fireplace.

224
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Next to the big brown sofa.

225
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You noticed

226
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: With your hands. Perhaps the cool leather.

227
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice one leg bent underneath your body

228
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The smell of firewood and coffee.

229
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're aware of the case to the cookies and coffee.

230
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And then looking around the room, you could see the door.

231
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Was would

232
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a window on it. Just no no color just regular goal round handle a turn lock on the handle.

233
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The door was open all the way

234
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You could see outside the door outdoors, could see the grass and trees and chickens.

235
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.670
And the feeling was happiness.

236
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And in checking in. There was nothing going on in the stomach.

237
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: There was nothing up to stress there.

238
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was cheerfulness before to

239
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a happy tears. Is that what they are now.

240
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.070
Christina Haro: Yes. Okay.

241
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the room changed at all.

242
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.260
No, no.

243
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So as we move into some of this misinformation. We have some new new support that all included in this process, which is your team your guardian.

244
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Angel, your dad.

245
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: yourself as a protective nurturing and wise.

246
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about

247
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.790
Christina Haro: Looking at my sister's

248
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

249
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And much like when we started, that's what was going on there was this just being present with them.

250
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I had invited

251
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, an exploration about what misinformation. This little five year old had to absorb in order to survive.

252
00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I invited that there be access to magic sometimes a little magic wand. That's nestled in a secret compartment somewhere in the room.

253
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can access

254
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You had difficulty identifying what was needed. But then you found it.

255
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We needed to be away from mom outside far away from the door as far away as we can get from her. She's down the street.

256
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: At the neighbors.

257
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We continue to be laughing and happy.

258
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You noticed your dad is now in the room.

259
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a good person.

260
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're drinking. He's drinking coffee and smoking and dad tells you

261
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Moms crazy and there's the nurturing and hugs you

262
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And sits

263
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You want as law and says, Don't listen to her just bouncing you on his knee.

264
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you become aware of what the misinformation was

265
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That you had to absorb in order to survive.

266
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was

267
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The lie.

268
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That you absorbed was that you

269
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Are good for nothing.

270
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Your adult

271
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The wise figure today.

272
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that's not true.

273
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay with that imagery and see if we can complete this exercise, and I want you to sort of tell me what's coming up for you.

274
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

275
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it

276
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: In this imagery

277
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That the little girl believes that she's good for nothing.

278
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.390
Christina Haro: I do, I do believe it.

279
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: As a little girl. It really is believed rain.

280
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you believe that lie.

281
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion. Do you feel

282
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like sad, is there more to it. Do you think

283
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.450
Christina Haro: Her sad, I'm

284
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.240
Christina Haro: I'm a curious.

285
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.200
Yeah.

286
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.660
Christina Haro: Curious

287
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the little girl want to know what she interested in when she wants to she curious about

288
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.410
Christina Haro: This little girl wants to know why.

289
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.540
Christina Haro: Why, my mom.

290
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, we're going to find the information we're going to get it.

406
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: disappointments out on you.

407
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.870
