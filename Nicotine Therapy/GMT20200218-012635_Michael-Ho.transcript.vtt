11
00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:08.610
G6: I was just on the internet, trying to find somebody who prescribe Suboxone try to get a same day appointment around here in my area. It's like next to impossible. Yeah. Okay, great. And

12
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.530
What is

13
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.680
What's bringing you into treatment or what's yeah what's motivating you to come into the treatment today.

14
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:36.330
G6: Well, I had, I had a bad accident and was on painkillers for like four years before workman's comp located a surgery. Okay. I was fine after the surgery and I stayed on the Suboxone but when I went to the Kaiser, they took me off of it.

15
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.680
G6: And just never was quite the same.

16
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.560
G6: I also was on

17
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.380
G6: I forget what they call it.

18
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.690
G6: Tell us the name of that.

19
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:09.690
G6: I don't remember some kind of it helped me sleep at night and cause a pan and but Kaiser doesn't prescribe any of that. I mean, you have to be totally wacko to get that one.

20
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:26.220
G6: So, you know, I just forgot about it and I was okay but then Things just got really rough different things and I you know what to compel here and there. And then next thing I know, I'm right back to where I started.

21
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:44.580
G6: And so, and it helps us depression. A little bit, yes. Yeah, a lot of it really does will find that, yeah. So what was just, you know, starting to get from the beginning. When was your accident that you had. And what was the accident. It was about eight years ago now.

22
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.360
G6: Was it a car or eight years ago. Oh, the accident. No, I fell in on a

23
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.020
G6: At work on what tile hit my head on a wrought iron fence to them back down again.

24
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.190
G6: And it caused a really huge disconnect laid on a nerve.

25
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.830
G6: Okay. And so, and I have a little nerve damage of my leg. But, you know,

26
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.640
G6: You can deal with that, you know, gotcha. It's just that sometimes you feel like I'm tired of being tired and hurting and

27
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.510
G6: When I have the Suboxone it just seems to make everything. Okay, gotcha. Okay.

28
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.290
Michael Hoefer: So, and before your accident. Have you ever used opiates before

29
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.380
G6: You ever been on Oprah. I don't even know what they were. Okay.

30
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.470
Michael Hoefer: Somebody who use heroin back in the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.780
G6: Said, oh my god, no. I say that a needle.

32
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.640
Michael Hoefer: And then after your accident, you're on probably oxy code on our hydrocodone or something for for

33
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.080
G6: They kept me on

34
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.940
G6: Norco was what it said on the bottle and

35
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.680
G6: And then they took that you know took that away and I was supposed to go to pain management and

36
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:10.980
G6: That's when I got to the one doctor who was prescribing me Suboxone Dr. Greenberg over in

37
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.790
G6: Libya in California, but

38
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.740
G6: When I came back from Kaiser, I couldn't get back in to see him.

39
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.570
G6: And how mom. Oh, that's too bad.

40
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.590
Michael Hoefer: How long were you

41
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:36.150
G6: And there's not that many doctors that have that. What do you call it that certification to prescribe it. Yeah, that's true.

42
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.150
Michael Hoefer: How long were you on Suboxone for at

43
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.010
G6: Least a year.

44
00:06:42.090 --> 00:07:00.060
G6: And I really would have to take it every day. You know, and I mean it wasn't even something I had to have every day, just once in a while where you get the NX and I'd take, you know, sometimes I didn't even break the film and half because I take an eight milligram film.

45
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:13.680
G6: Or they used to start out with pills actually and I break it in half and that was fine. And then when I went off of it. I was fine, you know, was like, I went with through withdrawals from that or anything.

46
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.390
G6: But

47
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:26.280
G6: Like I said, like an idiot. I had some problems. Towards the end of last year, and I took a pill here and there. And the next thing you know,

48
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:40.590
Michael Hoefer: And the pills you started. So, so the pills you started taking at the end of next year and sounds like in response to the stressors, you had in your life. Has it gotten to the point where you now have like a habit like you go into withdrawal. If you don't have bills to you.

Michael Hoefer: Know, have you ever injected any drugs in your life.

62
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.860
G6: Oh god, no. No. What

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.610
Michael Hoefer: What are the negative ways that that the opiates have affected your life do you feel like

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:11.040
G6: That well when you when you still addicted to it to where you want it in the morning, so that you feel okay and don't have that icky feeling, you know, you just don't do the things you should be doing, you know, I have a husband and

Michael Hoefer: You know, do you have you ever had any legal issues from the opiates. Have you ever had any physical or mental problems that came from your own plants you feel like you feel like it feeds into

78
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:32.250
G6: You know you don't take anything. I mean, he had his nose broken the hospital and took like three painkillers. The whole time I was like oh my god I would have went through the bottle.

79
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.430
G6: So it's just the way he years

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.960
G6: So for him, just said he was, you know, he's angry, but he was trying to be helpful.

81
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.130
Michael Hoefer: So him seeing you take, you know, any med it's concerning for him, especially like an opiate

82
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.860
G6: Yeah, he don't like it. Yeah. Gotcha.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:58.200
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever you know used any other substances in your life like cocaine or math or

84
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:12.180
G6: May. Okay. When I was in my 20s once in a while like once every third month I may have a line at a party that was back in the 80s.

85
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.670
G6: Cocaine, but no heroin, nothing like that.

86
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.170
G6: No matter what

87
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.760
G6: I am going on to the code part. It was like you got drunk and needed to come back up.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.550
G6: So yeah, even you out. Drink longer yeah I don't drink, though.

89
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.300

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.740
G6: I mean in 25 years I don't drink. Great.

91
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.680
Michael Hoefer: Did you ever have any concerns over your drinking

92
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:45.750
G6: Oh god, no. I was the type who would drink once a year and be hung over for a week and never touch it again for another year. Okay.

93
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.660
Michael Hoefer: How about marijuana use marijuana

94
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.850
G6: No. Okay, I have before in the past.

95
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.670
Michael Hoefer: But right now, you're not using

96
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:06.150
G6: Know marijuana or CBD or. Let's see. Oh CBD. I have to admit, my husband has a bottle of that oil for back pain.

97
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.700
G6: He's getting ready to have a shoulder surgery. So, um,

98
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:19.620
G6: Yeah, he has a bottle of that. But he bought it legally doesn't help. He loves him yeah he thinks it's great.

99
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:28.800
Michael Hoefer: Great. Yeah, there's a lot of people who said they find it helpful. Do you use a use tobacco it all smoke cigarettes or

100
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.380
G6: Do I smoke cigarettes. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. How much do you smoke.

101
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.200
G6: At least a half a pack a day.

102
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.890
Michael Hoefer: And how do you feel about your smoking.

103
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.650
G6: It's horrible, but I know I'm probably never going to stop. Okay.

104
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.200
Michael Hoefer: You said resigned to that.

105
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.900
G6: Yeah, I tried before. And let me tell you she's not very nice.

106
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.380
Michael Hoefer: She's laughing when she

107
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:10.110
G6: Turned into a total bitch, yes. And it's just something that makes me crazy and I kind of look at it like you know everybody's got advice. My husband goes out drink them and I don't know.

108
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:18.600
G6: How much longer, but he's got something. And that's the thing that yeah something another back that's mine when I can deal with

109
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.990
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever tried champix before

110
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:28.710
G6: You know what I did and it actually works very, very well except for like the first week or so.

111
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:37.440
G6: And then after that it starts giving me horrible nightmares any vivid vivid nightmares.

112
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:48.210
G6: Did you ever tried to name dose. Did you ever tried to take a loading dose and not an evening dose. No, no, no one who suggested it yeah that's sometimes works.

113
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:58.320
Michael Hoefer: For people because the vivid dreams is the common thing. And sometimes if you just lower the nighttime dose or just take the morning dose it they go away. Interestingly,

114
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:09.990
G6: I would try that again. Because like you said the first couple weeks I was on Chantix I realized it had been like four or five hours. I hadn't even thought about a cigarette, and that's a miracle for me.

115
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:18.540
G6: Yeah, it's a pretty amazing drug sorry drugs, it's, it's the, it's the one that by far works the best.

116
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:26.880
Michael Hoefer: And it has kind of a similar mechanism actually to Suboxone so it's a very similar medication just working on nicotine addiction as opposed to opiate

117
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.340
Michael Hoefer: So it's okay it's, it's, but that's up, you know, to discuss, we can discuss down the line, but um

118
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.410
G6: Yeah, don't get info to know

119
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.860
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever taken methadone before

120
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.380
G6: Or Naltrexone nothing like that. It really sounded like somebody who did heroin.

121
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.170
Michael Hoefer: Usually. Yeah.

122
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.230
Michael Hoefer: Classically, that is the case. Yeah.

123
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.430
G6: Yeah, I was like, well, we ain't get No, I've never touched

124
00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:04.500
G6: I don't know what makes me think I'm better just because they take a pill instead of something else. Yeah. A drugs or drug that's true. Have you

125
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:14.880
Michael Hoefer: And how about you know mental health issues. Do you feel like you know sounds like depression is something you struggle with. Can you tell me about you know what you like and how bad it gets

126
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:23.550
G6: It just gets bad. I have a very I've been married for 37 years and sorry

127
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.850
G6: To the doctor.

128
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:44.460
G6: Been married 37 years is very, very hard headed very controlling man, let me say he wants to control everything and his whole life, including me. Yeah. And he gets he drinks quite a bit.

129
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:53.160
G6: And I hate alcohol because my father was an alcoholic and I just don't want it in my life. Yeah. And that causes problems.

130
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.260
G6: Because he's an idiot. And he drinks and he drives

131
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.570
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever gotten a DUI.

132
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:15.120
G6: Nobody came close. He was handcuffed in the back of a cop car, and if it hadn't been for the then getting a bigger deal on the line, either been in jail. They called me to come pick them up. Gotcha. Course he split before I got there.

133
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.270
G6: Late for but I'm not

134
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.440
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, that's it's really hard when you've had a parent or or a family member that there's an alcoholic. It's really hard to be around.

135
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:45.150
G6: It isn't handle the stupidity, the talking. It's just like, shut up. Yeah, it does cause problems. Yeah, I'm having that kind of stress in relationship and I got a stressful situation with a son, and it's just

136
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.050
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

137
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.720
G6: What's interesting here is your son have

138
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.350
Michael Hoefer: Is your son struggling with substance use, or mental health.

139
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.510
G6: I think my son has a drinking problem.

140
00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.000
G6: He won't admit it, but I think he has a very severe so drinking problem again.

141
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.890
G6: But, you know, to have. It's all in my head.

142
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.690
G6: And for a person that because it gets so

143
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.530
Michael Hoefer: Bad that you ever feel hopeless or worthless or

144
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.060
G6: You know,

145
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.180
Michael Hoefer: Build a in bed or how bad is it good.

146
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:25.710
G6: Sometimes I feel like I don't want to get up because I'm tired of dealing with everybody else's problem. Yeah.

147
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:32.370
Michael Hoefer: It'd be easier if you could just stay in bed or be easier if you didn't wake up or be easier if not

148
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:40.260
G6: easier if I didn't wake up just easier if I just stayed in bed and had my little TV and watch my took care of my little animals.

149
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.180
G6: But

150
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:51.600
G6: I have to get up and I have to cook dinner and we have to clean the house and I have to take care of the yards and wash the cars and all that kind of stuff. You can't leave that

151
00:17:52.350 --> 00:18:06.090
G6: Have you ever felt suicidal before or have you ever had a suicide attempt. Oh, I've never thought of that. I'm kind of believe it or not, with my condition I am religious and I believe that the Lord, and I would never do that. Okay.

152
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.640
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever you know taking medications for depression or gone to therapy or been treated for depression.

153
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.610
G6: At the very beginning when they took me off of

154
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:26.100
G6: Pain medication. The doctor put me on antidepressants. It made it twice as worse. What did you take

155
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:43.890
G6: I have no idea. Now, it was so difficult, but whatever it was, it was like, I'm not touching this stuff ever again. It actually made the thoughts in your head just weird to where they weren't there before gotcha anime. So I don't want to touch him. Like I said, I had that

156
00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:03.690
G6: Closet pan, a kind of calmed me down and help me sleep because sleeping is not something that comes easy to me I lay there and toss and turn four hours before I fall asleep, and then I only stay asleep for a few hours wake, back up, back to bed wake back up, go back to bed.

157
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.020
G6: So, that was nice, but

158
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:15.780
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. So you only try you try the one and a depressant, and made things worse. And you, and you've stopped after that that

159
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:30.150
G6: Yeah, I guess I don't want to take any of this stuff anymore because you ever tried cycling. Did you ever try like counselor or psychotherapy or anything like that. No, no, I, I did go to a counselor for a little while, but I just

160
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.760
G6: Want to once we're talking. I'm surprised, she's talking to you like this. You have shot.

G6: Laid in there, my bedroom and prayed couldn't get back out of bed and finally

198
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:16.710
G6: I think it was Lord because my girlfriend gold and we'll figure what's wrong. She was I'm coming over. And I said, no, I can't talk.

199
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:32.280
G6: And she has been praying and then my pastor called and he said, Well, okay, if you won't let me come over and pray and then about a half hour later, I was unable to uncurled regionally. My kids out with Dan watch TV play with them.

200

G6: decided he was going to stay

204
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.070

212
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.320

Issue in your neck.

219
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:07.530
G6: Um, I don't really have any issues anymore. You know, I've been

220
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:21.630
G6: After I got off the pills and all that, when they did the surgery and got that thing off my nerve and replaced it. I started walking and know and things like that, trying to get the back stronger and

221
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:36.090
G6: Just doing things like that. So you take my belt you have that many problems anymore unless I overdo it. Gotcha. Do you take any medications at all. I take aspirin. You know, like Advil

222
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.130
G6: But nothing for like

223
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.520
G6: I'm not taking taking something heavy duty.

224
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.090

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.320
G6: I do have high cholesterol.

227
00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:01.530
G6: And, um, I was on medication and I, but I didn't take medication at first because I didn't want to. I don't know why.

228
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:11.430
G6: Take everything else. I don't know why they want to take that. But anyways, I didn't take it and I brought it down 100 points just from walking and eating and everything.

229
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:22.710
G6: And so I thought, well, if I could do it 100 points on my own. I can imagine what could happen if I took the medication. So I started taking the medication with the walking in the Everything but now I need to go have all my blood read done

230
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.190
