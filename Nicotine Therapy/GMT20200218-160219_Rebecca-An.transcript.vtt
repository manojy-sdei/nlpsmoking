Donna Jochimsen: But I'm but I personally am doing pretty well. I'm happy.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
Donna Jochimsen: I'm happy with up and the progress that I've made. And just a couple of short weeks.

8
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's amazing when you start becoming motivated to do something.

9
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.620
Donna Jochimsen: I just needed to put a few of the pieces together spell that we're holding the app and and I'm doing that.

10
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Good. Tell me how you'll be

11
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.960
Donna Jochimsen: Okay.

12
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.170
Donna Jochimsen: Well, it was pretty crazy. As usual, I would just love to have 24 hours life. I don't even remember what that felt like, but

13
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:21.270
Donna Jochimsen: One of the things I did this week, as I said, My daughter's cat while she was out of town. And she said, I'll leave some gas money for you on the counter mom and I said, Yeah, all right. She lives about 25 miles away. So

14
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.050
Donna Jochimsen: I got there, and she'd left me $100 so

15
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:38.400
Donna Jochimsen: I texted her. Are you sure because I don't live that far away. She's like, Yes, Mom. Thank you. So I decided that I was going to do something for myself. So I bought myself a new comfort or new curtains.

16
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:56.790
Donna Jochimsen: Redoing my bedroom, which I love my bedroom is my favorite, favorite place in the house. I love like I have downtime. I love to just get in bed watch TV read drink coffee you just do whatever I want. So that's been a good thing. I've been cleaning

17
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.620
Donna Jochimsen: Cleaning. I am really good so

18
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.510
Donna Jochimsen: It got delivered yesterday and I'm almost done cleaning. So I'm ready to

19
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go good

20
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:19.020
Donna Jochimsen: It does feel really good. Um, you know, I have I have enough money to pay my bills and to eat feed my cats, but I have to be careful. Still, I don't have a lot of extra money so to have some extra was really nice.

21
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I bet I love it when stuff like that comes together.

22
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.880
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, and I was real spontaneous. I didn't really even think about it. I was just like, oh, I want a new comforter. I'm going to do that now. So I did.

23
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. It's important that you take care of yourself. Yep.

24
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what else did you do

25
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.520
Donna Jochimsen: Oh well, most of my time, of course, was spent with my dad.

26
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.940
But

27
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.160
Donna Jochimsen: I had a really good conversation with my son on the telephone.

28
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.920
Donna Jochimsen: Saturday. I think it was

29
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:04.170
Donna Jochimsen: I'm going to have to change my time to go to stay alone. I was going to go on March the 14th, but my son is actually going to be down here.

30
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.660
Donna Jochimsen: And he lives in Portland, which is a couple hours away from Salem, but he wants me to come and stay with him for a couple of days to while I'm there.

31
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:29.670
Donna Jochimsen: So I'm going to, I'm going to change times I don't know what's going to be a little bit later or a little before that, but I'm trying to rearrange all my people with my dad, you know, because sometimes they they aren't able to do. It's kind of

32
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.900
Donna Jochimsen: Not as easy as saying, Okay, I'll go on this day.

33
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah. Are you going to your daughter's to

34
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:55.680
Donna Jochimsen: Limit. That was the. That was the plan, she's she joined and roller derby about a year and a half ago, and her first year was just learning how to do it and practicing BUT SHE'S FINALLY ABLE TO BE IN THE Derby's now so she wants me to come and see you and I'm really excited about that.

35
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of

36
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.820
Donna Jochimsen: Kick ass woman, I tell you.

37
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.910
Donna Jochimsen: There's nothing she can't do you put it in front of her, and she will tackle it somehow.

38
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm. Sounds like her mom.

39
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:19.620
Donna Jochimsen: Um, no. Well, maybe a little bit but but i'm not i'm not as kick ass as she as you're not going to find you doing roller derby or climbing mountains.

40
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, those are good, good.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.740
Younger generation.

43
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.100
Definitely hungry.

44
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How did your recovery go this week.

45
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.360
Donna Jochimsen: And went well. I have not used haven't had a desire to use

46
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.500
Donna Jochimsen: I did I do my Tuesday meetings as my fact I have one today Tuesday meetings I go to have a meeting.

47
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.990
Donna Jochimsen: I picked that one because it has mostly old timers on it, which is helpful to me. Plus, I'm old do so.

48
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.120
Donna Jochimsen: I just fit well with that group. And then I still been doing my Tuesday night my Tuesday night.

49
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.020
Donna Jochimsen: On the online one with women's

50
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For separate women.

51
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:18.690
Donna Jochimsen: Sobriety that's getting a little more comfortable for me as kind of little awkward with, you know, the TAT for them.

52
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.180
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I just different. And I'm finally getting a little more comfortable with that.

53
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.200
Good.

54
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you meeting people

55
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.370
Donna Jochimsen: On the tat. Yeah. Everybody's anonymous on the chat. Okay. You have to pick it a

56
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.690
Donna Jochimsen: User ID that's not your name when you sign up

57
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:53.670
Donna Jochimsen: And I'm not even sure that the same people have been on because I'm just not that I'm not remembering people's usernames or, you know, this is my, this will be my third time doing it so

58
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.800
Donna Jochimsen: I

59
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.820
Donna Jochimsen: Never will but

60
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.930
Donna Jochimsen: I haven't yet.

61
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you getting anything out of the conversation.

62
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:11.910
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, yeah there. It's a very positive group. They don't do the 12 steps where you look back, it's all forward looking positive

63
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.210
Donna Jochimsen: Reinforcement and support for women.

64
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.040
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, I am for all who are have had drug or alcohol problems in the past. So yeah, it's good.

65
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. I'm referring all kinds of women there.

66
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.270
Donna Jochimsen: I really like it because it's so positive and

67
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:39.120
Donna Jochimsen: And and and all women. I think sometimes women UNDERSTAND WOMEN. Well, always women UNDERSTAND WOMEN issues a little better.

68
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I agree. Very much so. So tell me what you're going to be working on this week.

69
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.640
Donna Jochimsen: Well, this week.

70
00:06:49.200 --> 00:07:03.510
Donna Jochimsen: Somebody talked me into helping a political candidate in our area so Saturday. I'm going to go door to door. I thought I was gonna have to be talking to people, but it's basically they. Excuse me.

71
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.960
Donna Jochimsen: And they have targeted the voters. They want to target and I will be going and just leaving literature on their on

72
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:21.120
Donna Jochimsen: Their door knob or talking to them if they want that mainly just trying to get out people to vote. So that's a different for me. I don't usually do things like that.

73
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.800
Donna Jochimsen: How did you get connected into that.

74
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.890
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, that my kick ass daughter, her mother in law lives here in Crescent City and she she

75
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:43.650
Donna Jochimsen: has volunteered for the Democratic Party here for ages and she called me up my daughter probably had something to do with it. But she called me up and asked if I would want to help. So I said, Yeah.

76
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good that you can enter

77
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.530
Donna Jochimsen: It'll be getting me into a whole different group of people than what I usually associated with so yeah

78
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good. What about for your recovery.

79
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:15.720
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I still I still have been trying to practice practice mindfulness, because like I said that's it's hard for me to do, and I know the more I practice it, the easier it will get

80
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:28.890
Donna Jochimsen: And I just think that that's really important for me because I tend to when when I let my mind go I'm either going to go to the past and feel bad about it or to the future and be afraid of it.

81
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:38.820
Donna Jochimsen: So I really need to stay focused and present and it's taken some it's taken some practice and I, but I think I'm getting better at it.

82
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:49.020
Donna Jochimsen: And I'm trying to practice in all different, you know, different arenas, because I think I do pretty good when I'm like out walking

83
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. But

84
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.080
Donna Jochimsen: You need to do that all the time, or as often as possible.

85
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:15.330
Donna Jochimsen: I like I said, I find my mind if I have too much time on my hands, which isn't all that often, but I usually go back to feeling bad about what I have done or worried about what I'm gonna do. And neither one gets me anywhere I just become paralyzed by the whole thing.

86
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

87
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you gotta stay out of that.

88
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That reoccurring rumination inside your head and it'll get easier the more that you practice it, it will start getting easier and easier, you'll have that tool to be able to fall back on.

89
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.000
Donna Jochimsen: I can see that.

90
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's important.

91
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me what you kind of walk me through what you do when you're out walking

92
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.350
Donna Jochimsen: I usually go to the beach, because I just love it there and

93
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.810
Donna Jochimsen: I don't, I don't really, I just walk. You know, I walk it

94
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:02.970
Donna Jochimsen: Now I'm well I'm now I pay more attention to the birds, the ocean. The sand the wind what out, you know, the cars going by what whatever

95
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:18.240
Donna Jochimsen: I just like to get out why I've always been somebody that like to walk I it feels good. I feel better after I do it just, you know, it's a good, good thing for me to do.

96
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. And when you're

97
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're doing that, you're taking your walk, tell me how your anxiety.

98
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How does that play out.

99
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:42.480
Donna Jochimsen: My anxiety. I usually don't have a lot of anxiety when I'm walking, you know, actually my anxiety level husband down a lot a lot since I started taking the quantity

100
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.390
Donna Jochimsen: Good. And yeah, and

101
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:57.390
Donna Jochimsen: I but when I'm walking I I it relieves my anxiety. I have no anxiety, while I'm walking and I easily have less of it after I'm too.

102
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Okay, good. How many times a week. Are you able to get out and walk

103
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Donna Jochimsen: Not as often as I want. I think I did it two times last week, but I would like to do it every day, actually.

104
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's hard when

105
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Another winner. Yeah. The weather's better though now it's still a little cold but

106
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:27.300
Donna Jochimsen: It's clear, at least, and and it just feels good to get out and move. I've been been stuck inside way more than I like to be

107
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's time. And then you Saturday, you're going to be really, really busy, which is really good.

108
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:43.770
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I am going to be really busy. I've got somebody to watch my stay with my dad for four hours. So however long. Well, maybe a little bit longer but

109
00:11:44.940 --> 00:12:02.430
Donna Jochimsen: Definitely for so hopefully I can go for a walk. Well, I'll be walking, door to door so it's not the same. Now it's for me it's not the same. I need to to relieve anxiety and feel better. I actually need to like pick it up a bit, you know a lot faster.

110
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.070
Donna Jochimsen: Just, you know,

111
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.820
Yeah.

112
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.050
Donna Jochimsen: What

113
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Purpose if they wouldn't fit.

114
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.600
For purpose.

115
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got you've got a good week going on.

116
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we're just going to continue with what you're already working on right now. I'm going to be curious to see how it goes on Saturday.

117
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that's really good inside your box. And that's really good. Right.

118
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.030
Donna Jochimsen: To do think it is getting outside my box.

119
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.800
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it's good. I need to look for more ways to be able to do that.

120
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And be around.

121
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Health hopefully healthy people.

122
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:48.480
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, you know, everybody has their problems, but

123
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:58.980
Donna Jochimsen: But, but, yeah, I think if you're if you're a voluntary time for all it to an election we probably are a little bit healthier than, than I have been in the past.

124
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I think that's going to be really, really good.

125
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:16.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we're just going to continue your treatment plan as far as you know practice in your mindfulness getting outside your box going to your meetings and we won't add anything onto your plate until for another week or so.

126
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.980
Donna Jochimsen: And then we'll take a look pretty cool right now. Yeah, because I still I still spend

127
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.930
Donna Jochimsen: 20

128
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.940
Donna Jochimsen: Maybe 20 hours a day with my dad most days so

129
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.380
Donna Jochimsen: Okay.

130
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:39.720
Donna Jochimsen: My, my brother, my brother and my sister in law have been stepping up to help me though. I think they finally heard me say I can't do this anymore.

131
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.100
Donna Jochimsen: Good, we're gonna have

132
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.620
Donna Jochimsen: We're gonna have to put him in a hospital or something because I can't do this. And yeah.

133
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:54.810
