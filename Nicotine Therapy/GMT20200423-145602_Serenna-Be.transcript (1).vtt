00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.690
Serenna Beers: Morning. How are you today.

3
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.700
Kennerh Blaine: I'm okay. Yeah.

4
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.020
Kennerh Blaine: You make this screen bigger if I can do it.

5
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.440
Kennerh Blaine: No, I don't want to leave meeting.

6
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.660
Kennerh Blaine: Here we go.

7
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.330
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, okay. Yes, yes.

8
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.750
Serenna Beers: So tell me how everything's going when you say I asked you how you are and you say, Okay, what does that mean

9
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.730
Kennerh Blaine: That means I'm irritated it a few things I'm

10
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.630
Kennerh Blaine: They're waiting for Maya why song called to pass.

11
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.390
Serenna Beers: Oh,

12
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.900
Kennerh Blaine: I think they were able to either bring him home from the hospital or they were able to go visiting

13
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.600
Kennerh Blaine: Which I'm perfectly okay with

14
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.310
Kennerh Blaine: When we got our stimulus money.

15
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.420
Kennerh Blaine: I gave my wife $500 to do with every she wants.

16
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.940
Kennerh Blaine: She has no income.

17
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.600
Kennerh Blaine: And

18
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.040
Kennerh Blaine: Then yesterday, just before she leaves. She asked me, she can have money. And she goes, Well, I know you're going to be mad, but I can I have some money. It's like

19
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.940
Kennerh Blaine: It's frustrating.

20
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.170
Because

21
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.490
Kennerh Blaine: This isn't the first time she's done it. She'll have money for stuff and then she'll spend it and she knows it. Well, can you just go ahead and do it. Give me more and

22
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.820
Kennerh Blaine: That's something we're going to talk about

23
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.900
Soon.

24
00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:02.700
Kennerh Blaine: Because we're living off my parents right now. I gave 2000 a month for social security in my purse disability.

25
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.780
Kennerh Blaine: And my parents are paying my mortgage

26
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.390
Kennerh Blaine: So,

27
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
Kennerh Blaine: Both my parents, you're in a memory care facility and I have

28
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.150
Kennerh Blaine: Control over all their money and before my dad really lost it. He had been paying my mortgage

29
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.510
Kennerh Blaine: To help because my mom was living with us.

30
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.960
Kennerh Blaine: So the plan is that

31
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.220
Kennerh Blaine: I'm gonna sell my house in order and

32
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.870
Kennerh Blaine: And I should get a substantial amount of money for it. I'm gonna pay my parents back

33
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.270
Kennerh Blaine: This

34
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.510
Kennerh Blaine: Just really irritating. Yeah. And so

35
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.980
Kennerh Blaine: And it's been an ongoing thing ever since she lost her disability, the money.

36
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.120
Kennerh Blaine: So, like I say, that's a, that's a Avenue. I'm going to have to go down.

37
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
Kennerh Blaine: And usually when we have an avenue like this to go down.

38
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.290
Kennerh Blaine: We see our, our family counselor marriage counselor, whatever you want, which is her counselor.

39
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.940
Kennerh Blaine: But we're unable to do that.

40
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.590
Kennerh Blaine: Right now.

41
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960
Kennerh Blaine: Because, you know, the whole the county shut down.

42
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.250
Kennerh Blaine: Right. So, and it's

43
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.690
Kennerh Blaine: Um, it's too weird to for both of us to talk to her.

44
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.170
Kennerh Blaine: On the phone or even virtually it's it's just kinda so I'm just gonna have to approach it.

45
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.980
Kennerh Blaine: in an appropriate manner and that's that.

46
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.700
Kennerh Blaine: That's the part I'm struggling with

47
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.150
So,

48
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.510
Serenna Beers: That's big stuff, you know,

49
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.450
Mm hmm.

50
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.570
Serenna Beers: So how does that impact you throughout the day. I mean, like, Are you the type that

51
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.710
Serenna Beers: And. And the reason that I'm asking. This is because it'll also give me an idea of how you manage your emotions.

52
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:59.460
Serenna Beers: Do you do you process it and kind of run through it and then move past it, or are you someone who will sit and it'll kind of fester until it comes out in some other way do you hold it all in a. How do you deal with it.

53
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.710
Kennerh Blaine: I hold it in

54
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.500
Kennerh Blaine: Until it festers

55
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.770
Kennerh Blaine: Which isn't the proper way.

56
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.220
Kennerh Blaine: But that's one of the things that I'm working on with Gabby and john

57
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.200
Kennerh Blaine: And

58
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.920
Kennerh Blaine: And Kenny to point O is to appropriately.

59
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.580
Kennerh Blaine: Appropriately.

60
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.730
Kennerh Blaine: handle these situations.

61
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.910
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. So, and then usually comes out on some poor innocent victim.

62
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.720
Or

63
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.690
Kennerh Blaine: Somebody that I think

64
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.900
Kennerh Blaine: You know, we had

65
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.620
Kennerh Blaine: At my parents, first thing I did is I put cameras up everywhere. Inside, outside

66
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.650
Kennerh Blaine: You know their stuff at my mom and dad's

67
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.050
Kennerh Blaine: That I can't replace

68
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.940
Kennerh Blaine: I took all my dad's medals down

69
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.470
Kennerh Blaine: And uniform and I have them here.

70
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.350
Kennerh Blaine: Because

71
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:39.780
Kennerh Blaine: I'm so afraid somebody would take those but I i I'm more worried that somebody would just go in and screw them up.

72
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.460
Kennerh Blaine: And then I would go ballistic over that.

73
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.750
Kennerh Blaine: And then we had kids across the alley. I guess jumped the fence and

74
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.970
Kennerh Blaine: Take some pieces of old pipe.

75
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.800
Kennerh Blaine: That

76
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.250
Kennerh Blaine: Had nothing yummy. You know, they asked me to gave them to him.

77
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:25.740
Kennerh Blaine: I had a neighbor stop buying and tell me his already told a friend of mine that was working there. But when we were on our house boat trip and

78
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:37.350
Kennerh Blaine: He's sick Donny is sick. He he he had a couple of strokes and now he's had respiratory respiratory thing that is

79
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:55.830
Kennerh Blaine: Really getting sick and anyways. He, he's the one to set up all the cameras and I told him we need to set another one up because I don't have a picture and complete picture of the front of the shop. My dad's wood shop.

80
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.080
Kennerh Blaine: I have one inside

81
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.500
So,

82
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.260
Kennerh Blaine: I just kind of let that go.

83
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.230
Kennerh Blaine: Because

84
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.480
Kennerh Blaine: If I say something

85
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.930
Kennerh Blaine: In the mouth off.

86
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.460
Kennerh Blaine: To jail.

87
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.180
Kennerh Blaine: Because

88
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.220
Kennerh Blaine: What my parents have I can't replace. Well, my mom and dad have touched. I can't replace

89
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.850
Kennerh Blaine: Um, so I've let that go.

90
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:47.130
Kennerh Blaine: So let me just junkie pipe, but the theory. The thing is, you know, jumping over my fucking fence when the big gate is open. I haven't closed it so

91
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.150
Kennerh Blaine: That's probably how it's going to come out, something like that.

92
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.400
Serenna Beers: And obviously that's not the

93
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.260
Serenna Beers: Most

94
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.960
Serenna Beers: appropriate course of action.

95
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.140
Kennerh Blaine: Correct. I know this appear

96
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.000
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Sure.

97
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.320
Kennerh Blaine: But here.

98
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.530
Kennerh Blaine: you disrespect my parents.

99
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.570
Kennerh Blaine: disrespect my wife.

100
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.810
Kennerh Blaine: Consequences don't matter. Yeah.

101
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.880
Serenna Beers: Well, the consequences. Don't matter in that moment, but clear clearly the

102
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:41.010
Serenna Beers: Consequence matter down the road, because it's not just you, you would affect if you go to jail or anything else. Worse, which I know that you know that right

103
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.140
Kennerh Blaine: And that's what has kept me from

104
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.440
Kennerh Blaine: Exploding on other things, other situations.

105
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.300
Kennerh Blaine: Is

106
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.630
Kennerh Blaine: I get that fleeting thought that

107
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.380
Kennerh Blaine: If I do this.

108
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.020
Kennerh Blaine: I'm risking going to jail.

109
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.820
Kennerh Blaine: And I

110
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.640
Kennerh Blaine: And then not going to be there for my parents or my wife.

111
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.830
Kennerh Blaine: And that

112
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:23.040
Kennerh Blaine: snapped me out of. Okay, let's look at the real consequences. Is it really worth going to that extreme.

113
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.510
Kennerh Blaine: And all but once it has worked

114
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.720
Kennerh Blaine: In

115
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.090
Kennerh Blaine: It.

116
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.740
Kennerh Blaine: The one time it got to the point where

117
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.670
Kennerh Blaine: I was in his face.

118
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.280
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah. Anyways, he got on a bicycle, blah, blah, blah.

119
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:55.800
Kennerh Blaine: And screaming and or people in front of me, blah, blah, blah. During the corner, and he runs into my car.

120
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.630
Kennerh Blaine: And so I stopped and I said hey, and

121
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.820
Kennerh Blaine: Of course she said something

122
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.760
Kennerh Blaine: And immediately to embark

123
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:17.100
Kennerh Blaine: On now and I'm about six inches from his face, and he said something else.

124
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.810
Kennerh Blaine: And they said to call the cops. I said, well, it's 911 fuck head call them so

125
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.520
Kennerh Blaine: At that point,

126
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.690
Kennerh Blaine: I just turned around and went back, got my car and went about my my day.

127
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.570
Kennerh Blaine: Because of that fleeting thought

128
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.010
Kennerh Blaine: That I wouldn't be here.

129
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.470
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, for my parents.

130
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.510
Kennerh Blaine: So,

131
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.730
Serenna Beers: How does that affect you.

132
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.030
Kennerh Blaine: How I

133
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.750
Kennerh Blaine: Usually deal with situations.

134
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.390
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, it's better

135
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.550
Kennerh Blaine: It's gotten better.

136
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.940
Kennerh Blaine: Because I've been working on that with Gabby and john for

137
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.640
Kennerh Blaine: Well, a couple years in ways after I got out of the hospital in

138
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.590
Kennerh Blaine: Almost three this August I think it'll be three years ago or 951 50 um

139
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.530
Kennerh Blaine: And so I've extremely been working on that with them and

140
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.840
Kennerh Blaine: Coping tools.

141
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.510
Serenna Beers: So you you were

142
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.310
Serenna Beers: 50

143
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.190
Serenna Beers: Okay.

144
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.000

162
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.570
Kennerh Blaine: I couldn't talk to anybody about anything without just busting down balling.

163
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.990
Kennerh Blaine: Uncontrollably

164
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.680
Kennerh Blaine: And so, Dina went with me at that time I was seeing euro.

165
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.500
Kennerh Blaine: Counselor, with the county

166
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.210
Kennerh Blaine: And she went in with me and

167
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:19.920
Kennerh Blaine: Risk a cinch. We got to do something. And she asked the question, and I gave the magic answer.

168
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.140
Kennerh Blaine: And

169
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:30.180
Kennerh Blaine: Then I went to our local hospital until they could, you know, find a facility for me.

170
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:40.500
Kennerh Blaine: And I stayed there. I think seven days and they did the same thing for me that they were doing for my mom is they got my medication.

171
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.360
Kennerh Blaine: Added some subtracted some

172
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.400
Kennerh Blaine: And so they got it dialed in.

173
00:16:52.350 --> 00:17:04.170
Kennerh Blaine: And then when I got out, you know, I stopped by the convalescent hospital and talk to the charge nurse and told her where I'd been would happen and

174
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:11.370
Kennerh Blaine: You know, she said she was glad that I sought help because they could tell that

175
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.320
Kennerh Blaine: I was in no shape to take care of my mom.

176
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.630
Kennerh Blaine: And so mom came home after a month up there.

177
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.290
Kennerh Blaine: Completely different completely back to her sigh hurt herself.

178
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.120
Kennerh Blaine: And then once she was cleared.

179
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.690
Kennerh Blaine: With the urinary tract infection and

180
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:49.770
Kennerh Blaine: Everything was okay with me. I could bring her back home again. And so she lived with me and my wife for two and a half years. And that was

181
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.280
Kennerh Blaine: That was trying. There's no law.

182
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.010
Kennerh Blaine: Is no question about it.

183
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.310
Kennerh Blaine: And

184
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.980
Kennerh Blaine: Whenever we will

185
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.160
Kennerh Blaine: Start to talk. My mom would want to know what we're talking about. What are you doing, and

186
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.490
Kennerh Blaine: You know, I would explain

187
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:22.680
Kennerh Blaine: You know, the dean and I are talking Mom Oh okay, you know, and she was okay with that. But it really irritated Dina

188
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.140
Kennerh Blaine: Because my mom.

189
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.950
Kennerh Blaine: You know, added know everything's going on but

190
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.640
Kennerh Blaine: That's typical

191
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.210
Kennerh Blaine: My mom knew everything about me everything except for what happened when I was a child.

192
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.830
Kennerh Blaine: I would not tell her I still haven't told her.

193
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:55.170
Kennerh Blaine: And I told her, then it was going on, she would walk right up to him and put a bullet in his head.

194
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.370
Kennerh Blaine: With no doubt at all.

195
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.050
Kennerh Blaine: My dad was overseas. My mom was

196
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:15.570
Kennerh Blaine: working full time at a convalescent hospital and go on to San Diego State full time.

197
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.030
Kennerh Blaine: To become a physical therapist assistant

198
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:30.240
Kennerh Blaine: She was one of the first in the state of California to get her license as a physical therapy assistant and so

199
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.740
Kennerh Blaine: It was no way I would ever put that on her.

200
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:45.780
Kennerh Blaine: So, I mean, when my mom came home at night from the convalescent hospital I wake up for her I brush your hair I massage your feet.

201
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.610
Kennerh Blaine: Spin some quality time with her and then I go to bed.

202
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.990
Kennerh Blaine: And that's

203
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:08.280
Kennerh Blaine: The way it's been my whole life. She's always known about my drug addiction. My drug use. She was an enabler.

204
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.450
Kennerh Blaine: So it was my grandma, my grandma didn't know really what I was doing. She didn't know what I was doing wasn't

205
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:20.820
Kennerh Blaine: Good.

206
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:34.590
Kennerh Blaine: So the day. My mom told me know devastated me and I went, oh, run asked my grandma, my grandma told me no

207
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.020
I'm

208
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:50.130
Kennerh Blaine: That set me off i mean i i wasn't mad at them. I was mad at me. I had my son with me.

209
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:59.550
Kennerh Blaine: And I did something extremely stupid and my son had been taken away from me on his sixth birthday.

210
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.180
What did you do that wasn't

211
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.260
Kennerh Blaine: Well,

212
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:15.630
Kennerh Blaine: The

213
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.810
Kennerh Blaine: Closer didn't like each other.

214
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.710
Kennerh Blaine: Which is my fault. I mean, I think.

215
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.810
Kennerh Blaine: So anyways, we had a little show of

216
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.910
Kennerh Blaine: Gun power.

217
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.570
Kennerh Blaine: And I'm

218
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.540
Kennerh Blaine: didn't end up well for me.

219
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.380
Kennerh Blaine: So I went to jail.

220
00:21:54.210 --> 00:22:03.960
Kennerh Blaine: And as soon as they released me from there I went to a right roads and Red Bluff or recovery home.

221
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:16.080
Kennerh Blaine: Got out of there with my little Good boy. Note, and when I went to court. The next time I

222
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.740
Kennerh Blaine: You know, showed the judge my good boy note.

223
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.990
Kennerh Blaine: And he told me

224
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.300
Kennerh Blaine: That she. My mom is a physical therapist assistant

225
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:38.250
Kennerh Blaine: And so she worked on all their backs these arms, shoulders, feet, whatever. And my dad.

226
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.800
Kennerh Blaine: Worked for the county

227
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.170
Kennerh Blaine: As a building's

228
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.700
Kennerh Blaine: Guy. So he builds all their desks. Their bookshelves.

229
00:22:50.340 --> 00:23:03.480
Kennerh Blaine: They're both very well liked and respected judge carry on Tommy says, Mr. Blaine, if you get out of my county by send down tonight and don't ever come back.

230
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.250
Kennerh Blaine: We will do formal arbitration.

231
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.230
Kennerh Blaine: And you won't go to jail for a long time.

232
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.640
Kennerh Blaine: And so I was out before sundown. You know where to go. I just packed. What I add into the storage unit.

233
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.920
Kennerh Blaine: And left

234
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.410
Kennerh Blaine: And I ended up in willows.

235
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.830
Kennerh Blaine: To know learn me buddy's wife.

236
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.750

237
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.070
Kennerh Blaine: You know, one thing I do another blah, blah, blah.

238
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.310
Kennerh Blaine: That lasted about six months.

239
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.260
Kennerh Blaine: Because I started running again and again.

240
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.300
And

241
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.570
Kennerh Blaine: They all man for a test.

242
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.390
Kennerh Blaine: Needed a test was dirty.

243
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.910
Kennerh Blaine: So,

244
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:25.320
Kennerh Blaine: I begged Glenn county tip with me and a program because a some you know jailhouse lawyer told me that if you're in a recovery unit. They can't come and take you out of that unit without a special federal warrant.

245
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.810
Kennerh Blaine: So I when I did my 90 days.

246
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:39.480
Kennerh Blaine: I came back. So, the judge my good boy thing this time, and it says, Okay, this it

Kennerh Blaine: They transferred my probation to blend counting

248
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.050
Kennerh Blaine: And so

249
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:57.360
Kennerh Blaine: When I got out a right roads. Actually, before I went to write roads. I had a my sponsor Ed head where

250
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.950
Kennerh Blaine: It was a gruff OLD SON OF A BITCH I mean

251
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.010
Kennerh Blaine: He was in Pearl Harbor.

252
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.460
Kennerh Blaine: When Pearl Harbor was bombed.

253
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.890
Kennerh Blaine: Wow, and

254
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:13.620
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

255
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:25.380
Kennerh Blaine: He told me that if I wanted him to be my sponsor that I would do what I was told.

256
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.470
Kennerh Blaine: Go find somebody else.

257
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.400
Kennerh Blaine: I didn't like everything he told me, but I did it.

258
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.190
Kennerh Blaine: He got me involved in my community.

259
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.310
Kennerh Blaine: He told me I either had to get a job.

260
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.080
Kennerh Blaine: The school or something so

261
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:58.890
Kennerh Blaine: At the age of 29 I went back to continuation school and Glenn County and willows, two years later I graduated with a real high school diploma.

262
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.360
Very cool.

263
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.730
Kennerh Blaine: He used to tell me in the meetings.

264
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.310
Serenna Beers: To shut up.

265
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:19.470
Kennerh Blaine: Because they I didn't have anything they needed to hear. I didn't know nothing about recovery and it was true.

266
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.470
Kennerh Blaine: So,

267
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.540
Kennerh Blaine: There was an incident at Denise.

268
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:42.570
Kennerh Blaine: Were Friday night football and his home game and Danny says packed and the waitress didn't get over fast enough with my coffee. And I said, Yo, bitch. Buck over here and fill my coffee cup.

269
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.020
Kennerh Blaine: Everybody left

270
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.460
Kennerh Blaine: By the time I got home.

271
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.590
I had a

272
00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:08.640
Kennerh Blaine: Message on my machine from it and told me that I would be in his garage at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon I got out of school at 132 years, except for send a

273
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:22.500
Kennerh Blaine: I was in his garage on my stool at two o'clock in the afternoon, and we went through steps and traditions and we went through working on, Kenny.

274
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:32.910
Kennerh Blaine: He got me involved in in COLLIN COUNTY mental health drug and alcohol Advisory Commission, which was a board then they changed the name

275
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.700
Kennerh Blaine: And so

276
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.140
Kennerh Blaine: I excelled there.

277
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.260
Kennerh Blaine: To where they made me the chair. After a year and a half.

278
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.600
Kennerh Blaine: I was scared to death.

279
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:58.800
Kennerh Blaine: When they told me that I just broke out in the most god awful smell sweat that you could ever smell from the fear.

280
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.440
Kennerh Blaine: And Mike Krista said can you don't worry

281
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.130
Kennerh Blaine: We'll walk you through it, you'll be okay.

282
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.290
Kennerh Blaine: I had

283
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.890
Kennerh Blaine: I was on that board until I moved to reading

284
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:23.190
Kennerh Blaine: 2010 2009, I guess.

285
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.320
Kennerh Blaine: Got married for the third time that divorced for the third time came back to Glen County.

286
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.980
Kennerh Blaine: And

287
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:47.610
Kennerh Blaine: Did a long haul trucking and five western states for a local guy like this love

288
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.470
Kennerh Blaine: And then I got back on the board again and I'm on the board now. And so, as my wife.

289
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.540
Kennerh Blaine: So those are the things that I was taught

290
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:09.300
Kennerh Blaine: I wasn't taught how to deal with the emotions or the anger. I was just taught

291
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.810
Kennerh Blaine: Not to press them.

292
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:23.460
Kennerh Blaine: And it didn't always work when somebody nice or daughter went missing.

293
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.430
Kennerh Blaine: And the first one that called

294
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.770
Kennerh Blaine: Because I'd find her.

295
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.030
Kennerh Blaine: Show.

296
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:43.680
Serenna Beers: So what do you think

297
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.330
Serenna Beers: Was

298
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.690
Kennerh Blaine: A payoff was

299
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.220
Kennerh Blaine: Ego.

300
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.540
Kennerh Blaine: Status.

301
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.580
Kennerh Blaine: Because

302
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.280
Kennerh Blaine: Nobody fuck with me.

303
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.770
Kennerh Blaine: You know, it was I didn't

304
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.320
Kennerh Blaine: Have a reputation of being an ass around the meetings.

305
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.690
Kennerh Blaine: Because I don't put up with their bullshit.

306
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.700
Kennerh Blaine: I don't put up with people talking and

307
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.170
Kennerh Blaine: Gathering when somebody else's talked and disrupting the meeting.

308
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:54.990
Kennerh Blaine: And I'm usually not pretty nice about it, it sounds. Shut the fuck up and sit down or leave

309
00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.250
Kennerh Blaine: That's how a bunch of us were taught you know most of us with the

310
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:16.620
Kennerh Blaine: Double digits. Every covering Glenn county or taught by the old time a because we had one name one NA meeting here and we had to a meeting.

311
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.810
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. And so

312
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.940
Kennerh Blaine: If we wanted another NA meeting we had to go out of town. And we did that a lot

313
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:37.470
Kennerh Blaine: We would meet at the Shell Gas station where a friend of mine in recovery. His parents sound and we flip a coin to see if we're going north or south at night for me.

314
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.740

Kennerh Blaine: To go seek out meetings.

Kennerh Blaine: And most of us.

319
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.350
Kennerh Blaine: Had to work or go to school the next morning, but we just did it.

320
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.880
So,

321
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:06.930
Kennerh Blaine: I'm

322
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.610
Kennerh Blaine: You know, I don't have those values.

Kennerh Blaine: My dad and I started a relationship that I had

338
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.370
Kennerh Blaine: Dreamed of my whole life.

339
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.310
Kennerh Blaine: I mean, we

340
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:53.370
Kennerh Blaine: We got real close. We're still close but you know did stuff that

345
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.620
Kennerh Blaine: That's my way. That's my dad's way of showing his love.

346
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.890
Kennerh Blaine: I've never heard those words from my dad.

347
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.960
Kennerh Blaine: I don't ever expect to

348
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.270
Kennerh Blaine: And I'm okay with it.

349
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.050
Kennerh Blaine: Because I know his way.

350
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.520

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.480
Kennerh Blaine: It was I, you, bro.

356
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:54.990
Serenna Beers: Here's his love language wasn't of words as much as it was of action, maybe

357
00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.740
Serenna Beers: Correct, yes.

358
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.700
Kennerh Blaine: And I knew that I mean I'd figured that out, you know, long, long time ago.

359
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.250
Kennerh Blaine: And that just made my mom's heart.

360
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.070
Kennerh Blaine: Filled with so much joy.

361
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.450
Kennerh Blaine: My dad gave me a key to his house.

362
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:21.600
Kennerh Blaine: That

363
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.020
Kennerh Blaine: That was huge.

364
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:34.260
Kennerh Blaine: On my 18th birthday, my mom sent me down to San Diego to my cousins.

365
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.580
Kennerh Blaine: And when I got home, my dad tore up my bedroom.

366
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.770
Kennerh Blaine: Enlarge the kitchen.

367
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.430
Serenna Beers: Wow.

368
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.570
Kennerh Blaine: Here's your bags.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.000

Serenna Beers: Oh my goodness.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.690
Serenna Beers: That caught caught me off guard.

378
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.930
Kennerh Blaine: And I went in the army.

379
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:25.680

393
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.810
Kennerh Blaine: My dad.

394
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.740
Kennerh Blaine: Immediately called

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.870
Kennerh Blaine: The commander of the post.

Kennerh Blaine: And explain to them that they needed to watch me

397
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.100
Kennerh Blaine: Make sure I was safe. After I got that news.

398
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.440
Kennerh Blaine: And so

399
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.490
Kennerh Blaine: You know, after a little while I was so okay

400
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:19.140
Kennerh Blaine: Well, after I finished the training. I went home and when I came home.

401
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.200
Kennerh Blaine: My best friends in the world said, hey, you need to

402
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.770
Kennerh Blaine: You need to go talk to her because

403
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.570
Kennerh Blaine: She is

404
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.420
Kennerh Blaine: shacking up with somebody else.

405
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.020
Serenna Beers: Hmm.

406
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.460
Kennerh Blaine: So that did

407
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.260
Serenna Beers: So what do you think is your

408
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.750
Serenna Beers: What is your primary

409
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.220
Serenna Beers: Struggle as far as because based on

410
00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:09.330
Serenna Beers: Some of your backstory. There's a common thread and that's underlining anger, which you go a little deep, deep deeper than that.

411
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.790
Serenna Beers: Anger is just fear.

412
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.290
Serenna Beers: Inside Out not like you're a chicken shit. I mean, fear as okay

413
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.670
Kennerh Blaine: There's, there's

414
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.310
Serenna Beers: There's a fear attached to that.

415
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:31.350
Kennerh Blaine: And, um, yeah. The fear is that somebody's going to hurt.

416
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.030
Kennerh Blaine: And

417
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.120
Kennerh Blaine: Then ain't gonna happen again.

418
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.910
Kennerh Blaine: Now, it was the bottom and it took me a long time to

419
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.450
Kennerh Blaine: Be able to admit that or come up with that.

420
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:51.000
Kennerh Blaine: And then when we got into my dad and

421
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:59.910
Kennerh Blaine: It took me a long time to except that he wasn't there for me when I was growing up.

422
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:07.590
Kennerh Blaine: Because the first thing I would say is my dad's a war hero, and he is. He's a true

423
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.030
Kennerh Blaine: 100% war hero.

424
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.000
Kennerh Blaine: The metals in the certificates to prove it, you will never say that.

425
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.680
Kennerh Blaine: But that's what I would say. Because I would avoid it.

426
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.710
Kennerh Blaine: I would avoid the

427
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:32.580
Kennerh Blaine: Idea of thinking that he chose the military career over me.

428
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:43.710
Kennerh Blaine: And that's where my anger started very early age. First time I was ever suspended from school was fourth grade, and it just went

429
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.080
Kennerh Blaine: Down from there. Mm hmm. Put me in special classes.

430
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.670
Kennerh Blaine: I do have some learning disabilities.

431
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.740
What are those

432
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.120
Kennerh Blaine: Dyslexia

433
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:06.000
Kennerh Blaine: Okay. Um, and I also

434
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:15.750
Kennerh Blaine: I have a real time real hard time understanding written instructions.

435
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.560
Okay.

436
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.370
Kennerh Blaine: It doesn't compete up here.

437
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:27.150
Kennerh Blaine: You can show me a picture and I can put that together to wait a picture says, but to read the instructions and

438
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.640
Kennerh Blaine: execute them only off the paper. All right, I

439
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.380
Kennerh Blaine: Can do that.

440
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.820
Kennerh Blaine: And usually when I try to do that because I can't figure it out by the picture I get real frustrated and I guess give up.

441
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.010
Kennerh Blaine: So, I mean, that's one of the

442
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:58.260
Kennerh Blaine: That is one of the strong things. My wife and I have together. Is she

443
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:06.750
Kennerh Blaine: She will read the instructions, show me how to do it. Tell me how to do it and it

444
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:08.940
Kennerh Blaine: And

445
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.740
Kennerh Blaine: It works.

446
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:16.050
Kennerh Blaine: Show.

447
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.960
Kennerh Blaine: I think I told you about my son.

448
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.670
Kennerh Blaine: I have no contact with him.

449
00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.940
Kennerh Blaine: My other son.

450
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.550
Kennerh Blaine: Who isn't my biological but Dina's youngest

451
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:43.350
Kennerh Blaine: Calls me dad and I called him son, he's been coming down the last couple of weekends.

452
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:45.300
Kennerh Blaine: To help us.

453
00:42:47.040 --> 00:43:01.230
Kennerh Blaine: And he came out of his bedroom crying last Saturday, and I got up to hugging me kind of put his hand up. I thought it was emotional over you know his, his great uncle maybe dying.

454
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.070
Kennerh Blaine: But he told me he had daddy issues.

455
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:07.740
Okay.

456
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.320
And

457
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.530
Kennerh Blaine: He told me that

458
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.020
Kennerh Blaine: First day I Maddie.

459
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.400
Kennerh Blaine: Did I treated

460
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:40.650
Kennerh Blaine: With respect, and even when he screwed up and they screwed up a few times I've never turned my back on him.

461
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.210
Kennerh Blaine: And then he's never had some, but he

462
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.310
Kennerh Blaine: And his life that he called daddy.

463
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.800
Kennerh Blaine: And we hugged and we cried.

464
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:07.920
Kennerh Blaine: But

465
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.590
Kennerh Blaine: That was special. And he also told me see.

466
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.760
Kennerh Blaine: I gave me my mom's car two years ago.

467
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.020
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. He lives in love, we live in Oregon.

468
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.540
Kennerh Blaine: 30 miles away.

469
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:37.020
Kennerh Blaine: And so when I called asked, we need to have to go get him or his girlfriend to have to bring him down. That was very inconvenient. Anyways, blah, blah, blah.

470
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.190
Kennerh Blaine: I gave him my mom's car.

471
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.730
Kennerh Blaine: Until 1995 Ford

472
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:56.250
Kennerh Blaine: Taking care of in the garage little old lady drove it you know that whole

473
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.030
Kennerh Blaine: And in six months, he destroyed.

474
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.480
I was pissed.

475
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:09.540
Kennerh Blaine: And beginning

476
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.310
Serenna Beers: I would imagine.

477
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.150
And

478
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.100
Kennerh Blaine: He would come in, you know, asked me for help.

479
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.730
Kennerh Blaine: He has a big ass on his chest. He wants to save a whole and you know

480
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:25.830
Serenna Beers: Captain said.

481
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:28.590
Yep.

482
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.380
Kennerh Blaine: And so

483
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.780
Kennerh Blaine: I told him.

484
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.890
Kennerh Blaine: See, you know, this car wasn't given to you.

485
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.970
Kennerh Blaine: To run all these bitches around the world.

486
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.260
Kennerh Blaine: That was given to you seek to get a job and you can come and help me and mom when we need it.

487
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:52.920
Kennerh Blaine: And so

488
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.800
Kennerh Blaine: I think that's it.

489
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.520
Kennerh Blaine: Didn't change.

490
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.730
Kennerh Blaine: He ended up getting a possession violation up and Susan bill.

491
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.000
Kennerh Blaine: Um,

492
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:18.030
Kennerh Blaine: I wasn't gonna bail him out. I wasn't gonna go getting I'm not putting money on his books.

493
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.740
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Nothing.

494
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.850
Kennerh Blaine: Anyway, so we got out. He got his car.

495
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:34.530
Kennerh Blaine: And he got just passed Chico, and the transmission

496
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.200
Kennerh Blaine: quit working

497
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.150
Kennerh Blaine: So calls me

498
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.880
Kennerh Blaine: I go look at the car.

499
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.460
Kennerh Blaine: Well,

500
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.250
Kennerh Blaine: The mission was completely on a fluid.

501
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:01.920
Kennerh Blaine: And it was irritated because I didn't bring no transmission fluid and I've already called triple aim to have it towed to my house.

502
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.710
Kennerh Blaine: So I told him I'm done.

503
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.390
Kennerh Blaine: That's it.

504
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:20.640
Kennerh Blaine: Last time. Well, now he's ran into so much crap. He's good. There isn't a corner on that car that isn't screwed up.

505
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.570
Kennerh Blaine: Went over something

506
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:32.490
Kennerh Blaine: And he screwed up the tie rod in front end and it wears tires off.

507
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:51.420
Kennerh Blaine: Within about 80 miles under miles. It literally, where's the tyro so anyways I told him I'm done. It's parked in my parking lot or in my garage driveway here and I told him. If you want money to fix that you need come down here and work.

508
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.880
Kennerh Blaine: Well, that didn't work until the last two weekends.

509
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.140
Kennerh Blaine: And he realized that

510
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.490
Kennerh Blaine: How much he had been

511
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.370
Kennerh Blaine: Screwing off.

512
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:14.790
Kennerh Blaine: And he promised me that when I asked him to come to help that he would show up when I asked him to

513
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:22.410
Kennerh Blaine: When he was here, he would work because he would come here and he would eat and he would see

514
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.040
Kennerh Blaine: When went to closer. He

515
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.670
Kennerh Blaine: Was supposed to help with a big brush pile.

516
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.730
Kennerh Blaine: Even overlaid on the grass and slept for four

517
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:35.160
Kennerh Blaine: I was done.

518
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.360
Kennerh Blaine: I

519
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:39.270
Kennerh Blaine: Said, I'm not doing

520
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.500
Kennerh Blaine: I'm not asking for his help.

521
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.240
Kennerh Blaine: And so of course one last time I did. And he'd been real good. And that's when he came up with the

522
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:57.210
Kennerh Blaine: The daddy issue thing last Saturday of I've never turned my back on aim.

523
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.460
Kennerh Blaine: Did tell him I'm not fixing your car, you're going to have to work and earning

524
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:12.480
Kennerh Blaine: I said $10 an hour, I said that don't mean sleeping under the couch. I don't mean sitting in a chair smoking cigarettes playing on your damn phone

525
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:16.260
Kennerh Blaine: Let me get off your ass and working

526
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:16.980
Mm hmm.

527
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.610
Kennerh Blaine: So the last couple of weekends. He's done that real well.

528
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.670
Serenna Beers: That's good. So, so

529
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:29.400
Serenna Beers: Tell me, because I'm I'm we're coming up to the close of the hour, and I've got a session.

530
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.240
Serenna Beers: At nine

531
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.410
Serenna Beers: But this is good stuff. Honestly, because I'm with

532
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.730
Serenna Beers: Em, er, and do you like to go by Kenny or Kenneth or Ken

533
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.260
Serenna Beers: What is your preference.

534
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:42.570
Kennerh Blaine: Kenny.

535
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:51.630
Serenna Beers: Okay Kenny, Kenny. So, you know, as we prepped to begin doing. Hello. Hello.

536
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:52.710
Kennerh Blaine: Hello.

537
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.090
Serenna Beers: Can you hear me. Oh.

538
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:55.380
Kennerh Blaine: You're frozen.

539
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:57.000
Kennerh Blaine: I'm frozen. I can hear you.

540
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.110
Serenna Beers: Okay, there you go.

541
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.150
Kennerh Blaine: No, no, I'm frozen.

542
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.120
Serenna Beers: Oh yes, um, as we move

543
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:14.550
Serenna Beers: Towards getting closer to the stage of where we actually do the work with the wand. It's important for me to understand your what I like to call your trigger points.

544
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:28.980
Serenna Beers: And the, the one thing that I feel is one of your biggest if not the one is your anger, because all of the underlining roots that are attached to that anger is what you need to resolve which hasn't been yet.

545
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:37.440
Serenna Beers: Your abuse as a child. Your abuse in many different ways. The abuse from your dad and maybe he showed you. He loved you, in different ways. But there's that

546
00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:55.590
Serenna Beers: Attachment issue. There's that disconnectedness there's that lack of emotional support and which has caused you to shut down. You've operated in your adult life with a guard because, as you said, and I put quotes here.

547
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:05.250
Serenna Beers: Someone is going to hurt me, and I can't allow that to happen again. That's very powerful statement, very, very powerful.

548
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:13.560
Serenna Beers: And my goal with with you and tell me if this line might lines up with with with you is to create

549
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.840
Serenna Beers: A pathway where you can

550
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:27.930
Serenna Beers: Work through some of these past traumatic issues in order to get to a place where you don't operate out of being reactionary and the first place that you go to is anger.

551
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:45.030
Serenna Beers: You, it seems like you know, especially now that you feel like in your lifetime that you want a different way to resolve issues when they bother you versus stuffing it and then imploding. So you implode you stuff, that stuff, that stuff at stuff it and then you

552
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:56.670
Serenna Beers: Rage usually as you said to somebody who is an innocent bystander. That's usually what happens when you deal with somebody who implodes

553
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:06.270
Serenna Beers: But then you quickly move from imploding. Once you've had enough, then it. That's when you explode. Well clearly that's not a healthy

554
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:21.810
Serenna Beers: coping skill and so I believe what your goal is, is to get to a place where you can work through childhood trauma and current trauma and around your mother. And that's a very big, big issue because there's clearly codependency

555
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.840
Serenna Beers: There in a very unhealthy way but

556
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:42.150
Serenna Beers: Mind you I I sure hope that you understand that I'm not judging you in any way. I wouldn't think of there to be anything less because you were presented with a job to take care of her, because your father wasn't there. So you just continue, continue that pattern right

557
00:52:43.170 --> 00:53:04.170
Serenna Beers: So that I think that there is some adjustments, along with the EM dr in behaviors that will help you to sustain the work that we do. So for example, if we are going to do some work around your trigger points of anger that are attached to all those past events.

558
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:15.840
Serenna Beers: Then I'm going to make sure that you understand going for four foot forward the additional work that you have to keep doing. And all that means is, Oh, hello.

559
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.290
Kennerh Blaine: I lost you for the last 30 seconds.

560
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.920
Kennerh Blaine: Oh,

561
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:25.110
Kennerh Blaine: Well, right after my trigger point

562
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:26.160
Serenna Beers: Okay loss.

563
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:42.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, so I, I just think that it's going to be a great place for us to start with your anger, because your anger has different branches. There's all kinds of events that are tied to anger, and if we just start there with what is your most

564
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:56.100
Serenna Beers: What is your most act activating event, then things will come up as we are doing the bilateral stimulation. So have I gone over with you the steps that we are going to do.

565
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:58.410
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

566
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.970
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, yes. And I'm doing some of that with Gabby to say

567
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.520
Serenna Beers: Okay, great. No, you're good.

568
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.950
Serenna Beers: Okay, good. That's right. Alright, so then for next week.

569
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:20.370
Serenna Beers: What I want you to do without you obsessing because I don't want you to, you know, think about all the things that you're angry about all week because then you'll be angry and we don't want that.

570
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:26.250
Serenna Beers: But I do want you to kind of maybe maybe right before our session just come up with what you

571
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:26.670
Think

572
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:45.750
Serenna Beers: In the present is the most significant trigger point for you, things that create dissension and anger and rage and create uncomfortable unity within your body as well as within your mental health, and that's the first one that will work on. What do you think about that.

573
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:58.080
Serenna Beers: I like it. Okay. All right. Well, then, for next Thursday at 8am. We will start, we'll probably spend the first 10 minutes just figuring out exactly what

574
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:09.120
Serenna Beers: activating event that we're going to go on and then we'll start the bilateral stimulation and then we will talk, talk about it after the end and see where we go from there.

575
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.260
Kennerh Blaine: Wonderful.

576
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:19.860
Serenna Beers: Alright, well, I think we have either group, are you in Doc, Doc. Dr. Ella.

577
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.730
Serenna Beers: Next Friday.

578
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.890
Serenna Beers: Friday. Okay, so I will see you

579
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:23.580
Later.

580
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.980
Serenna Beers: That's right. So I'll see you Friday at four right

581
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:37.890
Kennerh Blaine: Yes. Could you please spell me her last name, I need to give it to Gabby.
