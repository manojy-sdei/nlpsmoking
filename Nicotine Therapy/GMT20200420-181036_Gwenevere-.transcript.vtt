Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite you to find a place for me to land kind of prompt me up somewhere. I'm going to open up a note, while you kind of look around your environment and find a place where you can sit comfortably and the phone can rest.

7
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.650
Debbie Barker: And hopefully won't fall off.

8
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so used to it. Honestly, I will have a question about five times a day.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that like that spot actually is really good lighting like that turquoise

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. And you are so funny with the whole hair thing.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I was funny.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.950
Debbie Barker: I'll be glad when the beauty shops open back up my hair so long and can't do nothing with

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.030
Debbie Barker: Set Washington come back and it goes everywhere.

15
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone was telling me that they, it was. Oh, it was someone that

16
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A friend of mines husband, the people that he works with

17
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone at work bust her hair off. She was like, I can't deal with this. I'm just cutting it off.

18
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.220
Because

19
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know I'm not ready to do it either, but I was like, well,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.180
Debbie Barker: I know

21
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Was trying to pick

22
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:59.340
Debbie Barker: The last time I tried to cut my hair, I had to wear a hat for a couple of months and go to the beauty shop. Good. I said, Never again. Well I mess with my hair.

23
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's funny. That's funny. So you can't. You gotta get one of these kids years to learn how to cut hair so then they can keep on it.

24
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.130
Debbie Barker: I don't trust her.

25
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: She would do it on purpose and cut a little too short.

26
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.530
Debbie Barker: Right. Oh no, I just

27
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.990
Debbie Barker: She probably do an okay job, but I'd rather wait till the beauty shop opens

28
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go, well, what if it's another two months.

29
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.760
Debbie Barker: On. I don't know. Maybe I'll start wearing pigtails or something.

30
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.170
Debbie Barker: Where my head all the time.

31
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying.

40
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't wait can't quite put an image to these

51
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:14.490
Debbie Barker: I'm moved back. I went 94 to be closer to my family. I just got my sister left now. And two, and in fact, one has pneumonia and is in the hospital pretty worried about her.

59
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:09.420
Debbie Barker: Love for my sister to be able to do more. She can't read or write very well. But I want to get on Facebook, so she can at least look at the videos and stuff like that. I don't think you should enjoy that.

60
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.540
Debbie Barker: She's always looking over my phone when you know my children when I'm on my phone. So

61
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And does her. Does she have someone that's bedside with her, or she alone.

68
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.420
Debbie Barker: He was a real gifted young man.

71
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And these substances, don't mess around. I know when you know

72
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you know, I'm invincible. I can or not, you know, these are

Oh boy.

78
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the points you want to get across.

79
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.750
Debbie Barker: That certain people need to stop coming around.

80
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.830
Okay.

81
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.840

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.740
Debbie Barker: You know,

93
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.650
Debbie Barker: I don't know if she needs to do something to slow things down, we just

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.870
Debbie Barker: Don't know.

95
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.260

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Gotcha.

98
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.120
Debbie Barker: And it just hasn't been that way on and off.

99
00:07:52.290 --> 00:08:03.090
Debbie Barker: And of course my health hasn't been that great year lightly. I didn't sleep very much last night. I'm up for another back surgery and and knee surgery as soon as all this. Let's go song.

100
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.730
Debbie Barker: I just deal with it.

101
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.330
Debbie Barker: I sleep sometime and then sometime I don't want I don't sleep. I'm a harder time going with things.

102
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Really harder now that's normal. In other words, right, we

103
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't think straight when we're overtired we just can't.

104
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

105
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.560
Debbie Barker: One part of my body that was hurting. It wouldn't be so bad.

106
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:38.220
Debbie Barker: But I've got arthritis tomb and that you know comes and goes with certain days it's worse on certain days and then it's better on certain dates.

107
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: it last time when we were talking, is this the same person you were sharing

108
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I see. So she she has a boyfriend now. And his and he's mean is that the dealer.

109
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:06.540
Debbie Barker: Yeah, no, no, lives in Texas. I wish she would find somebody that would make her feel better about herself.

110
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.360
Debbie Barker: Instead of somebody that was mean.

111
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This friend that also gives her

112
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Her hookup. What is this, a friend from high school, or how long are they know each other.

113
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:41.880
Debbie Barker: I don't really know how long they've known each other. She moved out for time and move back to Clovis and was working for a guy up there and then with everything you know that started with the corona thing is business slumped down to almost a whole so she had to move back home.

114
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to communicate a point to her that you've I bet you've been trying to communicate it subtly

115
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

116
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it's now, you're not going to be not so subtle.

117
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to ask

118
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So how might it sound. I don't know you yet. I kind of want to get in and see how you talk to your daughter kind of want to get a sense of how communication goes over there.

119
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.550
Debbie Barker: Well, we don't yell and scream at each other or anything like that.

120
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I

121
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.350
Debbie Barker: Just want to set her down and talk to her. I'm tired of things. I just want things to slow down some

122
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.400
Debbie Barker: Wonder to get some kind of my life and in a better way to go.

123
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is the substance that she's using is it also an opiate

124
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.450
Yeah.

125
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:40.920
Debbie Barker: So,

126
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Would she would she be interested in in maybe checking out bright heart health.

127
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.370
Debbie Barker: Well as soon as she gets an idea we've been trying to help her get an ID. So hopefully when she gets her idea she can do this.

128
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to make sure when she does come in that she's not assigned to me what's Kathy and then she had the same last name, as you probably know,

129
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.300
Scheduling

130
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.150
Debbie Barker: same last name as me.

131
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be that she accidentally gets assigned, but I'll handle it from there. I'll just kind of have that in my background, just in case, I'll make sure that she she gets assigned to someone else, because there would be a conflict because

132
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.360
Debbie Barker: You know,

133
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.920
Debbie Barker: I can beat them.

134
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Out because I, you are my clients and your interests, your goals are ahead of

135
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, any distractions and I don't want you to everything. K. She said, or she said, so it's always better when our family members and their spouses and siblings are separate.

136
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: In group and an individual therapy. Yeah, I do. I do like this program. I've been really satisfied with with the work that people are doing in here. So, um, yeah. Let's get that ID. Okay. So let me ask you something.

137
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.740
Debbie Barker: One time

138
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you want to slow down.

139
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about what that means.

140
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:15.000
Debbie Barker: Just slowing down, doing, doing things any kind of money goes towards them. Don't go towards the house need to content right now and helping do

141
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So all her MONEY IS GETTING DIVERTED TO THE addiction.

142
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.920
Right.

143
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.290
Debbie Barker: Just a second.

144
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No, absolutely.

145
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.160
Debbie Barker: I'm just making sure

146
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.220
Debbie Barker: Making sure she wasn't in the kitchen, so she could overhear things. I don't want her to overhear things

147
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense to my offended.

148
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.830
Debbie Barker: Right only sit down and talk to her.

149
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.860
Debbie Barker: Wearing me down.

150
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.070
Debbie Barker: I love her and I want to help her. But she's going on 39 years old when

151
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. It's time. It's time to face it. We're not a kid anymore.

152
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.240
Debbie Barker: No, I'm worked hard all my life. For one, I have

153
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.950
Debbie Barker: I didn't want to go on so security when I did, but I couldn't work anymore.

154
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.540
Debbie Barker: I couldn't work pumping fame goes all the time in your

155
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.040
Debbie Barker: Your body just eventually gives in

156
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:39.360
Debbie Barker: And this last us and they done is come apart. So I have to go in and have that put back together.

157
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.090
Debbie Barker: I don't know if they're going to do my knee or my back. First, I want my need done first.

158
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.680
Debbie Barker: Sewing be a little more stable when they do my back surgery.

159
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Now for you, Debbie. When you have

160
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to look at difficult times in your life when you had to do, maybe a big growth spurt look at something in yourself that you didn't want to

161
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember back to how difficult it was to do that.

162
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:10.830
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

163
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.210
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

164
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So asking her to take a look at her behaviors of addiction is a big ask

165
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was just as easy as stop spending your money on

166
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: bluejeans

167
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That'd be one thing or but this has got another element to it.

168
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to

169
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.520
Debbie Barker: Have some kind of a goal.

170
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.880
Debbie Barker: You know, something to reach for

171
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.440
Debbie Barker: Student this everyday grind that she does.

172
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What is she doing during the day when she doing

173
00:14:50.340 --> 00:15:07.110
Debbie Barker: Things in a room, most of the time here lightning. She's eight Norway through the house. He's been gaining a little weight, which is fine. You know we got an extra food stamps here in New Mexico, which really didn't help out, you know, to stay at home more song.

174
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to work.

175
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.270
Debbie Barker: And mortar to

176
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:19.410
Debbie Barker: head towards some direction, you know, set some kind of a small goal for so

177
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And

178
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.720
Debbie Barker: Getting an ID.

179
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.800
Right.

180
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it like for you. In other words, I'm asking how you feel. I already know the logic. You've already kind of given me some stories. And this has to do with those feeling words we therapist. We love our feeling words.

181
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel having your daughter going through her struggle with addiction.

182
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: In your home while you're in your own recovery program. What's it. How are you feeling. What's an emotion you might be able to

183
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.350
Debbie Barker: It makes it really hard.

184
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes it hard. And what's the feeling

185
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.260
Debbie Barker: Makes it hard to stay away from things

186
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

187
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you some feeling words and see if there's any of these that ring true

188
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Staggered anxious know any of those, yo.

189
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you said yes to scared and anxious

190
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.520
Debbie Barker: You know, I had to send it to the hospital, three or four days ago.

191
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

192
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.920
Debbie Barker: Because I didn't know what I didn't know what if she took on something or

193
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:38.640
Debbie Barker: I wouldn't get no response, didn't know who I was, or anything else. And I wouldn't go to take a chance

194
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And that sounds smart. I think you were in group at that at that time. And that was going on.

195
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What about angry. Do you ever feel angry.

196
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:49.950
Oh, yo.

197
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.050
Debbie Barker: Yo,

198
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That one.

199
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.350
You know,

200
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.320
Debbie Barker: I don't have a very good relationship with my oldest one neither, but that's her choice.

201
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But this one with with Cassie, there's a chance and you don't want

202
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.450
Debbie Barker: Always been close. Yeah, always

203
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:24.660
Debbie Barker: We have our ups and downs, you know, but she's a good kid. And I know that she can do things if she just says her mind to it. You know, I would want seem like you would want to live the life than that.

204
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.700
Debbie Barker: I know I did.

205
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if you were to share a heartfelt story with her in your sit down and talking to her sort of setting her straight kind of thing.

206
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What story. Would you tell that you can relate to what she's going through right now. What story which you remember back to until that one boy, you look like how I felt when I was 2628 30. You know what I mean, like what story would you tell her.

207
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.070
Debbie Barker: My addiction wasn't nearly as bad as her wish.

208
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:09.780
Debbie Barker: I was always responsible on we tend to be and didn't have nobody else you know that didn't even lean on but myself.

209
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.210
Debbie Barker: So I really never got real bad. As far as

210
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.520
Debbie Barker: You know, being on it for a long time, or anything.

211
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So he can't quite relate to what she's doing. Is that what I'm hearing. It's just not yeah I don't quite and you don't quite understand how she could be doing

212
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So little with the support that you're giving her. Yeah.

213
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.730
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

214
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That probably won't get you the response you want

215
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm digging around for is a story about going after your dreams and what it felt like for you to not be able to reach them. That's the one you might be able to reach

216
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.540
Your

217
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.700
Debbie Barker: Health hard it was

218
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:06.450
Debbie Barker: To work and raise them at the same time and try to go through back surgeries that that was a big struggle but I get it.

219
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.430
Debbie Barker: I've had four back surgeries and raised both of them.

220
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And can you hear in Kathy's life how her life has been difficult.

221
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.880
Debbie Barker: Or you have been she's lost two husbands. The first one hung himself.

222
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So those two right you can start with empathy. So when we sit down with people, sometimes it's helpful to touch into

223
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a hard time. These are the ways it was hard for me, this is what I did to overcome it and was

224
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And then you've had these losses and this grief and this is how you're coping.

225
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you may need are coping skills that I don't know maybe you weren't able to teach because you didn't hadn't learned them at the time when she was a little girl or something.

226
00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's a heartfelt where it's not about just go get a goal. It's about two people really talking in a heartfelt way. Whoops. What's going on, I

227
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.450
Debbie Barker: Gotta dismissed it was my sister. Oh.

228
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you need to check on her.

229
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

230
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.370
Debbie Barker: No, I'll call her back.

231
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So a place to start when we sit down with people is empathy and compassion, you know, because probably if she's still in active addiction.

232
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay.

233
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:30.480
Yeah.

234
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.660
Debbie Barker: I just hear things going on in the kitchen.

235
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very likely of defensiveness to come up

236
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.620
Yeah.

237
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.040
Debbie Barker: So just thought back in my face about my addiction, so

238
00:20:50.730 --> 00:21:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so the message I'm trying to communicate right now is your daughter, the one that smart, funny loving affection and all those things that you know about her. That's not the person that's making the decisions right now the addicts, making the decisions.

239
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the thing.

240
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The attic.

241
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't going to listen to what you say.

242
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unlikely, and I know nobody likes here in this, but think about you. Like, could anyone have convinced you to stop doing whatever you were doing as far as the substance.

243
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you had to feel it, you had to feel the consequence of it. Am I right, like you had learned the hard way, let's say,

244
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't know what your limit is if you had to communicate what your limit is to her.

245
00:21:49.260 --> 00:22:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that limit. So you say, what about so and so. Can't come on the property, but are you able to follow through with your own boundaries, your own limitations of what you really and truly will follow through with

246
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.240
Debbie Barker: I think so.

247
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.580
Debbie Barker: Yeah, that up with the young

248
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's possible that if the addict is still making the decisions that limit will get breached, because an addict doesn't really care.

249
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.790
Debbie Barker: Park.

250
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your limit giving what will you not tolerate anymore. And what's the consequence if she does that behavior.

251
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.680
Debbie Barker: Keep keep coming over here and this continues, you just gonna have to go somewhere else.

252
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like to say that out loud.

253
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.580
Debbie Barker: It hurts. But I can run to

254
00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:00.840
Debbie Barker: Continue with dragging the house down. She needs to put in her Sarah to

255
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.360
OK. OK.

256
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.680
Debbie Barker: It shouldn't be on our shoulders to pay everything in to do everything all the time.

257
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When your daughter shows up when the addict. When the voice of the attic is quieted by your actual dog, the one that's like

258
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Mom, I need to deal with my grief and I'm so grateful to you, and thank you. I'm going to go start applying for jobs. Would you recognize the difference of who was actually talking to you.

259
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The BS artist or your actual daughter would you recognize the difference

260
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Down. Okay. Okay, good. Hold on to that because you're going to need it.

261
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the addict is going to guilt trip you call you names.

262
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.690
Debbie Barker: Throw your love.

263
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Your face and you

264
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Say I'm talking

265
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants you to get better. But in order for you to see. It's not okay for you to take advantage of me. I need to teach you to not take advantage of other people too. It's not okay.

266
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.840
Debbie Barker: Small

267
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the limit if I let you keep doing this. I'm not going to have food. I can't heal. I need to take care of myself to

268
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Drew. And so, the expectation is, and just really know knowing going into the conversation by the end of the month. Okay, I got you.

269
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment.

270
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.310
Okay.

271
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.470
Debbie Barker: Next one might be outside

272
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway,

273
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we do this again.

274
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: 27th at 12pm

275
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.290
Okay.

276
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.190
Debbie Barker: Well,

277
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.960
Debbie Barker: Sounds good. Gotta run down. I might get something better, the rights did on all my bills.

278
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:42.690
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

279
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and I wanted to ask you, so we've got April 27 at 12pm Mountain Standard Time. And then I want to ask you, I send these checks, like I sent a courtesy texts at night.

280
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Before, and I hadn't heard from you. So I was really concerned you weren't going to show up tonight.

281
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.170
Debbie Barker: I'm looking for, but I did not see it.

282
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me show you. Sometimes, and I've noticed this when they're going

283
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, when they're green. They don't always go through. So, this I sent you told them.

284
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I said in Queens and it looked kind of like this.

285
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.570
Debbie Barker: I did not get it.

286
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. So yeah, so I say o'clock, and then it says text me before seven o'clock Mountain Standard and so I'm sitting here going, oh last night. Yeah, but then I sent another one. Same thing, and nothing. So I was really concerned citizens.

287
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.600

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.790
Debbie Barker: No, no.

309
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: what I might do is either. I'll give you a quick call and it'll probably just it won't be to rush you off, but really I I'm doing an evening and I really just want to touch base would probably be like this. Have you just calling to confirm tomorrow at noon.

310
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.010
Debbie Barker: But we still

Gwenevere Abriel: Or I might assign it a care navigator to do it.

315
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.440
Debbie Barker: Kind of depends.

316
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: On how busy they are

317
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Some will do it that way. And I'm going to send myself a little reminder. So call

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful.

321
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.910
Debbie Barker: Now get that straight, now.

322
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, let's talk a little bit about your relapse prevention planning. Let's talk about the fun things that you like to do that are self soothing. For most people, they're like, what, I don't do anything nice for myself. What are you talking about

323
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people like to paint. They like to take more tell

324
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.960
Debbie Barker: Me can some stuff.

325
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you like to can

326
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.660
Debbie Barker: On one of my good things jelly

327
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me all about it.

328
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:34.740
Debbie Barker: We have

329
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.630
Debbie Barker: Oh no, I can't remember the name of the Durham bush.

330
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.680
Debbie Barker: I sound kind of a sour plum here.

331
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:57.840
Debbie Barker: That I'm making last time I entered the fair with for I've got I'm was number one out of 400 and something so that was pretty good mom would have been proud of me.

332
00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: My goodness. What's your love to give me away your recipe. But what's I've never can anything. I remember seeing my grandma and do that she would can peaches in Washington State. I remember seeing her do that.

333
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.690
Debbie Barker: That's all we ever knew his kids.

334
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'm like, What is this thing. You guys are doing. And so amazing. And then we would eat them later on.

335
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the

336
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Reward is

337
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.930
Debbie Barker: Black Eye Peas was one of my best that year.

338
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it hard, meaning how many hours would I have to put into it.

339
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.860
Debbie Barker: So a lot of steps.

340
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.750
Debbie Barker: A lot of being on your feet.

341
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.100
Debbie Barker: That kind of thing.

342
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:52.230
Debbie Barker: You got to cook them, you know, and then put them in your jar. You got to clean them up kind of then cook them and put them in your jars and then you got a pressure cooker them.

343
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.440
Debbie Barker: That's all we ever knew his kids.

344
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:04.530
Debbie Barker: My mom was raised on the farm and my grandfather, but boom corn did this area in 1965

345
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:16.440
Debbie Barker: One time that a lot of property out employed and formed with his brothers for years and years before it got so stove button.

346
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:27.660
Debbie Barker: Had to move into town. But he still drove trying to for the old boy he sold the property and stuff for. In fact, he died out in the middle of the field, doing what he loved to do

347
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be the way to go. I think I

348
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Always tell people I said I'll probably be standing here saying, how do you feel today.

349
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.090
Debbie Barker: Those are some of the

350
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:49.230
Debbie Barker: Better times of childhood, you know, being being out in the country and that sort of thing, because I was raised in Africa.

351
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.520
Debbie Barker: And big town and I missed to being in a small town and I miss being on the farm.

352
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.050
Debbie Barker: I wrote a minimal on a tractor.

353
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So canning. You have to be on your feet. You know what it makes me think.

354
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting to do fun things that you're not able to enjoy able I

355
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.560
Debbie Barker: Sit down to peel potatoes and things like daddy more

356
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.340
Debbie Barker: Work. I can't do a whole lot in on

357
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we need to go on a discovery journey and figure out some fun stuff because I want you to have joy and happiness and a hobby that doesn't require you on your feet.

358
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.080
You know,

359
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's keep thinking what is something that you've kind of thought when you were younger. This is something I wanted to try, but there was never any time you never really looked into it. What would be something that you would enjoy doing doesn't require standing on your feet.

360
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.340
Debbie Barker: Getting back into my art.

361
00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now. What kind do you like pen and ink pens charcoal page, what do you like

362
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:13.590
Debbie Barker: I don't know. It's been so long. Her father was a sign painter and I used to do cartoons and all kinds of things going to better cartoons and I ended anything

363
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.590
Debbie Barker: That he used to be able to draw anything

364
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever taken to

365
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking your trials and tribulations and taking that difficulty.

366
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And translating that into art. Have you ever done that.

367
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Or taking something that maybe was ugly to someone else and turning it into something beautiful.

368
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo. Yeah, that one.

369
00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I would challenge them to give that a try to say this is part of my recovery. This is part of what I can do, maybe even

370
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: After a surgery. I could make sure I have thing. So I'm not bored out of my mind I can be. If you enjoy doing drawing

371
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Then maybe it's about investing in colored pencils and maybe that's part of the conversation. Maybe it is charcoal. Maybe you want to go on a journey and experiment, all the ways

372
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can do artistically.

373
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not going to be able to do that if all of the money is diverted somewhere else. So it's

374
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.160
Debbie Barker: A lot of that already.

375
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You do. And what about

376
00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.450
Yeah.

377
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:34.830
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

378
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So, truth be told, you've got the material and you've got the paper. Have you been missing inspiration. What's been missing.

379
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.280
Debbie Barker: The inspiration to do anything you're likely. Yeah.

380
00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if you're putting on paper, your experiences helps you and helps others. What if you did some drawings and you decided I want to share it, maybe with daughter or with the group.

381
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I've had some tattoo artists that share their work. I've had people that do paintings in the back, they'll actually be doing them.

382
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If that feels good to you this idea that you're looking to sort of get some inspiration. I personally would love it.

383
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've always wanted to post people's art when with consent, obviously, on the bright Heart Health website wanted to, so to say, is personal. Let's bring in people's personal artwork things that they've done if they if you wanted to, but

384
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking something from a history and turning it in to something maybe beautiful maybe that could be an inspiration.

385
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.110
Debbie Barker: You know,

386
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you use for your cartoons. Would you say colored pencil ink pens, what would you do

387
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.250
Debbie Barker: Would probably start out with a pencil.

388
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah.

389
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And what cartoons, did you used to like when you were younger.

390
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:16.050
Debbie Barker: Think that they're all different kinds. What and somebody had a CB handle I could always come up with some kind of a drawing for one

391
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.980
Debbie Barker: And read on both sides of the truck, that kind of thing.

392
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you actually did you ever, like sell it.

393
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.170
Debbie Barker: You know,

394
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like it.

395
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:30.750
You know,

396
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.080
Debbie Barker: Dollars aside.

397
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.610
Nice.

398
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you just got so busy and had to stop.

399
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.300
Debbie Barker: Traffic

400
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.580
Debbie Barker: No.

401
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:59.310
Debbie Barker: Unload we separated and I moved down here and and got a divorce from payment on painting and

402
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.140
Debbie Barker: I moved. I couldn't be around him anymore. Yeah.

403
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if you left all that part of you behind too. And so maybe changing, changing the meaning and the feeling around doing art might be needed.

404
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.410
Debbie Barker: True.

405
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.250
Debbie Barker: I could get some my workout and look at it.

406
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at your old work.

407
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.190
Debbie Barker: Hey,

408
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:54.750
Debbie Barker: Maggie,

409
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:57.660
Debbie Barker: Baby

410
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.340
Debbie Barker: Somebody pulled up two dogs were barking.

411
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.040
Debbie Barker: Two dogs and cats in the house.

412
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Any a company

413
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, fuzzy company.

414
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.360
Debbie Barker: A lot of outdoor ones too.

415
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.260
Debbie Barker: I wouldn't have any other way. Got to have a cat.

416
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you hear your own idea just now.

417
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that idea.

418
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.150
Debbie Barker: About cats. Oh, looking at my own drawings

419
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

420
00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:40.980
Debbie Barker: Yo,

421
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice what was missing was the inspiration.

422
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Mail pulling those out, looking at him again.

423
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe that same old stuff from that other marriage that might be that might be done.

424
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.940
Debbie Barker: Yo,

425
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.230
Debbie Barker: Yo, he's gone.

426
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.200
Debbie Barker: That's over with, years and years ago.

427
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.140
Debbie Barker: He's only longer alive.

428
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.080
Debbie Barker: Unfortunately,

429
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.350
Debbie Barker: Today that story. One of these days.

430
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, it's a doozy.

431
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.320
Debbie Barker: It is

432
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.420
Debbie Barker: Interesting mind.

433
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I would love to hear about what it was like for you to even revisit some of that old work looking at it. I would love to hear next time or in group either one.
