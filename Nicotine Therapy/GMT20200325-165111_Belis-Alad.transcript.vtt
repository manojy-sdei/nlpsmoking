00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:21.570
angelina°: Yeah, I tried to in August and I, there was a situation where I had actually lost my phone. And so for the while I was actually struggling to get a phone use little own I was on my laptop.

14
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:31.440
angelina°: But I didn't really have, like, I don't know, I guess you could say the motivation at the time to continue. I didn't know my phone. I didn't have really anything I'm service so

15
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:48.810
angelina°: But I've been trying to I've been on a different track lately I've been trying, you know, to get my life together. Honestly I can't keep doing this, you know, I just got my driver's license. I just, you know, technically move back in with my mom. Okay.

16
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.680
angelina°: So there's little things that I want to change you. And I feel like it'd be. There's no reason not you know

17
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.870
Belis Aladag: Yeah, good for you to take charge again of your life and just sort things out and and then prioritize your health.

18
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.230
Belis Aladag: Because

19
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.300
angelina°: This is really important.

20
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.440
Belis Aladag: You know, I think.

21
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:20.580
Belis Aladag: It's I read through some of the notes. So I just want to kind of go through you confirm if it's correct. But I have here that around age you started with methamphetamine use

22
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.450
angelina°: Mm hmm.

23
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.760
Belis Aladag: And then age 17 you've started heroin like kind of to counter the effects of the meth. Was that right

24
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.010
angelina°: Right, okay.

25
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.430
Belis Aladag: And then it just became kind of combo use after that.

26
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:50.460
Belis Aladag: Right. Okay. Um, and then and then you did try for treatment. You tried to do like an inpatient detox, which didn't work. You know you relapse right after

27
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.130
angelina°: They kicked me out of the program.

28
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.200
Belis Aladag: Oh, they kicked you out.

29
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.990
angelina°: What wasn't really much of a kick out is more of like the let me be there for three days, but I didn't know what I was very

30
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.600
angelina°: Nice to know what to do at the time, huh.

31
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.000
Belis Aladag: Yeah. So you weren't offered medication like Suboxone at that time.

32
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:23.340
angelina°: No. Yeah. Well, at that time that I did that detox place in Cherry Hill and I was really struggling with methamphetamine really but

33
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.150
Belis Aladag: I see. Okay. So yeah, I see, I see.

34
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.650
Belis Aladag: And then

35
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:37.350
Belis Aladag: And then tell me what what and then you had some hold some psychiatric whole like eight times or something.

36
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.620
angelina°: Yeah, when I was a minor when you

37
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:48.150
Belis Aladag: Reminder, and was it at all related to like suicidal thoughts suicidal attempts or anything like that, or

38
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.140
angelina°: Well, and the

39
00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:01.620
angelina°: Light is can drag us. They say the drug use was like harming myself in a way. And then I was endangering myself the honestly

40
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.770
angelina°: Yeah, it was more. So just the drug use.

41
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.120
Belis Aladag: I

42
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:16.950
angelina°: Mean I had suicidal thoughts in the past, I had this looking. Sorry, excuse my language. I have those feelings, but I mean it was starting from the drug use and it just really mess with my head a lot, you know,

43
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.880
Belis Aladag: I bet. Yeah. Okay, so you've had the thoughts in the past, but you've never really had a true attempt

44
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.020
angelina°: Not that I could recall. No. Okay. And

45
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.700
Belis Aladag: Recently, do you feel like you're in danger of that at all, or we are, yeah.

46
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:43.020
angelina°: No, no, no. It's actually the opposite. I'm excited. I want. I'm really excited about all this. I'm like, you know, I woke up earlier than my alarm clock today.

47
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.180
Belis Aladag: Hey, that's a positive. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, okay, good. So you're in a good place.

48
00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:05.280
Belis Aladag: And tell me about other medications. I see. Was there a history at some point you were diagnosed with depression and diagnosed bipolar. Did they treat you for these things, or do you think

49
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.960
Me.

50
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:23.040
angelina°: When I was like 1716 1718 they gave me Abilify circle. I mean, they put me on a whole bunch of different ones like Lexapro, it would be on

51
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:38.970
angelina°: So they put me on all kinds of one well because none of them really work. They were just making me like like a zombie or disrupt jury. So then I just stopped in a circle just put me to sleep like I'd say I'm 17 our street and it just wasn't

52
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:50.520
angelina°: You know wasn't working for me. So I just, I came to me personally that my anxiety anxiety medication that actually did help me a lot.

53
00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:01.920
angelina°: Because if I didn't have the anxiety. I wouldn't get the depression. I wouldn't get, you know, the mood swings. So trainings, he was smiling big thing, but

54
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.400
angelina°: I haven't been on any medication, since I was about 19

55
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.430
Belis Aladag: Okay 19 was the last time you were on any of those psychiatric meds.

56
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.350
angelina°: Taking

57
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.760
Belis Aladag: And how old are you know 2222 okay

58
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.660
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, and the Suboxone okay so so you first introduced to this him from us was that, is that right

59
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.440
angelina°: Right knows you guys in August.

60
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.230
Belis Aladag: In August. Okay. And how did that go for you, you're

61
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.770
angelina°: Twice.

62
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.620
angelina°: You like David. Yes.

63
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:46.260
Belis Aladag: It should really work well to help you feel normal not have cravings and just kind of get on with your life.

64
00:06:48.240 --> 00:07:04.770
Belis Aladag: And so that's great. And if it can help you keep your mind away from that stuff from the temptation. Hopefully you'll make good choices. I mean, obviously it's not it's not, you still have to do work to stay sober, but

65
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.460
angelina°: Yeah.

66
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.290
Belis Aladag: It's a huge help. Right.

67
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:15.720
angelina°: Right, and it's honestly it's I don't like the fact where I have to plan things out based on having enough to get me through the day.

68
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:28.680
angelina°: That's ridiculous. I have to plan out that I'll have some heroin for a doctor's appointment for if I want to go see a family member. If I want to hang out with somebody, if I want to do this, do that like it's it's

69
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:44.280
angelina°: It's ridiculous. And I can't, I don't want to live my life around a bag. That's not what I want. It's not. It's not me. In general, it's just, you know, it's like I'm fighting with another person that's not me.

70
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:50.220
angelina°: Yeah, I can't live me unless I have that answer ridiculous. I just one, you know,

71
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.810
Belis Aladag: Get over it. Yes.

72
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.830
angelina°: It's not, I want to do. I can't do anything I want to do because it

73
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.360
Belis Aladag: Yet it's so limited, you must be

74
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.590
angelina°: Crazy really yes

75
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.700
It's not

76
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.790
Belis Aladag: So okay, so you've been using it IV with math as well. Still

77
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.440
angelina°: Yeah.

78
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.270
Belis Aladag: Okay. When was the last time you today earlier.

79
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:23.310
angelina°: Well, I mean, because I when I heard that I was going to have this doctor's appointment, um, last night, they called me.

80
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:39.690
angelina°: So last night was the last time I took what I use a shot because I thought, you know what I mean by the time that I would see the doctor that you know I get some hours and stop, you know, because I know there is some type of detox that you have to do beforehand. Right.

81
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.730
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I want you to be ready to take it. And so, yeah, it's great that you stopped last night. You seem uncomfortable.

82
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.720
angelina°: Yeah. OK.

83
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.380
Belis Aladag: So the good news is I'm going to prescribe you the medication and

84
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.920
Belis Aladag: And if you're

85
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.450
Belis Aladag: Uncomfortable. That's usually a sign a good sign. I mean, if you have physical

86
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.470
Belis Aladag: Are you feeling restless. Do you feel pain. Do you feel

87
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.230
angelina°: Me. Are you still kind of like out of breath, my, my eyes won't stop watering and

88
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.970
angelina°: Watering yeah I can't sit still and just feel like, you know, just I will

89
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:25.560
Belis Aladag: Not so good feeling. Okay. So the good news is you're in probably sufficient withdrawal because you would use now right

90
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.980
angelina°: Normally, yeah, oh yeah, I would have been used like five hours ago.

91
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:39.300
Belis Aladag: So, so, so it's a good sign that your body is ready your receptors are emptying out and they're ready to to get the Suboxone it. Okay.

92
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:46.080
angelina°: I think I last used was maybe because I went to bed around maybe like 1230 so yeah

93
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.710
angelina°: Did around 12:12am okay yeah

94
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.850
Belis Aladag: And now we're 10am so okay 10 hours. So you should be

95
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:08.130
Belis Aladag: You should be ready. You seem uncomfortable enough. The reason we want to wait, rather than take it too soon, is if you take it too soon, it kicks off whatever's left of the opioids and it makes you feel worse so

96
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.860
Belis Aladag: Right worse, right.

97
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:25.230
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I'm it look if that happens, something in the world, you'll get through it. It just needs some time and it'll pick up but but i you look uncomfortable enough that I think it'll be okay to take your first dose.

98
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.690
Belis Aladag: And you were on eight milligrams films twice a day that was

99
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.950
Belis Aladag: Looking okay for you.

100
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:43.530
angelina°: And it wasn't too much too little. So what I liked about it. I mean, I honestly back then. I felt I remember correctly, is that I was worried about my still felt a little jittery

101
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.820
angelina°: And a little bit like uncomfortable like towards four hours later, after I took the

102
00:10:47.820 --> 00:11:02.820
angelina°: First one. So that's why I took the second one, but I didn't know if left with more more was live. I didn't know how that goes about bit. I mean, it's a good starting dose. Definitely. Yeah, I don't know anything at this point I'm ready to try it.

103
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.100
Belis Aladag: Okay.

104
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:13.920
Belis Aladag: So we'll start with one. So, take one film and then and then see how you feel. Okay. And then, and then, like you said,

105
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:23.820
Belis Aladag: You know, just relax into it. See if it how long in the whole do and then before you know in the afternoon, you take the second one and see if that twice a day dosing works for

106
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.310
angelina°: You if

107
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:43.470
Belis Aladag: If that first dose is like you're still not comfortable after one full film and you're like, I don't know. I don't feel so right, then you can take the second maybe a half of the second one right after. And so it's more like one and a half in the

108
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.490
angelina°: Same time

109
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.420
Belis Aladag: Yeah. At the same time, like, back to back, give it like maybe a

110
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:59.130
Belis Aladag: Half hour to kick in and then if you're like Wow. This still doesn't feel right. I think I need a little bit more than do another half film. So then you do one and a half technically

111
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.540
Belis Aladag: And right there, half, you could do maybe before bed and then see how you

112
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.200
Okay.

113
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.340
Belis Aladag: See if you can do it that way and do one and a half and half.

114
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.510
angelina°: And then see ya.

115
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.160
angelina°: Maybe that's a good idea.

116
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.360
angelina°: That will

117
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:33.990
Belis Aladag: Stick to to a day but you're just kind of split it a little that way. Um, and then if it's still not enough. We'll talk about it, but OK. So the way we're going to meet in is in groups. Um, I have some options for you. There is a women's group on Mondays at 10

118
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.350
Belis Aladag: That works or there's a Thursday 4pm group.

119
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.400
angelina°: I'd like to 4pm veteran. Don't you like better.

120
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:50.040
Belis Aladag: Okay, cool. Um, so I'm going to put you in that group. So

121
00:12:51.270 --> 00:13:07.170
Belis Aladag: So I'm gonna see. So that's tomorrow I'm, I'm wondering if we should wait. You think you'll be okay. Do you want to meet tomorrow to say, okay, went okay it didn't go okay, or would you rather just try to do this one and a half, and then a half for like a week and then see I

122
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:13.590
angelina°: Read us a week first honestly just to get in the mood of things but yes do that.

123
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.620
Belis Aladag: Let's do that. I'm also going to prescribe you know our can you know what that is. Reversal agent.

124
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.030
angelina°: Right. And yet, in the note.

125
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:29.130
Belis Aladag: It's just good if you're living with your mom to say, hey, Mom, I'm in treatment. I'm going to be okay. But if you ever find me pass. Now, you don't know why it doesn't hurt.

126
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.250
angelina°: Yeah, that's good idea. Probably. Anyways, you know,

127
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.030
Yeah.

128
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.540
Belis Aladag: You could also use it on other people. It's

129
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:45.540
angelina°: Okay I want more, but I wouldn't really I don't really see myself trying to hang out with other people.

130
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.340
Belis Aladag: Yeah, please don't because, I mean,

131
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.960
angelina°: Yes. You want to like
