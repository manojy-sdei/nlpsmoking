368
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.130
I'm

369
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.070
Angelo Sanchez: Just in the center. I know I'm pushing too hard though. Okay.

370
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.950
Angelo Sanchez: Not, not bad. A

371
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.740
Angelo Sanchez: Good kind of strong stuff.

372
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.950
Chris Alliman MD: Sounds good. Alright.

373
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.440
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so

374
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.080
Chris Alliman MD: We want to work with you and see what we can do around the whole Suboxone thing.

375
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:46.380
Chris Alliman MD: There you are going to need to get a primary doctor and I would recommend that you get back in with the psychiatrist and work with the mental health issues through psychiatry. Okay.

376
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:53.100
Chris Alliman MD: I think that's going to be pretty important for you as you keep trying. As you work on getting the job and holding things down.

377
00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:09.720
Angelo Sanchez: All right. Yeah, there is a one anti-psychotic it's a new one. It's called Abilify is what last one okay injectable formed us taking need to happen. Do injectable form even quicker.

378
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:16.170
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, yes. So, so certainly talking with them about that option. I think would be a good idea for you.

379
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.460
Angelo Sanchez: But insurance.

380
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:29.820
Chris Alliman MD: In terms of our program. Well, we offer is we have weekly group visits, like we're doing now, but there's like five to 10 patients a provider, like myself, and then also a therapist.

381
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.310
Chris Alliman MD: Right. So together we have once a once a week hour long group visits.

382
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.320
Chris Alliman MD: And then you also do

383
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:44.970
Chris Alliman MD: Once a week. Individual therapy visits on the computer with the therapist. So it just be you and the therapist also

384
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.660
Chris Alliman MD: Does that sound doable to are you able to do two meetings a week. Each for an hour.

385
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.820
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah that's fine shouldn't be any real problem at all. Good, good.

386
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.960
Chris Alliman MD: So we need to figure out a good meeting time and

387
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.520
Chris Alliman MD: I have a good group that's available on Friday at 12 noon, would you be available on Fridays at 12 noon.

388
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.850
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, I should be. I mean, I don't know how I work schedules used to be my

389
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.950
Angelo Sanchez: Time in primary

390
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.850
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so when that happens, we can look at adjusting things. That's fine.

391
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.750
Angelo Sanchez: If we need to

392
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.180
Chris Alliman MD: But I think this would be a good way to start out

393
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.260
Angelo Sanchez: Now, sounds good. Okay. You just fine.

394
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:42.180
Chris Alliman MD: So the way that works out is just like today when you called into the virtual clinic and they gave you the zoom room number. The same thing happens. You have to call in about 20 or 30 minutes beforehand.

395
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.880
Angelo Sanchez: Oh yeah, I'm sorry about

396
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.440
Angelo Sanchez: Sorry about that. I forgot some apologize because I, I went to the

397
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.240

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:10.410
Angelo Sanchez: Video greeting. There's just like two or I mean 815 is. I mean, I know like a 16 or something like 30 minutes and push that button so down waiting

399
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.000
Chris Alliman MD: Gotcha.

400
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:24.990
Chris Alliman MD: So, so, calling into the virtual clinic is just like going to the doctor's office or calling the doctor's office. There's always a line of people. And there's always paperwork to do. Okay.

401
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:26.010
Angelo Sanchez: So,

402
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:33.180
Chris Alliman MD: So we don't want you to wait until about five minutes before the clinic starts to call in, because you're not going to get in and time.

403
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:40.800
Chris Alliman MD: We want to call in about 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time so you can work your way through the line and get everything done that needs to get done.

404
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.230

419
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:21.300
Chris Alliman MD: So knowing how much Suboxone you were taking I would suggest that we work with three films a day for you. That's the maximum amount that's the highest, we can go on it.
