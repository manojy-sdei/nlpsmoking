Wayne Dal: Only getting better.

12
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, how you doing, how you feeling

13
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.410
Wayne Dal: Good, I'm good. Today I went back to one and a half milligrams

14
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.510
Wayne Dal: As I was having a hard time with one I was having a lot of cravings.

15
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.090
Wayne Dal: And I just didn't feel like myself like I get

16
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.970
Wayne Dal: Busy kind of dizzy feeling

17
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.540
Wayne Dal: And I was like, no, week after going down to one. So I had another sweats, though.

18
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.540
Wayne Dal: It was just hard and you know like the doc said yesterday, it's just my body, you know, getting used to.

19
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.720
Wayne Dal: You know that very low dose of medication.

20
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if next time we go about it, we do it like point two five.

21
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.810
Wayne Dal: Yeah, that's what meeting.

22
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.750
Wayne Dal: Talked about yesterday was just took down

23
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.940
Wayne Dal: Half a milligram

24
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.670
Wayne Dal: Even less

25
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.610
Wayne Dal: And as you said, just take it real slow. So my take that advice and

26
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.370
Wayne Dal: And run with it.

27
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.470
Wayne Dal: You know, I was, uh,

28
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.370
Wayne Dal: I don't know. It was just a weird feeling that I had. And it's, it's kind of scary to the same time you remember me. Yeah.

29
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend a little bit of time talking about that. Let's, let's not because this is something new. We haven't seen this one in a while. So let's spend some time with it. Let me open up a note here last time we met was March 17

30
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.400
So,

31
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't need to review treatment plan review, unless you think you're not going to see me until after April 17 we need to meet within

32
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 days for individual therapy. So do you think we should review some of the goals today. If you don't think we're going to meet before the 17th of April.

33
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.690
Wayne Dal: I think we should really meet before the 17

34
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, great, let's do this. Let's go do that up front.

35
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.760
Wayne Dal: Like every two weeks.

36
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so. Oh, it'll work. If it's the 14th. It'll work perfectly.

37
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.980
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think, or it could do the 14th what days.

38
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's like what we're doing now. It's a Tuesday at eight.

39
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.810
Wayne Dal: Yeah yeah that'll work.

40
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll give you a quick text, hopefully been pretty good about the day before sending people messages of confirmation

41
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.850
Wayne Dal: For 14 yeah

42
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Am set your alarm.

43
00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.330
Wayne Dal: You know 737 45 beautiful bird now with my new puppy gets me a birdie.

44
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I just tell you, I wanted to find a nice little segue to talk about your puppy that you were bringing on the screen. I just couldn't do it. But I was just, it was so fantastic seeing that

45
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is adorable.

46
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.950
Wayne Dal: Yeah, he was he was here at my feet. I

47
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.210
Wayne Dal: Need to get on my lap. So I

48
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.460
Wayne Dal: Had to put them up here yesterday.

49
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.930
Wayne Dal: I did.

50
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.210
Wayne Dal: You know, I didn't want him to be a distraction or anything. So it kind of put them down right away but

51
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are good distractions. It's nice to have a laugh. Some of our content gets pretty serious sometimes so

52
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice to lighten it up.

53
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see we got to tell

54
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:52.920
Wayne Dal: Her. I had a question. I was wondering about somebody in this, you know, I don't need to know what's going on. But just to know that they're okay, as well. Kenya. I haven't seen him for

55
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.160
Wayne Dal: A long, long time. Is he doing okay.

56
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it's not for me to say, All I can say is

57
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, what can I say

58
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.100
Wayne Dal: This is he, is he still on the program.

59
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I don't think I can.

60
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.140
Say,

61
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think I can do that.

62
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.720
Wayne Dal: Well, I'm just, I just wondered, because I haven't seen him for such a long time. You know, I was just wondering

63
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I can do this for quite a while there was nothing to worry about.

64
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.450
Currently, I don't know.

65
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.270
Wayne Dal: Well, I hope he's doing okay yeah this is someone that you know I was used to see

66
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:55.860
Wayne Dal: A lot, you know, and I haven't seen him for quite a while and you know I know people, you know, go to different groups and stuff to fit their schedules, but it was just something I've been thinking about, you know, just the people like yesterday and in group.

67
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.980
Wayne Dal: Just thinking about the people that are used to see all the time on. I don't see them anymore so

68
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.350
Wayne Dal: You know, you get used to seeing these faces and then you don't see him and then you get to wondering if they're okay. Yep, you know,

69
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It. So there's a lot of

70
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.340
Wayne Dal: Things going on.

71
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. Sometimes it is schedule. Sometimes if they dropped out. Sometimes it's their arm every other week. You know how you don't come every

72
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Week times there's an alternation there. Sometimes there are relapses sometimes, you know, they can't afford it and their insurance lapses. I mean, there's so many different things that happen to people. Sometimes it's a bad fit with me. It doesn't happen very often.

73
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes it's I need to go to a different therapist and I concur that it's a bad fit. It's pretty rare. I like everybody. So it's very rarely something around that.

74
00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But they may be triggered in some real specific way around something going on with me or maybe. Since Dr. Aubrey hell is my mother, there can be some weird kind of things in there. You don't know what it is. Right. I mean, it's so complicated could be any number of those things.

75
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So just just kind of going with that though. Just notice what it's like to wonder, is that part and parcel to this recent. How am I doing in my own recovery, you know, how am I doing I'm having cravings wonder if he had a relapse like is that kind of the same.

76
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.310
Wayne Dal: That's kind of, you know, I, yeah, I do think about that, you know,

77
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:51.210
Wayne Dal: And that's, that's why I've been thinking about it, because I've, I've been spending a lot of time at home, cuz we're really slow. Now the office so you know my wife, you know, she's, she's going to work. And I'm basically staying here and and

78
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.920
Wayne Dal: You know, like this topic came up yesterday and

79
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:06.690
Wayne Dal: No, it does bring back some some feelings of back when I was in my funk and, you know, being alone.

80
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.000
Wayne Dal: And you just do a lot of thinking

81
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.640
Wayne Dal: You know, because I i

82
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.520
Wayne Dal: Hear it was just chaotic here a few months ago and now it's just like, whoa.

83
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.980
Wayne Dal: You know, it's just like

84
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.510
Wayne Dal: Too much money.

85
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:35.010
Wayne Dal: It's what I wanted. You know, I mean, but I don't know. It was just, I just had a lot of time alone and just a lot of time to think and then all this happened, you know,

86
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.710
Wayne Dal: Maybe it was maybe it is a trigger. You know, I thought

87
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's lay down on this a little bit. Originally it was I want. Meantime, you've got the meantime.

88
00:08:48.600 --> 00:09:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was on your terms that was, I want to get up, I want to have these half hours. I want to spend time with my wife. I want a nice smooth flow. If I want to make a breakfast. If I want to walk my dog if I want to sit and watch TV that was on your terms.

89
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.000
Wayne Dal: And don't get me wrong, I enjoy it. You know, I'm happy.

90
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but something not in your control. Not on your terms is happening. You are not working as much and you are now and a stay home order from your governor something, aren't you

91
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.990
Wayne Dal: Yeah yeah

92
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.350
Wayne Dal: So just, it just kinda reminds me

93
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

94
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:48.750
Wayne Dal: I resigned from my job at the county and you know I was heavily doing pills and drinking very much and it was kind of rings back to those kind of feelings. Yep. You know, I mean,

95
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that is is it's and it didn't touch on it and group, a little bit.

96
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. That boredom in and of itself, that being alone up sitting on the couch watching something the temperature of the room, something in the air. I don't have anything to do

97
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be a trigger, it's so bizarre. It's just this kind of thing. Like, where did that come from. And then the thought comes so

98
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Boredom but

99
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't ask for this. It's imposed on you.

100
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now just curious. This that when you resigned from the county

101
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That was on your terms right

102
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.180
Yes.

103
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.870
Wayne Dal: Well yeah, I was really sick.

104
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.580
Wayne Dal: Just

105
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.700
Wayne Dal: A lot of stress and

106
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.540
Wayne Dal: I was, I was really getting sick, you know, it was developed gas tonight is

107
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.290
Wayne Dal: My blood pressure was back to the roof.

108
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.550
Wayne Dal: I just couldn't take it there anymore.

109
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:09.120
Wayne Dal: You know, I was in a supervisor position and I was babysitting adults all day was just

110
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.470
Wayne Dal: It just and my boss was total ass.

111
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.150
Wayne Dal: And

112
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.270
Wayne Dal: I just got fed up with it in in when I developed that guest tonight is, you know, like

113
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.110
Wayne Dal: Literally serious and the doctor told me you know

114
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:41.250
Wayne Dal: No stress. No. No more drinking and I just had to make a decision. You know my health. It was more important than the job and benefits so

115
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.720
Wayne Dal: You know I talked it over with my wife and my kids.

116
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.720
Wayne Dal: Decided to resign.

117
00:11:50.610 --> 00:12:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's somewhere in between. This was my decision and not my decision. It was a bit of a push, because you couldn't change the environment. So there's a little bit of that.

118
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really what you wanted, with the job itself. Was it a good income and you felt capable and intelligent and there's a good fit. As far as jobs go

119
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.830
Wayne Dal: Definitely. It was a very good paying job yeah

120
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:27.330
Wayne Dal: Yeah, sorry. I was, you know, I did feel I felt good in where I wasn't in my position.

121
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.920
Wayne Dal: And it's

122
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:40.530
Wayne Dal: You know, I just now. I think about it and I have a little regret.

123
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

124
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.440
Yeah.

125
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.490
Wayne Dal: Because I had 17 years and there

126
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.500
Wayne Dal: You know, I needed 25 retire. Sometimes I look at now. And can I see. Damn, I would only have five more years.

127
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.010
Wayne Dal: You know, and I'd be done.

128
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:01.320
Wayne Dal: So,

129
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.650
Wayne Dal: There, there is just a little regret, sometimes, you know, I should have stuck it out.

130
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.090
Wayne Dal: At that time I just I just couldn't do it.

131
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:20.070
Wayne Dal: And I do blame my my my dependence a lot on my decision.

132
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.150
Wayne Dal: So it's, it's something I think about sometimes but you know I am much happier now and you know I love my job that I have now and

133
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.690
Wayne Dal: And even been talking to my wife about going out on my own and doing what I do for myself and

134
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.320
Wayne Dal: Working for myself.

135
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.500
Wayne Dal: So that's my new

136
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.190
Wayne Dal: Goal is to start my own business.

137
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How

138
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Would I do. How let me hear numbers on that one. How

139
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Important is it that you get your own business, zero to 10

140
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.990
Wayne Dal: No, it's a tune

141
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:17.100
Wayne Dal: Really yeah I'm I want to start making money. You know, I see all the money I'm making for our bosses and seeing the, you know, pennies. I call pennies that we get, you know,

142
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.450

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to own my own business. Did I phrase that as a goal as a good one.

Gwenevere Abriel: Land consulting land consulting. Okay. And I got you today.

151
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: 331 28 out of 10 How confident are you that you can do this from zero to 10

152
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.350
Oh,

153
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:19.200
Wayne Dal: I would say it's a 10 I'm very confident because I do have the experience. I do have the knowledge you know I know how to get things done to these government agencies and real confidence doing it. Okay.

154
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, first step can be one step that can be done within the next

155
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say seven to 14 days little step a call an application a certification some little thing and investigation and research that can be done in the next 14 days.

156
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:56.400
Wayne Dal: Well, now it's kind of hard because of all this stuff that's going on, you know, I haven't been able to to go and talk to people at the city or the county and let them know that you know to start forwarding some of these applicants to me as opposed to my boss. So it's crazy.

157
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But everybody's everybody's

158
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.980
Wayne Dal: Yeah, so

159
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Use your get creative right now and think, What can I do

160
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To set up a business. Now, it might not be the marketing, which you are just talking about where you're doing networking. What else could you do

161
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.010
Wayne Dal: I could probably

162
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.530
Wayne Dal: Reach out to some individuals via email or text.

163
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you do a network in zone. Could you hold a little meeting and a little powwow

164
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.560
Wayne Dal: I don't know. Because a lot of those well I guess they could set something

165
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, say, hey, I want to talk to you want to show you this really cool thing, and you actually

166
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You dress professionally and you're actually chat with them in here kind of be funny about it. And this is kind of the new way. You know, I would rather have sat down and met with you, you know, over lunch.

167
00:16:53.220 --> 00:17:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But with our new situation, how about we meet and zoom in, show you it's really cool. And hey, we can do it with your friends and you're turning them on to something you're teaching them something

168
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of I'm telling you, I'm trying to get everybody to kind of see this is a way we can connect

169
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.820
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I like that idea.

170
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:20.220
Wayne Dal: I really like this, zoom, zoom stuff. So that's a really good idea. I'm writing stuff down. Okay.

171
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wrote down. I could reach out to people for networking opportunity.

172
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And when do you think you could do that if you set yourself a goal, and I'll write it down, but make it something that you think you can do

173
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.410
Wayne Dal: I would say within the next week. Okay.

174
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: next seven days.

175
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:54.660
Wayne Dal: And I can also, you know, I have a space here at home where I can have no office. I can start setting stuff up.

176
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I could create an office.

177
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.800
Wayne Dal: Is going to get a laptop and stuff so I can get stuff ready here.

178
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

179
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:03.870
You know,

180
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're in an office, you'll do office things

181
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.030
Right.

182
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, notice how it's not just what you can't do not focusing on the limitations and the constraints, see this as an opportunity because guess what we're all going through it.

183
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All of us.

184
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And more that you get into the solution and focus completely in this new ignited passion that you have for this business.

185
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That other thinking will be there. You won't be bored. You'll be preoccupied with Creative Problem Solving what to other people do going online, what are other people doing

186
00:18:51.780 --> 00:19:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of like what is networking look like now in a you know a shelter status like go dive into getting information. This is the time to be getting more information about marketing under these kind of environments.

187
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of, I wish I had worked there for 25 years. Look at the difference

188
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did you see it.

189
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.510
Wayne Dal: Was

190
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them makes you feel like crap and the other one gets you excited

191
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.500
Wayne Dal: Yeah, yeah, just talking about, you know, this gets me excited

192
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And all it is is one step at a time. Maybe today it's I'm going to write a list and I'm going to pull out 10 items from a cluttered corner in my office. I'll go through one box and I will shred 10 pieces of paper. I'm talking about small steps.

193
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.510
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

194
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then because I know, in reality, what happens is typically once we go do that. We're like, oh this wasn't as hard as I thought. I'm just going to clear out this whole counter or I'll plug in one chord.

195
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, well, now I kind of want to know if the fax machines actually going to work. Okay, I'll turn the computer on well now I kind of want to know if I can fact something, it just snowballs.

196
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you set yourself something to do you go to it. Don't wiggle out of it do something, you know, you can actually do and then it'll probably snowball, but ours will pass and all that negative thinking

197
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're distracted yourself you're completely focused on and it's an investment in your future. There is nothing you can do about the past. The only good that

198
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing that it's good for is to say

199
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I learned my lesson, I cannot. I cannot put my body and my mind. Second, I have to put recovery. First, everything's at stake.

200
00:20:46.470 --> 00:21:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A long term job like the negative consequence we visit the past to say I learned my lesson I want you that again. That's it. That's it. You don't linger there and shame yourself and what a turkey, you are you spend one sentence thought on that.

201
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it.

202
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Say thank you. I learned my lesson, I will not do it again. I will do the next healthy thing.

203
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And the next healthy thing will happen. I'll do the next right thing. The next thing will happen. And here I go. What is it I write it down. Is this something I can do in the next hour. Yes, I can. I go do it. I don't overthink it.

204
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I do the five second rule I sort of stand up I count 54321 I'm already over there. I'm already doing it. Why would I stop now. I've already started.

205
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You pick up the phone, you start dialing 505 Boom, I got a call. It's going to be the Baba, Baba.

206
00:21:44.490 --> 00:22:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you just go you're excited if while you're at a 10 your intent and importance and attended confidence. Dude, I would be I would be like, Stop the presses. I now have a lot of time I have the motivation and confidence. I think this is it. This is your moment.

207
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

208
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: On zoom. Isn't this cool. Look at this.

209
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you can be teaching people and look at the confidence that has, and I know like I've got these ideas for land, blah, blah, blah. You know how to share the screen you can show them reports, you're working on, you can show them sketches, you can be doing stuff just just, just like that.

210
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:26.730
Do

211
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own website, your own domain name you already. Maybe you're building a website. I mean, there's so much to do with your own business.

212
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Be the first guy out there to get in.

213
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.890
Wayne Dal: Here, I think that's important to get my information out there.

214
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.830
Wayne Dal: So website. Yeah.

217
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.350
Wayne Dal: Let my wife retire her. She wants to help she can help. If not, she can

218
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:14.790
Wayne Dal: You

221
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.060
Wayne Dal: That's, that's my goal. She's taking care of me for a long time. So, you know, I want to

222
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.630
Wayne Dal: Take care of her.

223
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what are you noticing as we're talking. Now, notice how your mind has changed how your mindset has changed. How do you describe what's going on and that brand new years

224
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.040
Wayne Dal: Well, I have

225
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.740
Wayne Dal: Excitement

226
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.890
Wayne Dal: And I have a

227
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.670
Wayne Dal: Little tingling sensation in my head.

228
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:04.440
Wayne Dal: You know, feels it just feels good. Feels good to talk about it and to think about it.

229
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And did I invent anything new. No.

230
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how this is happening in zone. This is happening through social discussion. You want to be talking to people. It gets you that tingling excited good feeling.

231
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It just ignites we are we're charged up by by talking with you. I'm fine. That's great. What, what would you do, what do you guys think, and you might offer a great idea. They might offer a great idea.

232
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, off we go. You could be onto something really blows up right now because of the constraints we have what you're doing to build up these networks, while everyone else is in fear. You are confidence is continuing and it's showing

233
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not daunted by it. I would want to work with someone who continues to be confident during this time.

234
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Very cool. So let's review some of the things you are saying you were having some triggers. So let's just see what some of the things you've said in the past relationship.

235
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, are there any dynamics going on in your relationship where not feeling loved is happening.

236
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Is there anything happening around

237
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

238
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Not putting your needs. First you

239
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.770
Know,

240
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:48.300
Wayne Dal: There's, I don't know how to say it. There's nothing going on like that.

241
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:51.960
Wayne Dal: I just

242
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:59.460
Wayne Dal: I don't know where these where everything came from. I was doing good. And all of a sudden

243
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.450
Wayne Dal: It was like a change my thinking but

244
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.660
Wayne Dal: people on my team was

245
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.950
Wayne Dal: Was disrupted.

246
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But it looks the same out here. Look. Look at what you did. You said

247
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I was how did you feel, I felt good in the position that other job is County.

248
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to quit.

249
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I love my job. Now I have to stay home and look the same.

250
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So to me it looks the same. You're bored. You want to be working, you can't work. They look the same. So to me it doesn't look like a big surprise. It looks the same as this other one

251
00:26:50.790 --> 00:27:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted to be there working for slightly different reasons but doesn't matter wanted to be working life to the job can't do the job have to stay home. I didn't choose this, I want to be working

252
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And that I think is what is getting triggered you're calling it boredom. Right.

253
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's this. I want to be. I'm a productive capable, man. I want to be working right now. I can't. This socks. The sense of helplessness.

254
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is no fun. So when you dipped into it and you marinated in that thinking it continued to cultivate sounds like you had distress increase pain and we had an increase of self medicating

255
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: put a pin in it and we're playing around. As soon as we started talking about brainstorming ideas are you thinking about pain we thinking about anxiety or you just jazz.

256
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.690
Wayne Dal: Knows those girls jazz. Yeah.

257
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's where thought stopping comes in that's, that's where we go

258
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I do this deconstruction of what happened then, how is it similar to now it's like oh it's boredom. I'm sitting at home when I know I'm capable person and I can be out doing and I can't. Well, what can I do

259
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can sure have an organized file cabinet. I can share finally get through my junk drawer. I can sure I didn't even know what it is, you know,

260
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.640
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

261
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Hate that bathroom.

262
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.280
Yeah.

263
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.140
Wayne Dal: People are so busy again, there's a lot of stuff I've done so.

264
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just play with

265
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.110
Wayne Dal: keeping busy as busy as possible. Good.

266
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, so let's go over here and sounds like I wrote a goal, and it says, I want to start my own land consulting business. We have short term objectives, I could reach out to people for networking opportunity within the next seven days.

267
00:28:53.580 --> 00:29:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I have, I could get a laptop and set up an office in the house as a short term goal. Okay.

268
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.670
Wayne Dal: Yeah. And also, I can I have a desktop computer. So I can run out and get the word

269
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.520
Wayne Dal: Can download work and get some ink from my printer so

270
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.760
Wayne Dal: There's some stuff I can do to get ready.

271
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to use

272
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: A basket and gloves. You're going to use precaution.

273
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.210
Wayne Dal: You know, I really don't.

274
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.910
Wayne Dal: Do that, um, I guess I should, because I am kind of high risk.

275
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can we talk

276
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.120
Wayne Dal: A lot of my lung stuff. I mean,

277
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.770
Wayne Dal: They really like what are my chances of really contracting. Okay.

278
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on.

279
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:42.990
You're scaring me.

280
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

281
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.850
You're scaring, sorry.

282
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But look, look at this.

283
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This is someone up here at the top. This is you going about your business with kind of that.

284
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All the fine.

285
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be fine and have it for 14 days sitting inside of you.

286
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you. In fact, let's say 2.5 people and within sets in five days within 30 days just

287
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Your let's say you were a carrier of it. You can affect in 30 days basically 406 people. So although you're talking about you. I am worried about you. I actually think you are vulnerable.

288
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may not want to think about it because feeling vulnerable when you're already feeling vulnerable about being, you know, a producer of, you know, income, etc. I want to be out, busy, busy doing. And then on top of that you have to think about your own physical vulnerability

289
00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just you. This is a mark where we have to say to ourselves, wait a minute, not only isn't my own safety you're contributing to the

290
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To the community over here 50 50% less exposure. Let's say you were staying home for a couple weeks or a mass

291
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Left things that are plastic or metal aside for three days and let the virus sort of die off and you didn't wear the same shoes that you wore in

292
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In the stores and you kept those clothes somewhere else and you came in and you showered. And you left all that viral load outside, you might

293
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Mitigate it down to 30 days of infecting and if you increase your care and precaution of safety and preparation to about three weeks isolating for maybe three weeks you would reduce it.

294
00:31:44.580 --> 00:32:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To maybe only affecting 2.5 people just a three week effort we would go from possibly having an impact on yourself and 406 people down to maybe only impacting 2.5 people. That's a massive difference with just

295
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A three week bit of inconvenience. This is a weird timing, it's a it's a time for where to my individual civil liberties and rights begin and end

296
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do they begin in in and where does my obligation to my family, my neighbors my city, my state my country, my planet. Where does it begin and end

297
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We have not been posed with this maybe never

298
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe me never maybe most of us have not been posed with this situation where we had to think about that dissonance. My, my rights to myself, my obligation to community.

299
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Acting locally thinking globally. Why, like I thought that was for recycling, but maybe we can do it for protecting ourselves and others around this virus.

300
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.660
Wayne Dal: Yeah, and I think that the chart you

301
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.200
Wayne Dal: I could be one of the people on the right hand side.

302
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:12.090
Wayne Dal: Right, not protecting myself because I don't have to be the infected one I could be the one of the ones or the right

303
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you're not what let's say you decide to go out and you don't wear a mask and there's someone who doesn't care about you and he's standing right next to you, he thinks is all bunch of BS. This is stupid. This is like the flu to the stupid, stupid, stupid.

304
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: He's right here next to you in line and you decided, I don't want to be embarrassed. I don't want to wear a mask.

305
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that could have been mitigated are you bringing home and you affect tiny tots. Other people

306
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would we do that, why wouldn't I look ridiculous. I don't care. And I'm kind of a narcissistic little snip. I care about my hair my makeup, right. Look, I look I tried to look kind of cute.

307
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I am in there with a dumb ass mask on my face and I don't care dumb ass masks.

308
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And gloves on my cause I'm up at the pharmacist with my little my little blue hands. He's like, I got your girl in a while you're doing that. I'm like, Uh huh. And I'm

309
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You look how you're touching everybody's medicine and you don't people come driving up here, but there will credit cards credit cards.

310
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell you what.

311
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:26.850
Wayne Dal: I was thinking I was thinking about that yesterday because I went to the store to get some things

312
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:28.410
Wayne Dal: And

313
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.260
Wayne Dal: I was looking at that little years old.

314
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.730
Wayne Dal: I was looking at that credit card King and

315
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.830
Wayne Dal: It's gross.

316
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.440
Wayne Dal: So,

317
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.480
Wayne Dal: It made me think they're

318
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:51.420
Wayne Dal: There I should actually have some gloves if you know because you never know what people people touch everything

319
00:34:52.410 --> 00:35:07.800
Wayne Dal: So yeah, that thought did cross my mind yesterday where I should have had gloves on, you know, I didn't. But I did you know I was aware and touching my face while I was driving home and then came home is washing my hands.

320
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.310
So,

321
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.650
Wayne Dal: You put you touch.

322
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The stuff on your car.

323
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's true. It sits there for three days on metal or plastic if that's true. I don't know if it's true. But if it is, it's still sitting there on the gearshift if there's metal somewhere the door handle. I don't know. So for me, it's like okay

324
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If I've touched it. And it's metal or plastic. It's not going to get touched for three days.

325
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's if it's something I can transfer food my bread leaves this bag goes into Ziploc

326
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: lunch meats leave this very safely goes from here, and does it block and then it can be in the house and I don't care you all enjoy your day.

327
00:35:46.380 --> 00:36:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: My chips, just tell me, I'll go get them. I'll move it. Ice cream goes in Tupperware a cardboard. I don't know, does it die when it freezes. When I read it lives happily. So, I still have to wait. Those, those hours 24 hours 36 hours 72 hours so

328
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the deal. I might end up being the one that looks insane. But here's the thing. When I go out to the store.

329
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the designated shopper and my mental health says to me, I need to feel okay

330
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If the ritual of wearing the mask. It's the ritual of changing my clothes, leaving a specific person with my credit card in a Ziploc bag. All of that helps me calm down all day. Why would I do it. Why do I care what other people think I'm out of my mind. What if I'm right.

331
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What if we're the last family in this in this community gets together. We're all going to get it. I think we're all going to get it. I do.

332
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if I'm the last one. And what if we waited so long that there were enough. Right.

333
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Masks, there were enough respirators and hospitals because weeks and months and past and they were able to make them. What if there were enough healthcare professionals. By the time we got it. And we were taking care of but I pushed it off as long as I could, what it

334
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Takes so so what what do y'all think I'm out of my mind well

335
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel better going out shopping. When I do that.

336
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

337
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.120
Wayne Dal: Yeah yeah

338
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you all have to strike that that that that Where's my line. What am I willing to do

339
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The CDC is talking about is cleaning surfaces.

340
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I showed, did I show you that screen.

341
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:33.690
Wayne Dal: You know,

342
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, with the with the solution, etc.

343
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And if if we're tracking in from a store things that have landed on the floor because gravity is going to drop my coughing and sneezing straight to the floor and I'm tracking it right into my house and my dog looks good.

344
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Food off the floor, and then I kissed him on the face and then you kiss me. Well, okay. That doesn't seem like it took that long to get to my mouth. Hmm.

345
00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So I got a problem with that. I'ma leave those shoes with a dog can't get to it.

346
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't get to my face.

347
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.140
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

348
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.990
Wayne Dal: Only will start protecting myself. I have those. But I don't have mask. You know what I could use

349
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:18.960
Wayne Dal: 30

350
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Somethings better than

351
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:20.970
Wayne Dal: Nothing.

352
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.430
Wayne Dal: And I've been trying to limit my

353
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.310
Wayne Dal: You know, going out.

354
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.080
Wayne Dal: Because, you know, my mom is a little worried about me because of my alone.

355
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:48.930
Wayne Dal: Thing and you know she's been keeping on, not about not going anywhere, staying home and stuff so I I can't really do that. You know what I mean I have to go out and do some shopping here and there. So I will start protecting myself.

356
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But why do you have to be

357
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.610
Wayne Dal: Shot.

358
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Why can't your wife, the healthier person be that

359
00:38:53.670 --> 00:39:02.610
Wayne Dal: I just think that, you know, she's at work all day and she shouldn't have to come home and go to the store. You know I want her to be able to come home and

360
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:15.840
Wayne Dal: Relax and not worry about about that thing you know about doing stuff because you know I'm here all day and I just feel it's my duty to to do that.

361
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How good are you going to be if you if you get sick and die.

362
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How much help.

363
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.350
Wayne Dal: Me no good.

364
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I fear at you, not to freak you out, but to say if this isn't discussed as a family. This is family meeting kind of thing. This is

365
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So the decision for me was, look, I'm the most conservative person. I'm going to think of careful thoughts before anybody else. I'm pretty healthy. I don't have a predisposition. I hate shopping. So it's like a total inconvenience for me.

366
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm kind of the right person to do it. So I was like, Okay, I'll be the shopper because I'm going to be super careful now. It was the decision and they hate it.

367
00:39:58.890 --> 00:39:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But

368
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We we all decided together.

369
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.710
Wayne Dal: I think it's a discussion.

370
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.600
Wayne Dal: With her and

371
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.520
Wayne Dal: She might have to do it on Saturday and

372
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.680
Wayne Dal: That's it, you know, cuz she does understand that I am

373
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.090
Wayne Dal: You know risk more than she is she's

374
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: wearing a mask. She's got stuff that comes in the house, nothing that was out there comes in.

375
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:31.920
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

376
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that seems really kooky. But can you imagine if she was thinking that she caused you to get sick. I mean, this whole thing is like we've got to be taking care of your mental health to, like, wait a minute.

377
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's all be careful.

378
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.710
Wayne Dal: Yeah, and I don't think a lot of people think that way.

379
00:40:53.670 --> 00:41:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm encouraging people in group I'm encouraging discussions in here. Like I said, for most of us. This is the first time we really get in a meaningful way.

380
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: act locally think globally is the one of the first time we've ever been forced to do it. So what good rehearsal, because our planets, about to, you know, it's in trouble. This

381
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be a good reversal for us about how how to think like that. So that's why I'm thinking about it, good for us. We're going to learn from this. I hope you know

382
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:29.490
Yeah.

383
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Did I scare you. I don't want to scare you. I just want

384
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.500
Wayne Dal: To you just made me think, you know, it is important.

385
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.480
Wayne Dal: To protect yourself and your family and

386
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.940
Wayne Dal: You know he didn't scare me at all.

387
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:49.380
Wayne Dal: You know, and it was good because i guess i really didn't think it was, you know, important

388
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:59.850
Wayne Dal: You know, I do, but the back of my mind, I'm like, you know, like I asked, you know, what are my chances really getting infected, you know,

389
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:10.260
Wayne Dal: But it just made me think that I need to protect myself 500 more than 500 people died in one day yesterday. I know.

390
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.800
Wayne Dal: And here in New Mexico, you know,

391
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.220
Wayne Dal: I think Santa Fe county has the second highest rate of people infected. So it's here you

392
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Will laugh about it later. Go to your shop and go look for a drywall mask one that you have tucked in your toolbox.

393
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Shake it out and wear it.

394
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Minus from when I was putting up. I took the popcorn off. I still have one laying around. I hate

395
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I took out

396
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A form down. Yes, so much work to make my shoulders.

397
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday and I gotta have it's baby smooth, you know, some wrong with me anyway so smooth as well.

398
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I still had it.

399
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.180
Wayne Dal: shake up now.

400
00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.540
Wayne Dal: I think I have one somewhere.

401
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you go in and you get you some get one for your, for your wife, we put in a ziplock we have we have our cleaning material with us we wipe. We clean

402
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we wait maybe we don't go out, but for every three days. Right. Well, if stuff stays on, so I won't go shopping. So that stuff. I can keep track of it. I keep a little label to head is really cookie like this is when it came in. This is when we can bring it in three days later.

403
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I still like it down but

404
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.010
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

405
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This way of mitigating any issues because it helps me in my head.

406
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.430
It helps me

407
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:46.590
Wayne Dal: In a way it's, it's the truth because you never know who's touched whatever it is that you've got

408
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:52.950
Wayne Dal: You know so many people, you know, grab stuff off the shelves and look at it. Probably cough on it.

409
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.020
Wayne Dal: And put it back. And then you come along and grab it and put in your basket. So

410
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:05.820
Wayne Dal: You know, it doesn't only help you in your mind. It's just, you never know a virus could be on there.

411
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:14.250
Wayne Dal: wise thing to do is to leave it for three days and wipe it down and then bring it in, but

412
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If we are in what we might say,

413
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of obliviousness or denial. If it's hard for us to see our own vulnerability that that we won't do any of those things will minimize it. And that's my concern, you are at risk.

414
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong with you, protecting yourself. It is your very personality right it to not put you

415
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.430
Wayne Dal: First

416
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're even that much more at risk because you won't you won't want to inconvenience, your wife.

417
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine how she would feel

418
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's what you were thinking and didn't talk with her about it.

419
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.950
Wayne Dal: She could have helped. Yeah.

420
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's complicated stuff. This is where the very vulnerability about our character our style comes out.

421
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And we've got to challenge those things and say wait a minute, this is what I was doing before, all bets are off. Right now we got to do this differently. We've got to have this sort of, you know, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts mentality. We need to think in a larger scale.

422
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We start with our family.

423
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:25.680
You know,

424
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I just hope.

425
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That all those homes that have the five second rule I finally I hope it finally goes out of code.

426
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: always made me crazy. Oh, I like the germs. Don't wait.

427
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.440
Wayne Dal: Kids are like that. I'm, you know, I'm a real

428
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:58.800
Wayne Dal: You know, clean freak and everything gets clean. They're like, oh, that's for you can eat. So, you know, they'll drop something and pick it up and eat it like, dude,

429
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.000
Wayne Dal: If

430
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't say there's a cookie. Let's wait

431
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's wait a

432
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.800
Wayne Dal: Second, so say my floors are clean, but you're in here with shoes on which you know I hate

433
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:20.520
Wayne Dal: Everyone you know you've been walking all over the floor. That's, that's my pet peeve. And then people wearing shoes in my house, man.

434
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've got a good reason to get on them about

435
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.640
Yeah.

436
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A nice little place to stack them up or a little bag. They can stick their, their little shoes in and now you're like see

437
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.180
Wayne Dal: Leave them upside

438
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah this whole time you've been have been doing away with this learning curve.

439
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:38.940
Wayne Dal: Yeah, exactly.

440
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: joke about it, we can find ourselves funny, I find myself completely ridiculous. And so whatever. What am I supposed to do, you know, this helps me, psychologically, so I'm not preoccupied with it all day.

441
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.250
Wayne Dal: Everything that I can

442
00:46:55.890 --> 00:47:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well you know I have big plans for you. I was gonna do. I'm Dr. But you know what, sometimes

443
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.240
Wayne Dal: You do it next time I got my water bottles. They said, Yeah.

444
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.380
Wayne Dal: Uh huh. So I'll be prepared next time.

445
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have April 14

446
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And we will be April 14 at 8am and we'll meet them and see if we can kind of loosen up some of the stuff from a little earlier, that are still triggers for you. I'm just so I know how are you doing around your ability to

447
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what you need. What you want what you prefer. Notice if you can catch

448
00:47:48.720 --> 00:48:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A nice communication or a polite assertive communication. Are you able to do that before you show anger or is there still that same pattern of getting irritated impatient and blowing up what what do you like

449
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:05.610
Wayne Dal: I'm

450
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:12.330
Wayne Dal: If, if something is bothering me. I say something right away. I don't let it I don't keep it inside

451
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.070
Wayne Dal: not talk about it. I say it right away. And that's it.

452
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:32.730
Wayne Dal: You know what I mean. I said what was on my mind or what was bothering me or something. I said it. That's it. Okay. So yeah, it's not that same or cycle where, you know, I didn't talk about it.

453
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:38.970
Wayne Dal: Anger me, you know, get those

454
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Feelings out of me change routine and morning. I want to start my own landscaping timber Suboxone

455
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I don't have anything about the anger anymore. I must close those out. Yeah. Let me close that one out.

456
00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over to. So this is what we'll do, get those past feelings out of me and be positive. Now, that's your wording therapeutically I'm thinking reprocess early trauma.

457
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can set ourselves a goal that next time we meet will do that will I'll pick up a target negative font that you still have we'll see if we can do a little bit of work around it. Okay.

458
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:19.140
Wayne Dal: Okay. All right. Um,

459
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you're at 1.5 milligrams today yes just catch yourself thinking, What if I just wait.

460
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: 90 seconds. I'll go busy myself for 90 seconds I know my initial thought is, I want to use. I want to escape this emotion. What if anybody can do a distraction for 90 seconds and you go do that.

461
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. And then guess what. Now, or has passed. Okay, try the 92nd thing of distraction.

462
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission to delay the reward a little bit and I think you'll see that you're able to delay even longer.

463
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.030
Wayne Dal: You know,

464
00:49:54.450 --> 00:50:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the breathing go talk with someone go do some stretching. Get back in your body. You're okay we're okay. Know that you are not alone. We are all going through this maybe like no other time in your life. Have we all had probably the same thought once a day. Oh my gosh.

465
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.490
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

466
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter the gender, no matter the religion, all of us. I think it's amazing.

467
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.460
Wayne Dal: Yeah, it is. You're not

468
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:27.960
You're not alone.

469
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I will see you when I sleep.

470
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, bye.
