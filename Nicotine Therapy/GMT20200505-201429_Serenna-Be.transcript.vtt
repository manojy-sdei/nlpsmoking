49
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.520
Serenna Beers: I need to reach out to Dr. Allah DAG and I need to reach out to my

50
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:12.450
Serenna Beers: Clinical Director. And the reason why is because they flagged you is me meeting with you, bi, weekly, and I don't know why that is, but at least I can

51
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:28.050
Serenna Beers: Depending on upon the kinds of things that you share with with with me you know we we we usually for anybody that's new with us. We start with twice a month and then the next month if everything's good. Then we go to once a month. I don't know if there's like

52
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.850
Andy Keffer: One that's fine with me. I don't

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.370
Serenna Beers: Okay. All right, well then let's just start with tell me what brings you to bright heart health, and why now.

55
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.820
Andy Keffer: Well, I, I've been on Suboxone for

56
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.260
Andy Keffer: Almost two years almost three years.

57
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.280
Andy Keffer: Mm hmm. And I had a bad opiate habit.

58
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.530
Andy Keffer: I was taking six oxycodone 30 milligrams a day or at a time like 3456 times a day.

59
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:09.270
Andy Keffer: So I, I got pretty bad on them. And then I started boxing boxing work and it makes me feel normal. And they only have to take you know what their unprescribed and

60
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.680
Andy Keffer: I don't feel like

61
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.280
Andy Keffer: A waste of space anymore.

62
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.540
Serenna Beers: Yeah, that probably had to be pretty tough.

63
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.560
Serenna Beers: So you were taking 30 milligrams of oxy cotton or oxy coco, coco down

64
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.600
Andy Keffer: koto oxycodone, but I was taking 30 milligrams. I was taking six five or 630 30 milligram pills at a time.

65
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:46.950
Serenna Beers: Oh wow, believe it or not, I didn't even know that they made him up to that milligram, it's, it's been a long, long time since I've been involved in that lifestyle so

66
00:05:48.810 --> 00:06:00.870
Serenna Beers: Yeah, I didn't even know that goodness gracious. So let me ask you, when you transitioned from them to Suboxone. How was that, how did you adjust with that mentally because that huh

67
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.130
Andy Keffer: It was easy.

68
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.660
Serenna Beers: That's great.

69
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.250
Andy Keffer: Wow, I stopped taking pills, one day and started doing Suboxone the next

70
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.600
Wow.

71
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:25.320
Serenna Beers: That's really cool you because I'm sure you've heard, you know, just being in groups and stuff, but just, you know, there are some folks that really the reason why it takes so long is because of that transition that what they call the induction phase.

72
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.090
Serenna Beers: It's really, really a struggle.

73
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.680
Serenna Beers: Wow.

74
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.380

Okay.

Serenna Beers: Rings. Okay. Is it town, tell me a couple of like goals that you want to get while working with with us, even if it's, you know,

160
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:36.270
Serenna Beers: I want to learn. Time management. I'm struggling with that and I'm just throwing in anything out there because we

161
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.200
Serenna Beers: In like

162
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.540
Andy Keffer: A good one because I do struggle with time management really bad.

163
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:39.990
Serenna Beers: Okay.

164
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.400
Andy Keffer: I got you trying to disease.

165
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.380
Andy Keffer: You know, I'll be

166
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.270
Andy Keffer: Doing stuff over here like Lupo and I'm off over you're doing something else. But it's like oh crap. I was 20 years ago.

167
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.320
Serenna Beers: You give the new meaning to the word squirrel. Yeah.

168
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.950
Okay.

169
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.500
Serenna Beers: Okay. So, time management. And what about. Is there anything else.

170
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:06.840
Andy Keffer: That I'm on a game that the ability to be able to cope with things without drugs without use drugs or

171
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.090
Andy Keffer: Situation.

172
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.140
Okay.

173
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.750
Serenna Beers: That translate to in my mind.

174
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:25.080
Serenna Beers: Being able to regulate your emotions are you one that tends to step at step it and then you blow up. Are you one that tends to explode.

175
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.880
Andy Keffer: Explode

176
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:36.270
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay. You're an employer. You are my fellow man. You're my kind of guy. I understand that it took me years to become better at

177
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:46.890
Serenna Beers: When I feel it address it acknowledge it validate it and move past it. And I had to keep repeating it until it became like second nature. When I feel something, whether it's

178
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:59.460
Serenna Beers: sadness, anger I allow myself to feel it and I'm so used to stuffing it. And when you've stuffed it for 1617 years you have to relearn a new a whole new way to

179
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:16.320
Serenna Beers: To behave. And so I had to teach myself not being me by myself. But, but through the use of something like this when I was on the other side of the screen, I guess, for lack of better terms. When I was a patient going through much of the very same thing.

180
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:28.950
Serenna Beers: You know, I just couldn't figure out how to manage my emotions because I would step in and step and then become resentful when I blow up and look like the crazy one and I hated that about about myself, but

181
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.970
Serenna Beers: It is possible to change that. It really, really is.

182
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.570
Serenna Beers: Okay, so when I heard you say was, time management and then I heard you say

183
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:49.830
Serenna Beers: Maybe some emotion regulation of learning how not to really push things down, but to deal with them, you know, which we would call that what

184
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.610
Serenna Beers: Not distress tolerance.

185
00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:05.340
Serenna Beers: I can't think of the word, but just effective way to communicate, you can communicate how you feel. In the moment versus to sit on it because that's not good for anybody.

186
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.570
Andy Keffer: I get mad.

187
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.740
Andy Keffer: And then once

188
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.620
Andy Keffer: Once I once I mad, that's over with, or, you know, talking to me. There ain't no nothing. Just my ass. I don't give a shit. I'm on

189
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.030
Andy Keffer: I'm on a roll and

190
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.580
Andy Keffer: That's just to get the hell out of the way.

191
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.250
Serenna Beers: Right.

192
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.160
Andy Keffer: I've been that way forever, but

193
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:35.190
Serenna Beers: Anger is just inside out, fear and it doesn't mean like a sissy fear. It means when we get mad or it's inside out her it's fear or hurt. It's usually those big trigger words.

194
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:51.210
Serenna Beers: You know, like when somebody hurts me it pisses me off, especially when I feel like I've been good to to them. Or if somebody, you know, I mean, it really is anger is our secondary emotion to deal with our first our first initial feeling, you know,

195
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.120
Serenna Beers: Okay, so what about. Let me see something here real quick.

Serenna Beers: She I would imagine she's probably good for you when, in case you do get mad, she would. I would imagine can be a pretty common, common

199
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.230
