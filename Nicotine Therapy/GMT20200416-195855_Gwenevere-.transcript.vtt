00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.050
Matthew Montano: Last month, was it wasn't that long garden.

28
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

29
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We met march 10. That's why I backed out

30
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does it mean to you.

31
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels like two weeks ago.

32
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.570
Matthew Montano: I actually thought it was two weeks ago, though.

33
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.760
Matthew Montano: Yeah, sure.

34
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a month, more than a month ago.

35
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.960
Uh huh.

36
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It was like two weeks.

37
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.530
Matthew Montano: Why not, why I've been seeing you in a group therapy. So maybe that's why it feels like less is more.

38
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.610
Probably

39
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but now I gotta go.

40
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: See

41
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the reference is March 10

42
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So since it's been over a month, we do need on the front end to review your goals. I like to do that monthly and it makes the accreditation body very happy that I do that I want everybody knowing that I'm reviewing goals. So we're going to start there.

43
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But I am

44
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Aware that the elephant in the room is

45
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Us.

46
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.660
Matthew Montano: Or Cogan I'd seen, or what is it

47
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I hardly think that I think that you and I will find your way will find our way. Okay.

48
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There's enough trust between us. There's enough positive experience. I think

49
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That you'll you'll will be okay. But I'm going to loosen it kind of keep it superficial going to set, keep it light and fluffy on the outside for a little bit and then

50
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite. Well, let's talk a little bit about what's going on. But first, let's buffer. It was a little chitchat and we'll start with a goal of yours witches.

51
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

52
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Body summer ready

53
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.800
Matthew Montano: Is that what did I say that

54
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do so that's a goal of yours. I don't know that exactly when is quite that what this is is a goal that you set. So let's write a little something something about that. How do you assess your body as summer ready

55
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.710
Matthew Montano: Well, it's not quite where I would want it to be.

56
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.440
Matthew Montano: But that's part of what the gym is closing down months ago, like over a month ago.

57
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So the note I'm writing is not quite what I want

58
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.150
Matthew Montano: Yeah, but I've still

59
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.220
Matthew Montano: Been keeping up with like Gordon on jobs and stuff. What I can with everything going on. Okay.

60
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Going on jobs. Let's give it a number, so that when we revisit this again in May, we can look and we can say, ah, oh backsliding or look at us. You're moving forward. So when you say summer ready, let's say it's zero to 10 and 10 is hot bought

61
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.380
Matthew Montano: Some clothes of five.

62
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got it.

63
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.380
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Not even close.

64
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.010
Currently,

65
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

66
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to just extend that target date.

67
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To RG there is. Okay, next goal.

68
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: next goal you have is have a good well rounded life. That's a big one. That's much bigger than summer bond that incomes encompasses a lot of moving parts.

69
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Ships how you assess what a well rounded life is so there's a lot to it. Let me just bring bring in some past statement.

70
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.660
Matthew Montano: I feel, I feel like my life is generally

71
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Okay.

72
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.180
Matthew Montano: I go to work every day I pay my bills.

73
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.360
Matthew Montano: That type of stuff.

74
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever known anyone who went to work, they paid their bills and yet from a distance, you're like, I don't look so well rounded

75
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.540
Matthew Montano: Yeah, but I don't feel I'm it that way.

76

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:01.110
Matthew Montano: Oh No for real. That's say that 10 times real well rounded by

107
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:22.590

113
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had

114
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A house.

115
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard the dog, and how would you measure success. Again, how would that be measured.

116
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.260
Matthew Montano: make you more money.

117
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.570

Matthew Montano: Know,

119
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.860
Matthew Montano: Like these are very difficult

120
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what was hardly

121
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Success.

122
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:32.910
Matthew Montano: Because I kind of have a theme with shopping. I like going shopping for clothes or just stuff for the house and I know when I'm

123
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.890
Matthew Montano: Successful or where I want to be is where I don't have to

124
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:47.940
Matthew Montano: Pinch or like worry about how much cash I have and watch it. You know, I can just kind of have that extra money all the time.

125
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it all the time.

126
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.020
Matthew Montano: Um, that's a far reach but yeah hopefully we get there.

127
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to be more successful. Um, I won't worry about how much cash and

128
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't worry about it.

129
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.480

Matthew Montano: Yeah.

133
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That you could

134
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Have done she did what she could

135
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:25.740
Matthew Montano: Do

136
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time. Um, you'll have a house with the yard and you'll have a dog.

137
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.250
Matthew Montano: Yeah, that's what I picture in my mind.

138
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, could we close this goal then then you'll have a good well rounded life.

139
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.220
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

140
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.240

143
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that earlier I said did you reach that goal. Have you been close to close this goal.

144
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:05.340
Matthew Montano: No, no, because I feel like I don't want to stop reaching for something ever if you

145
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you can add another one. Just think about that.

Matthew Montano: One being is

150
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.860
Matthew Montano: I guess.

151
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.760
Matthew Montano: How I am in relationship sometimes like I'm okay. When I'm just dating or not giving them.

152
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.120
Matthew Montano: Before we make everything official and before all these terms like

153
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:51.750
Matthew Montano: Where we can only be can be together and stuff. I'm okay before all that stuff. But once I get past that point, I don't like some aspects of myself.

154
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what, hey, watch this. This is how you know you ran into a goal. This is a convenient way to do it.

155
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do more of this. I want to do less of something else. See if you can find that one.

156
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: About this other piece, you mentioned, I got all that but just see if you can find turn it into something you, you and I could see more of a good measure it and now we know where they're or it'd be less than this other thing. What are those things.

157
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.590
Matthew Montano: overthinking things in relationships.

158
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a fragment sentence, putting in a full sentence.

159
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.840
Matthew Montano: I'm

160
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.230
Matthew Montano: overthinking, I don't know, like, What do you mean, is it

162
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't Domingo sense. So just write that down your goal, and then we'll know we'll get it, you know. Soon as you write it down right now.

163
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.350
Matthew Montano: Okay, your video is choppy, a little bit.

164
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.040
Matthew Montano: Um, okay.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use it. Take your time. I'm gonna walk over here right on your bowl.

174
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.930
Matthew Montano: What

175
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.220
Matthew Montano: What if I was just thinking I let myself get into bad relationships.

176
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an explanation. Write down your goal.

177

Matthew Montano: Okay, so it says have a fun loving relationship in which we both have the same goals and like

180
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm loving really

181
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationship in which we both have

182
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun. Whoops, I lost it.

183
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:52.680
Matthew Montano: Um, but have a fun loving relationship in which we both have the same goals in life.

184
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

185
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's take that. That'll be the overarching goal. That'll be something you're going to hear back at you, every month. Okay.

186
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to hear back. How's your goal with having a fun loving relationship in which we both have the same goals in life.

187
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, how does

188
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.710
Matthew Montano: It work.

189
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm reading it. That's the goal. You stated, I'm making sure that that's the one you want that you're going to hear back at you, every month.

190
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you've been invited to consider getting a house plant.

191
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: First, because you're working at recovery program you're still going to be looking at this goal every month.

192
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that going to be okay.

193
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: As you, you're going to see that and yet treatment me is saying, you may want to work on self for you start a romantic relationship if you're taking a recovery seriously.

194
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what people frequently do you'll hear in a lot of different places where they say kind of focus on your own growth and then get in

195
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:26.340
Matthew Montano: Romance. Well, yeah, that would just go back to like I said right now like financially stable. I have my life is comfortable. I have a good job. Um, I was like, one thing that would help me make make me feel better is going to the gym and just that used to make me feel good and like you know

196
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:38.640
Matthew Montano: And keep yeah he GIS and when you feel like you're looking good. And things are going good around you. Um, that's the goal.

197
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to start over. Your goal is have a fun loving relationship in which we both have the same goals in life. You're going to hear that every month.

198
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do with the fact that treatment, aka me is saying.

199
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't start a romantic relationship for about a year.

200
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do

201
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do it.

202
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:06.870
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

203
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You do with those

204
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.800
With those

205
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Opposing be an opposition or the an opposition.

206
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:23.490
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I think it's a good idea because I've been in a relationship for over a year and it didn't, it went well, till the end, you know,

207
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why I'm bringing up that frequently when people are in early recovery that they not only did they change people, places and things that they hold off on starting new romantic relationships. Why do you think that would help someone in recovery.

208
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.300
Matthew Montano: Um,

209
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.300
Matthew Montano: If you can be more focused on your recovery.

210
00:20:49.440 --> 00:21:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay yourself just see how true any of that is for you. Try and make some statements with that. So you said you but try it first person and see, see if any even small pieces that if that is true. And you where you are in your recovery.

211
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it for you.

212
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.180
Matthew Montano: How well is it for me.

213
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.970
Matthew Montano: Relevant relevant. Um, I feel like it would help.

214
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.580
Matthew Montano: Because

215
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:32.550
Matthew Montano: My recovery has been a big part of my life for so long, but I but just been doing it for so long, like, You're not the first doctor. I've been to for this that I just kind of like

216
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.400
Matthew Montano: I feel like I've been

217
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.940
Matthew Montano: You know, doing it and doing it well considering a lot of the things I've been through in my life.

218
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Those two things don't go together. I think, I think it would kind of help.

219
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.750
Matthew Montano: A lot

220
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't just stick with that I think and name with the it don't put an end in there. I think what's the it

221
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.450
Matthew Montano: Is recovery.

222
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it is not going to do it again. Ready.

223
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:09.300
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

224
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You suppose you might benefit from not starting a romantic relationship.

225
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.730
Matthew Montano: Because I need to focus more on myself.

226
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.040
Matthew Montano: Because these things that I want to change about the relationship might have to do with me.

227
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't learn them now, then what

228
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.300
Matthew Montano: If I

229
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.250
Matthew Montano: Now,

230
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.690
Matthew Montano: Um,

231
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.100
Matthew Montano: I could be single for the rest of my life. That's fine. It's to be

232
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking with yourself and see why you brought in. I kind of been doing it and doing it. Well, you're almost like a little singer there for a second. I'm

233
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.480
Matthew Montano: Talking about

234
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Your Mac. Come back, come on, you just went off roading for a second. Come on back. So did I.

235
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of been doing it well. Oh, and then you're not the soccer. I've seen I've been doing it well. I wonder why you said that. Do you know why.

236
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:51.720
Matthew Montano: Why wonder, Well Chris my life I've been through some hard situations in my life and considering I feel like I i am doing pretty well.

237
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I mentioned that you've been seeing other doctors say that

238
00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.410
Matthew Montano: Well, because I've been in recovery for

239
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.260
Matthew Montano: For for longer than which what I've been in recovery with you, which is less than a year.

240
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that mean I don't I don't get that.

241
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.760
Matthew Montano: I'm working that

242
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:16.830
Matthew Montano: That I'm working on getting there, like we've been cutting down the amount of my medication, um,

243
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.670
Yeah, but

244
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The doctors didn't cut down. So tell me, see if you can identify why you brought that in just now. See if you can grab it.

245
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.100
Matthew Montano: Grab it. What do you mean

246
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you mentioned this other treatment program. You weren't tapering with these other programs. So see if you know brought it up.

247
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.620
Matthew Montano: Well, I don't know why he wasn't tapering me. I thought that was the point

248
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:40.830
Matthew Montano: Of it.

249
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can figure out just now trying to track what I'm saying why you brought it up.

250
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you. Who's this, we were talking about relationships and then you brought in, but I think going to treat me for a long time and I'm doing it and doing it well.

251
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought that up.

252
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with it a little while the fresh to it. Take your time.

253
00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.280
Matthew Montano: Okay.

254
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.410
Matthew Montano: Um,

255
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.460
Matthew Montano: I just was thinking, I don't like myself when I'm asked to take anything or rely on something.

256
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:20.310
Matthew Montano: I don't like that aspect of myself. So that's something I don't like about myself. So that could come out in other areas of my life.

257
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, um,

258
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you move over to this other goal to

259
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Not rely on any substances, that's your goal. That's your phrasing not rely on any substances. That's the goal. You came in the door with with bright heart health.

260
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: With that goal.

261
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:58.350
Matthew Montano: I'm doing good on that because we've been cutting down by amounts as best I can.

262
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.450
Matthew Montano: And I'm still getting used to, like, where I'm at, at the one and a half.

263
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.660
Matthew Montano: I still

264
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still getting used to where I'm at 12 milligrams

265
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

266
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And

267
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:34.350
Then

268
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.540
Matthew Montano: There's this

269
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:46.830
Matthew Montano: Like we're kind of I feel like we were starting from the beginning again but just in general, there's a lot of things that happen to me that I have to

270
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.350
Matthew Montano: Deal with, you know, before I'm not like a

271
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.810
Matthew Montano: Inside I need just deal with those things, you know, get those things out.

272
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet if you heard someone say that you would have no idea what they were talking about because you didn't sneak any connection between the beginning of that statement.

273
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just randomly sort of said, I gotta go. I have no idea what that means. What are you talking about, well,

274
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.820
Matthew Montano: I don't know what we're focusing on today, like I need something to go off of, I guess.

275
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Even well think about that. I bet if we rewind this there'd be a really clear plan. I won't address the elephant and instead we will go over each goal. Actually, I'm quite clear. I'm really clear.

276
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But how are you feeling right now.

277
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about the elephant going to get into it now. Okay, we've got a nice 20 minutes or so to really get into it. How has it been feeling to be you for these 39 minutes

278
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:11.700
Matthew Montano: I feel good. Generally, I feel pretty good considering I just went through a breakup, like in the past, um,

279
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:21.810
Matthew Montano: What I went through a bad breakup, it kind of affected other aspects of my life and I feel like that hasn't happened this time.

280
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing differently.

281
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.890
Matthew Montano: Um,

282
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:36.660
Matthew Montano: I'm just realizing that something that happens in life, you know, and it's something that I maybe figure out about myself. So I don't let myself in a certain types of relationships.

283
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.900
Matthew Montano: Or so that I don't

284
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:49.980
Matthew Montano: Put up with certain games because I feel like I wouldn't have gotten into this whole mess by what if I would have read the read signs read

285
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.940
Matthew Montano: Like what

286
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Plants are red.

287
00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:03.090
Matthew Montano: Flags or read them if I did have a jealousy issue there is these he would do to make them worse. I'm

288
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.680
Matthew Montano: Like

289
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you. So we're gonna stop for just a second. So you didn't ask you answered a question wasn't mine was an answer, but it wasn't my question. So lean in a little bit. So you can actually hear me. Let's do it again.

290
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.930
Matthew Montano: I can hear. I can hear you. Good.

291
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That you answered someone else's question, not mine.

292
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

293
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.440
Yeah.

294
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: yeahs last 40 minutes. Now, how have you felt

295
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.700
Matthew Montano: I feel frustrated because I can't bike.

296
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.150
Matthew Montano: I don't feel like we're getting anything done.

297
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

298
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you not getting done.

299
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll talk about me in a second, but let's see about you.

300
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.520
Matthew Montano: When I not getting done.

301
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:18.540
Matthew Montano: Today's my day off. I feel like well I needed to catch up on sleep. So, not really. I was gonna say. Today's my day off. I could have got it earlier and wait for a jog or run or something.

302
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is there any connection between getting up going for a jog or run

303
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And having to come in here today. Any connection.

304
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.060
Matthew Montano: They're both positive things my way

305
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're feeling frustrated that you're not getting something done. But just now you're you're calling sort of this is something that is a positive thing. So as it goes. It's both feeling

306
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's frustrating.

307
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:04.320
Matthew Montano: Well, I feel like because you're asking these questions and I'm and I'm filling them giving answers, but it's like the night, not the right answer for you. So like

308
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.190
I mean,

309
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.860
Matthew Montano: Yeah, because I feel like if you asked me what you what you really need. I'll give it to you like

310
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.360
That

311
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's something underneath my actual questions, it's still something that I'm not saying

312
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:34.200
Matthew Montano: Yeah, if you want it. Like, if we're talking about like things that happened in my past that affect me now in relationships or why I let myself get into those situations like

313
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot when I talk

314
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.840
Matthew Montano: Yeah, because I generally do with it pretty well. I think, and I'm getting better.

315
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not the elephant in the room.

316
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what a pink elephant is

317
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.420
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah, no, that means

318
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.570
Matthew Montano: That that's the big like question or the big issue there.

319
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I talking about what's the pink elephant for

320
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.590
Matthew Montano: There we have a few weeks.

321
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is just so it's just meeting. That's it. So we already covered that it's been exactly those days. So we already covered it is the elephant still in the room.

322
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.720
Matthew Montano: Is Elphinstone the room.

323
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a company. We already know that when it was

324
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.780
Matthew Montano: Something's there because I feel like we need to talk about something.

325
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me call

326
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:45.930
Matthew Montano: We call that I feel like we wouldn't have this problem. If I didn't have scheduling issues, a little bit of a scheduling issue with my work right now.

327
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the problem at this that if it was perfect skin.

328
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.660
Matthew Montano: Like them calling me and for

329
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the issue. Already know if your schedule is perfect. There'll be no issue, what, what's the issue.

330
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:12.900
Matthew Montano: Sorry.

331
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So perfect schedule.

332
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the issue.

333
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the elephant in the room.

334
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.500
What's in the room.

335
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:40.650
Matthew Montano: I don't know, because these are such general terms that I don't know what would he be

336
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.340
Matthew Montano: What's the elephant in the room. What's

337
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's go like this elephant pink elephant is a metaphor for something that apparently the scheduling would fix what's the pink elephant.

338
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.020
Matthew Montano: For me,

339
00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.670
Sure.

340
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.500
Matthew Montano: For me, the

341
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.540
Matthew Montano: Pertaining to like counseling or or what I don't don't get it.

342
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.490
Matthew Montano: It just

343
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.440
Matthew Montano: Pretending to my life for

344
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: pink elephant that scheduling would solve

345
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.340
Matthew Montano: Well, I still

346
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:38.790
Matthew Montano: It's a lot of doctors appointments. I feel like it's more than I need, like, I feel like the once a week individual with you as well. But the once a week, group therapy. I really don't feel like I need to do that.

347
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:49.740
Matthew Montano: Maybe once every two weeks. I just feel like that's the problem is it's a lot of appointments and I work a lot already. And you know, I need you know

348
00:35:51.030 --> 00:36:02.340
Matthew Montano: I by friends over at the end of the day I cook for them. We watch TV show like assign try and stay busy and then like kind of lazy. If I can have steps up

349
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.940
Matthew Montano: And I feel like it's not gonna affect any other part of my life.

350
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I did get lost in there. I have to admit,

351
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: friends over and lazy.

352
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

353
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I just can't track very well.

354
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just say that you

355
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:32.640
Matthew Montano: I feel like mean you were at a we were working on stuff so I don't know why not why we're not starting back to her.

356
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

357
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. Why don't you look in

358
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: inside and find out why.

359
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So that might be part of the frustration, not getting things done. So try and look and see

360
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:57.750
Matthew Montano: What not to hide anything. Or you can just feel like I don't really understand what you're asking because I'm not getting the right to keep saying so.

361
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, wondering, not the right answer is if I'm, I'm with holding the real question the real thing.

362
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:23.040
Matthew Montano: I'm once again I'm the type of person that I'm not going to. I don't like to cry people's shoulders. I hold things in and delete them myself. And the only way you're going to get that out of me as if you ask certain things, or we have work on certain things, I guess.

363
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.070
Matthew Montano: Is I'm not just gonna say, oh,

364
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.110
Matthew Montano: This is happening.

365
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

366
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back.

367
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the pink elephant that a perfect schedule.

368
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Once all

369
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.070
Matthew Montano: That perfect says schedule itself.

370
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.070
Matthew Montano: That route.

371
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.990
Matthew Montano: I would be able to come to my meetings regularly.

372
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.180
Matthew Montano: And we wouldn't have this situation right now, I guess.

373
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we call this situation right now. What do you call that

374
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.450
Matthew Montano: I think like we're just having a misunderstanding right now.

375
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm misunderstanding. Okay.

376
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the pink elephant.

377
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.820
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

378
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.220
Matthew Montano: You. I know. The only problem is I

379
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:27.360
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I know. I think the only problem we're having is, I missed two weeks. So we're on the same page.

380
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you had to guess because I

381
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:32.760
Thought

382
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: If you, if you had to guess that the pink elephant.

383
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is misunderstanding between you and I, or you, and Dr. Solomon or all three of us what where's the misunderstanding between you and I

384
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.770
Matthew Montano: Yeah, cuz

385
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.910
Matthew Montano: Cuz we're reevaluating these goals and I feel like

386
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.780
Matthew Montano: I feel like this is where we started and I don't know what is useful out of this because I

387
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.440
Matthew Montano: Like I feel like I'm doing I'm doing good in life. It's just like gotta work on

388
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:18.240
Matthew Montano: Little things

389
00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to what the emotion is right now so you can find that. What is it,

390
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: move beyond frustration what's underneath that

391
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Happening here in these 49 minutes it's been here the whole time.

392
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.450
Matthew Montano: frustrating because

393
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:46.560
Matthew Montano: I feel like you're trying to get deep inside my mind, but you're not telling me exactly what you want, so I don't

394
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say that I am withholding. Let's say I have a big question on asked, What are you doing in here to contribute to the Miss understanding

395
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.100
Matthew Montano: Now I know you had to answer your questions, I guess.

396
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.030
Matthew Montano: I'm really

397
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

398
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.090
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

399
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.060
Matthew Montano: Oh,

400
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.570
Matthew Montano: You're just like

401
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

402
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, your intelligence. So see, try again. What are you doing, if I'm withholding

403
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Already imagining the worst thing I was holding some important piece of information. And the real question that's not a fun thing for me to even imagine.

404
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing to contribute to the Miss understanding

405
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:16.530
Matthew Montano: Not making my appointments on time or not good missed a couple of appointments, I guess, because we wouldn't be starting over like this. If I did it.

406
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:17.490
Maybe

407
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a couple of things I can clarify, just to address that. That bit right there.

408
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What if the worst thing that you were doing was missing the appointments

409
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: As you didn't want to actually attend

410
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that what if you thought I don't need to attend them. I only want to go every other week and

411
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

412
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That was

413
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A misunderstanding.

414
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:16.770
Matthew Montano: Well, no, no, no, it's not that well the thing I know I said I don't want to go to every week was the group there. I don't mind doing these every week.

415
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.050
Matthew Montano: Because the one on one therapy.

416
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm sitting here with the idea that I might be withholding something I tried that on true, not true. Don't know we haven't even gotten to that, but I'm sitting with it for a second.

417
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm imagining

418
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.290
In this room.

419
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not asking the real question.

420
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm withholding something from you right now.

421
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing to control

422
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.210
Matthew Montano: I don't feel like I'm withholding so

423
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

424
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.120
Matthew Montano: I feel like you're

425
00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.030
Matthew Montano: Just like this question.

426
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel while you are doing everything you possibly can and I am the one with holding what's I feel like

427
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.900
Matthew Montano: Frustrating, you will work with holding something.

428
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you still believe it's true.

429
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.780
Matthew Montano: I still believe it's true.

430
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm asking, can we might want to sit closer because I keep having to repeat myself.

431
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.140
Matthew Montano: No, no, I can hear you can hear you. I just

432
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I

433
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.800
Matthew Montano: I'm not hiding me theory, it's just

434
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Something can you

435
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.480
Matthew Montano: You know, you're trying to get something out of me, but

436
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't asked the question, not the real one.

437
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:59.160
Matthew Montano: Well, because we were just talking about goals and my goals in life are just to be successful.

438
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:00.900
Matthew Montano: At work.

Matthew Montano: If I can get a good guy in my life.

441
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:20.610
Matthew Montano: And, you know, have a dog, maybe a kid later on. I feel like in those things are already in my life right now.

442
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be open to listening to this recording next week.

443
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.220
Matthew Montano: No, I do not like watching myself.

444
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.980
Matthew Montano: I did frustrating.

445
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say that you'd watch this video next week. What I do you remember what asked

446
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.350
Matthew Montano: If I'd be open to

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.310
Matthew Montano: Listen to it. Okay. Yeah.

449
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do that. I want

450
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.540
Matthew Montano: To like that was

451
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.840
Matthew Montano: So frustrating for me, too, because I spoke written, I

452
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess. Well, we don't, we don't know. We'll find out.

453
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.340
Matthew Montano: We'll just keep it. It's like, it's like 10. Is it just like

454
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:07.770
Matthew Montano: No like

455
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.270
Matthew Montano: Asked me. Are you happy.

456
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:23.310
Matthew Montano: Like if you're trying to get like this something hurting you right now. You like I feel like I can tell you that or something, but I don't feel like you're asking those things because I thought we were at a point where we're starting to do that.

457
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think we're starting over because and asking you about the goals that you expressed

458
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Over these months working together. Those were your stated goals and you have interpreted as we're starting over, and

459
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm causing contributing to the misunderstanding, because there's a question. I haven't really asked, and you're apparently doing everything you possibly can. You're doing everything you possibly can. Right.

460
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.840
Matthew Montano: My bond, I guess not. Because we're, we're both not understanding something

461
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What you've got four minutes. See if you want to

462
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: make the most out of these three or four minutes. See what you want to go with what did you do here today it contributed to our Miss under standing. What have you been doing

463
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you, what are you doing

464
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.520
Matthew Montano: I don't think I did anything wrong this time because I feel like if you ask more

465
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:49.890
Matthew Montano: If we were working on a certain type of thing, like we had in the last few weeks, like, today we're going to talk about this or. Today we're going to match the room. What's that room worth like

466
00:46:50.370 --> 00:47:01.770
Matthew Montano: And I feel like those things brought out certain emotions. Right now you're just asking you, general questions like, what are your goals and I'm telling you exactly what my goals are, like, I don't know how else to explain it.

467
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:03.900
Matthew Montano: Will be

468
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready. I wrote this down already.

469
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing to contribute to our misunderstanding.

470
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:22.500
Matthew Montano: I feel like I'm doing anything. I'm not like with all things up to you if you asked.

471
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:24.720
Me too.

472
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.250
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

473
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder why we have misunderstanding.

474
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:37.500
Matthew Montano: Because I'm not answering your questions right the way you want me to. And I don't understand why not

475
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I say you weren't answering them correctly.

476
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.910
