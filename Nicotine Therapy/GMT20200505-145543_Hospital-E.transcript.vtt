28
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.040

29
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.870

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.190
Ella Rose ODonnell: Finally, come down there was my boyfriend was on the run, like he was, he had a warrant because of a probation, but violation. So

32
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.700
Ella Rose ODonnell: He's an email. So getting it taken care of.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.710

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:31.500
Ella Rose ODonnell: I don't really know where I'm sure the probation violation was like just a PV and Albuquerque. But then they revoked his probation, I guess, without telling him in Montana. So you might have to go to Montana to see a judge, but we don't know yet.

37
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.940
Joan Kandel: Oh, gosh.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.760
Ella Rose ODonnell: That's hard. Yeah, but it's it's what needed to be done. I'm actually relieved

40
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.750
Joan Kandel: Are you

41
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.590
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, definitely. It was too little too crazy.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.990
Joan Kandel: YEAH, YEAH, WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD YOU'RE relieved and hopefully that'll work out. Okay.

44
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.320
Joan Kandel: Um, how long have you been together with him.

45
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.510
Ella Rose ODonnell: About, about a year and a half.

46
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
Joan Kandel: Uh huh, yeah and and how do you feel about your relationship.

47
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.400
Ella Rose ODonnell: It was really great at the beginning, um,

48
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.910
Ella Rose ODonnell: And then he he was an addict and but he had been clean for seven years and then somehow got introduced to one of my friends from like rehab or something.

49
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.750
And

50
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.420
Ella Rose ODonnell: And I guess my friend.

51
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.290
Ella Rose ODonnell: They somehow talks like got into doing heroin together and then

52
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.540
Ella Rose ODonnell: It took me a long time he was doing it and I was getting mad stuff and then I finally just gave in and tried it, like after like five or six months.

53
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.010
Ella Rose ODonnell: So,

54
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.910
Ella Rose ODonnell: Uh huh. And that was in like that was in like October last year.

55
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.690
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. And and you hadn't used before that.

56
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.120
Joan Kandel: No. Uh huh.

57
00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.690
Ella Rose ODonnell: I I did have, like, I had a drinking problem when I was like 19 and I went to rehab and I haven't drank ever since. So

58
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:11.880
Ella Rose ODonnell: Now that went away pretty quick. It was kind of a weird thing. I didn't really I don't know if I really had a real drinking problem. I just had a lot going on and

59
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.280
Ella Rose ODonnell: A lot at that time and then

60
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.490
Ella Rose ODonnell: But I haven't wanted to drink sense so

61
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.920
Ella Rose ODonnell: Uh huh. Yeah.

62
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.560
Joan Kandel: Did you did was rehab helpful for you.

63
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:37.380
Ella Rose ODonnell: Um, so yeah, it was, it definitely was it. It was an experience and like it kind of introduces you to like things some bad things to like that. Right.

64
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.470
Joan Kandel: Right.

65
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.920
Ella Rose ODonnell: Because I was pretty sheltered pretty isolated from what was really going on in the world. Besides, like alcohol.

66
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.090
Joan Kandel: Right, yeah. So it kind of opened your eyes.

67
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.560
Ella Rose ODonnell: It normalized it for me. Yeah.

68
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.030
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. Normal right

69
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.300
Joan Kandel: Now haha yeah. Oh, that's interesting. That's an interesting perspective.

70
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.840
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

71
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.790
Joan Kandel: How long were you in rehab.

72
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.370
Ella Rose ODonnell: 30 days just a program. And then I was in Oxford House in Albuquerque.

73
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.980
Joan Kandel: Okay, is that

74
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.360
Joan Kandel: Like a sober living

75
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.970
Ella Rose ODonnell: Place. Yeah, they have them all over

76
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.610
Ella Rose ODonnell: But yeah, in Albuquerque. It was really helpful. I got places like a bunch of really great girls so

77
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.020
Joan Kandel: Oh, nice.

78
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.850
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you still have friends from that.

79
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.090
Ella Rose ODonnell: I do. Yeah. One of my friends from the house is actually she runs Oxford for New Mexico, so

80
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.230
Oh, wow.

81
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.060
Joan Kandel: That's great.

82
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.110
Joan Kandel: Well, we just kind of dove into a conversation, but I didn't introduce myself. I'm Dr. Danielle.

83
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.010
Joan Kandel: TO MEET YOU. HI ELLA.

84
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.990
Joan Kandel: On. I'm glad you're here. That's good. So tell me a little bit about why you're here and what's happening with you.

85
00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:04.680
Ella Rose ODonnell: So ever since we started or I started, I was always trying to kind of get bolt like him off. And then I had no problem getting off of it like it was fine for me.

86
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.800
Ella Rose ODonnell: Until like January.

87
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.220
Ella Rose ODonnell: He went in to jail for like only like five or six days and

88
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:27.030
Ella Rose ODonnell: And I had and I wanted to stop. So I tried to stop and that's when my like withdraw started so that time I didn't actually I didn't stay clean. I ended up using again.

89
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:39.960
Ella Rose ODonnell: And then not and then February came or no later in January. He checked in with his people again and she sent him to a detox because he wasn't clean then either

90
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.340
Ella Rose ODonnell: Which is understandable because I he came out and I was using so

91
00:06:48.300 --> 00:07:03.330
Ella Rose ODonnell: Then he went in to detox and i i got clean while he was in detox. So when he came out, I was clean. Then, and then just a week later, you started using again. So then I did, um,

92
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.680
Ella Rose ODonnell: And then ever since then it's been kind of like

93
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.300
Ella Rose ODonnell: I feel like I gave up kind of trying to get off of it which sucks.

94
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.180
Ella Rose ODonnell: But then I got pregnant.

95
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.220
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay, no.

96
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.300
Joan Kandel: Dad, did you get to tell me about the pregnancy.

97
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.380

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.900
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

100
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.620
So,

101
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.840
Ella Rose ODonnell: November 18

102
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:40.470
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay, I'm so then we went to big OSA. And I actually got into see a great doctor. I really liked her name was Korean read

103
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.910
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, number

104
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:48.570
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, and so she got me started on Sunday text because I'm allergic to naloxone I tried it at

105
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.630
Ella Rose ODonnell: The for like anti cravings Adam The rehabs

106
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:07.680
Ella Rose ODonnell: And had like a really weird reaction like they try the shop to and just like gave me like kind of a rash and then my throat got really itchy and my tongue God's will and so

107
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.870
Ella Rose ODonnell: Oh, wow. Um, yeah. So then I'm

108
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.890
Ella Rose ODonnell: Goodness, my boyfriend is calling

109
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.090
Ella Rose ODonnell: So then Sunday, and then does it. Okay.

110
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.230
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

111
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.110
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay. He'll. He'll call later. Okay.

112
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:38.730
Ella Rose ODonnell: Um, and so I started this IV text and then that's when we decided, or he decided to finally turn himself in. So we moved here to Los Alamos and

113
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.060
Ella Rose ODonnell: I, I basically we had to move like right away.

114
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.550
Ella Rose ODonnell: Like in like two days. So we moved

115
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:56.730
Ella Rose ODonnell: And then I talked to my doctor after I had already moved. Dr. Reid and told her, and she can't prescribe out of the county so

116
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.430
Ella Rose ODonnell: Uh huh. Yeah, so that's where I am. And so I've, I had to

117
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:17.310
Ella Rose ODonnell: Contact like my old people that I got stuff from and I had to start using that, again, but um and I wouldn't have done that, if there wasn't such a huge risk of miscarriage. So

118
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.300
Ella Rose ODonnell: I want to hear it for good.

119
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.960
Ella Rose ODonnell: And I he I mean SEBI texts was working

120
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.310
Joan Kandel: Yeah, tell me about that. What would it. How did you feel when you were on the set the text.

121
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:49.770
Ella Rose ODonnell: So the first day I didn't feel very good. Um, it was only eight milligrams of first day and then I think we got up to lose either 14 or 16 I can't remember. But, uh, then I was on that for a few days and I felt great.

122
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.720
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

123
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.950
Ella Rose ODonnell: There was a little bit of like depression but

124
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.220
Ella Rose ODonnell: Like physically. I felt fine.

125
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.920
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. And what was the, what was the transition like

126
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.490
Joan Kandel: Getting on to it. Did you go into withdrawal.

127
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.730
Ella Rose ODonnell: To get on. Yeah. So when I first saw Dr. Reid, I was

128
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.840
Ella Rose ODonnell: I was withdrawing pretty bad.

129
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.500
I

130
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.760
Ella Rose ODonnell: Because we had moved to Chicago. So we didn't know anybody in for those

131
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.620
Ella Rose ODonnell: And basically, my plan was to just like count on this like trying to get something at the hospital and then sticking with that.

132
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:47.130
Ella Rose ODonnell: And I thought it was going to be in for those of her while I'm so then she prescribed that and that that first day, like she prescribed only the eight milligrams and she would be like tape it up kind of

133
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.510
Ella Rose ODonnell: But

134
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.530
Ella Rose ODonnell: So we started at eight and then the next day. I think it was 12

135
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.600
Ella Rose ODonnell: And then

136
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.740
Ella Rose ODonnell: After that it was 14 or 16 and

137
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:06.750
Ella Rose ODonnell: I mean, yeah, I was in withdrawal. When I first started it, and then I didn't feel that much better.

138
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.130
Joan Kandel: Until

139
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.110
Ella Rose ODonnell: I got the bigger dogs.

140
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:17.100
Joan Kandel: Got it, okay. But you didn't go into what we call precipitated withdrawal, you know,

141
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.450
Ella Rose ODonnell: No, no. Yeah, I don't

142
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.950
Know,

143
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.860
Joan Kandel: Because you are already in withdrawal.

144
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.820
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, and I, I was kind of under the

145
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.890
Ella Rose ODonnell: Do you still go into precipitated withdrawal is the no option isn't present

146
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.730
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's actually the buprenorphine that makes you go into

147
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.170
Joan Kandel: Not done the locks on

148
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.530
Ella Rose ODonnell: So I didn't go into that because I wasn't withdraw.

149
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.460
Joan Kandel: Got it. So, um, when did you last take any opiates now.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.630
Ella Rose ODonnell: I want to say, probably around like 10pm.

152
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.470
Joan Kandel: Okay, and how are you feeling right now.

153
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.900
Joan Kandel: In terms of thrills

154
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.120
Ella Rose ODonnell: Me. Okay. I mean,

155
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:19.680
Ella Rose ODonnell: The way like it's like when I get really cold. I get really cold but like start sweating. That's like the worst thing for me and I'm already like that. So, but I'm not like severe just

156
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.370
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

157
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.310
Ella Rose ODonnell: Keep now I know I just kind of go kind of crummy

158
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.470
Joan Kandel: Okay. And when was the last time you went into bad withdraw.

159
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:36.630
Ella Rose ODonnell: It was that time. Oh no, it was in Montana, um,

160
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.420
Ella Rose ODonnell: It was like

161
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.830
Joan Kandel: It wasn't before Rosa.

162
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:49.560
Ella Rose ODonnell: month and a half ago it was I think it was like right when I yeah it was before it goes out and it was like at the beginning of my pregnancy and

163
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.340
Ella Rose ODonnell: I knew

164
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.260
Joan Kandel: Okay, and

165
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.970
Joan Kandel: When you went to post it to see Dr. Reid, did you

166
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.830
Joan Kandel: Were you in worse withdrawal, then here you are now.

167
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.390
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yes.

168
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.070
Joan Kandel: How much worse.

169
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.480
Ella Rose ODonnell: I would say probably give it like three or four hours.

170
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.330
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. From now.

171
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.220
Joan Kandel: From the movie about that. Say, uh huh.

172
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.980
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I'm okay. Because I'm just trying to strategize here to

173
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.930
Joan Kandel: Get you transitioned on to it because I don't want you to go into bad precipitated withdrawal.

174
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.330
Joan Kandel: Because that yeah uncomfortable.

175
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.290
You don't. Yeah.

176
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.460
Joan Kandel: Have you ever had that you never had the only time you ever had.

177
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:42.840
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, I've never, I've never had precipitated which I've heard of it. And I've been really afraid. So I usually push it too far. I usually go like

178
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:43.530
Joan Kandel: Aha.

179
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.280
Ella Rose ODonnell: I usually get pretty like in which all before I take it.

180
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.960
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right.

181
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.890
So,

182
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:59.640
Joan Kandel: So what we'll do is when you do feel like you're in bad enough withdrawal, like you say probably three to four hours from, you know,

183
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.780
Joan Kandel: But we'll have you just take a very small amount.

184
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.680
Joan Kandel: Like start with two milligrams at a time.

185
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:15.510
Joan Kandel: And work my way up. Because if you if you were to take two milligrams and that threw you into precipitated with your all your precipitated withdrawal.

186
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.940
Ella Rose ODonnell: Wheatley as bad as if you took four

187
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.810
Joan Kandel: Or eight

188
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:30.570
Joan Kandel: So it's a kind of a good way to kind of take a small dose, just to kind of stick. Put your toe in the water and see. Make sure that you're not going to go into bed precipitated withdraw so

189
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.790
Joan Kandel: That's so that's how we'll do it.

190
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:33.990
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay.

191
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.380
Joan Kandel: So I'm going to get you the eight milligram

192
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.720
Joan Kandel: Pills.

193
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.120
Joan Kandel: You were taking pills. Right. Yeah.

194
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.740
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, they dissolve.

195
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.690
Joan Kandel: Yeah right under your tongue.

196
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.370
Joan Kandel: Yep, yep.

197
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:57.030
Joan Kandel: So what you'll what you'll do is you will break it into into four

198
00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.580
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay, you take

199
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.490
Joan Kandel: Two at a time. Okay, you have a pill cutter.

200
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.350
Ella Rose ODonnell: I don't

201
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.940
Ella Rose ODonnell: But I have a sharp knife, you might

202
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.590
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that's kind of

203
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.990
Ella Rose ODonnell: Dangerous and now they're missing.

204
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.390
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so if you could pick up a pill cutter at the pharmacy when you go get it. That would be great. Okay.

205
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.910
Joan Kandel: Just because it's a little bit more precise.

206
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:18.780
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

207
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.420
Joan Kandel: And and less dangerous than using a shirt.

208
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:21.840
Yeah.

209
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.660
Joan Kandel: Okay, so, um,

210
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:40.110
Joan Kandel: Yeah, and we don't know. We don't know how high you'll need to go. You may need to get up to the 14 to 16 milligrams, but we'll kind of see how it goes and

211
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:47.190
Joan Kandel: Okay, and see how you do. And, and we'll be seeing each other tomorrow because that's when our group is our weekly group is on

212
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.060

Joan Kandel: At four. Are you able to do that. Wednesday, so

214

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.070
Ella Rose ODonnell: It that time I spent on it.

220
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.720
Joan Kandel: I know that. Oh, gosh.

221
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.210
Ella Rose ODonnell: This because I've been drug tested in

222
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.390
Ella Rose ODonnell: In has had to. I also tried to Methadone clinic to I forgot to tell you that

223
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.710
Joan Kandel: Oh yeah, tell me about that.

224
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.600
Ella Rose ODonnell: Um, back in December know back back in like around

225
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:46.590
Ella Rose ODonnell: It was around Thanksgiving. I tried. We started methadone and

226
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.170
Ella Rose ODonnell: That was still when I was like, pretty like adamant on getting off of it. But my boyfriend still wanted to us while we were using methadone.

227
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:11.970
Ella Rose ODonnell: And so it's like, but when we wouldn't be using like everything was so good. We were so happy like everything was great, but He just, he's an I mean his, his body really drugs.

228
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.080
Yeah.

229
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:15.870
Ella Rose ODonnell: So he

230
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.060
Ella Rose ODonnell: See, so he and I would kind of like if he would use. I would use basically so

231
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:28.320
Ella Rose ODonnell: We started the Methadone clinic. And then when we would run out, we wouldn't feel bad or anything. It was nice.

232
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.350
Ella Rose ODonnell: But then that's so when he went to jail.

233
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.830
Ella Rose ODonnell: That's when he stopped that. Will he couldn't get method on jail for some reason.

234
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:56.550
Ella Rose ODonnell: And he was supposed to be able to, but he couldn't. And so when I found out that I didn't want to do it anymore because he was going to get out and I'll be so stupid, but as I had a bad codependency problem with him, but I've gotten a lot better.

235
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.170
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

236
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.480
Ella Rose ODonnell: So,

237
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.450
Ella Rose ODonnell: I don't, I didn't. I felt like I didn't really withdraw from the methadone, but that's also because I was

238
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.160
Joan Kandel: I see. And what was your dose of methadone.

239
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.710
Ella Rose ODonnell: 60 or 70

240
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.810
Ella Rose ODonnell: Okay, and the liquid

Joan Kandel: Yeah, you're, you're

276
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.270
Ella Rose ODonnell: Thinking about telling my mom.

277
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.740
Ella Rose ODonnell: One side on

278
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.730
Ella Rose ODonnell: The side effects.

279
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.410

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.340
Joan Kandel: Stable and everything. Yeah, how's your relationship in general with your mom.

281
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.110
Ella Rose ODonnell: Good except for i mean i hate hiding it from them, so it

282
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.200
Ella Rose ODonnell: Kind of makes us fight a lot because I'm kind of like bitter.

283
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.510
Ella Rose ODonnell: But and

284
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.830
Ella Rose ODonnell: I don't have the same personality as I usually do, but because it's like, you know, when does your personality. A lot

285
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:23.340
Ella Rose ODonnell: Um, so I don't know, it's kind of our relationship right now, isn't the best, but it's because of me.

286
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.600
So,

287
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:31.380
Joan Kandel: So it might really actually helped quite a bit to just open up and get

288
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.940
Joan Kandel: Get real and get honest.

289
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.680
Ella Rose ODonnell: Because the yeah my really nice.

290
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.390

Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

292
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.490
Ella Rose ODonnell: So we'll show Sam nervous about

293
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

294
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.850
Joan Kandel: Well, she knew

295
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.060
Joan Kandel: About the about the alcohol stuff and

296
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.820
Joan Kandel: Yeah, to get into rehab before

297
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:51.390
Yeah.

298
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.220
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so maybe she'll be understanding

299
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.230
Ella Rose ODonnell: This time, Amy, Kelsey.

300
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.510
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

301
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:13.980
Joan Kandel: Well, the other thing that's part of the bright heart health program is is therapy counseling. So we do the group, the group therapy which has a therapist and a doctor me

302
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:23.610
Joan Kandel: And then you'll also do individual therapy once a week at a different time. And so that, you know, maybe you can kind of process these things and strategize and

303
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:23.970
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

304
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.340

Ella Rose ODonnell: Where I wear

525
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:18.840
Ella Rose ODonnell: Glasses and contacts. Sometimes, if I remember but I'm I don't like to wear them stuff.

526
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.210

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.510
Joan Kandel: Yeah, okay.

533
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.210
Joan Kandel: And do I forgot to ask you how you use heroin, do you shoot

Joan Kandel: You smoke. Okay. Ever. Have you ever injected. No, no, no. Okay, um,

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.420
Joan Kandel: Nope, okay.

538
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:18.630
Joan Kandel: Do you did you. Um, have you had an ultrasound or listen to the baby's heartbeat.

539
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.030
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, I do. I'd listen to the heartbeat and having ultrasound. Yeah, I have that

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.470
Ella Rose ODonnell: Night like

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.230
Ella Rose ODonnell: It was right before I moved to pick up, sir.

542
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.760

543
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.980
Ella Rose ODonnell: No, I was only in for those of the week and a half.

544
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.170
Ella Rose ODonnell: Oh yeah, okay.

545
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.900
Joan Kandel: Well you got into care pretty quick. Good for you.

546
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.760
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah, I went like the first sales.

Joan Kandel: Yeah look good for you. Did you let did you learn to read. Know that you

548
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.490
Joan Kandel: That you left

549
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.320
Joan Kandel: Yeah you did. Okay. Because I'm sure she would worry about you with

550
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.040
Ella Rose ODonnell: Yeah.

551
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.880
Joan Kandel: If she didn't know that you like. If she just thought you were in town, but not coming

552
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.050
Ella Rose ODonnell: He's gone. Yeah.

553
00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.040
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right.

554
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.860
Joan Kandel: Okay, so, um,

555
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.740
Joan Kandel: So let's talk a little bit about the program we've already talked some about it.

556
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:20.010
Joan Kandel: So it is, as you know, it's all based on, you know, it's all telemedicine. So it's all based on the computer. And that's how

557
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.870
Joan Kandel: We meet with you.

558
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:28.650
Joan Kandel: And it's, as I said, there's a one group, a week and then one individual therapy, a week.

559
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:42.810
Joan Kandel: And unless you feel like you want more, you can have more therapy than that if you want to. If you feel like you need more support. You can also meet with me individually. If you ever wanted to. You can make an appointment and we can talk about whatever

560
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:56.400
Joan Kandel: Most of the time what we do in the group is it's an hour long and usually the first part of that is a medical check in. So I check in with everybody who's there just kind of how they're doing on their dose.

561
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.490
Joan Kandel: And and how they're doing in general medically mostly specific to the addiction stuff.

562
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.190
Joan Kandel: But sometimes people have

563
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.900
Joan Kandel: Other questions that they want to talk to me about not in the group, not in front of people.

564
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.450
Joan Kandel: And that's totally understandable and totally fine.

565
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.080
Joan Kandel: So I'm available for individual appointments to so

566
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.240
Joan Kandel: If you ever wanted to meet with me, you

567
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.840
Joan Kandel: Can do that.

568
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.540
Joan Kandel: Okay, so. Okay.

569
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.650
Joan Kandel: And then

570
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.310
Joan Kandel: So the groups is when we do the prescriptions. So usually folks will get a one week prescription

571
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:51.990
Joan Kandel: And if but if people don't show up to their appointments like for individual therapy sometimes will shorten the prescription to just a few days to get you to that appointment so that you show up for that one. And then you'll get another prescription after that.

572
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.520
Ella Rose ODonnell: So make sense. Okay. Yeah.

573
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.590
Joan Kandel: But if, as long as you're showing up to your appointments and stuff like that, then we do a week at a time.

574
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:12.510
Joan Kandel: For the from group to group. So, our group is going to be Wednesdays at four. So check in at about 330 because every week. They'll have you do a survey, like a self survey, how you're doing how things are going.

575
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:24.870
Joan Kandel: And that takes a little while so the check in process usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes so show up at 330 tomorrow. And then it's actually a new group.

576
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.750
Joan Kandel: Jessica is going to be the therapist and she's wonderful I'm going to be the doctor.

577
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:38.520
Joan Kandel: And I think we have three people in there. So it's kind of a small group. Generally, we usually run our groups about eight to 10 people

578
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:49.530
Joan Kandel: But since this is a new group. You'll all be getting to know each other at the same time, which is kind of cool. And it's kind of smallish to start and we'll have folks. Add to that as we go along, but

579
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.190
Joan Kandel: That'll be

580
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.460
Joan Kandel: That'll be really good. I think you'll like the people who are in there.

581
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.420
Joan Kandel: And hopefully, that can be a support to you.

582
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.890
Joan Kandel: So,

583
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.670
Joan Kandel: The one other thing I want to tell you about is that part of the program is

584
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.800
Joan Kandel: Your indirect screens and it's about every month or so.

585
00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:21.510
Joan Kandel: And what they do is you do not have to go into the lab for that every month we'll send it to you in the mail.

586
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:34.050
Joan Kandel: So will you'll get in the mail, like a bulky package like a big envelope that has a urine cup in it and what you do when you get that envelope is don't open it.

587
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:47.490
Joan Kandel: Call the virtual clinic because they will have you open it in front of them so that they know that it wasn't tampered with. And then they'll have you take it out and then I'll have you go to the bathroom and come back and then they'll read it on the camera.

588
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:48.960
Ella Rose ODonnell: I'll say

589
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.950
Joan Kandel: That's so that's how that'll work. And it's just really easy. So you just do that at home.

590
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.030
Ella Rose ODonnell: Next,

591
00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:09.720
Joan Kandel: It's good, and really the virtual clinic is the place to go if you have any concerns. Any questions, any problems with your prescription any problems with your appointments. If you needed to reschedule something that's the place to go.

592
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.110
Joan Kandel: If you need to get in touch with me. You can ask them to

593
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.020
Joan Kandel: contact me if you need to.

594
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:22.260
Joan Kandel: And and i can also give you my email if you wanted to.

595
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.370
Okay.

596
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.470
Joan Kandel: So,

597
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:49.800
Joan Kandel: If you needed to get in touch with me. But generally speaking, virtual clinic is the place to to to go if you need anything like that because they can coordinate things. But if you needed to just say something to me or had a quick question for me. You could email me directly.

598
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:56.040
Joan Kandel: All right, and that's Jay candle at Breitbart health com

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.430
Ella Rose ODonnell: blends into else

613
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.780
Joan Kandel: Okay, so will you call when you talk to virtual clinic.

614
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.730
Joan Kandel: We tell them that in your chart, it has one and

615
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.270
Joan Kandel: So they can fix that, because I was wondering about that.

616
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.900
Joan Kandel: Because I thought it was strange to not have two ends and two L's, because that

617
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.580
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. So they have it wrong. So let them know

618
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.420
Okay.

619
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:16.860
Joan Kandel: Do you have questions for me. So I guess we didn't talk specifically about your about your minutes, but we did a little bit. Do you understand how to do your like take the yeah

620
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:29.190
Joan Kandel: The two milligrams at a time. Yeah, okay, good. So if you have any questions about that, like later today. You can email me directly and say this is what's happening. And, you know, just something you know that I'm

621
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:37.290
Joan Kandel: I'm here. If you're having any problems, but I don't expect that you're going to have problems, I would suggest that you wait like we've talked about, you know, another

622
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:46.590
Joan Kandel: Three or four hours until you're a bit more sick, but not super duper sick and then start with two milligrams under the tongue and just kind of see it. You may not feel

623
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:59.760
Joan Kandel: A lot better, but what we want is you. We don't want you to feel worse if you feel worse and you feel like all of a sudden you get really sick, then that's precipitated withdrawal. And then if precipitated withdrawal happens. You just have to wait it out.

624
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.570
Joan Kandel: So,

625
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:08.130
Joan Kandel: If that were to happen. Don't take any more. Just kind of wait and wait a few more hours to get sick again and try it again. And it'll work.

626
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.660
Joan Kandel: I don't expect it to happen, but if it does, then, then that's the thing to do and

627
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.880
Joan Kandel: Okay, it's not a cause for freaking out.
