Belis Aladag: I'm in the future, especially being diabetic, you know, that's something we can help you with. Do you think you're

131
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.350

132
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.170

133
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:44.070
Andy Keffer: I'm working on. I'm working on getting off on myself here I've got gone from two packs a day down to pat so

134
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.630
Belis Aladag: Oh, good for you. That's

135
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.610
Andy Keffer: It's a slow process.

136
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:57.870
Belis Aladag: Okay, but you're doing it and you're working on it. Good. I think that would be so key for you, you know, with the diabetes and the wound healing problems. Yeah.

137
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:11.880
Belis Aladag: Because it really affects the the the insides of our veins and arteries and that's where the blood flow happens for the healing. Right. So if we can really get rid of the the cigarettes for you. That would be

138
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.790
Andy Keffer: my, uh, my, my dad passed away here.

139
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:24.150
Andy Keffer: A couple years ago and he had he got on have early onset dementia caused by us Copenhagen us. Oh, wow.

140
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.800
Belis Aladag: See

141
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.980
Andy Keffer: That's what, that's what made me decide to quit smoking.

142
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:38.520
Belis Aladag: I'm so glad I mean I'm so sorry about your father. But, you know, something that inspires you to do something good for you, you know,

143
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:48.420
Belis Aladag: Something good can come out of it. Maybe. Um, but yeah, going down from two packs to half a pack. That's huge. So

144
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:57.000
Andy Keffer: Yeah, hey it's took me almost a year to do that, but it's it's a slow process. But I'm working on it. Okay.

145
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:19.680
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, if you want. Just know that I have. I can give you things like loss and just like hard candies. You can suck on in replacement of a cigarette. For example, um, there's gum. Some people like the gun. They chew chew and then they park it and then they kind of let the nicotine come out.

146
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:29.850
Belis Aladag: And then of course there's patches. So some people like to put on a patch. Let's say it gives them like a daily like a steady dose of nicotine and then

147
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:38.130
Belis Aladag: If they don't crave a cigarette. Great. But if they do. Still, despite that they can then use the laws injured, we can kind of combine all those things.

148
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:47.070
Belis Aladag: But for now, you know, you're working on it. Just know that, you know, anytime you want a boost you let me know.

149
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.560
Andy Keffer: I've been using a vaporizer.

150
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.050
Andy Keffer: Okay, lately and it, it seems to help a lot. Maybe

151
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.150
Andy Keffer: The biggest thing. The biggest, biggest thing I have is the hand to mouth breaking that habit.

152
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:01.740
Andy Keffer: Break.

153
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:13.710
Belis Aladag: That yeah and the VPN can help with that, of course, um, but not to be the bearer of bad news, but that also has its own set of issues you may have heard

154
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.010
Andy Keffer: Yeah.

155
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.670
Belis Aladag: What the pneumonia is and the vitamin E in the in the

156
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.040
Andy Keffer: Formulation, and I'm laying in London one

157
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.070
Belis Aladag: Like you can't win.

158
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.640
Andy Keffer: So I started, I started making my own my own juice so

159
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.530
Belis Aladag: Oh, maybe

160
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.650
Andy Keffer: Use that I don't use the factory made stuff so

161
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.980
Andy Keffer: Many mine. I don't do any of that.

162
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.390
Belis Aladag: OK, so maybe that way. It's a little healthier, who knows.

163
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.770
Andy Keffer: A little better for me.

164
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.020
Belis Aladag: Okay, okay. That's something okay and then

165
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:54.450
Belis Aladag: Tell me about any any history or current risk of like suicide suicidal thoughts.

166
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.190
Andy Keffer: No, no.

167
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.200
Andy Keffer: I have any of that.

168
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.280
Andy Keffer: Okay, thank goodness. Okay.

169
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.230
Belis Aladag: Um,

170
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:19.650
Belis Aladag: Okay, so I think I got a pretty good history. I just want to know, tell me a bit about your the oxycodone, um, when were you what was going on that you were placed on it, what happened.

171
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:27.360
Andy Keffer: Why they started me on bike it in. I went from biking in Norco from Norco de Burgh set set

172
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:35.730
Andy Keffer: The timer least oxy cotton, which didn't really work all that well and I was alone. I was allergic to the real interest to the time release gel.

173
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:45.150
Andy Keffer: Hmm, that's, you know, that's the reason why I can't take the morphine, either. And then they put me on the box code on history leads because I've got a I've got degenerative disc disease and

174
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:53.280
Andy Keffer: Arthritis and nerve damage in my spine at the Law Group. When I was 19 when on the concrete.

175
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.220
Belis Aladag: Oh wow, okay.

176
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.510
Andy Keffer: So I've got a

177
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.590
Belis Aladag: Big fall on you hurt your spine. When you were 19

178
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:08.100
Andy Keffer: Yeah, I've got back got back issues that I've had for, you know, pretty much as long as I can remember now.

179
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.200
Andy Keffer: And they turn

180
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:19.350
Andy Keffer: On the Oxycodone and it just started to just got to the point where it wasn't working. So I'd have to take more and more and more than you got to the point where I was taking six. I'm going to time and

181
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.260
Andy Keffer: Just, it was working out.

182
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.030
Belis Aladag: I got you. So I see. So from a young age. You've had this chronic back pain and

183
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:40.230
Belis Aladag: You were placed on these meds that yeah it's kind of like a Nolan situation. They just, you just develop tolerance and tolerance and we just keep going. You hit a wall.

184
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.770
Belis Aladag: I see, I see.

185
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.420
Belis Aladag: Um,

186
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:53.670
Belis Aladag: And have you heard of Narcan I can also five that. Do you have some

187
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.130
Andy Keffer: Um, yeah, I do. Okay.

188
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.640
Belis Aladag: So I don't have to prescribe it, but it's just something for safety reasons. If you're just taking Suboxone and there's no value.

189
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.650
Andy Keffer: For. That's the only thing I'm taking so

190
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:13.710
Belis Aladag: You should be fine. I mean, the risk of overdose, that is extremely small. There's actually a safety kind of index on it so

191
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.040
Andy Keffer: Yes.

192
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.900
Andy Keffer: It's called ceiling cap.

193
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:30.690
Belis Aladag: Exactly. You know about it. Okay, good. So yeah, so that keeps you safe from any sort of respiratory too much respiratory depression but you know it's good to have on hand in case of like you see anyone else on the street or, you know,

194
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.380
Andy Keffer: So,

195
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:40.470
Andy Keffer: That's why I keep it because there's a lot of my friends to use and I've had a couple of overdose in my car and I'm like a no no no. Oh, no. Here, take this.

196
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:53.190
Belis Aladag: Yay. Yeah. Yeah. So, so it's good, it's good to have to public safety thing and do remember though if you use it to call nine one or drop them off at the hospital because it is

197
00:15:53.550 --> 00:16:00.900
Belis Aladag: Rapid but it reverses again. So like it's good for like half an hour. It brings them out and then they're going to go slip back in

198
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.300
Andy Keffer: And

199
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:11.640
Belis Aladag: You know, legal trouble they shouldn't get into any legal trouble related to any drug possession or drug use, if you call nine one or anything like there should be

200
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.150
Andy Keffer: Good Samaritan laws to protect people nowadays so so you

201
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.820
Belis Aladag: Know people are afraid. Oh, I don't want to call the call.

202
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.150
Andy Keffer: Yeah, you kind of freaks me out the call conference. I'm like that's going on.

203
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:29.370
Belis Aladag: Yeah, people are afraid for good reason. But that's exactly why they put the laws in place so people's lives aren't wrist. Yeah.

204
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.090
Yeah.

205
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:40.410
Belis Aladag: Now, if you had a warrant for your arrest. I believe they still could take you, or whatever. But other than that, from a previous thing.

206
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.890
Andy Keffer: I don't think I got that going on.

207
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.930
Belis Aladag: Good. Speaking of which, any de Lys or any like legal trouble.

208
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.580
Andy Keffer: No. No. Okay.

209
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.120
Belis Aladag: I'm got you. Okay. So Andrew

210
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.690
Belis Aladag: I'm going to refill your medication. Um, what

211
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.540
Andy Keffer: Uh huh. How do we do the refills up with you guys, are they once a week or once a month or

212
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:18.990
Belis Aladag: Yeah so. So here's how we do things. We have groups. So I have, for example, I have option of

213
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.880
Belis Aladag: Can you do like Mondays at 9am, could you

214
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.600
Andy Keffer: Know that afternoon is better for me.

215
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.170
Belis Aladag: Then I there's a Thursday 4pm

216
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.400
Andy Keffer: That would work.

217
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.080
Belis Aladag: Okay, we can do a Thursday 4pm which in that group from now.

218
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:49.470
Belis Aladag: I'm where you know we check in like this, but it's briefer, you know, just to be like, Okay, how's it going, all while still sober any concerns. Any other things to say.

219
00:17:49.860 --> 00:18:03.180
Belis Aladag: And then I do the same with like a bunch of other people that are on the zoom call and then there's a therapist with me there who leads the rest of the discussion. So it's one hour. It's like four to five.

220
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:14.970
Belis Aladag: And the discussion is usually like some sort of recovery based thing, like, okay, how do I keep saying how do I, you know, it's all useful stuff we could all use like

221
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:27.630
Belis Aladag: You know, we try to make it relevant and we want it to be useful to everybody in the group. So it should be fun. It should be good. And it's kind of like you get to see a bunch of other people, different ages different stages.

222
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:44.850
Belis Aladag: And kind of. That's how we do it. And then we do a refill for you and then we'll go through it again and again and again, I think the model I'm new too bright heart health as well. But the model is they want they prefer us to keep that going for, for a good while.

223
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:45.840
Belis Aladag: And then

224
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.000
Andy Keffer: And then eventually we can

225
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.530
Belis Aladag: Extend it and stuff.

226
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.770
Andy Keffer: Yeah, cuz I'm my other doctor, he would write me for two months, but I wouldn't seem I've only seen once every two months.

227
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:56.910
Belis Aladag: Okay.

228
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.700
Andy Keffer: And we, you know, he'd Rodney Rodney for 30 days supply with a refill. Uh huh, which

229
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.100
Andy Keffer: It doesn't matter to me. Either way, it doesn't matter.

230
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.020
Belis Aladag: Yeah, let's try this out and see how far we go and then

231
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.050
Belis Aladag: And then we go from there, you know,

232
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:33.360
Belis Aladag: We'll adjust it as we go. And, and, you know, I'll send you an email reminding you, there's like a blood test at Qwest labs that you should do, just to see how your liver function is doing, because this process is processed through your liver. So it's good to have a baseline labs.

233
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:45.180
Belis Aladag: They also will do a urine test. They're just the one time, you know, just to check and then eventually every month you'll get something in the mail. Don't open it. Just call

234
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:57.660
Belis Aladag: Until clinic and say, Hey, I got your on below. See here and then they'll watch you open the envelope you go to your bathroom come back. He shown the like temperature and seven. So it's like a drug test witness drug test type thing where

235
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:13.110
Belis Aladag: They okay yeah I'm taking my Suboxone and I'm not doing anything else. And it's not a punitive thing if there was a problem like you're using something again or whatever, like, obviously we use it as a marker to help you, not as a punitive thing. Okay.

236
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.450
Belis Aladag: And then I think those are the only things I should remind you of

237
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:30.960
Belis Aladag: You have the option of doing individual therapy. So you'll be assigned a therapist if you want to you can also do visits with that person one on one, but okay.

238
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.040
Andy Keffer: It's optional.

239
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:43.410
Belis Aladag: If you want just meet her. I think you're assigned to Serena, she's getting most of my patients. So you'll meet her on Thursday at four.

240
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:54.210
Belis Aladag: So we can do it that way. So since since you and I already met. Now, do you want to skip this Thursday and go for the following Thursday.

241
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.210
Andy Keffer: I'm not going to go this Thursday, that's fine.

242
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.500
Belis Aladag: Check it out. Yes, you.

243
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.090
Andy Keffer: don't check it out anyway.

244
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:08.880
Belis Aladag: Is. See how it feels. Okay. So, on Thursday, you meet her, and then you can decide. Yeah, yeah, maybe I want to do individual visits as well.

245
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.900
Belis Aladag: Because it can help you. You were mentioning anger and other things that

246
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:21.510
Andy Keffer: Yeah, but I have a bad thing or issue tends to tends to get out of control. Sometimes, and I have to remind myself and and sometimes it's hard to do.

247
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:32.130
Belis Aladag: Yeah, so if we can. Yeah, maybe there's things that that'll help you out with that. So we'll do that. I'm finally medication wise.

248
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:38.460
Belis Aladag: Meds. You mentioned those to the human log sliding scale in the vascular pen anything else.
