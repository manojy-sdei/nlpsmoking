00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And makes a difference makes you appreciate the small things. As for sure.

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Okay, so what we're doing is we're going to complete what's called a bio psychosocial

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to ask you just a series of questions. And then if you could just give me as much information around each question, that would be great.

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK. OK, so the first question is, what brings you to treatment and why now.

10
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.780
Jessica Freeman: Well, I've been in treatment for since

11
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.570
Jessica Freeman: April of 2016 and

12
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.720
Jessica Freeman: I've had some success with it.

13
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.080
Jessica Freeman: I actually am coming up on two years of continuous sobriety. On March 7 so that's exciting.

14
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.530
Jessica Freeman: I want to keep doing what's working

15
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your substance abuse history. What age did you first were what age were you first exposed what substance was it and how did it progress from there.

16
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.060
Jessica Freeman: When I was 16 I was introduced to alcohol and marijuana

17
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:58.260
Jessica Freeman: And i don't know i was i was a really good student and I didn't get really into it right away, but then when I was 17 I had, you know, a trauma happen and after that it became, you know, drugs and alcohol became my escape for you know 20 plus years.

18
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.980
Jessica Freeman: And it escalated, you know, by the time I was 18 or 19 I was

19
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:21.870
Jessica Freeman: Doing painkillers and you know I had tried like Coke and some other things. And then when I was 21 I, you know, went to the clubs and just got wasted all that time and you know ecstasy and all kinds of stuff and

20
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.820
Jessica Freeman: You know my over the years I became a mother when I was 23 and I wasn't really prepared for that.

21
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.890
Jessica Freeman: Mentally and emotionally. I have like arrested, you know, at like 17 years old and

22
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.690
Jessica Freeman: Yeah I did the best I could, but I was still drinking and using a lot of pain killers, you know, trying to live a normal life but

23
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.060
Jessica Freeman: It didn't go so well.

24
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.750
Jessica Freeman: Such as, what else do you want to know.

25
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What alcohol is your primary drug of choice.

26
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.440
Jessica Freeman: Well, good choices on painkillers. But alcohol is the underlying basis of everything you know

27
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any, any pain.

28
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.180
Jessica Freeman: Like me right now. Yeah.

29
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any physical issues that you've been dealing with any kind of pain.

30
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:31.710
Jessica Freeman: I mean like I have getting over a sinus infection so out a little pain in my head. But other than that, I'm good. And I saw a doctor and I have medicine, so I'm

31
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, no physical issues.

32
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.440
Jessica Freeman: No, not really. Okay.

33
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.120
Jessica Freeman: And formal

34
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and you said that you had a history of substance abuse treatment and how many can you tell me a little bit about that.

35
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.360
Jessica Freeman: Well, sure. I like the first time I got

36
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:06.990
Jessica Freeman: Like when I went to rehab. Like I staged my own intervention. I told my parents everything I have been going on. And, you know, but they didn't really know how to deal with it. So they

37
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:19.500
Jessica Freeman: They didn't know anything about treatment and recovery and neither did I. So they ended up packing me up and shipping me off to nowheresville Oklahoma to Scientology rehab.

38
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:32.640
Jessica Freeman: Which, by the way, has nothing to do with the 12 steps and I spent five months in in Oklahoma basically learning, learning the basics of Scientology.

39
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.060
Jessica Freeman: Not what I wanted, or was interested in at all. But I had to do it. So I did it.

40
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.930
Jessica Freeman: And then I started drinking and using again like pretty much right after not I went a few years without using any like

41
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.320
Jessica Freeman: Drugs, per se, like hard drugs limited it to alcohol and painkillers.

42
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.920
Mm hmm.

43
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.230
Jessica Freeman: Actually, no. I think it was just alcohol for like three years.

44
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.900
Jessica Freeman: And then I got back into the painkillers and from there you know it just

45
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.680
Jessica Freeman: Took off and escalated.

46
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.790
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, so everything came to a head in April of 2016 my boyfriend.

47
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:35.550
Jessica Freeman: Well, I signed up to go to rehab because I knew that I needed to. And while I was in rehab thinking that my family and my boyfriend, the father of my year and a half year old son, year and a half year old. I don't think that's right.

48
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.080
Jessica Freeman: He was a year and a half.

49
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:47.850
Jessica Freeman: And you okay anyway. Um, but yeah, I thought everything was cool, like everybody was supportive. But then I went into detox, which is only for a few days. You know, like

50
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:59.880
Jessica Freeman: 10 days max and nobody would talk to me while I was there. And then when I got out my boyfriend took the baby moved out changed his number I couldn't reach him.

51
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:18.210
Jessica Freeman: And my parents were so angry at me for going back into rehab and embarrassing them and this that and the other, that they like protected his location and I didn't get him back until I you know really clean up my act and got my shit together, you know,

52
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:31.260
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, I went to detox and then I went right back out into the madness. Then I had to go into A RECOVERY HOUSE AND I WAS IN A RECOVERY HOUSE FOR like

53
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.210
Jessica Freeman: Four or five months. And that was between October of 2016 in February of 2017

54
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:50.070
Jessica Freeman: And then when I got out of the recovery house. I got I had been working, you know, you work up to it. You go from a complete gutter rap and then you learn how to be responsible.

55
00:06:50.400 --> 00:07:00.330
Jessica Freeman: And then you go out into the world. So that's what I did. And I got an apartment and I, you know, was working, and then they let my son visit me

56
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:15.900
Jessica Freeman: And I noticed some serious signs of neglect and I was like, hey, I'm not sending him back to you. And he said, okay, and at that point he disappeared. You state of Michigan is not in our son's life early at all.

57
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

58
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past mental health treatment.

59
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:32.610
Jessica Freeman: Well before I got sober. I was diagnosed with borderline. But now that I'm sober. I don't really manifest any of those symptoms.

60
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

61
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past suicide.

62
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Attempts thoughts.

63
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.130
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, like when it got really bad. Yeah, but I didn't actually want to do it.

64
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.740
Jessica Freeman: And I didn't really try it. I was just like,

65
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.230
Jessica Freeman: It was a call for like cry for help kind of thing.

66
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any

67
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.100
Jessica Freeman: Stand at the time, but now I do

68
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past self harm.

69
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.970
Jessica Freeman: Just there at the end before I got sober.

70
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.630
Jessica Freeman: I'm just a little bit of cutting but

71
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:15.030
Jessica Freeman: You know, it wasn't a thing that I did in my life. And it was just when I was at the lowest bottom, bottom, bottom

72
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any past homicide attempts. That's okay.

73
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, tell me, going back to your childhood. Tell me a little bit about the family dynamics that you grew up in, boy, your parents married your whole life, or did they separate divorce, we adopted.

74
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.980
Jessica Freeman: My parents

75
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.070
Jessica Freeman: Were married until I was 21

76
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:50.460
Jessica Freeman: They are very religious very strict and we were high achievers. It was just kind of expected and our family very musical as well. Um,

77
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.790
Jessica Freeman: My mom has difficulty with her emotions.

78
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:09.600
Jessica Freeman: And my dad is more of like a like ignore the problem type of thing, like he just both my parents live in still to this day like kind of a state of denial, they just

79
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:21.000
Jessica Freeman: An emotional. I never had a model for like emotional regulation skills, skills, and neither did my brother and he is also

80
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:31.500
Jessica Freeman: an alcoholic and a drug addict, but he lives in Portugal, and he doesn't think you know he doesn't identify as someone with a problem but

81
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:41.610
Jessica Freeman: He doesn't have any coping skills or emotional regulation skills, either. And it's sad. I've learned it. I've learned it in therapy and I learned it in

82
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:50.040
Jessica Freeman: A day and I'm super grateful because if I weren't an alcoholic and a drug addict. I wouldn't have learned what I know today.

83
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have one brother is he older or younger than you.

84
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.560
Jessica Freeman: He's three and a half years older. And that is my only sibling.

85
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And any mental health issues in your family or substance abuse or workaholic or gambling.

86
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:29.340
Jessica Freeman: Sure. My, my mom's grandfather was an alcoholic, but they kept it really hush hush. So nobody talked about it. I didn't find out until after he was dead. And then my dad side, we got a couple alcoholics and addicts. I have a cousin and Uncle

87
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.930
Jessica Freeman: Two cousins and an uncle that are alcoholics and addicts.

88
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay I'm going back a little bit further. How was school for you.

89
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:54.420
Jessica Freeman: I did really well in school. I'm talking like elementary, middle and high school after that trauma at 17 I had enough credits to graduate early and I was not managing

90
00:10:54.990 --> 00:11:03.930
Jessica Freeman: Well, so I graduated a semester early and went off into the world and moved out of my parents house two days after my 18th birthday.

91
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any are you currently in a relationship.

92
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.240
Jessica Freeman: Not have any romantic kind. No.

93
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and it's just you and your son that live in the home.

94
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.330
Jessica Freeman: And my little dog.

95
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and any past or present legal issues.

96
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:37.200
Jessica Freeman: And yeah, I had an arrest in September of 2016 which kind of precipitated the recovery house.

97
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.710
Jessica Freeman: It was

98
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:56.610
Jessica Freeman: resisting arrest, really. I was just drunk at home alone screaming obscenities at these children that were noisy and I didn't know that you don't have to open the door when the police come

99
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:10.050
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, that's all resolved. I went through probation and i i met all the requirements and that it's been over for a while with a November 2018 yeah

100
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay and and any financial stressors at this moment.

101
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.590
Jessica Freeman: Kinda. I mean,

102
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:26.130
Jessica Freeman: So my son is autistic and I'm a single parent and his dad really doesn't do anything to support anything on

103
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:41.160
Jessica Freeman: My mom is a big help financially but you know it's not her responsibility, so I can only work part time and take care of my son and like taken to all the things that he needs to go to

104
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:50.070
Jessica Freeman: I've tried 40 hours a week, it doesn't work, at least not at this stage in the game. So yeah, I mean,

105
00:12:50.700 --> 00:13:07.800
Jessica Freeman: I make like $10 an hour, which I made more when I was in high school, like I've never made $10 and hours the shitty is wage, I would never work for that, but I'm working for that now because, well, the real estate thing. It's something I want to grow into in my career.

106
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:18.150
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and also because I need to keep my income at a certain level so that I can stay qualified for the services that me and my son need

107
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:27.780
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. So yeah, I mean, I'm okay. Everything's gonna be fine. My mom's got my back. She's not going to let me land in the gutter. I'm good.

108
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.410
Jessica Freeman: I just don't like being in like under her thumb, you know. Yeah.

109
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

110
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not self sufficient.

111
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sense. Yeah. Um, is there anything that I didn't bring up that you think is important. We know about you.

112
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.430
Jessica Freeman: Hmm.

113
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.070
Jessica Freeman: Well,

114
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.480
Jessica Freeman: Like, for what purposes like therapy purposes.

115
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, anything that you think is important for bright heart to know why we're working with you.

116
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.670
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and

117
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.440
Jessica Freeman: You know how my ex stole my baby.

118
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:27.900
Jessica Freeman: I just told you about that. A few minutes ago. Okay, well my ex husband from when I was let's see we got married at 20 when I was 23 and I divorced him when I was 25 we have a son, his name is Brendan and Brendan is going to turn 17 next month, um,

119
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:41.220
Jessica Freeman: I lost both my babies like they were taking from from me and you know I've had, I've had key and back for a long for a while now. It was I got him back in

120
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.180
Jessica Freeman: late June of 2017

121
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.850
Jessica Freeman: But it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a thing for me like

122
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:59.280
Jessica Freeman: All I want to do is be the best mother that I can be and I you know I have so many regrets about

123
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.340
Jessica Freeman: The decisions that I made when I was younger about about my kids, you know,

124
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.260
Jessica Freeman: It's it's a thing, it's, it's a resonating issue for me. Like, am I a good enough mother.

125
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:24.540
Jessica Freeman: You know, I know. I can't fix what I've done in the past. But what I'm doing now and have been doing for a while now, now that I'm sober and good is

126
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:35.520
Jessica Freeman: Just really try trying to be the best mom, I can for my kids and have confidence about the mother than, than I am. People compliment me all the time on the mother than I am, but I just like, it's like, I don't believe it, you know.

127
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.740
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I do because I put in the work.

128
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:51.840
Jessica Freeman: I really do, but it's just this hot button for me and my mom was the star witness in both of the custody suits, where I lost my children and

129
00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:10.050
Jessica Freeman: You know, we've had a lot to work through we've gone to therapy together. My dad and I have gone through therapy together and I don't harbor any like lingering resentments, but with my mom. She's got all this power over my life. She really does. And I don't trust her.

130
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you have something that you want to work on.

131
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.090
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

132
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um,

133
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let me think. Are they engaging you in any kind of group therapy.

134

136
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're going to be going to group. And let me take a look really fast and see who your primary therapist is because, are you interested in engaging in individual therapy to

137
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.660
Jessica Freeman: Um, yeah. I think that'd be great.

138
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.020

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on.

142
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.910

149
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like what I picked up on was guilt and shame. And that's always a big one.

150
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely letting go of resentments and developing trust with people that have harmed you in the past.

Okay.

189
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.510

205
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:33.120
Jessica Freeman: Because I have to be completely ready before I take my kids to school and we have to be out of the house at 730 to get there. So getting both of us ready and out of the house by 730 I gotta get up really early just

206
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay, I'm starting this whole regimen of getting up at five in the morning.

207
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Going to bed by 930 10 o'clock at night just really kind of restructuring, my whole sleeping pattern and it has been a challenge.

208
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.670
Jessica Freeman: I bet.

209
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:56.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, eight o'clock is a good definitely a good time. It gives me enough time to

Jessica Freeman: Right, right.

223
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For some reason that

224
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The time change. And it's only one hour. And it's so simple.

225
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just messes with me. I don't know what that's about one hour difference and I it's like I go through this whole thing was like one hour wait

226
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.490
Jessica Freeman: No, I feel the same way.

227
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.440
Jessica Freeman: Like, it seems like it's something simple, but then sometimes it gets complicated.

228
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, alright, so I have you scheduled for Friday the 28th at

229
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.710

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 8am my time 9am your time.

232
00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

233
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.100
Jessica Freeman: It's going to be okay.

234
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.210
And

235
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thursdays.

236
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From that point forward, and we'll just start developing and

237
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Different

238
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can bring to the table DB T skills CVT skills you

239
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can look at emotion regulation, we can work out, you know, really kind of look at different avenues and faucets letting go of old you know guilt and shame and resentments and

240
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.640
Jessica Freeman: Just kind of really try to

241
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.300
Develop

242
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Develop some freedom in that area.

243
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sound like a plan.

244
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.530
Jessica Freeman: Yes. And you know, I actually have thought of something. Maybe we can add to the list.

245
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.540
Jessica Freeman: You know, we talked about the self sufficiency thing.

246
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.200
Jessica Freeman: I almost feel like it's impossible. You know, when we clear away the wreckage of our past.

247
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.090
Jessica Freeman: It's, it's so much right

248
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:59.460
Jessica Freeman: And I had to do five years worth of back taxes and it was a long slow, painful expensive endeavor. But I got it done.

249
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:06.960
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. And so this next mountain that I need to climb, if I'm ever going to get anywhere is

250
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.930
Jessica Freeman: Improving my credit score like getting it out of the gutter and having one

251
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:24.120
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. Which I don't even know it is very overwhelming. I don't have any idea where to start. And when I get overwhelmed like that I freeze and I do nothing. So

252
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:40.170
Jessica Freeman: Um, I don't know, like getting motivated to do that stuff and then staying on track with it and like, I don't know. I need to do something about that. And I've been frozen for a while on that and I need to. I need to fix it. If I'm going to move forward.

253
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so we can definitely look at all options. I know one thing that I do is I go through Credit Karma.

254
00:27:49.440 --> 00:28:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and Credit Karma calm and it's free and they check all three of your credit reports, give you a list of the things that are on your credit in collections and you can compile a list and phone numbers and be able to either dispute the charge through Credit Karma or

255
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:16.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Call them and make arrangements with them for, you know, with little to no monthly payments.

256
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that will help boost up

257
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your credit score and help you get back on track. So there's that piece that we, you and I can talk about and work on through this process to

258
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay.

259
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.690
Jessica Freeman: Cool. Thank you.

260
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sound like a plan.

261
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Okay, so I will see you Friday the 28th at ATM and we will go from there.

262
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.020
Jessica Freeman: Sounds good. Thanks.

263
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have a great weekend and I will talk to you next week. Okay.

264
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, bye.
