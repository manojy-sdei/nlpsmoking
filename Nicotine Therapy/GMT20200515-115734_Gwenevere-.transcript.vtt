00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Supposed to be Heather.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Domingos bio psychosocial although shall see her checked in yet.

3
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Please transcribe verbatim. When I asked questions.

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Questions such as

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Inquiry, and then just write the client does not endorse Hi, good morning, how are you

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.610
Galaxy J7 Crown: Good morning. I'm good. I think I might have set my alarm for PM instead of am

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.240
Oh,

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It works and makes a big difference, isn't it.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.190
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yeah, but I don't know I I still wake up anyway though like I was laying there thinking about it and I popped up and I was like oh crap.

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's today's a busy day. Like I mentioned on the phone.

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can prop me up somewhere nightstand coffee table book case anywhere that the the the device won't be moving back and forth. So you can kind of plot be somewhere maybe a book or a plate or something just to hold it from sliding down

12
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.360
Galaxy J7 Crown: I'm just holding it.

13
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead and find someplace. If you could where it's going to stay stationary just resting somewhere. It doesn't have to be fancy. Fishman say just anything else. Stay, stay put.

14
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. Um, before we dive right in and I'll get to know you a little bit based on some of the things that you share with me this morning.

15
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But I haven't had a chance to even introduce myself. We talked a little bit on the phone, but I want to give you just at least a little intro of who your therapist is

16
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here in Florida, and I've been licensed for over 20 years in Florida, and it had a new mexico license. It'll be going on three years in June. It was specifically just to work with bright heart health.

17
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What else, most of my career has been working with folks who are struggling with substance use.

18
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Started working with families and couples and kids and it just seemed like everywhere that I was going, it seemed like either right in that family.

19
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Or right right next to it was some sort of compulsive addictive behavior and I became very intrigued and wanted to know more about it. I never left have worked in felony drug court 14 years private practice residential

20
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Aap so more corporate kind of stuff and I'm now kind of settling in here with telemedicine.

21
00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I use my phone. Just a couple of these are real quick stuff I use my phone and you saw it for scheduling appointments. Notice I sent something and I said hey,

22
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just confirm hey yeah I'll be there. And that's it. But I want to psychotherapy on the phone. In other words, you might be going through something and you have access to my phone.

23
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And the response back might feel cold, but it won't intend to but it'll probably sound like hey let's schedule something in person in here and zoom

24
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And for a lot of people. That's kind of confusing because normally very playful, there's lots of kind of fun. That happens inside of it. And there's real accessibility but therapy. Can't really happen effectively through texting. So I've watched that over the many years and done her work.

25
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

26
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to hear me talk a lot about a recovery journal, you may have the connection was poor, but I don't know if you've ever heard that inside the group setting.

27
00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you happen to have laying around or keep your eye out for it sometime in the next week or two, just some sort of binary something we can kind of keep notes, things that you observed about yourself.

28
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe there'll be a little something that year maybe from from another client that really resonates for you or you may want to journal. A later on about it under more reflective time

29
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of have that handy. Every time group rolls around. You want me to too much in here because what you and I are going to do is psychotherapy and you don't you need hands free

30
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For that sometimes I'll be doing activities where it'll be a lot, cognitive, behavioral, but I do some experiential exercises where you might actually be kind of moving

31
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is kind of cookie. If you haven't had any of that psychotherapy, it can be a little different.

32
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see.

33
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, if, if you are going to be late. Let me know if you're not going to attend, please let me know 24 hours in advance so that I can offer

34
00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The appointment to someone else. And so when you get a hold of that recovery journal, but I'll ask is, you have, as I've watched it's effective. This way, notice how you didn't have a number saved. So I go old school on this stuff. I go

35
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Have written handwritten a bright her health one 800 number have handwritten virtual clinic and my personal zoom room. This one doesn't change they do want everybody

36
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's taken a while for me to conform to it. They want everybody showing up to virtual clinic beforehand, before you come in and meet with me.

37
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: As well as group so that that's a little clunky, but it in these early morning hours. You don't have to be there too early, maybe even five or 10 minutes as the day progresses, you're going to notice some people are waiting a half hour to get to get an ID number, so

38
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes you can go in and do these little fam surveys, the day before six hours before and just knock it out and then, you know, don't wait around

39
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've been kind of learning as I'm going kind of what works and the clients. You guys are the ones that really tell me what's working in there and what's not. We are independent contractors, which means I don't really, you know, have a boss, you know, it's, we're kind of independent

40
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I earn my living when you show up in here.

41
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So that makes any sense. I'm not a salaried employee.

42
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's dive right in. I know it's clunky, but we've got a lot to cover and you're ready to start. Yeah. All right. Good. Okay, so, um, let's kind of start with what you and I talked about when we began

43
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Last night, when did you first have alcohol was your first use of that.

44
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.490
Galaxy J7 Crown: Probably when I was about 16

45
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And you'll notice that I'm going to be asking and it'll get a little annoying.

46
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The same questions about different substances same questions about different people. So it's going to sound like this age of first use and now I know it's 16. What was the progression.

47
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: At its worst us how much was it and when was your last use that kind of thing. So, so kind of bring me into what that progression was for you age 16

48
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Immediately, were you drinking. You know, every night or how did it progress.

49
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.350
Galaxy J7 Crown: Is that was just the first time I tried it was like, just with friends.

50
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.580
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay.

51
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did it progress from there.

52
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.700
Galaxy J7 Crown: Um, it didn't until my son passed away.

53
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And. And how old were you when that happened,

54
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.480
Galaxy J7 Crown: I was 26 I believe

55
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: unspeakable grief. I'm so, so sorry unimaginable.

56
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Age 26 and let me see. You are so that was 10 years ago.

57
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So your son passed away. And then what happened with the alcohol use, right there.

58
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.110
Galaxy J7 Crown: I usually did it just so I didn't think about things or

59
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.890
Galaxy J7 Crown: I don't know. I guess I was bored. I didn't have. I didn't know what to do with myself. So I told my time with that.

60
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how much were you drinking. So you're going to notice. I'll be asking things like, how much, how often for how long.

61
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.350
Galaxy J7 Crown: So when

62
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We are right then have a free drink and

63
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.230
Galaxy J7 Crown: I was drinking like I was drinking brandy, then

64
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.020
Galaxy J7 Crown: Um, and I would drink like like a half pint and I

65
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Any for how many months or years were you drinking a half a pint at night.

66
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.610
Galaxy J7 Crown: I stay for a couple

67
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple what

68
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.190
Year.

69
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Years. Okay, and did it progress from there.

70
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.520
Galaxy J7 Crown: Um,

71
00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:06.000
Galaxy J7 Crown: I don't think so. I think that I stayed about the same, because after that I was drinking like little shooters. You know, like, little tiny shooters. Okay. And I would only have like six of those, you would just

72
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.310
Galaxy J7 Crown: X. Yeah. About six but i mean i don't think that that's anymore.

73
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.600
Galaxy J7 Crown: Then what I was drinking before. Okay.

74
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.680
And

75
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you told me when your last drink was, but I didn't write it down. When was your last ingestion means any alcohol.

76
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.420
Galaxy J7 Crown: Well, I can't drink because I have to see a probation officer right now, so I don't want to go to jail.

77
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your motivation. When was your last

78
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.850
Galaxy J7 Crown: About six months ago.

79
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.750
Okay.

80
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Six months ago.

81
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is this difficult to talk about these these questions so far.

82
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.370
No.

83
00:09:48.900 --> 00:10:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it is it's kind of hard to kind of really look at these details. So six months ago, so I'll be getting into sort of that that legal piece a little later in this section. It's just going to be really focusing in on on mood altering substances right here.

84
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me go to. Have you ever had.

85
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: blackouts. If so, like 20 in your lifetime. Approximately how many

86
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.700
Galaxy J7 Crown: I have and I think 20 years row accurate.

87
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

88
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow okay about 20

89
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see, let me just touch base. There's a little cage screening. These are just some quick questions.

90
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anyone ever said to you, Hey girl, you know you you really need to cut down and you were kind of like annoyed by it. Anyone ever said that

91
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.580
Galaxy J7 Crown: Oh, yeah.

92
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I guess.

93
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To forgot to mention, you're going to hear me kind of talking funny.

94
00:10:52.470 --> 00:11:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a transcription. That happens. So you're gonna hear me say things like, Please transcribe verbatim. So that's what that is. I'm typing the best I can. But she'll do a much better job and and really organize things

95
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes to to that. And what about an eye opener where you know what boy I'm waking up and I need a drink in the morning that ever indicate

96
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Okay, denies eye opener.

97
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you ever cut back like during those you know it's over these let's say last 10 years where you tried to cut back but just couldn't pull it off.

98
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so when you want to, you were able to stop drinking

99
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.080
Galaxy J7 Crown: I don't have to. I just do it to feel better.

100
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever had DTS.

101
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.320
Galaxy J7 Crown: One like detox or what

102
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:57.810

103
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm, I'm going to after I go through the substances, then I'm going to ask you a little bit about treatment. History

104
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to say a lot of substances, all you gotta do is just say yes, no, if you don't know what they are. I'm not going to spend time educating around what they are. We'll just move on to the next section. So just say yes or no. Have you ever experimented with heroin.

105
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:23.730

257
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've noticed that for many people. It's not the same thing. They might burn or cut themselves or tattoo almost because they sort of enjoy the psychiatric really from the tattooing, but it's not the same thing as 10 intending to die.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.330
Galaxy J7 Crown: I thought about it.

265
00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that two years ago. Is that what you wanted your friend call okay so you wanted to die, then

273
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you start to take action toward it, where you can do

274
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You go ahead

275
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.790

342
00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:06.570
Galaxy J7 Crown: Everybody tells me that she was really different before that happened. I mean, obviously I don't know because I wasn't born, but I never seen her normal like she's always

343
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:14.130
Galaxy J7 Crown: And honestly, I don't have a relationship with her any way because I didn't meet her till I was five. My dad took me from her.

Galaxy J7 Crown: And she didn't treat me the same as she did them so

354
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.840

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:30.420
Galaxy J7 Crown: So anytime those days would be perfect Thursdays. I talked to my probation officer at 1030 in the morning, those calls only last like not even five minutes she just asked me a few questions. And then we hang up. I completely

581
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: forgot to ask you about that. I usually ask, is there an open case. So you are on is how many eyes in one year to year probation, how long

582
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.350

Gwenevere Abriel: What do I say, are you in a program where they're going to be watching

588
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Certain things right, you have to take classes, etc. So is there a set time frame like you'll be under this status for a year.

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.410
Galaxy J7 Crown: So I have court. This next Friday, hopefully I won't have to see you in a war after that.

590
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.150
Galaxy J7 Crown: You were the only thing that they wanted me to do like

592
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:26.100

596
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I can kind of have some predictability and you know I mean you could kind of say, oh, I know I'm going to meet with her at this time and it can feel predictable for you.

597
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a pleasure to meet you and look forward to talk with you again.
