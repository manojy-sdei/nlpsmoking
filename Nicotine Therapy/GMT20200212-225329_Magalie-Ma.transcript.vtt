Magalie Marcellus: Work.

2
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.130
Magalie Marcellus: Hi Kevin Hi.

3
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.230
Kelley Briscar: No, I'm okay, how are you

4
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.610
Good.

5
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:31.710
Kelley Briscar: For you on the internet here hasn't been working that great. So if we go if I get cut out. That's why hopefully it'll be okay. But I'm just, I had a hard time last week.

6
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.210
Or last

7
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.740
Kelley Briscar: Oh,

8
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.680
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so you're back to your place.

9
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.060
Kelley Briscar: No, we went back there and it was atrocious. It's

10
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:52.920
Kelley Briscar: Still yes wreaked of smoke and then we had rats. I don't know how that happened. So we ended up coming back to the hotel.

11
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.960
Magalie Marcellus: Which we're planning on. Wow.

12
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:05.520
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so we can find somewhere to our, you know, our men or something else to run. So it was crazy, though. I mean, we had huge rats. I mean, huge

13
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.740
Magalie Marcellus: And you never had that before.

14
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:17.850
Kelley Briscar: Well, and we had a few nice every now and then, but right. No, I mean one got up in our stove. We had to take a year to take the stove apparel.

15
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.080
Magalie Marcellus: Wow. Wow.

16
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.430
Kelley Briscar: So big it was. I mean, ridiculous so

17
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.850
Kelley Briscar: With everything. It just made more sense. There was just no way you felt comfortable staying there.

18
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.930
Kelley Briscar: With all that so

19
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.950
Magalie Marcellus: How long do you guys stay there.

20
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.990
Kelley Briscar: There's about two weeks.

21
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:49.140
Kelley Briscar: Give or take. So he had an exterminator come out but didn't seem to they must know how to get around the stuff I don't know because we

22
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.860
Kelley Briscar: saw no

23
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.700
Kelley Briscar: I mean, I couldn't even go in my kitchen without either seen one or the being

24
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.400
Magalie Marcellus: Read, you know, read. Wow. Wow.

25
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.290
Magalie Marcellus: That's my unsanitary.

26
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.090
Kelley Briscar: Sad and to, like I said, the place wreaked of smoke smells.

27
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.030
Kelley Briscar: It was me breathing that in couldn't have been healthy, you know,

28
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.690
Kelley Briscar: Right in

29
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:25.560
Kelley Briscar: The building. It's all you would smell, you know, was the smoke so with everything we kind of just weighed the pros and cons and

30
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.810
Kelley Briscar: I just couldn't handle it. It was too much. The rats were just like,

31
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.190
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so

32
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:47.430
Kelley Briscar: Figured it out. And I mean, it's going to be pretty tight, but we can manage for now here until we can find somebody you know some apartment or something to run so

33
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.140
Magalie Marcellus: So for now, how long do you anticipate paying where you are.

34
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.030
Kelley Briscar: I have no idea.

35
00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:03.420
Kelley Briscar: It's all going to depend on how quickly we can fire to find something and find someone you know obviously willing to run to us.

36
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.770
Kelley Briscar: So,

37
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.320
Kelley Briscar: You know, I would think at least couple months maybe last hopefully you know we've been here Sunday, it'll be

38
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.790
Kelley Briscar: Two weeks.

39
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.870
Magalie Marcellus: Since we

40
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.940
Kelley Briscar: But you know, it's like the paper is so scarce. And what I find that line.

41
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:31.080
Kelley Briscar: You know, I find a decent amount of stuff, but they're also where yes, it makes like two times, you know, the rent.

42
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.860
Payments

43
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.400
Kelley Briscar: There so credit check and, you know, all these things that you know i mean we I've had very good rent. We've had very good rental history, but I don't have the best credit, you know,

44
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:55.680
Kelley Briscar: You know, different things like that. So, and there are a lot of them, one like $50 application fees and and right now we're just trying to keep a flow, you know, keep this place.

45
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.220
Over

46
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.410
Kelley Briscar: There.

47
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:08.310
Kelley Briscar: That's the only thing with online that you find it's a lot of them are more through the real a realtor companies and stuff.

48
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.670
Magalie Marcellus: Is not private line like that.

49
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.750
Kelley Briscar: Right. No, I mean, my mom has been looking in the paper every day for us but

50
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.970
Kelley Briscar: East Side. I can find a lot, but on the west side which is where we

51
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.070
Kelley Briscar: You know, need to be really

52
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.750
Kelley Briscar: You know, to look at, or for rent. So

53
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.500
Kelley Briscar: Like I said, I'm hoping it doesn't turn into any you know more than maybe a couple months here, you know, but

54
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.410
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah. Capone so calm.

55
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.090
You know, I know.

56
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.740
Kelley Briscar: I know

57
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:53.880
Kelley Briscar: What it is that it's better than dealing with rats and SM every time you you know go into the bill apartment building is nothing but smoking.

58
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:04.800
Kelley Briscar: In Atlanta landlord that just you know he's only willing to do the bare minimum of what is, you know, expected of them anything more than that is just

59
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:19.410
Kelley Briscar: Given those too much things. I mean even the pain they were supposed to clean from the smoke and and you know with industrial like cleaner and all that stuff and you can literally tell when you look at the walls.

60
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.400
Kelley Briscar: The black

61
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.900
Kelley Briscar: Coming through the paint.

62
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.800
Magalie Marcellus: That included before they put they paint.

63
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.430
Kelley Briscar: Not all the way, obviously, because you decided you can see the black seeping through the white, you know,

64
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.320
Kelley Briscar: Still sitting

65
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:43.830
Kelley Briscar: On this down the stairs. You know, I mean, it just whoever did the work just did it half assed. And I guess he's okay with that, you know, but I'm not

66
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.550
Magalie Marcellus: There any on attendance back in that apartment building. Oh.

67
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.580
Kelley Briscar: No, no, we would only ones. Yeah.

68
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.990
Magalie Marcellus: That was trying to come back.

69
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.250
Kelley Briscar: Well, I guess the other ones ENDED UP GETTING EVICTED anyway.

70
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.720
Kelley Briscar: Another the other apartments still

71
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.670
Magalie Marcellus: You know I say self condemnation.

72
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.690
Kelley Briscar: Oh, yeah.

73
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.760
Kelley Briscar: So I don't even know how and it makes me wonder if an inspector even actually

74
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.510
Kelley Briscar: Went there.

75
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:18.210
Kelley Briscar: To give the okay for us to come back because really what the just the smoke smell that was in that place alone.

76
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.590
Magalie Marcellus: They sound. Notice that

77
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.580
Kelley Briscar: He would wonder how they would say, you know, it's all right.

78
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.300
Kelley Briscar: My, not to mention they had to have seen all the route you know just

79
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.090
Magalie Marcellus: Did you pay any money when you went back

80
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.280
Kelley Briscar: No. No. Okay.

81
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.090
Kelley Briscar: Because we had to, you know, he had told us a big thing was to use January's rent to stay here and

82
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:47.100
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. And then when we came back in February. Yet, or we left Ashley February 2 but

83
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.570
Kelley Briscar: He had worked my you know my dad ended up actually getting involved in some of it and they had worked out.

84
00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:03.000
Kelley Briscar: Prior to us coming back because of the all the time that we've been out of the apartment. They're not everything. They are not. Yeah, we did.

85
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:17.490
Kelley Briscar: He was pretty much a free month for us. Well, you ended up cashing another check that he had add basically to make you know for February's run. So it's not like he got free and clear. Actually, if anything, we're the ones out money.

86
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.700
Magalie Marcellus: My pain. She got money for February.

87
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.200
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, but

88
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.630
Kelley Briscar: You know, it was, it was worth me just to be out of theirs, it's, it's worth it. I mean,

89
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.700
Magalie Marcellus: It was a healthy

90
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:30.720
Kelley Briscar: No.

91
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.810
Kelley Briscar: No, and we neither one of us should have been, you know, in my head, but neither one of us seem to feel good when we

92
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.500
Kelley Briscar: Got back

93
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.270
Kelley Briscar: Issues, a lot of coughing, you know,

94
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:49.650
Kelley Briscar: Just so I like I said it could have been a coincidence. I don't know, but I know I felt a lot

95
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.210
Magalie Marcellus: Better if you could smell it.

96
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.250
Magalie Marcellus: Then, I mean, you know, something that

97
00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:03.090
Kelley Briscar: Clearly clean so I mean I worried about my animals excellent have been good for them to be breathing. There's so much tinier than we are, you know, know

98
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:15.720
Kelley Briscar: Just all in all, you know it's it's better that we're, we're here, you know, for now, anyway, we just hope it doesn't take too long, define something else. You know, so

99
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:26.850
Magalie Marcellus: It's really been and I know the last time you you still were concerned about being able to have enough funds to cover where you are. You guys okay now make you know having enough

100
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.500
Kelley Briscar: Yeah.

101
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.550
Kelley Briscar: Kinda. Oh.

102
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.990
Magalie Marcellus: To cover the expense.

103
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:40.200
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, I mean, like I said, it's going to be a super tight but we kind of figured out, you know, they're really nice here. They even dropped the rate at the room more for us.

104
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.280
Kelley Briscar: When I call Dylan.

105
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.770
Kelley Briscar: Coming, you know, coming back.

106
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.970
Kelley Briscar: So they dropped it a good 20 more dollars for us.

107
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.710
Kelley Briscar: And as of

108
00:13:51.150 --> 00:14:05.580
Kelley Briscar: two more weeks from Sunday, they dropped. They have a deal thing that goes on here. When you stay longer after 30 days they dropped the taxes on the room and that goes down almost another hundred, you know, or under dollars.

109
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.050
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, okay.

110
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.000
Kelley Briscar: A lot easier.

111
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.320
Magalie Marcellus: Salsa dance.

112
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.250
Yeah.

113
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:19.710
Kelley Briscar: So, I mean, it never fails since we've gotten back here, though he he works. Usually, Monday through Saturday but

114
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.310
Kelley Briscar: Since we got

115
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:27.210
Kelley Briscar: Here, it seems like nowadays. He hasn't been working so that's kind of made it a little bit or might make it a little bit.

116
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.160
Kelley Briscar: Tighter, tighter, but

117
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.310
Magalie Marcellus: He works. So he was working six days.

118
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.060
Yeah.

119
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:42.450
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, every to do like every other Saturday was mandatory but he was choosing sleep because of finances to work.

120
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:58.530
Kelley Briscar: Every Saturday. We're not like last Saturday. They didn't even end up working and it's kind of up in the air, whether this Saturday or not they'll be working. So we kind of factor that in. When we, you know, figure it out, how much we have to work with, you know,

121
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.570
Kelley Briscar: buddy's been working in it going in a half hour every day.

122
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.160
Kelley Briscar: Early so hopefully that'll make up for

123
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.590
Magalie Marcellus: A couple of hours.

124
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.660
Magalie Marcellus: You know, now I'm was he able to get that promotion.

125
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.070
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, now

126
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:26.910
Kelley Briscar: And yeah, now they want to put them onto with another machine to which will mean a you know a little bit more to so

127
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.540
Kelley Briscar: That they seem to be really happy with with him. There's

128
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.740
Magalie Marcellus: A story. Yeah.

129
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.050
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. So once that comes into effect, that'll make it even a little bit more easy

130
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.330
Magalie Marcellus: For us to manage. Yeah.

131
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:50.370
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. Yeah, but then it will. We came, we ended up paying to just two weeks I've had, you know,

132
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.940
Kelley Briscar: Some topics like this will be the, you know, second payment, we may since we came back so

133
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.630
That was

134
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.630
Kelley Briscar: Like actually see what it is you know what he has to bring home but

135
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.670
Kelley Briscar: My parents a few bucks to hold on to. So hopefully between the two.

136
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.730
Kelley Briscar: Will be our fingers crossed.

137
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:25.800
Magalie Marcellus: And I found that, you know, you guys can maintain but but like you said, it's still difficult to have any type of saving because you could have chosen whatever you have to cover your expenses.

138
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.270
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, yeah. That's the only person really didn't have any savings thing that the other place either doesn't

139
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:44.370
Kelley Briscar: Have done a figure that out between wer E, I, O, and then that was the other thing with all that was going on there with the riots in this mouse. Now he increased our right to $615

140
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.520
Kelley Briscar: Weary we would have stayed. Yeah, we would have had just started to pay $615 and it looks like

141
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.400
Magalie Marcellus: Does that make sense. Yeah, exactly.

142
00:16:54.090 --> 00:17:03.000
Kelley Briscar: So it just so between that and then, you know, we do have some previous you know like balances on our utilities, so they tend to run

143
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.670
Kelley Briscar: A little bit higher. So between

144
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:12.300
Kelley Briscar: Banner, and really it's not that much more to stay here because you don't have utilities here obviously

209
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.460

Kelley Briscar: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:32.760
Kelley Briscar: But not

213
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.400
Magalie Marcellus: not old enough to make his decision stuff like

214
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.450
Kelley Briscar: Right, right.

215
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.980
Kelley Briscar: Which now the exam is. Oh, and I'm sure will change will change now that he's like that.

216
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:55.680
Kelley Briscar: But I'm in fact we're trying to work something out where, you know, my mom wants you know to see him too. So we're trying to actually we weren't supposed to see him this week, but everybody over there. I ended up getting on the set was cold. So kind of got

217
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.530
Kelley Briscar: Anyway,

218
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.470
Magalie Marcellus: How do you feel about that because that was

219
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.670
Magalie Marcellus: Cool and the possibility of making having a meeting since you haven't

220
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:13.740
Kelley Briscar: I i I've been seeing them as far as actually you know like in person and quite some time. So I can't wait.

221
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.800
Kelley Briscar: Very excited about it.

222
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.450
Kelley Briscar: So, I mean, we talk all the time anyway. But it's not

223
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.680
Kelley Briscar: Really

224
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.870
Magalie Marcellus: A face to face contact right

225
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.200
Kelley Briscar: RIGHT, BUT I'M THE APARTMENT BUILDING AND HE'S LIVING IN has another apartment unit open

226
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:39.420
Kelley Briscar: Hold nice Jonathan, my son, then if he was working it was

227
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:53.970
Kelley Briscar: Actually saw it and everything. And so he's really wanting that apartment plus. Now these kinda in the situation that Tyler. That's my youngest was in where he's the one taking care of the kids and

228
00:23:55.170 --> 00:24:04.110
Kelley Briscar: When basically what Tyler was, you know, doing so between the two. I think that's incentive enough for him to, you know,

229
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.110
Kelley Briscar: Get a job, so he can get that out of there.

230
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.360
Magalie Marcellus: Or you can be able to. Yeah.

231
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.670
Magalie Marcellus: Right, so you're able to maintain

232
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.230
Kelley Briscar: Right, right. So it looks like he got a job at Home Depot. He's just waiting.

233
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.100
Magalie Marcellus: Holly dope off.

234
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.190
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, oh, I'll be awesome.

235
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:31.830
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, I guess he's if they do a drug test. And so now when he goes for that and then course I know when you start so fingers crossed, and

236
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.180
Magalie Marcellus: Then eventually they

237
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.710
Magalie Marcellus: may move together.

238
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.820
Kelley Briscar: Well, it would they be in the same apartment building but in different

239
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.500
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, yeah, and build he's gone. But by himself.

240
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.660
I'm with you. I am

241
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.240
Kelley Briscar: Now just, it would be him.

242
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.040
Magalie Marcellus: I think the one that deal with them that

243
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.550
Kelley Briscar: would only be

244
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.730
Kelley Briscar: Well, yeah, you'd be working full time.

245
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.390
Magalie Marcellus: So he'll be able to manage all the expenses on his own.

246
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.100
Kelley Briscar: Yeah.

247
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.330
Magalie Marcellus: I would talk to

248
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.030
Magalie Marcellus: Them.

249
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:14.760
Magalie Marcellus: So, you know, be responsible for themselves, then you know you don't have to worry about, you know, like a ham, you know,

250
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.720
Magalie Marcellus: self sufficient.

251
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:28.680
Kelley Briscar: But I guess with that and, you know, just I know his father. Okay. I mean, it doesn't matter what's most important is to get this life together. That's

252
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.090
Magalie Marcellus: Why you

253
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.140
Know,

254
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:40.680
Kelley Briscar: Right. But of course, because he had his father's his father will be, you know, it's because he went, you know, back to his, you know, I already know what all here, but whatever.

255
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.170
Magalie Marcellus: Anyway isn't a dog. He can

256
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.900
Magalie Marcellus: Decide what he wants. What is this fine.

257
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.560
Kelley Briscar: Well, yeah, but that's just how that side of the family is you

258
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.830
Know,

259
00:25:51.210 --> 00:26:02.400
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. But I asked him, I said, You know, I said, what, exactly, it's a difference of curious because you're not hearing anything from your father that you know you didn't hear from me 1,000,001 times, you know, and

260
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:11.430
Kelley Briscar: That apartments. He's like, Mom, you get all these like honestly I really want that market. You know, I really want to be on my own and

261
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.620
Kelley Briscar: You know, I think, to he's not as good intent and as fathers

262
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.150
Kelley Briscar: Still that's more initiative, you know, to get out, get a job, and

263
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:29.100
Kelley Briscar: I stepped out of it. Don't get me wrong, whatever George you're around, that's all. I mean, the most important thing is that happened to me.

264
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.920
Kelley Briscar: I just was curious, you know, it's just like I used to drill in and I said, left and right.

265
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.300
Kelley Briscar: You know, never seem to play.

266
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:37.920
Kelley Briscar: With them.

267
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.080
Magalie Marcellus: But something like

268
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.560
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, let's thank God for that.

269
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.810
Kelley Briscar: follows through and but I think with this apartment. We have oily want in this apartment. I think that'll

270
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.890
Kelley Briscar: Be enough, you know,

271
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.580
Magalie Marcellus: And like

272
00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:01.110
Kelley Briscar: Right now I know he's not 100% content at his dad's you know it's far away from everybody.

273
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.220
Kelley Briscar: You know,

274
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.300

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.940
Kelley Briscar: Of course, means a lot. He loves the kids.

277
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.100
Kelley Briscar: But it's a lot more work, you know,

278
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.590
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, cuz it's not just

279
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.450
Magalie Marcellus: Being home anymore just taking care of himself, but his responsibility. Yeah.

280
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.750
Magalie Marcellus: When I take so yeah

283
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.580
Magalie Marcellus: They have to make a decision with it. And I'm sure if he's a dad a you gotta be able to happen as well, so I'm

284
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.540
Magalie Marcellus: Pretty sure that's right Sunday, the reason why he wants to be on his own.

285
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.390
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah so

286
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.980

Magalie Marcellus: You know, was a big thing for

317
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.440
Magalie Marcellus: For you, you and your family, you know, all those changes. So how you

318
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.500
Magalie Marcellus: Would dial in overall with you know what you

319
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:40.440
Magalie Marcellus: were exposed to and in terms of like I know sometimes people can suffer some trauma, because it is a an experience a different experience. So

320
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.510
Magalie Marcellus: How are you handling that so

321
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:52.980
Kelley Briscar: That are now at first, second, it really was. I think affected me. I was always, you know, I'm just having trouble sleeping, I would have nightmares. You know, I

322
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.850
Magalie Marcellus: Mean I can you

323
00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:10.830
Kelley Briscar: Know, just anything beat that I would you know it would just like revert back to that, but with time. You know, I did not. That was positive to being an ability, you know, to back, there was a big adjustment at first to, like, no, no, no.

324
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.210
Kelley Briscar: It's not the best taking care of building so

325
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.350
Magalie Marcellus: That was some early

326
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.300
Kelley Briscar: To know, and because we still don't.

327
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:18.570
Right.

328
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.610
Kelley Briscar: You know,

329
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:31.110
Kelley Briscar: So it's just, but I guess times gone by, it's gotten better yet or not, it's not on my mind as much

330
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.460
Kelley Briscar: As it was, you know,

331
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.420
First

332
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.020
Magalie Marcellus: Any issue just sleeping.

333
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.160
Magalie Marcellus: I know you said

334
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.850
Magalie Marcellus: In the beginning it was, you know, with my

335
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:50.910
Kelley Briscar: Right now, I mean, not as much. Now, I may still have some nights. But, I mean, that's more just my bath and then

336
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:59.730
Kelley Briscar: I'll come. But otherwise no i i'm looking pretty good for me anyway. You know, so

337
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.240
Magalie Marcellus: And what are you doing to take care of yourself.

338
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.550
Kelley Briscar: Just the same old, you know, but I always do.

339
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:10.710
Kelley Briscar: This

340
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:10.860
Uh,

341
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.290
Kelley Briscar: Huh.

342
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.240
Magalie Marcellus: I see your parents.

343
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.120
Kelley Briscar: Oh nice area. Oh yeah, we

344
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.590
Kelley Briscar: I don't know if I thought you we went through a boss here with her. She got relax.

345
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.420
Kelley Briscar: Oh god. Yeah, I bet.

346
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.490
Kelley Briscar: They couldn't even really find a

347
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:36.630
Kelley Briscar: real cause for why she was doing it. But I mean, is it starts brings it so inch feeder for like the longest

348
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.160
Magalie Marcellus: Anyway, all

349
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:48.090
Kelley Briscar: The last pass navy, weaker, weaker to she's finally starting to get back to herself, where she seen not in the wrong again and

350
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.710
Kelley Briscar: What he felt better out she's you know shown interest again and

351
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.670
Kelley Briscar: But it was very there for a while. I mean, she dropped

352
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.040
Magalie Marcellus: Out.

353
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.010
Magalie Marcellus: So they said, Oh no, what caused that

354
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:13.800
Kelley Briscar: No, no, I think it was something with our mouth that you heard her mouth because just certain things she was doing when she went to when he kind of move her head to the side like it was hard for her.

355
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:24.480
Kelley Briscar: But I don't think it was something significant enough that it was taught you know able to be taught by the doctor, you know, I mean, they looked in her mouth and

356
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.040
Magalie Marcellus: I'm like, they're

357
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:33.900
Kelley Briscar: Like you're fighting was done, they didn't really see anything, but I think it was just maybe so minor was enough to bother but not enough, you know,

358
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:41.550
Kelley Briscar: So just like I said, I just was very faithful about I don't like syringe feeder every teeth. We all are.

359
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.770
Kelley Briscar: I just stuck to that. And over time, not download

360
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.030
Magalie Marcellus: You know, I still do.

361
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.820
Kelley Briscar: Now because I'm but I think that's more apparently on like a power than anything else. You know, I

362
00:32:53.880 --> 00:33:09.930
Kelley Briscar: Just want to make sure she's getting a stroke, just like it's actually got so skinny there for a minute. It was done she went from being this chubby little thing to, you know, I mean, you wouldn't believe Thomas getting we will, you know, she got it was scary for a while but

363
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.830
Kelley Briscar: Knock on wood, I am. You seem to be back.

364
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.490

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.680
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah

366
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.700
I mean,

367
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:28.500
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, my mom even actually paid for the initial appointment for me because we were trying. I knew she needed to go but is a

368
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.800
Kelley Briscar: Gem was for a couple days. So, I mean, I

369
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.600
Kelley Briscar: Was beside myself just hoping she'd, hold on. And my mom was like, totally just make the appointment.

370
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.670
Kelley Briscar: But yeah, I mean, I was really surprised you

371
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:41.970
Know,

372
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:43.620
Kelley Briscar: But

373
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.660
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, see I important

374
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.560
Magalie Marcellus: She is

375
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.240
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, I think that's what it was. You know, I mean, I see.

376
00:33:53.130 --> 00:34:00.450
Kelley Briscar: Some expense, but she also gets you know how much happiness. The little thing brings me to, you know,

377
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.890
Magalie Marcellus: Why they have to it again. Ready also

378
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.680
Magalie Marcellus: It's a distraction for you, you know,

379
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.400
Yeah.

380
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:15.000
Magalie Marcellus: Daily would saying, so I'm glad she's on better Felicia gets all

381
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.530
Magalie Marcellus: The world, but

382
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.240
Kelley Briscar: Yeah.

383
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.490
Kelley Briscar: I mean, she's, she's about it all the way there. She just

384
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.340
Kelley Briscar: The eating. I mean, she eats on our own, but it's just not as much at one time as cheap was

385
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.320
Kelley Briscar: Time kind of time. Yeah.

386
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:34.830
Yeah.

387
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:41.340
Kelley Briscar: Do you know do like the bench feeding, Lester. Now, after listening to Dr. Stone.

388
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:47.400
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so at least you tried twice a day on top of what cheese.

389
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.560
Magalie Marcellus: You know, and you didn't cases not get enough

390
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:55.650
Kelley Briscar: Right, just in case you know and you can tell she's putting weight that done, so that's good, you know,

391
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.610
Magalie Marcellus: What what is is shown some improvement. That's good.

392
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.080
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah

393
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.480
Kelley Briscar: Just what I do have some NEVER HAPPENED TO HURT.

394
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.520
Magalie Marcellus: Really I think by that is, again, I

395
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:16.590
Kelley Briscar: Thought I was going to, you know, I mean, it was not looking good. That means she got to a point where she'd want to drink, you know, I mean,

396
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:17.430
Kelley Briscar: I was

397
00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:32.520
Kelley Briscar: Yeah so. But yeah, like I said, they really couldn't find anything right so what you know what caused it, and then find out hundreds of hours of testing. I know I didn't

398
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.380
Magalie Marcellus: I still don't have a cause I

399
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:35.550
Magalie Marcellus: Can you imagine

400
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.520
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so it's, you know,

401
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:42.630
Magalie Marcellus: But like as prostrating but but it's better than

402
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.460
Magalie Marcellus: Not too far off and not

403
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.170
Magalie Marcellus: Knowing you know how to best help

404
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:54.930
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. Well, she started to take a turn for the better. Obviously, you know, needed extra that need

405
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.850
Magalie Marcellus: Emergency yeah

406
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.110
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:04.410
Kelley Briscar: And actress to me okay about sending their home. They put her on the high calorie food and

408
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.720
Kelley Briscar: He

409
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.360
Was so

410
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.540
Kelley Briscar: Faithfully that seems to have done the trick and whatever what's ailing or you seem to have gotten over from

411
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:15.780
And

412
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.920
Magalie Marcellus: What's this yeah has a good pattern to take a look at

413
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.690
Magalie Marcellus: Our own dog when you went back to the apartment. Did you take any furniture anything with true when you went back

414
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.370
Magalie Marcellus: To your apartment.

415

Kelley Briscar: Now, not yet. Oh, we got

416
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.600
Kelley Briscar: All that we got

417
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.310
Magalie Marcellus: To get yourself back

418
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.090
Yes.

419
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:53.430
Kelley Briscar: Well, right. You my mom's there's a room in the basement. They're gonna let us. I mean, there's some stuff. We just have to leave because

420
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.620
Magalie Marcellus: It does this align with it.

421
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.660
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, a

422
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.400
Kelley Briscar: Couple things that we are going to keep they're going to let us put down

423
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.870
Magalie Marcellus: staring at it now because I remember you mentioned you were going to try to get some

424
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.570
Magalie Marcellus: voucher for furniture. So if you did get those

425
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.790

428
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.530

429
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.640
Magalie Marcellus: Now I'm just wondering, because I know

430
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.760
Magalie Marcellus: Those things are important. So, so

431
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.070
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah what sounds like you know even though there's some setback, but they still some progress.
