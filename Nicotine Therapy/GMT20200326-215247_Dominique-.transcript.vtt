96
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.960

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.880

100
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.870
Yeah.

101
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.030
Patricia Naranjo: So,

102
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.830
Patricia Naranjo: That, that's what I'm trying to do, and hopefully get back into yoga because I used to do yoga.

103
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.670
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

104
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.680
Patricia Naranjo: I think that's what saved me.

105
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.700
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

106
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.520
Patricia Naranjo: Cuz I shattered my pelvis, you know,

107
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.360
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

108
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.590

110
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.920
Patricia Naranjo: Oh, yeah, yeah. And

111
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.780
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know if you know, but it's more internal. It's hard to explain, I guess.

112
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:47.130
Patricia Naranjo: But it helps the muscles internally and I honestly I believe that's what helps save me.

113
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.110
Dominique Pozo: It does. It helps our it actually helps our internal organs, really, it's a

114
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.870
Dominique Pozo: Yet, like an internal organ massage

115
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.700
Patricia Naranjo: And

116
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.720

Patricia Naranjo: November 2018 yeah it's almost three years now.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.740
Uh huh.

179
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.020
Patricia Naranjo: Yep.

180
00:11:53.130 --> 00:12:03.360
Patricia Naranjo: But I've been going through so much difficulty, like I had to wear that for almost a year and then when they reversed it I

181
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.090
Patricia Naranjo: I got an infection that immersed saw on my stomach so I

182
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.250
Patricia Naranjo: Had to stay in the hospital for a month. And they breed me so now

183
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.580
Patricia Naranjo: I, I don't really have a stomach.

184
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.440
Patricia Naranjo: Oh, see,

185
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.120
Dominique Pozo: huh, uh huh.

186
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.400
Patricia Naranjo: And then so for that. I mean, so I've been kind of having complications. The whole almost the whole two years.

187
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.350
Patricia Naranjo: You know what I'm saying.

188
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.740
Dominique Pozo: What I'm

189
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:43.830
Dominique Pozo: So how would you like to address that or tend to it. Is that something you want to work on your like through diet or

190
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.520
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah, I need to. I need to adjust my diet.

191
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay, really bad. What would that look like

192
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.340
Well,

193
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.970
Patricia Naranjo: I wouldn't like to eat so much meat.

194
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.230
Okay.

195
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.460
Dominique Pozo: So eat less meat.

196
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.770
Patricia Naranjo: Yes. Okay, that

197
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.450
Patricia Naranjo: Is true that meat does kind of were like weigh you down. You know what I mean.

198
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.160
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it can

199
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.800
Patricia Naranjo: So yeah, change my diet and

200
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.370
Patricia Naranjo: Take I want to get back into meditating.

201
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.710
Patricia Naranjo: I find myself like

202
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:37.350
Patricia Naranjo: I guess caught in the middle of the old behavior to

203
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:51.600
Patricia Naranjo: Where I want to be. Do you know what I'm saying ducking. You know, like I'm not too sure where am I going. I know I don't want to go back to where I was at

204
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.540
Dominique Pozo: When you say stuck.

205
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:06.510
Dominique Pozo: Well, what do you experience the stiffness, because I'm actually seeing, I just want to validate and mirror back to you that I see you've actually you've

206
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:14.340
Dominique Pozo: You took care of your knee you dealt with that. That was a big issue. You've been, you know, doing the exercise and the

207
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:24.000
Dominique Pozo: You know the enough movement to keep rehabilitating after the surgery so that feels like a really big step because it seemed to me that the pain was just overwhelming your whole

208
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:38.310
Dominique Pozo: Your whole being. And so now I see the are available for more connection with your granddaughter. And I'm wondering how the connection with your daughter's going. I know you named wanting to work on that. But I actually see some movement. Where are you feeling stuck patty.

209
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.340
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know, maybe

210
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.890
Patricia Naranjo: Maybe I'm trying to look to a head too far.

211
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:58.170
Patricia Naranjo: Maybe that's what it is. But yeah, main thing you're right about my daughter, I would like to get a stronger relationship with her because no I didn't raise her

212
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.400
Patricia Naranjo: Oh yeah. Her dad raised her

213
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.550
Patricia Naranjo: She was, yes, since she was three.

214
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:21.540
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah, he got he got emergency custody is South Dakota and then his, his dad was feared by a lot of attorneys. So basically last to know when battle.

215
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.150
Patricia Naranjo: Know if you heard of an Indian actor activist named Russell Means

216
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.430
Dominique Pozo: Um, no.

217
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:40.500
Patricia Naranjo: But I knew that. That's her grandpa. So I had our up. Yeah. Her dad power up here, but anyway.

218
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:49.800
Patricia Naranjo: So I guess that's where my point where I gave up a lot. I gave up on myself.

219
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.700
Dominique Pozo: Was when you lost connection with your daughter.

220
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.790
Patricia Naranjo: Mm hmm. Well, when she was about 10

221
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.150
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah, she was about 10

222
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.260
Patricia Naranjo: But I would call it a try to call her.

223
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.850
Patricia Naranjo: Seeds that her dad hit away for me because she was going to be

224
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.730
Patricia Naranjo: And this State said she can make her decision where she wanted to go

225
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.610
Patricia Naranjo: Oh isn't I lost them for a whole year.

226
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.870
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

227
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.950
Patricia Naranjo: I couldn't find them.

228
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.270
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know.

229
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.130
Dominique Pozo: So,

230
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.610
Patricia Naranjo: She's the anger issues with me.

231
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.750
Yeah.

232
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.060
Dominique Pozo: What's the communication like now at this point.

233
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.090
Patricia Naranjo: Um,

234
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.370
Patricia Naranjo: It's okay. I mean,

235
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.810
Patricia Naranjo: I guess I don't say as much as I should, you know,

236
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:51.810
Patricia Naranjo: Like

237
00:16:53.250 --> 00:17:04.800
Patricia Naranjo: Like I'm just trying to figure out what what her ways are not. I mean, we haven't really talked about it, she was. She works a lot

238
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.240
Patricia Naranjo: So she just gone a lot. So I mean my granddaughter.

239
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.150
Dominique Pozo: What would you like to say to her.

240
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.630
Patricia Naranjo: Is everything okay

241
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.280
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know.

242
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.430
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know, I guess I'm

243
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.110
Patricia Naranjo: Just asked her, What is that I could do, you know, how can I make

244
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:42.900
Patricia Naranjo: Other anger and insecurity beef, but I can't. You know what I mean, I think it's already

245
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.760
Patricia Naranjo: There from this time by that.

246
00:17:49.710 --> 00:18:09.330
Dominique Pozo: Well I, I wonder if just listening to her might be a beginning step and and just letting her get it out, even if it's some of its not accurate. If it's not the way that things went down for you on your end, if just letting her speak it might be a first step and then

247
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.740
Dominique Pozo: In time, just letting her know, You know if you'd like to hear my story. I'm here to share with you.

248
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.870
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

249
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.430
Dominique Pozo: How does that sound.

250
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.610
Patricia Naranjo: That sounds good. Yeah.

251
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:40.140
Dominique Pozo: I think it sounds to me that if she's got so much pent up anger. She just may need to be heard. Right now, not explained anything to try to convince her that things weren't were different than they were. But just be heard.

252
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.080
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

253
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.480
Patricia Naranjo: So anyways, that's what's going on here.

254
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.250
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

255
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.330
So,

256
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.820
Dominique Pozo: I can't hear you.

257
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.920
Patricia Naranjo: Know, now they're not gonna that people travel a lot. Oh.

258
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.020
Dominique Pozo: Can you hear me now I can, yeah.

259
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.730
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

260
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:13.950
Dominique Pozo: I can't hear you.

261
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.040
Patricia Naranjo: I don't know if you're talking. I can't hear you.

262
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:17.940
Oh,

263
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.310
Patricia Naranjo: Can you hear me now.

264
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.920
Patricia Naranjo: Now, I do. Yes, hello, hello. Okay.

265
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:29.310
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah. That was weird. It was fine for a minute. I just went away.

266
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.040
Patricia Naranjo: Oh, but I was, I was just saying, can you hear me.

267
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.360
Dominique Pozo: I can, yes.

268
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:43.050
Patricia Naranjo: Okay. No, I was just saying that I can do that. You know, I could just let her talk and

269
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.160
Patricia Naranjo: I just don't want to get more upset.

270
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:48.810
Patricia Naranjo: Oh,

271
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.920
Dominique Pozo: Am I yeah I, oh, go ahead, go ahead.

272
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.040
Patricia Naranjo: No. No, go ahead. I was finished.

273
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:05.250
Dominique Pozo: No, I want to forgive me. I just, I was excited. I wanted to share this TED talk with you about ways to have better conversations

274
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.020
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

275
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.300
Dominique Pozo: But I wanted to hear what you had to say.

276
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.500
Patricia Naranjo: Okay, no, that's, that's good. I would like to

277
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.290
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to hear. Do you want to hear this. This woman's really great

278
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.970
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

279
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.380
Dominique Pozo: We're gonna play this for you.

280
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.320
Dominique Pozo: Alright, so

281
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:32.940
Dominique Pozo: So give me a heads up if you can hear this. Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna play it now. Just, just say, Yes, I can hear it if you can. Because I actually can't see you.

282
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:49.380
Dominique Pozo: Okay. All right. I want to see a show of hands, how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion childcare food.

283
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.490
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them.

284
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:11.070
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins and My Fair Lady stick to the weather and your health, but these days with climate change and anti vaccine those subjects.

285
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.930
Patricia Naranjo: Are not safe either. So this world that we live in.

286
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:23.550
Patricia Naranjo: This world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument where our politicians can't speak to one another.

287
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:30.780
Patricia Naranjo: And where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.

288
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:39.960
Patricia Naranjo: Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized. We are more divided than we ever have been

289
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:51.900
Patricia Naranjo: In history, we're less likely a compromise which means we're not listening to each other and we make decisions about where to live who to marry and even who our friends are going to be based on what we already believe.

290
00:21:52.440 --> 00:22:01.140
Patricia Naranjo: Again, that means we're not listening to each other a conversation requires a balance between talking and listening. And somewhere along the way we lost that balance.

291
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.500
Patricia Naranjo: Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.

292
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:21.510
Patricia Naranjo: According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than 100 texts a day, and many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face.

293
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:35.040
There's this great piece in The Atlantic was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell and he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes and he said this, I came to realize

294
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:46.170
I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we failed to teach

295
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:55.110
kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communication skills.

296
00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:05.790
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves, Is there any 21st century skill more important than being able to sustain sustain coherent confident conversation.

297
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:14.010
Now I make my living talking to people, Nobel Prize winners truck drivers billionaires kindergarten teachers heads of state.

298
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:30.630
plumbers, I talked to people that I like I talked to people that I don't like I talked to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level, but I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.

299
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:44.040
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this things like look, the person in the eye. Think of interesting thing topics to discuss in advance. Look nod and smile. The show that you're paying attention.

300
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.730
repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that it is crap.

301
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.700
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention. If you are in fact

302
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.920
Paying attention.

303
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:12.210
Now I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life.

304
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.140
Patricia Naranjo: So I'm going to teach you how to interview people. And that's actually going to help you learn how to be

305
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:27.360
Patricia Naranjo: Better conversationalist learned to have a conversation without wasting your time without getting bored and please God without offending anybody

306
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:35.580
Patricia Naranjo: We've all had really great conversations we've had them before we know what it's like the kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired

307
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.960
Patricia Naranjo: Or you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood

308
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:50.400
Patricia Naranjo: There was no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them.

309
00:24:50.760 --> 00:25:03.690
Patricia Naranjo: And master it, you're already enjoy better conversations. Number one, don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever's in your hand. I mean, be present.

310
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:12.030
Patricia Naranjo: Be in that moment, don't be thinking about your argument you have with your boss. Don't be thinking about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out.

311
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.880
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Yeah. What's that party is it getting broken

312
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.830
Patricia Naranjo: Up. Yeah.

313
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.240
Oh, no.

314
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.030
Patricia Naranjo: I know. Oh.

315
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:21.900
Gosh.

316
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.160
Dominique Pozo: Can you move closer to your router.

317
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.080
Patricia Naranjo: While it's in the living room in there and they're watching a movie.

318
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.040
Oh,

319
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.780
Dominique Pozo: Do you want me to keep going with this, or just stop.

320
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.630
Dominique Pozo: Are you still there.

321
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.400
Patricia Naranjo: Domini

322
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.360
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Would you like me to keep playing the video or do you want me to stop it.

323
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.280
Patricia Naranjo: I'm

324
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.860
Patricia Naranjo: Kind of interested

325
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.070
Dominique Pozo: It is

326
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.760
Patricia Naranjo: I know it's

327
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:08.730
Dominique Pozo: And it is interesting. And I'm my, my hope is that it serves you, with your daughter, but if you can't hear it.

328
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.030
Patricia Naranjo: Oh, I see. So breaking up.

329
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:24.720
Dominique Pozo: Why don't you try popping off. Yep. Why don't you try popping off and on again because

330
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.750
Dominique Pozo: That seemed to help last time.

331
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.160
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

332
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.920
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

333
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:08.580
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So take your video off and then that'll help give you more streaming then then let's see how this sounds Okay, let me know if it

334
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.890
Dominique Pozo: If it's OK.

335
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.140
LGL158VL: OK. OK.

336
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:22.530
Dominique Pozo: And I'll rewind it just a little bit so that you can get basically the 10 the 10 reasons why most of your interactions can't be like that.

337
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.340
LGL158VL: So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them.

338
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:42.570
Dominique Pozo: And master it, you're already enjoy better conversations. Number one, don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present.

339
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:55.650
Dominique Pozo: Be in that moment, don't be thinking about your argument, you have to your boss. Don't be thinking about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation. Get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.

340
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:07.800
Dominique Pozo: Number two, don't pontificate if you wanted to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or push back or growth, write a blog.

341
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.500
LGL158VL: Know there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show, because they're really boring.

342
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:23.670
LGL158VL: If they are conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're a liberal or they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.

343
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:32.670
LGL158VL: totally predictable and you don't want to be like that you need to enter every conversation, assuming that you have something to learn

344
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:43.350
LGL158VL: The famous therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself and sometimes that means, setting aside your personal opinion.

345
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:54.690
LGL158VL: He said that sensing this acceptance. The speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener.

346
00:28:55.290 --> 00:29:07.500
LGL158VL: Again, assume that you have something to learn. Bill Nye everyone you will ever meet know something that you don't. I put it this way. Everybody is an expert in something

347
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:16.530
LGL158VL: Number three, use open ended questions in this case, take a cue from journalists, start your questions with who, what, where, when, why, or how

348
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:22.950
LGL158VL: If you put in a complicated question. You're going to get a simple answer out if I asked you where you terrified.

349
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:31.170
LGL158VL: You're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence which is terrified. And the answer is yes. I was there. No, I wasn't. Were you angry. Yes, I was very angry.

350
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:43.140
LGL158VL: Let them describe it, the ones that know try asking them things like what was that like, how did that feel, because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it.

351
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:54.990
LGL158VL: And you're going to get a much more interesting response. Number four, go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.

352
00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:05.370
LGL158VL: We've heard interviews, often in which a guest is talking for several minutes, and then the host comes back in and asked a question, which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.

353
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:11.700
LGL158VL: That means the host probably stopped listening, two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question.

354
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:22.770
LGL158VL: And he was just bound and determined to say that, and we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

355
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:35.490
And we stopped listening stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five. If you don't know say that you don't know

356
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:47.160
Now people on the radio, especially on NPR are much more aware that they're going on the record. And so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure.

357
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:56.130
Do that err on the side of caution talk should not be cheap number six don't equate your experience with theirs.

358
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.640
If they're talking about having lost a family member.

359
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:09.240
Don't start talking about the time that you lost a family member, if you're talking about the trouble that they're having it work, don't tell them about how much you hate job. It's not the same. It is never the same.

360
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:26.670
All experiences are individual and, more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was and he says, I have no idea. People who brag about their IQ are losers.

361
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.280
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.

362
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.340
Number seven.

363
00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:50.190
Try not to repeat yourself it's condescending and it's really boring and we tend to do it a lot, especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids. We have a point to make. So we just keep rephrasing it over and over

364
00:31:51.600 --> 00:32:07.230
LGL158VL: Don't do that. Number eight. Stay out of the weeds, frankly, people don't care about the years the names the dates all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care what they care about is you

365
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:20.010
LGL158VL: The care about what you're like what you have in common. So forget the details, leave them out. Number nine. This is not the last one, but it is the most important one, listen.

366
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:29.070
LGL158VL: I cannot tell you how many really important. People have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop

367
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:37.980
LGL158VL: Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing. If your mouth is open, you're not learning and Calvin Coolidge said, No man ever listened his way out of a job.

368
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:49.170
LGL158VL: Why do we not listen to each other. Number one, we'd rather talk when I'm talking. I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything. I'm not interested in

369
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:55.440
LGL158VL: I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason we get distracted.

370
00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:03.270
LGL158VL: The average person talks at about 225 words per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.

371
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:19.950
LGL158VL: So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone. But if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.

372
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:33.270
You have to, you have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, most of us don't listen with the intent to understand we listen with the intent to reply.

373
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.640
LGL158VL: One more rule and number 10 and it's this one be brief.

374
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:55.530
Dominique Pozo: All of this boils down to the same basic concept and it is this one be interested in other people

375
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:02.730
Dominique Pozo: You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents.

376
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:14.370
Dominique Pozo: And after they would leave my mother would come over to her house and she'd say, Do you know who that was, she was the runner up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won the Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer.

377
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:24.420
Dominique Pozo: And I started, I kind of grew up, assuming everyone has some hidden amazing thing about them and I honestly I think it's what makes me a better host

378
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:44.760
Dominique Pozo: I keep my mouth shut, as often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open and I'm always prepared to be amazed and I'm never disappointed you do the same thing, go out, talk to people listen to people, and most importantly, be prepared to be amazed. Thanks.

379
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.190
Dominique Pozo: How was that

380
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.150
Dominique Pozo: For you Patty.

381
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.250
LGL158VL: Yeah, that was, that was cool.

382
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.640
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Was there anything in particular that stood out for you that might be helpful.

383
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.470
LGL158VL: Stop.

384
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:06.840
LGL158VL: People

385
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.130
LGL158VL: 20 more minutes, you know,

386
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.190
LGL158VL: Whatever. Yeah.

387
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.810
Dominique Pozo: Hmm. So being present.

388
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.490
LGL158VL: Yeah.

389
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:26.760
Dominique Pozo: Well,

390
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:36.030
Dominique Pozo: We still have a little bit of time. Is there more that you want to talk about or we could go into a mindfulness practice. What would, what would be best for you.

391
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.020
LGL158VL: Next time,

392
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.540
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

393
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.950
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

394
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.580
Dominique Pozo: Oh, great. Okay, so go ahead and

395
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.150
Dominique Pozo: If you want to just close your eyes and

396
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.140
Dominique Pozo: Just bring your attention to your breath, having this

397
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.330
Dominique Pozo: You know, these next few minutes are devoted to some self connection.

398
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.430
Dominique Pozo: Really feeling that inhalation move through the body.

399
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.600
Dominique Pozo: Noticing the exhalation.

400
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:55.590
Dominique Pozo: And then just starting from the top of your head. We're just going to do a scan down your body so scanning from the top of your head down the forehead just noticing in between your eyes, your eyebrows.

401
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.020
Dominique Pozo: Your cheeks.

402
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.420
Dominique Pozo: Your job, your tongue.

403
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:23.760
Dominique Pozo: Your mouth just feeling into the muscles in the face right now and noticing whatever you do.

404
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.310
Okay.

405
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.390
Dominique Pozo: And then moving down from the face to the throat and the back of the neck.

406
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.820
Dominique Pozo: Down the shoulders.

407
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.360
Dominique Pozo: Down both arms crossing your elbows.

408
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.960
Dominique Pozo: Crossing the wrists into the hands

409
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.090
Dominique Pozo: Moving your attention back up to the chest and the upper back.

410
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.820
Dominique Pozo: And then your belly that space above your belly button. An MIT back

411
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.150
Dominique Pozo: And then the space below your belly button and your low back.

412
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.260
Dominique Pozo: Your hips and your upper legs.

413
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:09.540
Dominique Pozo: And then your needs your healthy, strong recovering knees feeling into the knee joints just noticing any sensations in there.

414
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.370
Dominique Pozo: And then down the lower legs crossing the ankles.

415
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.640
Dominique Pozo: Again, noticing any sensations.

416
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.510
Dominique Pozo: You cross into the feet.

417
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.430
Dominique Pozo: And then feeling that connection with your feet to the ground.

418
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:01.140
Dominique Pozo: And noticing the ground beneath you, that's holding and supporting you.

419
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:16.320
Dominique Pozo: And then move your attention from the actual floor of the House to the earth body, the ground of the earth bone beneath the house.

420
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:24.450
Dominique Pozo: And just connect to that big foundation. This earth ground that's holding us all.

421
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.690
Dominique Pozo: I really feel that, and as you exhale, the next exhalation. See if you can relax into

422
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.640
Dominique Pozo: The ground.

423
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.460
Dominique Pozo: Allowing your muscles to

424
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.800
Dominique Pozo: Release and let go.

425
00:40:54.120 --> 00:41:05.970
Dominique Pozo: And then just bring your attention back back up a little bit back towards your mind and just check in. How about just a phrase of, you know, checking out. How are you doing right now.

426
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.070
Before we say

427
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.460
Dominique Pozo: Huh.

428
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.750
Yeah.

429
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.910
LGL158VL: Thanks. Good.

430
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:24.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, well, you can keep keep doing that throughout the day. If you feel like you know you're hearing about how the

431
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:36.780
Dominique Pozo: Cases of the coronavirus are increasing. Just take a deep, deep breath and a moment and recognize that, at least as far as we know, you don't have it, your family members don't have it, your home together.

432
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.660
LGL158VL: Yeah, okay.

433
00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.830
Dominique Pozo: Okay. All right. Patty.

434
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.810
Dominique Pozo: All right. Okay.

435
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.570
Dominique Pozo: See you soon. I'll see you in group next Wednesday. Yeah.

436
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:50.940
LGL158VL: Okay.

437
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:51.930
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

438
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.130
