00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that been like for you.

18
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.700
Joshua Lopez: Whoo, has not been for

19
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.730
Joshua Lopez: Not being good at all.

20
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like having those kiddos around. Don't just

21
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.260
Always

22
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So have you

23
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been feeling lonely, is that been the predominant emotion. This last week.

24
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.510
Joshua Lopez: It has, it has

25
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.630
Joshua Lopez: Well, I know I was doing pretty good. I'm

26
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.890
Joshua Lopez: Doing pretty good. Today, it kind of just, you know, just sunk in that

27
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.850
Joshua Lopez: I still got a long ways to go before I see him on Sunday.

28
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.830
Joshua Lopez: The house is just empty quiet.

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.430
Joshua Lopez: Just DISTRACTING MYSELF watching TV. Probably going to clean up do stuff like that.

30
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:50.130
Joshua Lopez: But most of the week has been okay I just went to work I avoided being sad. I'm just, you know, I've been practicing not to think on

31
00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:02.850
Joshua Lopez: Or dwell on other stuff. Just try to focus on the possibilities, you know, just the possibilities of what could be coming you know future why

32
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.180
Joshua Lopez: Just stuff like that. I do got a void getting on these stupid.

33
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.780
Joshua Lopez: shopping sites because I

34
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.100
Joshua Lopez: Just, I can't, I can't look at stuff and not want it. So I'm like, Oh, I got to avoid getting on these sites already

35
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

36
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.630
Joshua Lopez: I did buy a dining table, though. On the bright side, so

37
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta have a dining table. I don't think that that's an observant and expense.

38
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.260
Joshua Lopez: No, no.

39
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You needed a dining table. Okay.

40
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are noticing.

41
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're noticing it is right that retail therapy can be just as dangerous as going to a casino.

42
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:59.340
Joshua Lopez: Absolutely. Like last night, um, because they did. I got my account from Amazon and you know it was okay. It worked out. And then I've discovered this other site called way fair and they actually have some really nice stuff.

43
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.030
Joshua Lopez: So I purchased the dining room table, then another one popped up on my Facebook called Top patter, I didn't know how top header work. I didn't really know what it was.

44
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that

45
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:20.010
Joshua Lopez: Um, they I guess they just auction stuff on there I it was my first time being on it last night. The only reason why I clicked on it.

46
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:30.750
Joshua Lopez: They had some NFL New Era hats and I was like, oh, I need a new hat. So I went on it and there was only like three teams. And I was like, wow, that's not my team so

47
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:42.870
Joshua Lopez: I clicked out of it and then it popped up all their other stuff. And I was like, ooh, that's pretty nice, or that's nice and spent $50 last night and I shouldn't have even like regretted it immediately.

48
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:58.800
Joshua Lopez: I started bidding. It started off like twin no sorry off like at $8 and then I did somebody outbid me then it just got, like, Well, I'm going to outbid you type thing. And then once I outbid the person I was like waiting for them to counter me

49
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:17.040
Joshua Lopez: And they didn't and ended up purchasing it and I was like, Wait, did I really want that, you know, I just think it was just, I was bored. It was something to do. And I don't know why. It just felt good to outbid this person, you know,

50
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.900
Joshua Lopez: I don't know, I'm not going back on that site anytime soon, for sure.

51
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well you just learned a pretty cheap 50 bucks is not a really painful way to learn that

52
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You are kind of basing it more on you know we do we get this little, little reward center around competition and you got a little bit of that.

53
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And lesson learned. So hopefully, it ends there. We'll see. Yeah.

54
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:55.710
Joshua Lopez: It definitely it definitely will. I mean, the shopping online, I still think I will. You know, I still need to purchase certain things like a tv stand

55
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.980
Joshua Lopez: Which I plan to do next week.

56
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.820
Joshua Lopez: You know, with everything being closed it sucks because

57
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:22.740
Joshua Lopez: You purchase these things and you don't feel rewarded because you got to wait two weeks for it to come in but stuff, stuff I need also found a really, really nice bunk bed set for my kiddos. They have a bed. It's, um, I don't know what you call it, it's kind of like

58
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.400
Joshua Lopez: Oh my gosh, I can't explain it, but

59
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.410
Joshua Lopez: Let me see real quick. It has where you pull out a second bed from underneath it.

60
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.250
Joshua Lopez: I know

61
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:41.040
Joshua Lopez: Trundle. There you go. There it is. Okay. I was gonna like give you a quick view of it because I couldn't think of the name. But yes, it's a Trundle it's okay for now but

62
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.990
Joshua Lopez: You know, they're excited about the idea of a bunk bed first I'll get my tv stand because they don't meet the bed right away but

63
00:06:49.470 --> 00:07:01.260
Joshua Lopez: Down one for like $300 it's would nice it matches our decor. So I don't know how long it will take to get that one but I definitely will probably get that as well.

64
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.930
Joshua Lopez: And then there was some really neat like decorations that I want to get eventually

65
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.780
Joshua Lopez: You know, just, just to make the House feel like home more homey. The walls are kind of blank right now.

66
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.240
Joshua Lopez: I did go to Big Lots originally to find a way

67
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:27.510
Joshua Lopez: To look at their furniture and I didn't realize big locked had some decent furniture there. But unfortunately, since they're one of the only

68
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:38.220
Joshua Lopez: Doors that's considered a central to the cell like cleaning products and food and stuff there. Well, everybody's going there looking at their furniture. So everything they had on display was out of stock.

69
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.060
Oh,

70
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:48.930
Joshua Lopez: That's one of the reasons I got online in order to dining table because they had to there that I really liked and I was like, well, can I reserve one can I, you know, purchase one

71
00:07:49.320 --> 00:08:04.230
Joshua Lopez: They're like you could put one on layaway and they'll put you off the top of their list, but we won't have an idea of when it'll be here. So rather than doing that. I just said, screw it. I'll get one online, but I did find some really neat picture frames there.

72
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.300
Joshua Lopez: And I was really proud of these. I thought they were pretty awesome.

73
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, those are adorable.

74
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.360
Joshua Lopez: It's the only thing I the only thing I have hung up for

75
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:27.870
Joshua Lopez: You know, just little things like that, just, you know, just like I said when I get down I try and focus on the possibilities.

76
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:40.050
Joshua Lopez: Whether they be good, bad or great, I'm just not trying to dwell on what I can't control right now, you know, just trying to look forward to, hey you know I'm

77
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:52.410
Joshua Lopez: Your apartments coming together. It's looking good. You have a good job. You're making good money the possibilities, you know, are there the opportunities are there. Um, so yeah.

78
00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:07.170
Joshua Lopez: It's helped it definitely has I've felt a lot stronger this past week than I have in a while. Today was just minor setback. I did feel lonely. You know that lonely feeling of an empty house.

79
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:09.900
Yeah.

80
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

81
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things.

82
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if this is something useful or not. But what some people do is for every hundred dollars they wait that many days.

83
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say it's a $300 purchase, they won't hit

84
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: By until they've waited three days.

85
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And interesting things happen over those three days. And so if you start to notice you don't have the money for the things that you

86
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: had originally wanted and you're spending too much money over here. You may try that out so that $50 would have been

87
00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like five hours. Before you hit send to you would have not been able to quite fully. Oh, look at that. I'm being impulsive. Do I need a hat. Well,

88
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you have something running in the background that you kind of already have sort of this platform that you typically approach big purchases

89
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be useful, because then you will mitigate sort of impulse, so use it never use it teach it only don't use it. That's up to you. But for some people. That's handy. And then you know what I mean.

90
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:42.150
Joshua Lopez: That actually is, you know, cuz it was impulsive, I can kind of be an impulsive person. And then when I'm feeling down on it's you know it's definitely like like

91
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:58.440
Joshua Lopez: Like a quick quick little, like, Oh, I feel better. You know, it doesn't last. But it was impulsive. It was very impulsive. Last night I just felt really just little down you know because originally, I would get my kids on

92
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:08.610
Joshua Lopez: A day like yesterday after work. I have the next two days off, I would pick them up and it just, it just it's a it's coming home to an empty house for sure.

93
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there ever times when

94
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The house was full, full of people and you wish you could have had a little a long time. Was there ever any history where you've had them.

95
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.340
Joshua Lopez: I'm not that I can recall. I'm sure maybe

96
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:36.030
Joshua Lopez: I was highly stressed or something. Maybe I wanted to get away, but I never had that means to get away. You know what I mean. So

97
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:49.320
Joshua Lopez: And I just mean, personally, a lot of people are like, oh, I need a break from my kids or my kids are driving me crazy. I welcome it. You know, I just feel like I was born to be a dad.

98
00:11:50.340 --> 00:12:05.400
Joshua Lopez: Just, I love, I love being a daddy. You know, I love, I love when they come to me and you know the the week that I had on Friday night, my daughter, she's on antibiotics and she had a really bad reaction to it like really bad.

99
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:11.940
Joshua Lopez: So I called the emergency room. I was on hold for two hours they forgot about me.

100
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:22.980
Joshua Lopez: I had a call from my daughter's phone. They're like, Oh, we're so sorry. You know, you shouldn't have been on hold that long. Go ahead and hang up on that call will connect you straight to the nurse assistance line.

101
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.190
Joshua Lopez: Instead they connected me and it took me straight to a survey asking how my nurses

102
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:37.080
Joshua Lopez: experience was. And I was like, we haven't talked to in there. So I did their little stupid survey and then the call ended.

103
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:45.300
Joshua Lopez: Back again. Finally, they're like it or seen within 24 hours. You did the right thing by giving her Benadryl

104
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:52.710
Joshua Lopez: We don't think it's antibiotics because she's been on them for like eight days where I go to the doctors. They

105
00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:07.350
Joshua Lopez: Tell me. No, it's perfectly normal people can have a reaction, even when they finished their antibiotics to three days later. So I got that taken care of. And that's just, you know, I was I was glad I was there, you know, I was glad that I got to

106
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.960
Joshua Lopez: Take care of it for her, you know,

107
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.740
Joshua Lopez: Rather than getting a phone call from their mom saying, oh, I have to take her to the doctor and

108
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:31.020
Joshua Lopez: Kind of just feeling like I wasn't there. You know what I mean. I just, I welcome those things. There's challenging there whatever they are, but it just keeps in my, in my mind occupied and I just you know i i want to be there all the time.

109
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed when you were in group that you liked

110
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The cognitive behavioral video and

111
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think let's continue that. Then there's a lot of information out there that what you and I mostly do is

112
00:13:53.610 --> 00:14:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This big pieces of it that are cognitive, behavioral, but let's turn our attention to this this worksheet. I've have and it's 15 ways to untwist you're thinking

113
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, if you like, just that simple thing that that guy had done, you may want to do a print screen of this thing and not print screen, but a screenshot.

114
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.120
Joshua Lopez: Not the greatest doing stuff like that. But let me see if I can

115
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: For me it's the power button. And I think the bottom

116
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what to call down the bottom right hand button. There's two buttons on the right. So I do those together and it screenshots it I learned that my accident so I

117
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Was like, oh, that's how you do it.

118
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.940
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I'm not the most tech savvy person I am.

119
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, like, Tell me what kind of phone. Maybe I could look it up quickly on how to do it.

120
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.950
Joshua Lopez: What kind of file, it is a Samsung

121
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.040
Joshua Lopez: Want to say Galaxy S g seven

122
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.820
Joshua Lopez: I believe that's what it is.

123
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:11.460
Joshua Lopez: I mean, shoot, man. A year ago I barely use my phone just for text messaging and for phone calls. I didn't have Facebook or Instagram or anything.

124
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell your kids that

125
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:24.480
Joshua Lopez: I'm pretty I'm pretty historic when it comes to technology and learning now that I'm too old, you know, to use these type of things.

126
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen. I just see what I got here.

127
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so Samsung Galaxy j s how to take a screenshot.

128
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop share here, and instead share this on. Yeah.

129
00:15:44.220 --> 00:16:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well guys, in this short tutorial. I just wanted to show you how to think of bringing screen or screenshot with Samsung Galaxy seven. It is very easy to do that. Just press together the phone. Can you send our key here we go like that.

130
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wow, okay. So you got your home button. That's the button that you wake the thing up and then you got your power button on the right. So you do those two things together and then. So what we want a screenshot is this guy me just make it looks. That's the wrong guy.

131
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do many guys let me see.

132
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this one here.

133
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.230
Joshua Lopez: A little different, but I'm going to try it anyway.

134
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.860
Yeah.

135
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's get this guy up here, and that's the one we want.

136
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Should make up like a picture sound like a shutter have a camera going you know like a picture sound.

137
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.800
Yeah.

138
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.360
Joshua Lopez: It did something it, I think.

139
00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:58.680
Joshua Lopez: If

140
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You chopped it up.

141
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well my you saw how easy that was to get so you can look kind of for that information.

142
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not from some of you Ukrainian dude but

143
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:32.640
Joshua Lopez: OK. OK. So I tried doing it and I held it for a while and it popped up taking screenshots, press and hold the power key and volume down key.

144
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.080
Joshua Lopez: Together to take the Koreans take a screenshot. So let me try that real quick.

145
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.150
Joshua Lopez: Oh, there we go. Sweet. What do you

146
00:17:43.770 --> 00:18:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, look at that get non techie. You know what's really cool is there's going to be times when you want to take a picture of something instead of describing it to someone or there'll be a website, you just want to forward that thing on that image on even to a kid.

147
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You could just screenshot it and then you message it in a text. It's so convenient.

148
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.240
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, that's honestly. Pretty cool. I'm glad I learned that that is pretty cool.

149
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's very funny that this this neat being the one that taught you that I think that's very, very funny.

150
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's take a look at what you took a screenshot of

151
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And this could be something that you do, maybe even today when you get yourself. Sort of. Sort of spiraling down into a sad, like you continue the thinking of the sad initial thought

152
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm alone. I don't like this empty house. Look at this empty house. This room is empty to always be like this when you start feeding that sponsoring thought it will continue.

153
00:18:52.230 --> 00:19:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you interrupt the thought by and this is purely just cognitive behavioral intervention here was obviously lots of different you've been doing them use distraction you stay busy.

154
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is yet another way to intervene in the negative thinking

155
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just go through each one. First one. It's called identify the distortions. So you write down your negative thoughts. So just try and catch the one last night was the one that started last night and its continued on into today. What was the negative thought you had

156
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:38.160
Joshua Lopez: Just coming home to an empty house was being being alone not hearing, hearing the kiddos voices are

157
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So Joshua, just so you know, those are events.

158
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the actual thought we almost there. You noticed an empty house there was the absence of sound and you noticed there were missing people

159
00:19:52.200 --> 00:20:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It is your belief that happens about that empty house about that empty room about how quiet is. That's what we're looking for what meaning do you make out of that empty house.

160
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.540
Um,

161
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.310
Joshua Lopez: That it felt like this isn't how it should be. I felt like

162
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:19.470
I

163
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.020
Joshua Lopez: Felt like it shouldn't be this way. You know, it should be with my kids.

164
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.600
Joshua Lopez: just felt like

165
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.620
So,

166
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there. Stay there, stay there and go anywhere. Stay right there.

167
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

168
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Open the door, no one's there and it is quiet.

169
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that quiet say about who you are.

170
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the value

171
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Of you. What does it say

172
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go fast, go really slow in this. These are hard enough to get to. So, opening up the door and it's quiet and there's no one there. What does that say about you.

173
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.260
Joshua Lopez: Know if

174
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You have one we just decided not to say it, you have one that just passed through your mind and you elected not to tell me had one just now.

175
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

176
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.960
Joshua Lopez: I'm lonely.

177
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What okay

178
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to take it to the next level. Then what does that say about you that you are lonely. What does that mean to you I'm what

179
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.150
Joshua Lopez: I'm lonely. I'm

180
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.570
Joshua Lopez: Sad that they're not here.

181
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.360
Joshua Lopez: Said that

182
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.660
Joshua Lopez: Don't look forward to the weekend.

183
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're drifting come back. These are hard to get to remember. I warned you about that they're really hard to get. So I'm lonely stick with a lonely. What kind of guy feels lonely.

184
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it away from you for a minute, and let's go picturing someone he goes home he opens the door and no one's there. What do you think about that guy. He's what

185
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.240
Joshua Lopez: Only

186
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.030
Was her emotions.

187
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think about him. He's what

188
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.330
Joshua Lopez: Incomplete

189
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's your judgment of him if he's incomplete.

190
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.090
Joshua Lopez: These are really hard to get to try

191
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That their their their hard earned, which means they're yours forever, so wait it out. They're worth the wait.

192
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz I'm not in any rush, although I'm kind of keep sort of demanding something on this, not a rush.

193
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll show you picture a guy.

194
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Drives in holes into this new place opens the door.

195
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: No one's there.

196
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of them.

197
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.100
Joshua Lopez: Go for him. I feel empathy towards him that

198
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Those are feelings.

199
00:23:51.210 --> 00:24:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing good. You hang in there for it. You have an opinion about that guy. I'm trying to get you to figure out what that is. Come on. If you and I are talking smack about that neighbor. What do we say about him.

200
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.070
Joshua Lopez: Or guy.

201
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to feeling and I this is important for our work together. Now I know what you do, you go to emotions, nine out of 1010 out of 10 times

202
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not you think a therapist would love it, but I'm not. This is cognitive, behavioral, so it's I'm trying to get to the sponsoring belief.

203
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why you're noticing. I'm not going with the emotion you keep bringing up because this is not about the right side of the brain. You have a judgment about that guy.

204
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you won't say it and we're going to see if we can get there. We're going to keep hammering away at it here. What do you you got somewhere with it.

205
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so right he's incomplete. What do you think of that guy that's incomplete.

206
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an opinion. What is your opinion of him that guy that neighbor going home, nobody there. He's incomplete, what's your opinion of him not empathy. Not feeling for him. It's just an opinion and what is your judgment of him.

207
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.410
Joshua Lopez: Me get

208
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: off the stage here because that page and helping me

209
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.480
Joshua Lopez: I thought I could find something there that would

210
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Help us now. I won't help you

211
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.760
Joshua Lopez: I am trying to get there. I'm not trying to, like, if

212
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.320
Joshua Lopez: I'm wrong.

213
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we're gonna do it again. Here we go. This time you are you ready. Yes. You're not going to expect this

214
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna try and get you to the destination, which is the belief about the self and let's try it this way, once you to picture your mom sees that guy walking into an empty apartment. What's her opinion of that guy walking into an empty apartment.

215
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: For judgment of him.

216
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.820
Joshua Lopez: know much about hers, but yes, my opinion would be that

217
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.090
Joshua Lopez: Yes.

218
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.520
Joshua Lopez: I want to say loser, but I don't know if that's

219
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.810
Joshua Lopez: Healthy

220
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.160
Joshua Lopez: Then label.

221
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that's not what I asked was it I didn't say what's the healthy, did I, I didn't. I wanted you to know what it is and you fought hard to not say that you fought really hard and we had to dig a lot of time that's actually it

222
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a loser.

223
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And that it

224
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.790
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

225
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And doesn't that thought make you sad.

226
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Duh. Of course, it's gonna make you feel

227
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Better

228
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not actually effect.

229
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason I can say that

230
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because

231
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I know personally that when my perspective changes my facts change because my emotional relationship with who I am and what I believe is acceptable and okay changes. And so the facts change.

232
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How I feel changes. I think this one I'm a loser is absolutely in tolerable for anyone who has it.

233
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think is probably the sponsoring belief that then results to this one. Well, it shouldn't be this way. It shouldn't be this way. And yet, there it is.

234
00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you're denying your own reality, it shouldn't be this way. And there it is, well, how lonely and sad is that and how hopeless, is that

235
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think you just discovered

236
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The core belief which is

237
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a loser. That's the troublemaker. That's a little trouble monster right there. That's the one. So now hold that. And now we're going to go look at this this fancy, fancy little activity. And now we can apply it in here. Okay. You worked hard for that.

238
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice the word

239
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't say you're happy, healthy thought does it

240
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it doesn't. And you worked hard to get to this one.

241
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you write it down. So this would be your first let's say you're gonna like, I'm going to hack away, you know, each time I have a negative thought

242
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Or what I deem is negative. And I think it's negative because I'm feeling like crap. When I have it.

243
00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm not enough. I should be, you know, further along. Why did I make this choice when I was 16 devil, but whenever you do with your, with your mind however you're busy judging yourself. Whenever you have one

244
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to sit your butt down and you can do these. So let's just pick the first one. Let's just run through it.

245
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: took us a while to get here. Right. It's already a quarter of practically but here we go.

246
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would write down on a piece of paper. I'm a loser. You write it down so you can see which of the cognitive distortions you're involved in

247
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This will make it easier to think about the problem in a more positive and realistic way so they don't list the distortions in here. So I'm going to now that you know how to screen.

248
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know how to screenshot. I'm going to give you this because you don't have. You don't know what this means. I'm assuming

249
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to give you another something to take a picture of okay

250
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple versions of me see if I can pull them up quick quickly here. If I can cognitive

251
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Dissonance now.

252
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: irrational beliefs. Yeah, let's do that one so irrational beliefs cognitive distortions. Those are basically the same thing. So cognitive means thought irrational just is referring to. It's inhuman

253
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Irrational just means rigid and the expectation is is next level, not from this universe. It's not human. We often do that to ourselves. I should be such and such. That's irrational, but that's not what is what is

254
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Something else.

255
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show you a picture and take a snap of this one too. Now you got that fancy new skill. This is going to be when you're writing down the negative belief, you're going to run through these and see which one you're engaged in

256
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you engaged in all or nothing thinking

257
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait a minute. This or no, I don't know, maybe it is

258
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not perfect. I have failed. Look at that, either. I do it right or not at all. I wonder if you're engaged in all or nothing thinking with that I'm a loser thing.

259
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Wait, I have a failed marriage. Let's say you're judging yourself with that or I didn't do A, B, and C of

260
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The thoughts are, you might be engaged in this so you could look through here and say, Okay, yep. I'm doing this one. Let me check another one. Let me check my mental filter.

261
00:31:51.120 --> 00:32:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Only paying attention to the certain types of evidence only paying attention. So noticing our failures but not seeing our success. So notice

262
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't walk into the house and say, sweet.

263
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweet couch. I got my own place. I'm not up in my car. I'm not stuck with my mom, you don't focus on the positive or you don't go all the sweet silence, I can now rest.

264
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can now you know kind of have a moment to do some reflection some reading or be kind of lazy lumpy or watch some empty minded TV you focus

265
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: On the negative when you walk in, so you are engaged in mental filter. Well, there's another one, you're doing. Here's another one. Let's go to jump to conclusion.

266
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: These are two key types of jumping to conclusions. There's mind reading

267
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Predicting the future. So this one, you might be doing it with this House is empty, I feel lonely.

268
00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Always be like that. That would be fortune telling predicting the future. Okay, so that that might be

269
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing the mind reading really because you're not thinking about anybody else right in that moment, I don't think so. How about emotional reasoning. Oh, this one is so prolific so many people do this. So, assuming that BECAUSE WE FEEL SO I FEEL LONELY.

270
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, assuming that because we feel a certain way.

271
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It must be true. So look what I bet you're doing it, watch. I'm lonely. I am a loser. It's a fact it's a fact because, look, I'm lonely. I shouldn't be lonely life shouldn't be like this. And it's a fact I'm a loser. And so it cycles around around around around around around around around

272
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And it reinforces itself. And so you're using emotional reasoning.

273
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they use an example of I'm embarrassed.

274
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I must be an idiot. No, no, it's not the truth. There's lots of reasons why you could be embarrassed.

275
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or there's lots of reasons why you could be incorrectly embarrassed when really what might have been appropriate is being pissed off irritated frustrated

276
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or concerned about someone else's failure to, I don't know what they didn't give you the right information or they intentionally humiliated you maybe they're the emotion. There might be anger.

277
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's getting off the topic, but my point is, you could have been engaging and emotional reasoning when you're walking in that apartment door.

278
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How about labeling yourself stoop. Oh my gosh, look at even has it yours look, look, look, look, look, look. You see it down there under the stupid button.

279
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Even there. That's how common that is Josh, are you surprised to see that.

280
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.680
Joshua Lopez: No. Well, yeah, I guess.

281
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that common. It's one of those basic things we say to ourselves, really get ourselves bummed out.

282
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were mislabeling so the what this, this should really say is mislabeling so you sign a label to ourselves or to other people and it's a miss label.

283
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a loser. I'm completely useless.

284
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might do it to someone else. They're a complete idiot. Well, you know, we're not completely anything we're partly this and some of that are not all one thing. So you're mislabeling

285
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're engaging in quite a few of these do

286
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You get down in the sand swamp.

287
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how this is how you get there there so frequent that we out here. We got labels for them. We know what they're called, we can see when our clients are doing it when you guys are doing them.

288
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The trick is write them down and you look in here. He said, Can which 1am i doing. Let's go to catastrophizing this one you got a little bit in group from I think you were there right where I was doing that circle with the target we in there. I did that one.

289
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.290
Joshua Lopez: I don't think so.

290
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That was this week so nowhere because we're meeting. No. Okay, so let's keep going because I want you to be at least have some introduction to to to at least all of these. So there's more yay for us.

291
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So overgeneralizing everything is always rubbish. Nothing good ever happens to me. Okay, so see a pattern based upon a simple event.

292
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Or being overly broad in the conclusion. So it's either way. So you're taking

293
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I am alone over the next few days, and you're over generalizing it across time.

294
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you might be engaging and overgeneralizing right this is this is

295
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say not. This might not be your go to, I might notice some of these others match it a little bit better. Let's go to them. This next one.

296
00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A better example might be I failed a test like I'll never pass another test, I'm an idiot. I'll never pass another one that would be overgeneralizing or

297
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never be able to learn anything new that would be overgeneralizing and these are irrational beliefs about ourselves. They're not based on the truth. The truth is, most people can learn most people make mistakes all people make mistakes.

298
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We have expectations for ourselves that are way too rigid

299
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay disqualifying the positive definitely you're doing that right just discounting the good things that have happened or that you have done.

300
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For some reason or another, so well that doesn't count. Well, yeah, I may have this apartment. But look, there's no one in it. See what a loser. I am so you discount the positive

301
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't look around and just see, look at these cool pictures. Hey, I have good taste. And I got a good deal. And it's got pictures of my family and in our night. Awesome.

302
00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're not doing that you're focusing on negative. So let's go to magnification blowing things out of proportion.

303
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could be minimizing so that's sort of its opposites magnification or minimization.

304
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure you sure did. This one you said you did the show.

305
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see exactly what you said find it.

306
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't how it should be.

307
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, you're gonna apply that to anything, but it is that way.

308
00:38:44.880 --> 00:39:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that's going to be this right here you if you eliminate should must and you oughta get rid of it with your, your language all together. Your, your mindset will drastically change. It would be nice if my kiddos were here, period.

309
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be nice if I

310
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Already had a dining room table. I kind of want to sit down and make a meal. It would be nice, but it should be when your reality is something else is a horrifying realization

311
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: They're very different mindsets.

312
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the last one. They've got is personalization blaming yourself for taking responsibility for something that wasn't completely your fault to begin with. So, conversely, blaming other people for something that was partly your fault. So

313
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Over blaming yourself like I should have done this and that. There's that shoot again. So I'm going to pull back a little bit.

314
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.190
And I really

315
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

316
00:39:51.990 --> 00:40:03.510
Joshua Lopez: Quick question on that one. Um, so when it says blaming sorry I need glasses blaming yourself for taking responsibility for something that wasn't completely your fault.

317
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:08.760
Joshua Lopez: Then it goes to conversely blaming other people for something that was you're

318
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way the wording is bad. I wish this was written a little better. I would have, I would have said, partly

319
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:22.440
Joshua Lopez: Okay. So, so what does that exactly mean like is that still like is that the positive flip side to it.

320
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Or negative. All of these are negative.

321
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.790
Joshua Lopez: So, so come. Conversely, blaming other people for something that

322
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: was partly your fault. Okay. Okay.

323
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.250
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I think I got it, I think. Reading

324
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.070
Joshua Lopez: It out loud. It makes sense. Yeah. And I know

325
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.310
Joshua Lopez: We might head. It kind of trying to just was like, wait, what

326
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, their wording is a little, a little off. I would have said, partly I would have put in, because it really isn't ever just one

327
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: One fault, it won't. It doesn't work well when we simply just blame and I don't want to get too philosophical at this late hour here.

328
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't work well in us feeling okay with with ourselves and in relationship and in our community. It just feels better. We are happier when we can say, yeah, I made it. I may have played a little part in that.

329
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Really small part

330
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:33.600
Joshua Lopez: Now I get the whole downside and blip in your yourself for something that you know wasn't completely your fault. What would. What's the negative side to just putting the blame all the blame on somebody like

331
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:34.530
I know

332
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.740
Joshua Lopez: The reason why I ask is,

333
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:47.520
Joshua Lopez: You know, like I i've openly admitted that my, my fault in all this.

334
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:54.270
Joshua Lopez: Separation that divorce, just the way things are kind of blamed myself.

335
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:07.710
Joshua Lopez: And kind of like taking full bling. Now, on the flip side, you have my ex who hasn't ever admitted any wrongdoing any of it.

336
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.760
Joshua Lopez: What's the negative side to doing that.

337
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be an angry unpleasant unreasonable irrational person to be around.

338
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how many people do you want to be around that don't know how to own their part.

339
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're taking your ex obviously that's who we're talking about right.

340
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How likely is it that she's happy inside

341
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That she's blaming someone else it's out of her control and she had nothing to do with it. She's subject to the next person completely whatever ring.

342
00:42:54.690 --> 00:43:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't give her a sense of efficacy, either to say this person, unfortunately, it's you. So I don't know if you can do this particular analogy but

343
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are the person going through it, where you didn't know how to own your grain of truth. I would say

344
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that like to, to be so helpless to the outside world that you had no part in it. You never know. So I might do it again.

345
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There's different angles. You can come at it. And, and, secondly, I would probably be hearing from her and she's mad at people.

346
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be hearing from that woman if she's my client, she is going to be this guy did this to me and and and and then he did this and then he did this and I would be, uh huh. Well,

347
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: WHAT PART DID YOU PLAY.

348
00:43:53.460 --> 00:44:07.980
Joshua Lopez: That actually that actually makes a lot of sense, a lot of sense. It just seems like whenever I am around her, or have a brief conversation with her. She just she always just seem so angry with me like

349
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time. All the time.

350
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:23.670
Joshua Lopez: And that's why I asked, just because you know I saw myself in the, you know, blaming yourself for something that wasn't completely your fault. I see that in me then that second part of it.

351
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:25.680
Joshua Lopez: brought it up.

352
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:31.110
Joshua Lopez: That because, you know, in all of this.

353
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:41.730
Joshua Lopez: You know early on when I was like, I'm sorry I did this. I'm sorry I did that I you know I was real apologetic, and I was trying to own my mistakes.

354
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:52.830
Joshua Lopez: You know out of her response. It felt like she just said sorry because she thought that's what I wanted to hear. But she never said I'm sorry for this. Or I'm sorry I did that it was

355
00:44:53.400 --> 00:45:06.360
Joshua Lopez: I'm sorry tune. I'm sorry to and you know it was never to to me an apology is not sincere and it doesn't count as an apology. If you're not apologizing for something you

356
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.280
Joshua Lopez: Get a message.

357
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

358
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:13.320
Joshua Lopez: It's like an empty apology. It's just words.

359
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.250
Joshua Lopez: And I do notice, which you were saying that they're angry all the time.

360
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.490
Joshua Lopez: A couple of times I have talked to her, she's like, Oh, my boss did this and I was like,

361
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:35.820
Joshua Lopez: You know, I mean like her response to him was real cold and true and that's how she's been with me for a long time, just real cold and true.

362
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:50.610
Joshua Lopez: But you know, I don't know if that's every relationship. She has if she's like that, but I do know towards me and towards certain other aspects in her life. She does seem like she's just angry all the time.

363
00:45:51.750 --> 00:46:00.060
Joshua Lopez: Especially with me. I mean, I can ask how her day was and it's just like a really cold and true response.

364
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:10.650
Joshua Lopez: You know, one day she was tired of picking up the kids. I was like, oh, what you know like you. You look tired like oh I'm exhausted. I was like, Oh, well,

365
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:17.790
Joshua Lopez: You know, how was your day off. It's like, oh, I just laid down as, like, you know, are you tired from yesterday. She's like, No, I was off yesterday.

366
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:33.330
Joshua Lopez: Like, oh, you know what what got you feeling so tired. Oh, it just, I'm tired and you know I mean it was just like real, you know, like, Hey, I'm just trying to make small talk. I'm not judging you for being tired. I'm not. You know what I'm saying it was just

367
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's defensiveness. So what she was doing was defensive as if so, um, it's actually

368
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A sign

369
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your ego strength that you can sit with being wrong off mistaken, not knowing

370
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a sign of your strength, actually. So you and I spend have spent some time around this notion of identity and you label it may be incomplete.

371
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And we've spent some time in there, but this time.

372
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You sort of saying that there's something kind of maybe need some bolstering we need to work on confidence. So you've kind of said that

373
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I focus on on this word identity, you might label it confidence and I might say, Well, identity and

374
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, focusing on your own wants, needs and preferences and I spend time there. But this time I want to give you props, because the fact that you can sit with your grain of truth is a compliment.

375
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To your stability in knowing who you are people that have a fragile sense of self.

376
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Cannot afford to be wrong.

377
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't be has to be right.

378
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to and how how pleasant, is it to be around that type of person.

379
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:06.210
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, she's the type of person where a fact could be sitting right in front of her. She

380
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:25.050
Joshua Lopez: will rationalize being right you know like it could be just flat out evidence that hey, you had a part in this. Or, you know, maybe you should have done this or something, something of that nature. And she's just she's right you know she's 100% right all the time.

381
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, the irony is

382
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That it tends to be those folks those defensive folks that are actually more insecure than you.

383
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can write do you picture the maybe it's a boss or maybe it's a friend or someone and they're like this.

384
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah screwed up. Whoops. And like I got, I got to work on that. And it just rolls off like this.

385
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't they look cool.

386
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.570
Joshua Lopez: And, you know,

387
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:14.010
Joshua Lopez: I can't take credit and say, I've always been great at owning my mistakes, but I know, working with you. I know the situation. I've went through owning my truth owning my mistakes.

388
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:29.070
Joshua Lopez: A couple weeks ago, I had my my two months three review where my trainer and my team leader who's like my manager, my boss had to sit down and go over the this list of things and then it would have comments at the bottom of each of them.

389
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:43.230
Joshua Lopez: And one of the comments my trainer made in one of those was, you know, Joshua is quick to admit a mistake and correct it. He owns his mistakes you know doesn't make excuses for anything.

390
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:50.880
Joshua Lopez: And hearing that I was kind of like, you know, I do do that in it. I mean, as soon as

391
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:58.890
Joshua Lopez: As soon as they're like well why did you do that. And I'm like, Oh, shoot. That's my fault. I should have. I should have done this, and I apologize. You know, I

392
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:07.500
Joshua Lopez: I know where I made that mistake. I know how to fix it, you know, to mean like recognizing it right away. Um, you know what I mean, it just it

393
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:19.770
Joshua Lopez: Hearing that that last bit of those those things. Um, I gotta say make me feel a bit better made me feel like a better person than it made me kind of confirm

394
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:30.180
Joshua Lopez: What I knew about Jacqueline you know about always being right always, you know, to mean and just being so unpleasant towards me. It's something that I knew, but it kind of just confirmed

395
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:40.470
Joshua Lopez: It just gave me a different perspective. You know, so I do very much appreciate that. It just kind of opened my eyes and you know to mean it just

396
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:51.810
Joshua Lopez: And that's that when I told you I was doing a lot better. This week until today. We had a pretty big fight about to about a week and a half ago.

397
00:50:53.790 --> 00:51:01.800
Joshua Lopez: And I just, I sat down and I just kind of just told myself, dude, this is what you're crying about this is what you're hurting about

398
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:11.670
Joshua Lopez: Like look at how she is I look at how she handled that fight. You know, it's just, she would rather resort to

399
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:19.140
Joshua Lopez: You know, because that's talking. I told you I met a I reconnected with the friend of mine Evelyn she'd been real great companionship.

400
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:34.920
Joshua Lopez: And I told her you know this fight. It just, it was embarrassing was in front of the kids and she's like, dude, that's not on your character that's her character that's she's the one who should feel embarrassed. She's the one who should, you know what I mean, it just

401
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:50.370
Joshua Lopez: It kind of puts things into perspective when I start to miss her on like you. You know what that's gonna be like, like, you know, the connection you have with her. Now it's never going to be what it was. She's a different person.

402
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.460
Joshua Lopez: You know what I mean, it just

403
00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:05.370
Joshua Lopez: As much as it hurts to admit. Like, I don't really know who she is anymore. It also kind of helps me to say you really want to be around somebody like that, you know,

404
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. That's taking so what you're doing, from the psychobabble world is you're taking. Sorry, but yours are really bad.

405
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're taking an emotional response and you don't just roll with it.

406
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do is you dip into this that thinking part of the brain. The Thinker thinker. This one top notch and you're going, wait a second. I like the way she's handling this

407
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is happening. This is my wife now ex wife. I don't need. I didn't even know if you guys actually signed the paperwork. So still kind of think of her but I got you. Sorry about that. So you go it's happening. I don't like it.

408
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you dip into the member on paper. You saw should if you dip into the irrational thinking it should be like this.

409
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to stay stuck in that negative emotion. But if instead what you did do, which is, oh, this is a crummy feeling I'm feeling kind of Jaak embarrassments one of the yuck. Right. Yeah, well, oh, I don't like what she's doing.

410
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's happening. This is who she is. These days it represents, maybe even years of her behavior.

411
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real. The illusion of 10 years ago 12 years ago. That's not what's happening. This is it. This is happening.

412
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're able to go to. Well, I kind of glad I'm not in it.

413
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'd be unhappy. I think

414
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to get you into a. All right. I made it. I made a solid decision. I'm a part of this, this is this is a good thing. I'm going to grow.

415
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna, I'm going to be something instead of just tolerating a negative marriage, I might grow up might actually

416
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a healthy relationship with someone because you're growing up, you're doing this work now.

417
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.030
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, definitely. I remember a while back, probably a long time ago.

418
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.810
Joshua Lopez: There was like Dr. Phil or something.

419
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:36.570
Joshua Lopez: He was then you know how relationships work. And if you're the type of person who doesn't believe you had any fault in a relationship that ended badly, and you just play this victim.

420
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:52.770
Joshua Lopez: Next relationship. It's going to repeat itself. But if you're the type of person who can look at your mistakes and admit them and grow from them. Your next relationship. I promise you, you're not going to repeat your next, you know, I mean, you're

421
00:54:52.770 --> 00:55:02.010
Joshua Lopez: Not, you're not going to repeat the same the same mistakes you might make new ones. But you know what I'm saying it's your, you have the ability to grow.

422
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:16.140
Joshua Lopez: And I do feel like, yeah, she's already found companionship. She's looks happy on the outside, but at the same time. I'm like, how long is that going to last. If she's not willing to grow or learn

423
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.570
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it's taking me a lot longer to let go, it's taking me a lot longer to do these certain things.

424
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:38.910
Joshua Lopez: But I know when I do find somebody or I do find companionship, that I know my mistakes. I know you know where I went wrong. I know how to fix it. And I know you know what I mean, it's just

425
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.020
Joshua Lopez: Um, yeah, so I do

426
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:49.230
Joshua Lopez: I do really, really appreciate the work that we do. It's out for really helpful.

427
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Good. Well, I can see it. And I'm starting to see

428
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just in some of the language that you're using just write a couple of times in session that you're starting to head into the clearing

429
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Your head in there because you're saying things that

430
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically what you'll do is as soon as this comes up, you'll just be in the emotion, you'll be in it and then each thought is this

431
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It shouldn't be like this shouldn't be like this shouldn't be like this shouldn't be like this and it keeps got but what you did today was probably the way the last few days prior to last night have been which is you might have been more in

432
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I could look at this as an opportunity for my gross. I could look at this as an opportunity

433
00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: For a healthy, happy relationship and maybe I'll be happier. I think

434
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A little more of it.

435
00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We're normally you use what we would call emotional reasoning which is if I'm feeling sad right then, someone is deliberately hurting me they're intending to do it this the world. And it's a helpless feeling and I'm no good. And of course, you get to I'm loser quite quickly.

436
00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But I didn't see it right here at the tail end of today. I'm seeing something else you're able to see. Oh, there's another way to look at this woman's behavior.

437
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What about my opinion about behavior, not just, I have to take care of that behavior and feel like I did something wrong. There's a lot of other ways to take a look at that behavior and you just touched on a couple of them.

438
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them. I don't like it.

439
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hey, she's kind of insecure, in a way, I don't really want someone insecure. I'm getting more secure in myself and be nice to be with someone who's a whole person, not to incomplete people

440
00:57:55.950 --> 00:58:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's sort of that child's two hearts kind of thing like to have a heart that's kind of

441
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's like middle school love

442
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Mature love is I'm a whole I'm a whole man on hold and I want to share my life with someone and I'll be flawed and I'll make mistakes and all on them. You already got that part down. And wouldn't it be nice to be with someone who can do the same.

443
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:23.790
Absolutely.

444
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The work you're doing. I know it's hard but I think it's gonna think it's going to pay off for you.

445
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.100
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

446
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright man, do you want to schedule another appointment. Two weeks from today. Ish, yeah, that

447
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:46.260
Joshua Lopez: That that'll work because next week you'll have group and the following week my days off, or the same wednesday thursday

448
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.850
Joshua Lopez: So, so two weeks from now my days off or Wednesday Thursday.

449
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's probably

450
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A 36

451
00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:02.820
Joshua Lopez: That makes it a little easier on like planning our individual sessions. Just, just know the weeks that I'm in group.

452
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:09.450
Joshua Lopez: You don't have to memorize those days off because I'm in group, we won't set set up an individual with the following week

453
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:18.630
Joshua Lopez: After group I'm off Wednesday, Thursday, if that makes it easier because I know my schedule is kind of hard. It's hard to explain. For one, and it's probably even harder to understand

454
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I just all I need from you is is a yes or no, honestly.

455
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To schedule is may 13 which is to Wednesdays from today going to work.

456
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:39.300
Joshua Lopez: at 11am 11am may 13

457
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:42.840
Joshua Lopez: If it's on a Wednesday. Two weeks from now than. Yes. Okay.

458
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: May 13 so when you hang up with me cross check that, because you'll do the calculation on that and then you just let me know texting back and say, whoops.

459
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

460
00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's two weeks because next week would be May six, so then the next Wednesday would be may 13 so that's what I just did I flipped my calendar.

461
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To to forward. And that's where we landed, so I will see you then. And I'm going to send a quick message to dr reality we're here. I don't know if she has any medication, something to say about it. But all of a sudden know you were here and I'll get to see you group and next Tuesday, maybe

462
01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.890
Joshua Lopez: Yes. So yeah, this, this coming Tuesday. I'll be in group.

463
01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Come in and remember it's well 12 o'clock on Tuesday.

464
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: probing questions.

465
01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You, we missed you there. I wish you were there is a good group, but

466
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It was nice having you internet there. We don't just don't get to see quite as often because you're kind of on a bi weekly sometimes monthly kind of thing so

467
01:00:50.820 --> 01:01:02.010
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I noticed. Everybody in that group was pretty new. So it was, it was pretty cool to meet somebody or to see people who were, we were you know me and the net were

468
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:10.020
Joshua Lopez: Like a year and a half, two years ago, you know, to mean and to see their Judaism and, you know, I've tried quitting before but

469
01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:17.520
Joshua Lopez: never really had this type of helping because that's the way I'm sure she felt, and I know that's how I felt when I came into bright heart like

470
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:28.380
Joshua Lopez: I've done this before. I've tried this before but never like this you may mean never with the support that you and Dr. Aubrey out can provide. And you know, I mean, it's just awesome.

471
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that combination of having both so hopefully everything will work out, we'll be able to have you in there again next Tuesday. Okay.

472
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:39.180
Joshua Lopez: You have a good day.

473
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

474
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:28.770
Melissa Harrison: I just got home from work. So trying to connect to Wi Fi and all that. Then again,

475
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.820
Melissa Harrison: Well,

476
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.360
To make

477
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We both her log out and come right back. So just log out and then literally hit log in right away.

478
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:40.740
Okay.
