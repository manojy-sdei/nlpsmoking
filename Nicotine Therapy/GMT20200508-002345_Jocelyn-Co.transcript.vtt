16
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:30.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Eating taking a shower bathing brushing putting on clothes sleeping and managing pain. So it's like your basic day to day everyday things to do when you wake up.

17
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:44.550
Erika Romero: Right. Um, I just, I get up generally spend a couple hours by myself, waiting for my granddaughter Italy, and then I get her up and

18
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.860
Erika Romero: I'm I

19
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:59.460
Erika Romero: Play with her get housework done. Um, I do laundry and you know just basic run errands, if I need to.

20
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.460
Erika Romero: A I I eat maybe twice a day. Some sometimes if I'm lucky.

21
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.930
Erika Romero: But that's, that's always been that way. I've always just been a once a day eater. Anyway, so, um, and

22
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.170
Erika Romero: And so then my husband gets home I make dinner we eat dinner.

23
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.510
Erika Romero: And

24
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.060
Erika Romero: As far as pain management. I just right now, I'm just dealing with with my pain, um,

25
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.220
Erika Romero: And so

26
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:50.940
Erika Romero: But and sleeping going to sleep is is is difficult for me, I find myself very fatigued during the day. So I usually try to get in a nap in the afternoon when I put the baby down

27
00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:03.930
Erika Romero: Couple hours or an hour and a half to two hours. I'm with her. And then, um, I usually go to sleep, somewhere around midnight, I guess.

28
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.080
Erika Romero: That that's about my day.

29
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.170
Erika Romero: For you Monday and it's always the same.

30
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay wait for a while.

31
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.940
Jocelyn Corrales: And usually sleeps around 12 around 12 midnight. Right.

32
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.770
Erika Romero: Yeah, that's what I usually

33
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.920
Jocelyn Corrales: So, what time do you should eat, you mentioned that you usually wake up together with your grand daughter that what time does your granddaughter, you got. Are you from the week so

34
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:41.970
Erika Romero: Well, right now I'm trying to get her in a routine because she's getting ready to turn three. And so her bedtime routine has been like all over the map.

35
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:59.520
Erika Romero: But now I'm trying to get her to bed earlier and getting her up earlier and also taking a nap earlier during the day so I can kind of get her in a routine, but I'm usually up about 637 and then I get her up about

36
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.570
Erika Romero: 838 39 no later than nine

37
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.160
Jocelyn Corrales: So your grandmother at around 830 that's okay.

38
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.740
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good that you always keep a routine for her to wake up.

39
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.290
Erika Romero: Yeah, and it's

40
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Nice to get this tea.

41
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Especially when she's going to school.

42
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:35.790
Erika Romero: Me right and it's more of a necessity now because you know she. She fights her sleep now. You know what I mean, where she and he just stayed up till 12 one, two o'clock in the morning.

43
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.490
Erika Romero: being exhausted sleeps. You know me until 1011 O'clock in the

44
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.270
In the morning

45
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.470
Erika Romero: throws her naptime off. So I'm trying to get her into early or routine.

46
00:05:49.530 --> 00:06:03.960
Erika Romero: You know that way she's you know and then and I want to put her in preschool here. Yeah, yeah, I'm starting to put her down about nine 930 and then that way. She's asleep, no later than 10

47
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.180
Erika Romero: And because I want to put her like I said in preschool next year. So when she goes to preschool. She's got to be on on some sort of a schedule.

48
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and at least it's not difficult for her to wake up early beta time she goes to school already

49
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Already had and I think that's a good training.

50
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.160
Erika Romero: Yeah.

51
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.450
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're right, the earlier. She wakes up the

52
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Earlier. She also goes to bed.

53
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Because she she wakes up late, you know, she also made sleep.

54
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.870
Sleep.

55
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.370
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's a good. Did you have a routine, you know, lateral sleep at around maybe want to ours, you know,

56
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:49.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and I think maybe that's the reason why you get to sleep late also because you taken up with your granddaughter right

57
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.450
Erika Romero: Yeah.

58
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

59
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.240
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay if your granddaughter sleeps at their own one to two hours, but for you. I think maybe just try

60
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:08.910
Jocelyn Corrales: To limit yourself limiting sleeping at the only be 30 minutes to one hour, but not more than one are because if you sleep more than an hour. You know, it would be difficult for you to sleep at around

61
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.590
Jocelyn Corrales: At night.

62
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.960
Erika Romero: Right, yeah, that's

63
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:22.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Also, one thing that the country visit, but it's okay to sleep in the afternoon or take a nap in the afternoon, maybe just limited to 32 to 30 minutes to an hour, try to

64
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Make an alarm or no do an alarm for yourself.

65
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

66
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.860
Jocelyn Corrales: So you slept together. You stick together weaker read child or you just let her speak in her room.

67
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.170
Erika Romero: Well, right now, she she is absolutely terrified of her room.

68
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.730
Jocelyn Corrales: I don't know why he

69
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:55.710
Erika Romero: Is terrified. But she she sleeps in our room in her own bed. So yeah, when I took her to her to see her pediatrician last week. And she said, that's fine because of her age right now.

70
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.620
Erika Romero: If she sleeps in the same room with you. She says, but

71
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:07.350
Erika Romero: You might want to try to get her to start sleeping in her own room. I said, Well, yeah, terrified, her, her room, she does not want to sleep in there.

72
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:15.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried you know you let her sleep in her her room and you wait until she's able to sleep before you get out of her

73
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.430
Erika Romero: Oh yeah, and absolutely and the weird thing about it. She slept in her room. Her whole life. You know what I mean.

74
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.570
Erika Romero: And I mean,

75
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:32.100
Erika Romero: That sounds kind of funny cuz she's only three but you know her earlier life she's always slept in her room in it.

76
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:44.340
Erika Romero: I guess it's only been now that she's gotten older, and she's more cognitive of what's going on around her and her. Unfortunately, her room is on the opposite end of the house as ours.

77
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.660
lindsell

78
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:59.430
Erika Romero: Is she she's by herself on the other end of the house. And so I think that's what scares there's there's nobody else there and she wakes up, she wakes up every night still in the middle of the night.

79
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.990
Erika Romero: So not being that has gone away yet but when she wakes up in the middle of the night. She's absolutely terrified to be in her room, I think.

80
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.850
Jocelyn Corrales: The she watch movies before. You know, before going to bed or, you know, right now. Did you watch movies like cartoons or anything.

81
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.250
Erika Romero: Scary, you know, she doesn't watch scary stuff. And we don't let her watch. That kind of stuff.

82
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:32.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Because it could have been something that you know from what you watch know scary, you know, having some secure ideas because of something that she watch know

83
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:50.310
Erika Romero: Right, ya know, we want monitor everything we don't even watch scary movies, you know, because we went and we rented one was a week ago and I had to turn it off because you know she I didn't realize it was going to be as scary as it was, and

84
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.690
Erika Romero: That was the first time in her whole life that we've ever watched a scary movie.

85
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.010
Erika Romero: And I was like, Oh, no, we got to turn this off. She's already got enough problems, you know,

86
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:11.010
Erika Romero: I don't want to contribute anymore. So we just shut it off. And, um, you know, we monitor very closely what she watches and on on the tablet and also on TV and you

87
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.790
Erika Romero: Know that we make sure that she's not being exposed to that kind of stuff.

88
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:26.190
Erika Romero: Yeah, I think it's just more so that it's just quiet on that end of the house and you hear every eek and Creek and you know that dogs are also in in

89
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.970
Erika Romero: Outside, but on that end of the house and

90
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.480
Erika Romero: So, you know, any noise they make, and I think she doesn't

91
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.570
Erika Romero: Know what it is. And so it's

92
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:48.570
Erika Romero: Yours and really that's just the that's just the bottom line. I think it is, you know, being that little and just hearing stuff and not knowing what it is or where it's coming from, you know, not

93
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.250
Erika Romero: Understanding that

94
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.920
Erika Romero: You know houses make noises at night and the dogs wander around in the middle of the night, you know, and

95
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.990
Erika Romero: And so I think it's just getting her past this phase.

96
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.850
Erika Romero: And but she does sleep in her own bed so she doesn't sleep with us.

97
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:06.990
So,

98
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.820
Erika Romero: I don't know.

99
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.230
Erika Romero: So hopefully that'll be

100
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.790
Erika Romero: Something she breaks out of here before too long because I sure would love to have my room back

101
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you know, and your own privacy.

102
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.490
Erika Romero: Yeah, my privacy. Yeah.

103
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:28.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and by the way you've mentioned. She's your granddaughter. Oh, where's her mom and dad, by the way.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.510
Erika Romero: I'm her mom is my husband and I have custody of my granddaughter. My daughter is

105
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.360

Erika Romero: WE GOT CUSTODY OF HER.

124
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.510

125
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.010
Jocelyn Corrales: And, um,

126
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.810

127
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.890

142
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:42.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Have to follow you have to follow her every yet it does drain your energy. It's like a workout every day. It's like an exercise.

143
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.280
Jocelyn Corrales: And by the way we talking about exercise. Are you doing exercises.

144
00:14:47.370 --> 00:15:02.550
Erika Romero: Every day. Um, no I don't, I don't, I, I go for walks with my granddaughter. Aside from that, I because I have a back injury. I don't really do any physical exercises, but I'm constantly going. So, but I try

145
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:11.370
Erika Romero: As often as I possibly can. Check it out. The town. I live in is really one of the windiest places I've ever

146
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.900
Erika Romero: Lived in my entire life.

147
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.570
Erika Romero: So it gets hard to get outside and

148
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.830
Erika Romero: Do things outside

149
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:26.340
Erika Romero: But whenever I get a chance to I go for a walk. Yeah. Or we go for a walk in the evening or, you know, something like that.

150
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.650
Jocelyn Corrales: I said, but not if you go on a walk at times, but not every day.

151
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Now, we tried

152
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing. Maybe you mentioned you have a back problem.

153
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.320
Hmm.

154
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.620
Jocelyn Corrales: And can you do maybe a bit of, you know, stretching exercise.

155
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.210
Erika Romero: I do

156
00:15:49.230 --> 00:16:04.860
Erika Romero: That I do but not nearly as much as I should, more, more. So I think I do when when I'm hurting a lot, you know, I do stretches so that I can kind of stretch out the those areas that are really giving me

157
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Those muscles.

158
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:13.050
Erika Romero: Yes, yeah and and to relieve the nerves and stuff but i mean i. Sure, sure.

159
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.430
Yeah, I know.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Really included in your daily activities and we're going to include that in the plan.

161
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.880
To do you know

162
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:34.710
Jocelyn Corrales: You don't need to do a rigorous type of exercise special your age, but you could do some basic yoga, you know, basic yoga is also doing some extra some stretching, you know,

163
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.420
Jocelyn Corrales: You can do some basic

164
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Yoga and just the basic stretching exercise, you know,

165
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.130
Erika Romero: Okay.

166
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.440
Jocelyn Corrales: At least that I'll include that in the plan.

167
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.060
Erika Romero: Okay. Sounds good.

168
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.380
Erika Romero: See

169
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.440
Erika Romero: Often in my day.

170
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:59.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, you know, just start with, you know, at least maybe 10 minutes late. And you could also include your grandmother taller. It's do some exercise, you know,

171
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:11.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Actually, my husband when he exercise. I have a nephew, you know, he always he always watches my husband exercise into my husband, he's like, can you come here and let's do exercise and, you know, he would also follow

172
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:21.540
Erika Romero: Yeah, and that's the thing with them is that, yeah, they will follow the if the, if, if you entice them, they will. They'll do it.

173
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:28.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes, you could do some stretching exercise, you could add some music to, you know, to make it more fun.

174
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I'm gonna put that first in the plaza that I won't forget

175
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.770
Jocelyn Corrales: This the basic yoga don't do the complicated ones too difficult.

176
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:04.020
Jocelyn Corrales: And you mentioned that you are you only eat, maybe, you know, at least once a day. What, why are you not able to eat.

177
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.160
Erika Romero: Three times that it's not that I'm not able to eat. It's just that.

178
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:23.400
Erika Romero: I don't have that kind of an appetite or maybe I don't get hungry, like that. I'll snack, a little bit here and there, but as far as eating meals. I don't, I'll eat one one full meal.

179
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:37.890
Erika Romero: Usually in the evenings with my with my husband. I'm dinner. We don't, I don't really eat and but I've always been like that. It's not something that you know this, that, or the other, it's just always

180
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.860
Erika Romero: Been me. That's the way I've always eaten.

181
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:53.850
Jocelyn Corrales: It's more of a snacking then eating a meal. So when you're hungry. Just eat this. Do you have also a routine meal you know meal times for your granddaughter.

182
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:55.890
Erika Romero: Yes, I do.

183
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.220
Erika Romero: Yeah. She does. She's not much of a breakfast eater.

184
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:09.390
Erika Romero: Since she's gotten a little bit bigger. Breakfast is kind of obsolete for her, though I tried to get her to eat breakfast, even if it's just a little fruit.

185
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.030
Erika Romero: Or something's just not a morning eater.

186
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.740
Erika Romero: And I'm the same way. I've just

187
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.920
Erika Romero: Never been a morning eater. Um, it was much easier when she was little or and I could feed her, you know, and

188
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.800
Erika Romero: Didn't really have a choice, you know, here. Yeah.

189
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.690
Erika Romero: Breakfast, lunch or dinner but now she's very opinionated and

190
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.590
Erika Romero: very decisive about what she wants, and

191
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.050
Erika Romero: So she eats lunch and she eats dinner but breakfast isn't really

192
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.590
Erika Romero: Much, much of a thing for her.

193
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.800
Erika Romero: So she does have a

194
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:57.690
Erika Romero: She does have a lunch time with just in between 12 and one right before her. Her nap. And then we dinner between five and seven. It just depends on when my husband gets home.

195
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so why not we try. Yeah, I know. It's difficult, but can we try

196
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Setting out a plan of you eating breakfast. No, just maybe just a little instead of doing some snacking.

197
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.770
Jocelyn Corrales: At

198
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:34.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Your grand and I think you should also include your grandmother, because, you know, since you've mentioned that she's going to school. She has to have her routine meals a correct time and it's and it's not good sending her to school without having anything on her stomach, you know,

199
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.680
Erika Romero: Right. Well, yeah, but you can't force a child to eat, you can't. And if she doesn't want to eat. You don't want to

200
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat

201
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.980
Erika Romero: You know, and I'm not a breakfast eater. So I'll just tell you right now, that's not gonna work. I'm not

202
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.640
Erika Romero: A student

203
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you mentioned you try you eat you eat.

204
00:20:52.920 --> 00:21:02.430
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you do snacking. When you eat. Have you tried at least you tried to schedule your snacking. Maybe you know at least maybe around nine o'clock, maybe

205
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:10.860
Erika Romero: I'm not a big snapper. I'm not a big snack or either the i think i think you misunderstood what I said what I was trying to say I'm not a big snack or

206
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.910
Erika Romero: If I

207
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.760
Erika Romero: Eat something during the day. It'll be a snack, but

208
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.020
Erika Romero: Yeah, I usually only eat one meal a day. And that's it. I don't eat breakfast. I definitely don't eat breakfast.

209
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:28.020
Erika Romero: I know every once in a while, a couple of times a week I'll probably have how have lunch.

210
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:37.200
Erika Romero: And and I eat dinner. So that's my, that's the way I eat. That's why I've always eaten and that probably won't change, I'll be honest with you.

211
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.990
Erika Romero: I do try to get her to eat breakfast, but she just

212
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:49.140
Erika Romero: She's not a breakfast eater. I mean, I don't know, I tried fruit. I've tried yogurt. I've tried

213
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.950
Erika Romero: All kinds of stuff and all the bars. She

214
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.790
Erika Romero: Definitely has

215
00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:02.700
Erika Romero: Nothing to do with granola bars. You know, so I really am at a loss as far as breakfast goes, because I really would love for her to

216
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.060
Jocelyn Corrales: HAVE YOU TRIED, HAVE YOU TRIED eating with her, you know, both the both of you eating at the same time. So, don't you know it would encourage her to eat. Maybe because

217
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:20.130
Jocelyn Corrales: She's not eating because you're also not eating maybe try joining her like you're eating, both of you eating on the table.

218
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:35.340
Jocelyn Corrales: And you serve you know this is simple snack you doesn't have to be a full meal, like in your case also, it doesn't have to be a full meal. So if she's eating like you want to try to let her eat probably some yogurt or just maybe a fruit or just a snack, try to eat.

219
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:50.250
Jocelyn Corrales: At the same table with her. Maybe she would, you know, at least it would also put you on a routine, maybe just not a full meal, maybe just a snack for you at least it would put you and her on a routine.

220
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.140
Erika Romero: I'm going to humor you and I'm going to tell you yes I will try.

221
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.660
Erika Romero: That that's the best I can give you

222
00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.590
Jocelyn Corrales: I can

223
00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Finally, just fine.

224
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:07.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, it's okay, it's okay. You don't. It's not really necessary. It's not really required, but you could at least try.

225
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:17.100
Jocelyn Corrales: And tell me you know because we're going to meet again in the next 30 days and I'll check on you and tell me if it works out for you and your granddaughter. And, you know,

226
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:29.520
Jocelyn Corrales: When you try to eat with her at the same time, you know, you try to eat a bunch tries to eat. You know when you try to feed her you try to also eat at the same time with her on the table. And let's see if it works out that, you know,

227
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.090
Jocelyn Corrales: At the seek

228
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Out a routine.

229
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:36.450
Jocelyn Corrales: If it doesn't work, that's fine. Just, just just, just tell me. Okay.

230
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.950
Erika Romero: Okay, I'll try. I'll try it.

231
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:38.910
Okay, Jocelyn.

232
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.450
Jocelyn Corrales: But I'm going to put here that you will try, but you will not promise anything

233
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.620
Jocelyn Corrales: At least, I would know. Yeah. Next time I would

234
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Remind you

Erika Romero: Doing. No, no, no. It come getters go see going out for a little bit. Go hang out for a little bit. I'll be out in just a few minutes. Okay, hang on just a second.

236
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.360
Jocelyn Corrales: No worries.

237
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:32.850
Erika Romero: Okay.

238
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.430
Erika Romero: I'll be out in a few minutes. Okay.

239
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.020
Erika Romero: Lucky go get out here.

240
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.460
Erika Romero: To get on

241
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.640
Erika Romero: The lock the door. She don't come back in here.

242
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.820
Erika Romero: Sorry about that.

243
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.840
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay if she comes in and does

244
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.150
Erika Romero: She have you should be all in the TV Amina in their own in our song.

245
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:04.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

246
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:15.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so let's go let's proceed. So after your daily activity, as you mentioned, usually sleep in the sport industry plan later on with regards to the sleep.

247
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:30.840
Jocelyn Corrales: With regards to mental health. How do you manage, you know, your mood. How do you manage your stress, you know, just in case you encounter any stress or anxiety is how do you manage it in. How do you manage, you know, just in case you're in a bad mood.

248
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:46.710
Erika Romero: But if I'm in a bad mood I it's been I separate myself from everybody. And I take some time for myself, whether that's just sitting, sitting in my room by myself or in

249
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.200
Erika Romero: Watching TV or going for a driver.

250
00:25:49.590 --> 00:26:01.050
Erika Romero: Getting in the bath or usually it's just spending time by myself weather but usually it's maybe about 30 minutes to an hour depends on how angry.

251
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.000
Erika Romero: Or how upset. I am

252
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:13.320
Erika Romero: I'm sometimes it's longer than that. But generally it's only about 30 minutes to an hour, you know, just so that I have that separation time because

253
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.920
Erika Romero: That's what I've always that that I've learned over time is that

254
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:31.530
Erika Romero: If I don't, I have because I have a very sharp tongue. So if I don't take that time and and and separate myself and wine down and think about what I need to say I'm

255
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.300
Erika Romero: A lot of stupid stuff comes out of my mouth and stuff that I can get back so

256
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.530
Jocelyn Corrales: You end up hurting so nobody, you know. Yeah.

257
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:55.740
Erika Romero: And and you can take that back. You know, you can words or something that resonate with you and they will continue to resonate with you as long as, as long as you're alive, you know, and because I was in a very abusive marriage with with my first husband, so

258
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:07.710
Erika Romero: I know how badly words can hurt you know and how long they can carry throughout life, you know, and then damage that they do. So I'm, I'm, whether you mean it or not.

259
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.850
Erika Romero: You have to

260
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.460
Erika Romero: Understand what those words.

261
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:31.140
Erika Romero: You know those words to her. And so I have to because I have I have trouble controlling my my mouth. Sometimes I have to stop and separate myself and and give myself that time to settle down and think about what I'm doing and what I'm saying. Before I I allow myself to

262
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.200
Erika Romero: rejoin the people or persons who have upset me

263
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.600
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's a good breakfast.

264
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and it makes me

265
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.890
Jocelyn Corrales: It makes you a better person.

266
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.330
Erika Romero: I agree.

267
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it's

268
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it

269
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.900
Erika Romero: Gives you kept your relationships in a good spot.

270
00:27:52.590 --> 00:28:06.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true, that's true, that's true. Yes, that's true because there are some things you know when you are not you know when you're angry or mad. You see a lot of things that could be very hurtful to some other people and you know it's true. You could break relationships.

271
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.340
Erika Romero: Because of that, yeah.

272
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:18.420
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good that you try to you. Just be yourself. Stay away from everybody in spend time when yourself. That's good. That's a good practice actually

273
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:29.160
Erika Romero: Yeah, and I try to tell other people to do the same thing, you know. Yeah, if you're in a heated situation right now that that very moment is not the time to deal with it.

274
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:42.540
Erika Romero: Takes sometimes separate and give yourself that time to breathe and to think about, you know, what comes out of your mouth because yes and and i don't i try never to give people advice, but I think that that's the best advice.

275
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:50.250
Erika Romero: Anybody get from another person is give yourself that space because it words do hurt.

276
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes there's no use in arguing with someone you know

277
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:09.090
Jocelyn Corrales: I agree, it doesn't settle anything but maybe when both of you are calm down and you tell about it afterwards you know that's makes the situation better when both of you have come down.

278
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.820
Erika Romero: Right. Yeah, absolutely. I agree.

279
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so do you consider yourself spiritual

280
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.370
Erika Romero: Yes, I do.

281
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.740

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.520
Erika Romero: Probably not nearly as often as I ought to. But yes, I do.

289
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.870
Jocelyn Corrales: But that that's often I use as you used to

290
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.930
Erika Romero: Or as I should.

291
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, but do you go to church also

300
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:53.370
Jocelyn Corrales: And as you have mentioned that right now because you know because of the pandemic. There are no you know the try to limit in actually there are some who does not have church services, but have you tried accessing the online services from a church. Usually they have online.

301
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.730

303
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.150
Erika Romero: I probably should. But I haven't

304
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:21.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you know that you know the pandemic, you know, we because of the pandemic, you know, the quarantine could could be extended and we do not know when it would be, you know, lifted. You could try attending, you know, you know,

305
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:29.370
Jocelyn Corrales: You're been absent for it from church for so many weeks already to try attending their online services.

306
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.550
Erika Romero: Yeah and that that should be something that that we do me

307
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.370
Jocelyn Corrales: And you go, you could also dress up as if you're going to church when you're attending the online service.

308
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, it's funny, but we actually did try that and I

309
00:31:48.030 --> 00:32:01.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Am actually also a Christian and you know we we attend because of yeah because of the current pandemic. We're not allowed to go to church, you know, but we have online services at church. So we do attended every Sunday.

310
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:11.220
Jocelyn Corrales: And there was a one time just this Sunday, you know, it was a suggestion from another member, why not try to dress up as if you're going to church. So what we did this that we

311
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:24.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Just saw this like as if you were going to a church and took a picture of self and send it to the group because we also have a group chat with the other church members and said it to the other church members to at least inspire them, you know,

312
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.670
Jocelyn Corrales: That you know the world.

313
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:43.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You know God must have a greater plan for us. And, you know, just keep on going just to try to hold on with everything else, which would be, that's what that's happening in our world today. And, you know, it, it, it gives a good sense of, you know, positivity to other Members.

314
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.660
Erika Romero: Right, right. You're, you're right.

315
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.600
Erika Romero: I will try that. So,

316
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.570
Erika Romero: You can put that down to just one. Okay.

317
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.380
Yes.

318
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, let's try attending the online service. I'll put that here.

319
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.400
Jocelyn Corrales: At least you could start with, try, try to attend the online service.

320
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.750
Yeah, absolutely.

321
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.580
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you do gardening.

322
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:42.330
Erika Romero: I don't, but I have a whole bunch of house plants. So that's my gardening right now that's

Erika Romero: Yeah, it is. I have

325
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:53.670
Erika Romero: gophers I have gophers really bad and outside. And so having a garden is kind of useless. So

326
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.370
Erika Romero: But I have a bunch of house plants that

327
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:04.020
Erika Romero: Are in a pod. I mean, they're everywhere. Yeah, they're in a pot and now they're everywhere everywhere.

328
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.210
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good. That's gardening.

329
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.780
Yeah, it

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.770
Erika Romero: To me plan for our life. So then

331
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.030
Erika Romero: They made me happy. So

332
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.630
Erika Romero: You know I do. I do have my house cleanse.

333
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.150
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually also relaxing.

Jocelyn Corrales: Check out

338
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:45.750
Erika Romero: We carry the water, you know, the watering jug back around to all the plans and stuff. And so she's very helpful. I, I try to engage her with everything that I do. Um, she helps me vacuum. She's got her little toy vacuum. You know, so

339
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.090
Jocelyn Corrales: That kind of stuff.

340
00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.150
Jocelyn Corrales: I would like to see her do back up and that's her vacuum. Where is

341
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:09.330
Erika Romero: She. Oh yeah, well, it's got she's got one of those little tight back years but she helps me push the the my vacuum, you know, and so she goes, I tell her. Okay, backup. So she backs up and then they go, Okay, let's go forward. Let's go back.

342
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:20.040
Erika Romero: And so she hold on to the handle, along with me. And so we vacuum together, whenever it's feasible, you know, if I just have to do one room or whatever but yeah and and

343
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:33.510
Erika Romero: If, if, if she's not interested in helping me back in because sometimes she just like runs from the vacuum. I don't know why you know she's got her little toy vacuum and I tell her. Okay. Go get your vacuum. Let's go back to me.

344
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.840
Jocelyn Corrales: So she does. Lucky me when you're doing back. That's good.

345
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.520
Jocelyn Corrales: You know that's one way of training.

346
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.260
Jocelyn Corrales: You know that's one way of trading these kids to do the household chores.

347
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.910
Erika Romero: Yeah, I'm hoping that you know you're in a few years should be doing.

348
00:35:48.630 --> 00:36:04.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true, that's true. Actually, that's a good training. You know, you're, you're letting her getting involved when you're doing you know when you're doing gardening you let her, you know, this actually not only letting her learn, but it's also stimulating her to learn

349
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.730
Erika Romero: Right. Yes.

350
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:15.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, learning just learning a lot of things, you know, not only motor skills but also you put her interest into doing something, you know, something like that.

351
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.930
Jocelyn Corrales: And that's over learning, you get. Yeah.

352
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Good lady activity.

353
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:28.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually, and it's good that you're you're let you let her help with the plans you know you could actually tell her. No, you know, it's like

354
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:38.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Teaching her botany and it's like it's telling her, you know, when you do this, you do that, you know, put the plants to the sun, the plants will grow, you know,

355
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.320
Jocelyn Corrales: What their demands. Yes.

356
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.660
Erika Romero: Something like that. I just ordered her. I just ordered her a really cool little dress.

357
00:36:45.900 --> 00:37:05.970
Erika Romero: terranea and well it's more like a little. It's a castle, and so it comes up. It has little tears to it that you you know comes all pre packaged. So it has the soil and has a flower. See, or the plant seeds and so it has these four little tears that you that you can plant.

358
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:12.480
Erika Romero: These little flower seeds in and so that I can. I ordered that for her so that she can do her

359
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.590
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, and gardening.

360
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:25.410
Erika Romero: Flowers. Yeah, so I'm so excited for it to come in, it should be here soon. But yeah, so that way. She can do her own, and she has her own plants, she can take care of

361
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe in the next

362
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.630
Erika Romero: Time. We've managed to kill them. Then i'm not i'm not wounded.

363
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:38.790
Erika Romero: I think the next time we meet in the 30 days. I could see her to marry him or her little garden. Good. Take a photo of you.

364
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.460
Erika Romero: Most certainly will just

365
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:42.210
You know,

366
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.340
Jocelyn Corrales: When she goes to school, she could brag her classmates about, you know, I have

367
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.430
Jocelyn Corrales: A garden, you know, it's something you know

368
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.330
Jocelyn Corrales: It's something nice to do something she could also brag about.

369
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.760
Erika Romero: In a future. All right.

370
00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

371
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:15.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good also that, you know, aside from letter her, you know, you let her do some chores, at least by the time she grows old she's she she knows she's already trained. She knows how to do her basic household chores and maybe when she's older you could

372
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:16.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Select were

373
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Washing the dishes, you know,

374
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:20.670
Erika Romero: Oh,

375
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:30.900
Erika Romero: Well, she has happy with that kind of stuff. She, she gets up on the counter with us and and show me you know she'll do you know she's got her own little

376
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:43.830
Erika Romero: Play dishes and stuff like that. So she washes her own dishes and we'll get her in the kitchen, whenever we're cooking, you know, she will make a salad and we'll give her the little scraps, you know, the shaving.

377
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:57.090
Erika Romero: As a cucumber, or the ends of the tomato, you know, and so she has her own little plastic forks and spoons and pots and pans and that so she pretends like she's cooking, too. So yeah, she's

378
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.300
Erika Romero: And I've always been like that with my kids. I've always tried to get them engaged in whatever I'm doing, just so that they

379
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:21.660
Erika Romero: Um, first of all, that way I can spend time with them because I'm so busy that there's always something to do, you know, and make sure that they have that one on one attention with me. So even if it is just doing dishes or cooking dinner or watering plants, whatever it is that

380
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.050
Yeah.

381
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.750
Jocelyn Corrales: That's actually the bonding time.

382
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.330
Erika Romero: Yeah, you know, and it gives me that time to

383
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Knowing and knowing that someday they they going, they're going to grow up independent and, you know,

384
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:43.770
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not worried because, you know, they know how to cook. They know how to clean the house. They do. They know how to do basic chores.

385
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:44.670
Right.

386
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're not worried about anything about it because they know how to do it.

387
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you're trained to do so when they were young. That's a good training actress.

388
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.000
Erika Romero: She does with me to just

389
00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:58.920
Erika Romero: As you want

390
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.620
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, and she won't forget about she won't forget you. Because of it, you know, she would

391
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:14.850
Jocelyn Corrales: She would maybe say, you know, when she grows older she would say, you know, my grandma always cooks for me. I know how to cook because my mom, my grandma taught me how to cook this you know

392
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.180
Jocelyn Corrales: These are my grandma's recipe. So something good, you know,

393
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.080

Erika Romero: Yes, that's true.

432
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.910
Erika Romero: You got that really backwards.

433
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:29.910
Jocelyn Corrales: If If you only knew that, you know, being a housewife is actually, you know, a 24 hour job, you know, being a mother is a 24 hour job you know that's that's any amount of money could you know pay for it.

434
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:39.390
Erika Romero: And then on top of that I'm raising her daughter. So, you know, I've already done that did that. My kids are all grown, you know, and they're out

435
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.430
Erika Romero: You know, so

436
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:49.680
Erika Romero: For her to say that it was I just was like he boy you got that whole thing completely backwards.

437
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:57.990
Erika Romero: Such what you're right, it's a 24 hour it a seven day a week job. It never ends.

438
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.130
Erika Romero: You don't

439
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.180
Erika Romero: Get sick days, you don't get patients, you don't get what

440
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:12.900
Jocelyn Corrales: What will happen to the house. If you're not working, you know, if you're not cleaning the house. If you're not doing the garden, you know, if you're not cooking. What will your husband is, you know,

441
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.100
Uh huh.

442
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:32.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes. When he comes home you know he knows he has a wife that cook for him. Yes, he has a clean house you know he has a clean sheets, because it's newly clean, you know, nice clothes, you know, because everything in the house is being managed

443
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.650
Jocelyn Corrales: By right that's

444
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.760
Erika Romero: Right, yeah.

445
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.050
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

446
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:48.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, because you know some people doesn't think much about, you know, when you say, Oh, you're just a housewife, you know, but actually I know that's not something to

447
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:58.830
Jocelyn Corrales: It's it's supposed to be something that you should brag about, you know, because you do all the things it's like you manage your home. You know, you know, who would manage the home.

448
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.130
Erika Romero: And you don't get paid for it. That's the thing.

449
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:04.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

450
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.010
Erika Romero: You get, you get no pay and a whole lot attitude.

451
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.360
Jocelyn Corrales: As long as your husband is giving you money. That's fine.

452
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:19.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Who does the budgeting at home, you do the budgeting at home or is it your husband doing the managing of the

453
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.200
Erika Romero: Phoenix why we do it together.

454
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.760
Erika Romero: We do it together.

455
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:40.650
Erika Romero: There isn't anything that he does that. I don't know about. And there isn't anything that I do that he doesn't know about. So we manage our bills. Together we pay for them together and um yeah so that's a joint effort.

456
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.450
Jocelyn Corrales: It shouldn't be like that.

457
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:54.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Like that. Yeah.

458
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:09.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I'll just put in later. What's not working out for you because you know you've already mentioned to me what's working out for you and what's not working out for you and

459
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:18.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Could you also say that, you know, by cartel has been helpful for you. Your therapies in your medications would break your head. Has it been

460
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:19.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Very helpful for you.

461
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.770
Erika Romero: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

462
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.490
Jocelyn Corrales: And let's go back to the plan.

463
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:49.200
Jocelyn Corrales: I have nothing wrong. I know there's nothing wrong with you waking up early. I think let's continue on with that.

464
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe just your granddaughter just booked her on a routine.

465
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.640
Erika Romero: Yeah, just trying to yeah trying to establish that

466
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:01.050
Yes.

467
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:56.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so for the meal times you will try, but you will love promise. That's fine. I'm okay. I'm good with that.

468
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:03.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Just make sure that you eat, you know, although you eat on a lesser

469
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:11.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Frequency, but at least eat. You mentioned your you make salad. So I think that's a healthy meal.

470
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.940
Erika Romero: Yeah, oh yeah, we eat a lot of healthy food.

471
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.110
Erika Romero: Yeah, we're not, we don't eat a whole lot of junk food and

472
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.130
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

473
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.590
Erika Romero: And we try to stay try to stay away from all that stuff. That's good.

474
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, and she likes tomato.

475
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Wow.

476
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:14.610
Erika Romero: That's good, that's good.

477
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:19.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you have a vegetable garden know

478
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.510
Jocelyn Corrales: You could try planting tomatoes in your, you know, in a pop

479
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Up. Yeah.

480
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:29.250
Erika Romero: Because

481
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:41.400
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you've mentioned, although you know it's very hard to plan actually on the ground because you mentioned, there's a lot of grew go for us out there, but you could do some, you know, instead of planting on the ground.

482
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Just buy some big box and you know you could do some gardening on the box.

483
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.190
Jocelyn Corrales: That way to go first to get that tool in the box.

484
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.170
Erika Romero: I would love to have

485
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:30.270
Erika Romero: For the last four years that we've lived here to plant flowers and they just, it doesn't do well.

486
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:44.610
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good. Yes, you could plant some flowers. And you could also plant some vegetables, you know, the CC mentioned, I

487
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.240
Like

488
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:47.580
Jocelyn Corrales: You could

489
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.240
Erika Romero: Let some

490
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.240
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and I could check on your house, your garden.

491
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.950
House your vegetable garden.

492
00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:02.250
Jocelyn Corrales: I also think I get yours. Yes. Why not okay so activities of daily living.

493
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:17.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Mentioned that a inquiry, she to do a daily exercise and stretching exercise and do some basic yogis, you mentioned that you're having difficulty sleeping. Yeah, maybe because you've been sleeping sometimes will be a longer time.

494
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:34.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Than the usual for enough time yeah oh yeah but for the kids. It's okay for them to take a nap at the longer duration or time in the afternoon, but for iOS, maybe try to limit it on about 30 minutes or an hour so that you will be

495
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Able to sell critically and

496
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:48.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Limit nap time to up up to about 30 minutes to one hour.

497
00:52:49.980 --> 00:53:05.850
Jocelyn Corrales: And before going to bed, probably you could do some stretching exercise, you know, you do exercise in the morning, maybe before your granddaughter wakes up stretching and you know some yoga and before you go to bed.

498
00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:07.140
Jocelyn Corrales: So you would

499
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:13.260
Jocelyn Corrales: You know why before going to bed because you know so that you would feel tired and sleepy after that.

500
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.090
Erika Romero: And relaxed, I imagine.

501
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:27.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you know, every time I've tried exercising, you know, I started with about 10 minutes a day then gradually 15 minutes then 20 minutes than 25 minutes and 30 minutes

502
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:35.040
Jocelyn Corrales: I always feel every time after I do some exercise and some yoga I you know I feel tired. Sometimes I'm able to sleep on the map.

503
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Because

504
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:44.280
Jocelyn Corrales: If you, if you, it feels, you know, you would feel tired and at the same time, relax.

505
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.720
Jocelyn Corrales: After right

506
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.920
Erika Romero: Okay, I will try it for you. Jocelyn. Okay.

507
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, no worries.

508
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:57.810
Jocelyn Corrales: There's no harm in trying. If, let's see if it works out for you. But if not, you know, you could always change it.

509
00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.160
Okay.

510
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.640
Jocelyn Corrales: And I think you're doing good. We go relaxation techniques, you know,

511
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.690
Erika Romero: Yeah, I

512
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.110
Know,

513
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:20.970
Erika Romero: Yeah, that's a, it's a must for me I've, like I said, that's something I've learned over the years that for me that's that's the only way that I can.

514
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:25.110
Erika Romero: I can manage with whatever's going on.

515
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.000
Erika Romero: Just separate myself.

516
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:41.850
Erika Romero: And that's one thing with my daughter's that she's one of those people who wants to deal with every situation right now, right now, right now, and that's not me. You know, I can't, I can't do it. I have to be able to separate from people

517
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.300
Erika Romero: Because it doesn't work. It doesn't

518
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:49.140
Jocelyn Corrales: It doesn't do you like reading also reading books.

519
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.870
Erika Romero: I'm, I'm not much of a reader.

520
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.560
Um,

521
00:54:53.610 --> 00:55:04.470
Erika Romero: Yeah. I, for me, I'm relaxation. When I get the opportunity. I like to do crafts and and and i crochet

522
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.700
Erika Romero: When stuff like that. So that's my, that's my meditation.

523
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:10.440
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

524
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:13.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing graphs.

525
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:15.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Like what

526
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.150
Erika Romero: I'm

527
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:27.120
Erika Romero: I like to make things not too long ago I took a mirror and completely transformed it

528
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.880
Erika Romero: I have also

529
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:46.680
Erika Romero: The idea, do all kinds of stuff. So I mean it's not some not one thing. Specifically, I have a whole bunch of different crafts that I do. So, um, but mostly it's just

530
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.930
Erika Romero: Making stuff.

531
00:55:52.440 --> 00:56:00.540
Erika Romero: And I used to draw, but I don't really have that that time anymore. I think for me, drawing really takes up a whole lot of time.

532
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:04.260
Erika Romero: And and i have to be in a mood to do it and

533
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.720
Erika Romero: You know, it's, I'm not one of those people

534
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.710
Jocelyn Corrales: That's to

535
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:46.380
Jocelyn Corrales: You just need to have the mood, you know, yes, that's true, that's true. When in you know i know when artists like that.

536
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:55.770
Jocelyn Corrales: If he is not in the mood, you know, he doesn't want to draw doesn't want to do anything. But once he is on the mood, you know,

537
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Everything's go well.

538
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.370
Erika Romero: Come back to it later.

539
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.020
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know,

540
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:28.530
Jocelyn Corrales: It's difficult to finish it. If you're in a different it's difficult to finish it when you're on a different mood.

541
00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:30.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true.

542
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.310
Jocelyn Corrales: That's true.

543
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:46.230
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe when you do some crafts, or, you know, if you're in a mood. You know, you could actually teach your granddaughter some art. You know when you're doing art. Let her do her media art also

544
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.960
Erika Romero: You know,

545
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.000
Erika Romero: That kind of stuff to

546
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:25.560
Jocelyn Corrales: give her an example so like she's asking, you know, that grab I grab Jamia fish. So you drawing a fish and you tell her. Okay, you draw you draw me a fish. Also, something like that. Let her do the same thing. So look, you know, she

547
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.550
Jocelyn Corrales: She could practice.

548
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.090
Erika Romero: Although she

549
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:38.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, although she's still very little. She's still not able to do it perfectly, but, you know, at least you could make out you know some shapes that also developed her

550
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:40.860
Erika Romero: Mark you

551
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:52.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Know, writing. Yeah, that's true. Although, yeah, although it's not a developer for her age. But, you know, it would help an IED her you know in developing her skills.

552
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.130

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:16.080
Erika Romero: She really tries to stay inside the car in the picture inside

558
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:25.890
Erika Romero: Maybe I have another artist. Oh my god, I don't know. My daughter's really great at drawing and stuff like that, you know, maybe I have another artist.

559
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.620

564
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.370

565
00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:52.890
Erika Romero: Oh yeah, absolutely. Her and I do you know as often as we possibly can. We

Erika Romero: She's completely colored today.

570
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.970
Jocelyn Corrales: It's a good thing. She doesn't think you're her room.

571
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.210
Erika Romero: Not, not yet. You haven't gone

572
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Kids are bound to do that, you know,

573
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you would see the artist and he's like oh there's already a wall graphic there.

574
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:48.930
Erika Romero: Stuff.

575
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Grey is because she might paint dry.

576
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.370
Erika Romero: I know they're all washable crayons.

577
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:05.550
Erika Romero: markers, pencils. It's all possible right now.

578
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.820

Erika Romero: Mm hmm.

582
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:28.230
Jocelyn Corrales: The gravity and yeah I know that's why you know you get to learn to give them or buy them you know washable, so that you know it's just easy to clean.

583
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

584
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:43.170
Jocelyn Corrales: And they get into that. It's an age that you know they they get to do that, you know, there was one time we left our daughter, you know, we just left them somewhere and they saw our pain.

585
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.890
Jocelyn Corrales: And they painted the whole room white

586
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.770
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know, my mom was

587
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:59.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of getting angry. You know, my mom instead of getting angry with at her granddaughter, you know, she laughed it off. She they were all laughing

588
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.530
Jocelyn Corrales: So not

589
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Only the room equally and there's a TV in the

590
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:11.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Living the TV depleted it wiped

591
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:13.890
Erika Romero: Me.

592
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Out, you know, and it was one of the, you know,

593
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.520
Jocelyn Corrales: One of the funny memories that we had

594
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:34.020
Erika Romero: Right, yeah. And that, that that's that's the thing is, those things do turn into great memories, they might be frustrating for a minute or two. They are. They do turn into the lifeboat moments.

595
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:46.290
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, you know I'm making memories. It's, it's, they're both ways of making those members because, you know, it could be something traumatic for the child or it could be something that they could, you know, remember as something funny.

596
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Right, yeah. And my it and we tried to keep it.

597
01:02:50.250 --> 01:03:06.510
Jocelyn Corrales: You know that memory, as you know, yo. You know, you would someplace you would. Oh my god, what happened to them, you know, you could you could burn out like that. But, you know, it turned into a memory for us right now because, you know, instead of getting angry. We, the children, you know,

598
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.240
Jocelyn Corrales: Just make it easy for

599
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.460
Jocelyn Corrales: You to laugh it off, you know,

600
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Nobody could forget that moment right

601
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

602
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:24.960
Jocelyn Corrales: So it wasn't the dramatic and at least it was, it wasn't a traumatic one for them, you know, I tried to keep it in your anger. Yeah.

603
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.600
Jocelyn Corrales: You're making a good memories.

604
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

605
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.260
Erika Romero: So let me share you my screen so

606
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:38.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Let me share you my screen so that he could see the plans that we had. So I have placed in the good, the

607
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.850
Jocelyn Corrales: I could I have place either information about what's working out for you and what's not working out for you.

608
01:03:45.300 --> 01:04:00.120
Jocelyn Corrales: I'll just arrange this later on because I place it all here in one box in everything else. So I'll just put into what's not working well later on. So what they want to show you is the plan. So in the plan. There's nothing wrong with you waking up early.

609
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:11.640
Jocelyn Corrales: You just want to set your granddaughter on a routine waking up early. So you try to prepare her for school this book in there. You know, we can you wake up really there's no problem with that.

610
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:20.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Here we have a problem. But you said you to try, you will have promise anything but you will try. So let's just try to put it so that you could also have a routine.

611
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:28.200
Jocelyn Corrales: mealtime for your granddad especially when she's going to school. It's very difficult sending her to school without anything on her stomach. Try to

612
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to eat.

613
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Tried to eat with her so that she would be encouraged. He also

614
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:43.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's see that if it works out for you or for her. And let's see if it works out when we see each other in 30 days.

615
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.650
Jocelyn Corrales: And routine activities daily exercise and stretching every morning.

616
01:04:50.310 --> 01:05:00.450
Jocelyn Corrales: And we also have a nighttime. So you're going to do it twice a day, once in the morning at least 10 minutes. That's enough 10 minutes to 15 minutes then

617
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:15.660
Jocelyn Corrales: In the evening. The same thing 10 to 15 minutes and routine iOS and limit your lap time about for for your granddaughter, it's okay for her to sleep up two tours or so because she's still a child and she's a growing child.

618
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.280
Erika Romero: But for you, maybe

619
01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:27.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to limit it to 30 minutes to one hour because you will be having a difficulty, you will have a difficulty of sleeping with up at nighttime if you

620
01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Over to oversleep in the afternoon.

621
01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:51.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so plan here because you wanted. You know, you're a question and you haven't been attending church services lately because of the epidemics, not really your fault. So what we're going to do is try to attend online church services.

622
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:59.760
Jocelyn Corrales: And try to dress up as if you're attending the church services and try to inspire other people also or other church members, you know,

623
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:14.190
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay if you do dress up, it's fine, at least try to attend online service, then you mentioned you like to do some graphs crochet and create creating stuff recreating stuffs and making stuff. I think that's a good activity.

624
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:15.150
Yeah.

625
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.520
Jocelyn Corrales: And gardening. I did not put here. Let's put here. I forgot.

626
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:22.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Gardening.

627
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:25.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Do gardening.

628
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:32.940
Jocelyn Corrales: And I think it's a good idea that you mentioned earlier that you want your husband to make you a raised up

629
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:35.910
Jocelyn Corrales: raised bed.

630
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.910
Jocelyn Corrales: For you to plant your flowers and

631
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:45.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Probably plant some vegetables because you love eating salads, maybe plant some potatoes, tomatoes.

632
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:45.870
And, you know,

633
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe your grandmother would be happy when she sees your tomatoes, you know, bearing fruits

634
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:58.110
Jocelyn Corrales: And she could pick it out on her own. When she wants she's you know

635
01:06:58.650 --> 01:06:59.520
Jocelyn Corrales: You ready, right.

636
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Flowers and vegetables and at least, you don't need to go to the market, just to buy vegetables. No.

637
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:14.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Just right by what's you know what's lacking. If you have it available in your garden way that

638
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And before going to bed, tried to do some exercise or yoga before going to sleep.

639
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:35.130
Jocelyn Corrales: To, you know, to tie yourself and to be able to relax your body and also also to prevent you know you mentioned you have some back problems, maybe he could prevent some, you know, some of these back pains or back problems.

640
01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, you would you like some
