Kyle Smith: Okay.

485
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.090
Mary Lay: And said, that's it.

486
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:36.480
Kyle Smith: No three years. That's great. That's really good. So you've been taking again Suboxone for five years and it were you in this. Have you been in the same clinic.

487
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:42.720
Mary Lay: For five years now. I've been taking Suboxone from the clinic for the last probably two years.

488
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.450
Mary Lay: Okay, or before about them off the

489
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:46.770
Mary Lay: Street for about a year.

490
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.950
Kyle Smith: Okay, okay any problems or side effects.

491
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:50.910
No.

492
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:52.830
Mary Lay: No.

493
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.280
Kyle Smith: Okay. All right. Well, um,

494
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:58.620
Kyle Smith: I

495
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:12.810
Kyle Smith: I really think we can help you and I'm glad you've come. I think, I think this is a perfect fit for the situation that we find ourselves in. Now with the code crisis and

496
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:19.170
Kyle Smith: Having you know a lot of folks who don't have access to care and have lost their jobs and

497
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.270
Kyle Smith: You know, run the risk of

498
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.840
Kyle Smith: Having relapse and potentially really

499
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.030
Kyle Smith: Bad things happening.

500
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:27.870
So you

501
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:34.260
Mary Lay: Have a child is happening is in losing your job is that is because a relapse.

502
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.670
Kyle Smith: Yeah.

503
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.530
Mary Lay: It was that about it. Yeah.

504
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:50.370
Kyle Smith: Yeah, it's causing a lot of people, a lot of worry and I know you know even folks who are in treatment, it causes a lot of worry too because they don't know if they're going to be able to get their medicine. And I know that's a big deal.

505
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.210
Mary Lay: Yeah, that

506
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.970
Mary Lay: Was really worried about not getting there. Yeah.

507
00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:04.560
Kyle Smith: Have they haven't done this for a while. I know people get real worked up about that. Well, it sounds like you know you're one of those success stories.

508
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:20.100
Kyle Smith: A ban on on Suboxone and going through medication assisted treatment, which is what we call it am at the combination of the medicine and the counseling is really the gold standard for treating opioid dependency.

509
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:35.160
Kyle Smith: And that's what all of our medical research and literature says right now that if you take medicine and you do some counseling, you've got a very, very, very good chance to stay in treatment and stay alive. And that's why we're doing it.

510
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.970
Now,

511
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:40.950
Mary Lay: Tony said seven and he ain't got on the badge drink that for a while.

512
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.060
Kyle Smith: Yeah, I'm

513
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.480
Mary Lay: Actually a drug counselor now and

514
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.420
Mary Lay: Yeah.

515
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:49.470
Wow.

516
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.850
Mary Lay: Yes, it does. Yeah, yeah.

517
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:59.310
Kyle Smith: Did he get was he did he do MIT did he do Suboxone clinic as well.

518
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.130
Mary Lay: No. No, he didn't. He just quit and

519
00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:02.940
Kyle Smith: A quite

520
00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.030
Mary Lay: A while and went to jail for a few months, and then

521
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.350
Mary Lay: After that, even

522
00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.620
Mary Lay: Though he's doing great. I'm very

523
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.270
Kyle Smith: Good.

524
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:30.750
Kyle Smith: Of course, you know, there are other options out there. I'm obliged to to, you know, to bring those up you know about methadone men and Methadone clinics before you know about abstinence only where you basically cold turkey. Try to try to quit and we know, we know the six

525
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.150
Kyle Smith: Very not very good there.

526
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:43.740
Kyle Smith: And then of course you know 12 step programs are in there somewhere, as well. But as I said I think MIT combining the use of medication and counseling, I think is the best

527
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:55.050
Kyle Smith: Um, let's see you, you know, the effects of the Suboxone the Suboxone is a combination of the two drugs that the buprenorphine and the no locks on

528
00:58:55.890 --> 00:59:11.190
Kyle Smith: The buprenorphine acts like other opiates and goes into your to your body and and binds to those opiate receptors and keep them quiet keeps you from going in into withdrawal keeps you going and having cravings.

529
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:20.370
Kyle Smith: It, it, it's not a great pain medicine, but it's but it prevents the withdrawal and it prevents the cravings.

530
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:24.870
Kyle Smith: And it doesn't doesn't doesn't have the same high or the same effect.

531
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.910
Kyle Smith: As, as some of the other opiates, it's a it's a partial opiate

532
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.320
Mary Lay: Yeah, but it

533
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:32.940
Mary Lay: keeps you alive.

534
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.170
Mary Lay: You got

535
00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:44.010
Kyle Smith: That and that yeah you're right. And of course if you've been you've been taken tablets. You know that they go, you know, they go under your tongue and they dissolve.

536
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:53.520
Kyle Smith: The way that I counsel patients on how to take the medicine is to let it dissolve under the tongue for five minutes and then let it absorb for five minutes.

537
00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:01.080
Kyle Smith: And that's how the medicine gets it goes straight into the bloodstream and has its effect within 30 minutes to an hour.

538
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.690
Kyle Smith: And then

539
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.470
Mary Lay: you tag it like the same time every day to

540
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:14.100
Kyle Smith: You know, I think, ideally, ideally what I tell patients on the first our first visit

541
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:22.050
Kyle Smith: The way that the medication. The way that, so actually meant to be taken is just like you take your Lisinopril once a day.

542
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:35.580
Kyle Smith: The idea is that if you take it once a day, you know, over the course of about, you know, three to five to seven days. If you're someone who's just starting the medicine. Gradually the blood levels build up.

543
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:43.170
Kyle Smith: Until all of the receptors in your body at your all of the opiate receptors that that you've built up are filled and happy.

544
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Kyle Smith: And and if you take it at the same time every day. Your body gets into a cycle and maintains that even blood level of medicine and that's that's obviously, you know,

545
01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.610
Kyle Smith: Some people don't like to do it that way. But that's the way the medication is intended to be used.

546
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.290
Kyle Smith: Um,

547
01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.690
Kyle Smith: What else

548
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:13.680
Kyle Smith: Oh, while I'm thinking about it and I mentioned your Lisinopril. Do you have a primary care doctor

549
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.000
Mary Lay: Yeah, I got a mountain people's actually and

550
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.720
Mary Lay: I lost my insurance. So I just go to this little clinic making dollars.

551
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.780
Mary Lay: Okay, to be wrong. I'll go there.

552
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:31.080
Mary Lay: Okay. They've got my history too so

553
01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.550
Kyle Smith: Okay.

554
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.110
Mary Lay: All right.

555
01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:36.840
Kyle Smith: What's the name of that clinic.

556
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.470
Mary Lay: Is round tables in normal

Kyle Smith: Okay, now people's okay and then what was the name of the of the Suboxone clinic, you were going

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.320
Mary Lay: Oh shoot, I think, was the name of that.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.690
Kyle Smith: Alright, I'm

566
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:24.180
Kyle Smith: Alright, so, so you said you hadn't had any side effects from the Suboxone know nausea no constipation.

567
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.590
Kyle Smith: No headaches.

568
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.760
Kyle Smith: Those are the most common

569
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.470
Kyle Smith: Now,

570
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.060
Mary Lay: When I take them three apps, I get a headache. So the tablets.

571
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:37.410
Kyle Smith: Oh, OK. OK, so the tablets don't give you a headache.

572
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:39.030
Kyle Smith: Okay.

573
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:46.050
Mary Lay: Sometimes like there's Suboxone Milos ticket. Miss damage to my they said that they had a different kind of

574
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.280
Mary Lay: Savvy tech or SMS, that's for pregnant people you know when they

575
01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.930
Kyle Smith: Said, yeah, we usually

576
01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:00.390
Kyle Smith: We usually reserve that for pregnant women. Speaking of which, are you taking any birth control.

577
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.130
Mary Lay: I had a table.

578
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.030
Kyle Smith: At a tubal ligation. Okay. Alright, well, we'll, we'll

579
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:20.280
Kyle Smith: We'll, we'll do it. We were required by law to pregnancy test anyways because because there is a risk of the meloxicam having an effect and negative impact on any

580
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.310
Kyle Smith: Any fetus. Okay.

581
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.940
Mary Lay: That positive I'm Jordan mercy.

582
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.760
Kyle Smith: Immaculate Conception.

583
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:40.770
Kyle Smith: All right, well, I've also got to mention it while we're talking about risk of the medicine. There's rare risk that it would cause an elevation in your liver enzymes.

584
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.720
And there's

585
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:51.090
Kyle Smith: There's a chance that if you try to take other opiates while you're taking the Suboxone have a condition called precipitated withdraw.

586
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:54.420
Kyle Smith: Which is like if you tried to take some Percocet.

587
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.740
Mary Lay: Well done.

588
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.640
Kyle Smith: Yeah, it just and it's real bad at last for weeks and weeks.

589
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.530
Kyle Smith: We don't, we don't want you to take any other opiates while you're taking

590
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.310
Kyle Smith: That's why we asked about the Methadone as well.

591
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.010
Kyle Smith: We also ask that you not use any Ben's those

592
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.540
Mary Lay: Okay, okay.

593
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.540
Kyle Smith: I'm not use any Ben's owes while you're

594
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.550
Kyle Smith: While you're taking Suboxone no alcohol.

595
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.470
Kyle Smith: And no other illegal.

596
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:23.730
Kyle Smith: Drugs. Okay.

597
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.400
Kyle Smith: Right heart health.

598
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.850
Kyle Smith: As part of the medication.

599
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.140
Kyle Smith: assisted treatment.

600
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.290
Kyle Smith: Will get you into a counseling group.

601
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.690
Kyle Smith: Of people who are kind of going through the same thing. And at some point.

602
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.730
Kyle Smith: When we have enough patience to get to get you, together with them. We'll, we'll meet

603
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.130
Kyle Smith: I think it's once a week.

604
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:59.820
Kyle Smith: And and go through some things risk mitigation strategies, trying to prevent relapse. Probably a lot of the things that you've, you've heard before.

605
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.970
Mary Lay: Because you have done some counseling.

606
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:12.150
Kyle Smith: I think it's important to do counseling. I think the medicine helps you feel better. And I think the counseling helps you think about addiction and how to avoid relapse.

607
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.360
Kyle Smith: So,

608
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:25.650
Kyle Smith: What else, um, we do urine drug screens during pregnancy screens. We ask that you have you had any blood work in the last year.

609
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.450
Mary Lay: Yeah, mountain people's

610
01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:38.910
Kyle Smith: Okay, I wonder if we could get in contact with them to get that. So that would save you. That would save you a couple books and

611
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:44.190
Kyle Smith: And if it's got what we need. We can just have them facts that over

612
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.800
Kyle Smith: Would that be okay. Would that be okay with you.

613
01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.050
Mary Lay: Yeah, I think on the morrow and

614
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.090
Mary Lay: I might have

615
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.680
Mary Lay: Sounded released

616
01:05:53.820 --> 01:06:00.420
Kyle Smith: Yeah, you may have to, or the shoot. Yeah. I wonder if there be a way around it.

617
01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:05.940
Kyle Smith: Says he can't. He probably can't go to the clinic his clinic open

618
01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:13.440
Mary Lay: I don't think so. Okay, now that you mention it, I don't know what I was thinking when I said I just go down are satisfied her

619
01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.700
Kyle Smith: Yeah, I know. Well, it's a it's a strange it's a strange time

620
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:18.870
Kyle Smith: For sure.

621
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:29.520
Kyle Smith: Yeah, I'm in the mountain people's clinic. Do they does someone prescribe the Lisinopril there because I looked on your
