00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so if you did break your hand, you would

34
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.820
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Your next step will be what

35
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.830
nathanial kester: Go to the ER and get pills.

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.010
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Pills and what's stopping you from doing that.

37
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.140
nathanial kester: I didn't want to feel pain.

38
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.580

Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I'm glad you did. I'm glad you didn't. And let's see what we can do to

40
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.460
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Address, you know, the withdrawals, the feelings that you may be having

41
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:41.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: The people morphine. That's one of the medicines we thought that the medicine we use here can provide some pain relief that's not why we give it, but we have noticed that people do observe that they have a reduction in pain. Also, okay, many times.

42
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:53.160
nathanial kester: The big reason. The only reason I haven't quit is because of withdrawal. I can't work. I can't talk to my wife, I can't do anything.

43
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.870
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: When you're withdrawals.

44
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.370
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay.

45
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.230
nathanial kester: I feel like they're never going to go away.

46
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.010
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They

47
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.610
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They do.

48
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:16.050
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: From the patients. I've worked with. They do this the buprenorphine has worked very well helping patients deal with the withdrawals and making them feel like that they are themselves and

49
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.190
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They actually find that they feel more like their normal self. They're not chasing a high. It's not the up in the down

50
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.580
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Data that my patients have said they had when they won't hear when it's sent to know. Okay.

51
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.830
nathanial kester: I took like five five milligram hydrocodone

52
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.180
nathanial kester: Doing

53
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.070
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay.

54
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.230
nathanial kester: Like a today.

55
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.570
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Eight a day. Okay. And what we're gonna do, we're gonna talk about your history.

56
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.470
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So I'm gonna get your background history. So we've got a lot of questions and then from there we'll develop a plan.

57
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And what I'll do. I can calm and check in, you can call and check in with me tomorrow if you feel uncomfortable.

58
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:09.540
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And but I usually like to see you at least within 48 hours. I've had some people I've seen in 24 hours so we we walk together and we talked about what's going on and how you're feeling

59
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.330
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: The thing about the people morphine and the the the main name of the drug, you probably hear about us some box on. Have you ever been on Suboxone before

60
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.830
nathanial kester: Now,

61
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.300
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about it before I get your history.

62
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.490
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So it sounds like your appeal of choice was is the hydrocodone right

63
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.580
nathanial kester: Any kind of coding really

64
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.050
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay coding. Okay.

65
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.090
nathanial kester: And then what I bought from the online pharmacy.

66
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:46.200
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, the way it usually works is with the Suboxone when it's in your body, the active ingredients list of people morphine.

67
00:04:46.980 --> 00:05:04.170
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: That hydrocodone is bound to that receptor, the Butte buprenorphine and knock it all off, and you can go into a precipitated withdrawals. So one of the things I need to know before I give you the Suboxone is when was the last time you had hydrocodone

68
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.970
nathanial kester: Three days ago.

69
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.780
nathanial kester: Okay.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.340
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You haven't slept. Okay.

71
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.790
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So I can start you on the start and

72
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.320
nathanial kester: You want

73
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.030

74
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:32.340

522
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.260
nathanial kester: You know the price.

523
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:50.910
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I do not

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.420
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I do not know the price.

Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right.

527
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.400
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I've had several patients that have used the good Rx card.

528
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.990
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And it's been effective.

529
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.000
nathanial kester: Film right

530
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:28.020
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Well, it depends on what's going to be cheaper. When I speak with them. I'll find out what's going to be cheaper. I've had places where the film was cheaper to taps were cheaper.

531
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.910
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So with your

532
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.920
nathanial kester: Your screen view right you put on your tongue.

533
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:36.060

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:55.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Usually I've gone. The, the tablets were cheaper from my experience. Okay. And so two milligrams under your tongue 10 to 15 minutes you can take the second two milligrams under your tongue. An hour later and then two milligrams every two to four hours as needed.

535
00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:57.810
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay.

536
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:20.340
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: What most people say is that when they take it and it's effective. They noticed that the withdrawals and anxiety is like they they can calm themselves down it's starting to start to feel your center coming in. Okay, you start to feel the withdrawals and the shakiness subside. Okay.

537
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:29.550
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And starting off will allow you to basically touch rate yourself up to 60 milligrams a day.

538
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:34.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And what what that does is it allows you to be like okay

539
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:50.580
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I've already taken six milligrams and my withdrawals are really bad. I still cannot sleep. I'm still nauseous. I'm still sick and my restless leg is still really bad is so bad I need another two milligrams. Okay.
