213
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:20.490

Gwenevere Abriel: So like I said, sometimes you and I will accidentally talk over each other. We won't mean to, but there's just this little delay.

221
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.980
TCL A501DL: So just kind of

222
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.620

227
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.710

228
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: When we read your first use of value.

229
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.160

Okay.

245
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.470

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.220
TCL A501DL: Oh no, not that I can think of at the moment.

251
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:59.400

Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You wanted to die.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.860
TCL A501DL: Yeah. Click knives younger. Well, I still do.

TCL A501DL: Maybe once or twice more by slitting my wrists, but it didn't go deep enough because I'm still here.

266
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Did the splitting of the rest result in sutures they needed to be, you know, some

267
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.210
Know,

268
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about this for just a second, how. Um, maybe once or twice. I think we'll let's

Gwenevere Abriel: Which went. Now when you reflect back. Do you think you really wanted to stop living or did you want to just not be in psychological pain anymore.

273
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:50.490
TCL A501DL: It was a little, little bit of both. Because there'd be some nights that I would go deep in my arm. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Yep.

275
