13
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.810
Brian Kern: You know, they didn't even give me a test because they were like,

14
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.750
Brian Kern: It basically said, like if she hasn't you're gonna get it so

15
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.060

25
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:33.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being very aware of their body and the symptoms and different in different ailments. They may be experiencing and wanted to be hyper vigilant to make sure that they don't catch it, for obvious reasons.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.550
Brian Kern: I'm

42
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.800
Brian Kern: Like right now I don't really feel like too anxious, you know, I mean,

43
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.450
Brian Kern: I'm kind of like cuz I was thinking of quitting my job. Anyways, yeah, no, I'm like applying like applying for other jobs.

44
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.920
Brian Kern: And just as I don't really want to work there anymore anyways.

45
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:36.180
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, it is kind of crazy was like everything going on, like, I don't know how to like go about applying for jobs like you're saying, you know, like I watched some videos about the coronavirus and they're saying like

46
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:49.680
Brian Kern: You know, if you can like stay in your house and like stay away from other people until like slow spread out of it. You know, I mean, so it's kind of like a weird time, you know. Yeah.

47
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.250
Yeah, definitely.

48
00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:08.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well in situations like this with the pandemic going on you know the best way to manage your anxiety is try not to watch them as much via social media.

49
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Social media news because it kind of heightened please experience when you're reading it, it's different. Um, and then also think about all the things that you can control.

50
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, so, how you were able to go to the doctor. Once your wife is showing the symptoms doing those things that you can prepare for and control.

51
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:43.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, you know, letting yourself know that everyone else is trying to figure it out. So you're not in a position to be that one to have the solution, right, so any situations where

52
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It may seem discouraging because you don't have all the answers. I mean, the fact is, no one does at this point.

53
00:05:50.970 --> 00:06:05.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So just really they're taking it day by day, you take it day by day and trust your gut. The fact that you were able to speak up and say, I want to compromise my health and be at peace in the decision that you made. It's not going to work.

54
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.150
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, that's how I feel about it. You know, like

55
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.210
Brian Kern: You know, you're kind of waiting on early age. I feel like everything worked out, man. No.

56
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, we're talking a lot about present situations.

57
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you got into the program and you started with group.

58
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:43.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now that you know there's an opportunity confetti. Are there any things that you would want to unpack anything that you would want to process to give you healthier coping skills.

59
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.460
Brian Kern: You mean like what like past so says or

60
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.760
Brian Kern: Or like what we mean like

61
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.290
Yeah.

62
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything from the President that you want coping skills to be able to deal with.

63
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.140
Brian Kern: Yeah, I still have a lot of like

64
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.890
Brian Kern: Kinda like hyper vigilance, from what I got attacked by a machete.

65
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:31.920
Brian Kern: Like that makes me anxious, a lot. Yeah. Yeah, like when I'm walking down the street, you know, I mean, I know it's like a rational, but it's like, you know, create sometimes like something like that might happen again or something.

66
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.620
Brian Kern: You know what I mean, like, really violent

67
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said a little hyper vigilant, how do you

68
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Protect yourself.

69
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.480
Brian Kern: I mean any room I ever walk into any store like anywhere. I always check

70
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.550
Brian Kern: Like you know I always kind of like stand around like look around.

71
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.360
Brian Kern: See how many people are. They're stealing. How many doors are. You know what I mean, like, one of the people play

72
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.500
Brian Kern: What direction they're looking at. And so I'm going to me for like

73
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.150
Brian Kern: You know what I mean.

74
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.890
Brian Kern: And then I everywhere I go by, like, Go work.

75
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.330
Brian Kern: It's just like an unconscious thing that I do, you know,

76
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.230
Brian Kern: Used to carry a knife Barbie.

77
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What made that stop and decided to no longer

78
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unless I'm just going to close my screen.

79
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.540
Brian Kern: Yeah.

80
00:08:50.460 --> 00:09:01.200
Brian Kern: I don't, I don't remember. Actually, I think, honestly, like I just didn't have one anymore because like I went to jail for a long time. And like I was paying

81
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:12.270
Brian Kern: And everything I just didn't have one, you know, it wasn't really like a conscious. I guess it's like when I went to jail you know jail. I was, I was like, really saying

82
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:26.970
Brian Kern: So I got in, you know, I didn't feel threatened in there and all, which is like kind of ironic thing about jail. It was like really safe. You know, I mean those in the drug program in jail. So I kind of got used to like not really having to worry about.

83
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.530
Brian Kern: My surroundings. I wasn't ever vigilant all and

84
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.930
Brian Kern: You know, I got out.

85
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.110
Brian Kern: You know, like started again, you know, I

86
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:48.990
Brian Kern: Don't really anxious and but yeah I guess like like when I stopped caring. It just wasn't a conscious decision, it was just like these, like, I didn't have one

87
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.310
Brian Kern: Ever got one, you know. Yeah.

88
00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Amen situations that you mentioned me. We're also in a controlled environment so

89
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.250
You were

90
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:11.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In prison. So that's a controlled environment. These spaces, but now being out back in the community. That's not a controlled environment.

91
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it makes sense that, that's when the anxiety with people again yes jail is

92
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:30.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely an environment where there may be situations where you kind of are aware of your surroundings, just because the culture and the other people that are in prison, but it's still controlled space.

93
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So over time, you know, and if you develop

94
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:52.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A security there knew that you really didn't bother anybody. It could be this sense of all right I'm secure here, nothing's gonna happen but out in the community and considering how it happened. This was just this wasn't like someone that you knew this was

95
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A stranger. So

96
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.280
Brian Kern: Wow.

97
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When that happened, did you get any therapy afterwards.

98
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.170
Brian Kern: No, no. I mean, they

99
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.920
Brian Kern: Gave me a bunch of bands. I was pretty much, and that was it. Yeah.

100
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.630
Brian Kern: Yes. Oh, yeah.

101
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.630
Brian Kern: Pills pretty much

102
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.850
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, I was in the hospital for a month after that happen. So, or about a month, maybe only three weeks.

103
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.800
Brian Kern: Remember what

104
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're covering right from the injuries.

105
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.320
Brian Kern: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

106
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.140
Brian Kern: And they had like

107
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.140
Brian Kern: I guess it was a second psychiatrists calm and that's when they diagnosed with PTSD.

108
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.930
Brian Kern: You know, that's basically it. You know, I mean, it just fills.

109
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.160
Brian Kern: Out after that.

110
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what environments. Do you feel that you control that you feel safe in

111
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.220
Brian Kern: My home.

112
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.020
That's

113
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.880
Brian Kern: Pretty much.

114
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.430
Brian Kern: I mean, that really is the only

115
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.370
Brian Kern: Only environmentally can control.

116
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.760
How do you know that you see in your home. What is that what the safety feel like for you.

117
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:34.140

118
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:35.880
Brian Kern: You know,

119
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.680

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:11.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the fact that you don't look at the store. What's the self top that you're doing when you're in the store so that the the anxiety, isn't it. This chart doesn't show

146
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.630
Brian Kern: Oh really, you know, I mean, I just

147
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.770
Brian Kern: Like I usually just try to like you know your call. You know, I mean like I just

148
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.290
Brian Kern: You know,

149
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:35.730
Brian Kern: Or sometimes I'll even say, you know, like, I'll tell myself like nothing's gonna happen. Your parents, you know, I mean,

150
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.710
Brian Kern: Yeah.

151
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.330
Brian Kern: Which is true. I can be paranoid a lot, you know,

152
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.070
Brian Kern: There's things like that, you know, I mean I've gotten used to it over the years really

153
00:15:52.950 --> 00:16:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's good is that you want to be able to catch what am I doing well to help manage this enzyme, you know, PTSD. I have very real threats are very real experiences.

154
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:18.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That would make sense for me to be afraid to go out in public, but I'm able to do it. I'm able to function well I'm able to not give up to other people.

155
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:36.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This invite. So there's something that you're doing well itself top is working and I would also invite you to use some different ways to regulate your body and that might be your breathing. Have you ever tried belly breathing.

156
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.510
Brian Kern: Yeah, I've done a lot of the like.

157
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.650
Brian Kern: Mindfulness stuff, you know, like

158
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.390
Brian Kern: They, they taught us in jail. I do a lot of that.

159
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.240
Brian Kern: And even like group. Now, we do a lot of breathing. And sometimes I'll just like

160
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.490
Brian Kern: Breathe. You know,

161
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.950
Brian Kern: I'm never like really

162
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:08.910
Brian Kern: Gotten too much into it. You know, like, I can't, like, it's hard for me to meditate or anything like that because I like my brain is like all over the place.

163
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:19.770
Brian Kern: Yeah. So like most of the time. I don't even try it. My wife meditates a lot. She always like a high speed it. It just can't sit there and

164
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.560
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, like, it's just

165
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.630
Brian Kern: I can't, you know, it's just I can't do it. Yeah, I can like sit there like

166
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.460
Brian Kern: You know,

167
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.330
Brian Kern: I need to

168
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.180
Brian Kern: Do something, you know, I mean,

169
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you're right. She does a lot of the meditation and mindfulness

170
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.100
Brian Kern: Yeah, she does a lot like meditation, yoga. Yoga, like every day, you know,

171
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what what breathing exercise and she taught you.

172
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:06.240
Brian Kern: Like, deep, deep breathing. You know, I also a counselor actually am and then outpatient program I have where we were literally just like take like

173
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.550
Brian Kern: Really deep breaths, kind of like over and over again, you know,

174
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.950
Brian Kern: I also learned this like tapping, it's like really tap your hand.

175
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:28.860
Brian Kern: You know, apparently described is just like tapping and leave no self affirmation type stuff like you

176
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.340
Brian Kern: Know, things like that, though.

177
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.360
Brian Kern: Oh no, I just don't really like

178
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.970
Brian Kern: You know, I guess it's never done anything for any of that.

179
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.540
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, like, it's better for me. Like sometimes like I've been trying to like start working out again.

180
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.420
Brian Kern: And that, that helps you know a lot of times, like just working out.

181
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:08.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So discharging your anxiety through activity you find more useful than the breathing and meditation.

182
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.620
Brian Kern: Yeah, definitely. You know, I mean like

183
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.770
Brian Kern: Doing something pretty much like anything like take my mind off of it, you know.

184
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How often, the

185
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:40.440
Brian Kern: Lately so much. I've been like trying to get back. I used to be, you know, I used to exercise every day. And then I just, you know, didn't room while wink sporadically every now and then and now I'm like trying to get back into it.

186
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.130
Brian Kern: You know, especially because

187
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.940
Brian Kern: I don't have work or anything like that, you know, it's just kind of like other stuff gone away.

188
00:19:52.860 --> 00:20:00.360
Brian Kern: So now I feel like I could exercise more, not I don't have his busy schedule right now, you know,

189
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:10.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What else I want to find out what works for you are what hasn't worked for you in regards to managing

190
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.300
Brian Kern: Play video games that definitely helps.

191
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.100
Brian Kern: You know,

192
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.040
Brian Kern: It's just I can sit there and just

193
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.850
Brian Kern: Play video game. Yeah, I mean,

194
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:25.500
Brian Kern: Like

195
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:34.020
Brian Kern: You know, easily just this do so much either. Like, you know, because remember I told you only try and make a career out of it all.

196
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:45.450
Brian Kern: Of this like upload clips and like trying to stream to people, you know, might have, like, a few people watch. I mean, so, so I can like talk to them, you know,

197
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.630
Brian Kern: Also sometimes writing, writing. Oh.

198
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.450
Brian Kern: I haven't been doing so much that either really like I'll just like how to journal or something.

199
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Beforehand, how often are we doing

200
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.170
Brian Kern: At one point, like every day, you know,

201
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.690
Brian Kern: Now again, not so much really just because

202
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.510
Brian Kern: You know, stop gotten away.

203
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.860
Brian Kern: So really, all my trying to like get back in the old stuff right oh

204
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.630
Brian Kern: Yeah yeah what something from

205
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Putting back into the

206
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.120
Brian Kern: Game back into him.

207
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.180
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, right now, nothing stopping me really

208
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.110
Brian Kern: You know, early should only because

209
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.830
Brian Kern: You know, the only thing I really have a now.

210
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.550
Brian Kern: look for another job really or talk to my boss and 20 hours back

211
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.890
Brian Kern: You know, which not so sure.

212
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.250
Brian Kern: Yeah, oh yeah, just things like that.

213
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.300
Brian Kern: Really know what's what. What we're exploring. You know me, you know,

214
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:16.710
Brian Kern: I'm grateful because like lately, like, you know, other than the hyper vigilance that I have when I leave the house like I haven't really been too anxious at all and driving home.

215
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.060
Brian Kern: really anxious or anything. You know, I mean,

216
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.940
Brian Kern: You know, I spent a lot of time, you know, so it's like

217
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.010
Brian Kern: You know, right now, when not in a really a access

218
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.810
Brian Kern: Versus good

219
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.600
Brian Kern: Yeah yeah

220
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.330
So,

221
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How confident. Do you feel with your sobriety.

222
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.540
Brian Kern: Right now I feel like really confident you know i mean like

223
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.510
Brian Kern: I've been just, you know, like, I don't have any cravings or anything.

224
00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:01.110
Brian Kern: The dose that on like really helps you know it's easy. I just take one in the morning.

225
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.110
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, it helps a lot.

226
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:13.020
Brian Kern: You know I say that, like, I try to stay away from anyone that's using which is like why like I put my job.

227
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.530
Brian Kern: Because a guy that's spreading on the bathroom.

228
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:24.030
Brian Kern: You know, but I just I stay away from, like, every time he comes in, you know, I just, I leave you know

229
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:32.940
Brian Kern: My boss gets pissed. But I told him and work with this guy because he was the one that I was getting the pros. You know, I really

230
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.000
Brian Kern: Yeah, so

231
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.950
Brian Kern: And I told that you know I told like my boss is everything happened.

232
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.530
Brian Kern: And

233
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.490
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, they, they don't really care. I mean,

234
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.420
Brian Kern: Like they know that he sold me heroin.

235
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:54.810
Brian Kern: I mean,

236
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.600
Brian Kern: Those kind of like, like I feel like it's a toxin and like

237
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.100
Brian Kern: Like hostile work environment. I guess you know i mean

238
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:16.440
Brian Kern: Like my boss asked me, you know, I mean like I just really just hate working, you know, I am like really anxious to work, honestly.

239
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.420
Brian Kern: You know, because it's like is Duke and coming back. There was no fat, no.

240
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:28.920
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, also, like, he'll like because he, I think I'm pretty sure he knows that I told my boss is everything like

241
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.040
Brian Kern: Like he's kind of like, whoa, like say something really smart ass comments, you know, I mean,

242
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.700
Brian Kern: And, you know, like, holy

243
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.960
Brian Kern: I don't know, just kind of talk shit, you know, I mean,

244
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.950
Brian Kern: Like, honestly, the other day I want to kick his ass.

245
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.600
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, it's like you just

246
00:24:52.860 --> 00:25:01.290
Brian Kern: I want to, I want to kick his ass for him first. It was like like really like the main reason I don't work with them because I don't want to be around somebody

247
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:11.130
Brian Kern: Same time also don't want to be around because I realized I really don't like the only other, you know, I mean, so it's like

248
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.940
Brian Kern: Now it just is toxic work environment.

249
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What stopped you from going to the next level and fighting

250
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what was that restraint restraint.

251
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:46.350
Brian Kern: Oh, you know, like usually him. You know, I like I kind of pitch. But then it's like really like I always like talk right like I try to talk myself through like what would happen. So like, let's say I like punch in the face. You know what I mean.

252
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:59.250
Brian Kern: Like the next logical thing that would happen is my boss or somebody calls county jail and I'm on probation. So it's like really like it's easy for me to stop myself from

253
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:09.690
Brian Kern: You know, is easiest on myself and yourself like that, you know, I mean, yeah, like, especially now that I'm so if I wasn't so I probably

254
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.950
Brian Kern: Probably want to try to fight it. Honestly, you know, but now it's like I've learned, like, over the years, I've learned

255
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.230
Brian Kern: The attorney.

256
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:30.000
Brian Kern: Playing a tape forward. That's what they call the plane to take forward, you know, just kind of like talking myself through everything that happened is like the same with like

257
00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:37.410
Brian Kern: Like using heroin, like let's say I use heroin. You know, it would be like the next thing would be

258
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:57.120
Brian Kern: Maybe I'd use one more time. You know, I mean, and then I go to jail. You know, it's like the same thing. And that's, like, another reason why I'm so confident my sobriety. Because like I really, you know, I mean, I hate to spend a lot of time and do it so

259
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:06.360
Brian Kern: As you know, another thing. Like I use again like you know my wife would definitely leave me this question.

260
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.950
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, we get worse. And that's, that's not worth the heroines not worth anything that should

261
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:25.800
Brian Kern: It's not worth going to jail, not worth my marriage, possibly dying, you know, cuz I'm overdose, like a lot of time. So it's like

262
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.290
Brian Kern: You know my luck has to run out at some point, you know,

263
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.810
Brian Kern: Yeah, there's just no it's worth it, you know.

264
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:42.720
Brian Kern: Like it's very like easy like now like you know now please Like he

265
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.160
Brian Kern: taught myself to do that when I'm not or like

266
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.610
Brian Kern: In like realize it's not easy.

267
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.680
Brian Kern: I mean,

268
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.490
Yeah.

269
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely, because

270
00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You you found out the consequences, and it seems that you're in a stable place in your recovery because you said that you have relaxing. And so the

271
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:29.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The brain always talk about the diversity several brain. The brain took over most there was a constant goal if there was a red, yellow and green light. It was always on way but now you're processing, you're, you're being able to decipher when the adequate is speaking when the sober brains.

272
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:38.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm curious to know, is good because you put that boundary in place that would that co worker when he comes that access right there.

273
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:53.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you probably already determine when he's here there's going to be a battle to my brain and my silver brain and need to move the trigger, so that there is no battle on my sobering.

274
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good skill that you put into place.

275
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.040
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean,

276
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.070
Brian Kern: Yes, that was like the whole reason I told my boss and I couldn't work with them, you know,

277
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:18.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what what spiral ditching to begin with, where there are certain emotional triggers situation triggers.

278
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.150
Brian Kern: When I first started using

279
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it

280
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: gets worse.

281
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.020
Brian Kern: When I was in my worst

282
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:39.090
Brian Kern: May have been so many times and I was at my worst, you know, I mean, it's hard to really tell you know

283
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The underlying themes in your addiction. What were the triggers.

284
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.030
Brian Kern: Most of the time being said, pretty much.

285
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:57.930
Brian Kern: As as like the he doesn't always a huge one like whenever I started using like it. First is fun. Hi.

286
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:09.870
Brian Kern: Then after like a couple weeks. I'm just using constantly because I'm getting sick. That's it. That's, like, all I can think about, you know, I mean this is getting well you know

287
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:22.890
Brian Kern: Like, oh, I guess. So quick fine like develop a habit, you know, I mean, that's just it's over. From there, you know, I mean, if I have a heaven like stop, you know, until

288
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:29.700
Brian Kern: I got locked up pretty much, you know, I mean, there's like no other.

289
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:37.740
Brian Kern: Outcome, you know, unless I like somehow make it a treat. You know, yes. Happily times

290
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:39.150
But

291
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.720
Brian Kern: I mean other than the ghost like when I first started using is because

292
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.230
Brian Kern: Well, I mean, the first time I use like somebody offered it to me and I say yes.

293
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:59.970
Brian Kern: I was going through a lot with my mom being sick and like really deal with it. So that's why I was doing like drones.

294
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:10.320
Brian Kern: You know, so I guess there was that, and then when I used I started using a lot after my brother died too.

295
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.580
Brian Kern: So I guess like underlying emotional triggers is just like

296
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.990
Brian Kern: being depressed about stuff that I can't control.

297
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.850
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

298
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.470
Brian Kern: Like the

299
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:35.340
Brian Kern: Shitty stuff to happen is, you know, I used a lot too. Because like my PTSD is like so hard to handle some points.

300
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.550
Brian Kern: I use a lot of added, you know,

301
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.990
Brian Kern: So I guess I just use a lot because I didn't yield. Sure.

302
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:47.610
Brian Kern: Yeah.

303
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So was the emotional, you know, the emotion. And so with that,

304
00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:04.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's usually like a red flag thought. Right. And then there's a justification thought that follows up. So when the emotion, you know, with your mom going on.

305
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:15.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that red flag. See that that initial thought that kind of activates the addictive brain to say you

306
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.210
Brian Kern: Know, I mean, there's a lot of time for literally I'd like

307
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:37.650
Brian Kern: Go visit her in the hospital. Watch really slowly dying shit, that was that was horizontally us a lot because of that.

308
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.370
Brian Kern: I don't know if I can identify like a red

309
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.660
Brian Kern: Red flags, you know, I mean, it's just

310
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:54.090
Brian Kern: There's not really much thinking that goes into it, really, you know, it's just that's that's going

311
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To happen you know

312
00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:56.640
Yeah.

313
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:02.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then that's also the source of the problem, too. But there's no

314
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not the processing of what got you to that point.

315
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:16.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, because I'm reading and say your wife found out about the program, little more than a month ago.

316
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When what brought you to the program. You said your wife found out about you have to realize

317
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About a month ago, could you couldn't get your PTSD.

318
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:33.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then your wife found out about this program. So this sobriety is still relatively new.

319
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:41.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For you and considering the relax from different emotional triggers and so

320
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:52.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Often people will think that, well, we just want to do this. I did it. And there really is no rhyme or reason fill in a way for some had it and do it.

321
00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:06.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so as we continue to dig you'll start seeing that really there are some recurring theme. There are some self top of some justification that you tell yourself before you use because

322
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:21.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anyone that has been in treatment relapse finished treatment relapse, is it is a desire to be sober. And so the bow is between the mind and the soul, mind.

323
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:30.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There are some addicts that have not sat out treatment because there is no battle. They have not contemplated where they have no awareness that they are an addict.

324
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:45.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or if it could care less. And they don't want to improve their lifestyle but with you there is that battle, there is that awareness but there isn't enough insight to figure out what needs me to that relapse.

325
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:54.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because firstly sparkling eyes I ever laughs It's not just to relax. You know, it's that initial thought that planted.

326
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:57.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

327
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then is the next step.

328
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:14.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then after you relapse, like you said, you take it because of the emotional distress, whatever it is you're going through and then afterwards the relapse begins, because now you're trying to avoid the withdrawals.

329
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.050
Brian Kern: Yeah.

330
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:31.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if you backed up. If we wanted this movie right there wouldn't be a need to avoid the withdrawal symptoms if it wasn't the last to be killed. So in going back to those scenes. What was that first thing

331
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That happened to me to the next event.

332
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.640
Brian Kern: The first. I mean, it was really like I felt it wasn't really like a thing.

333
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:59.040
Brian Kern: Like, like a, like I physically felt really bad. You know, I mean, like, it was like almost like my anxiety was like making me sick. You know, I mean like I was so anxious because like I

334
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.980
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, I have like any

335
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:16.800
Brian Kern: Like medications that I take, you know, I mean, like any of that. So I like I was so anxious to visit I don't physically sick, you know, like this. Not like withdrawing or anything like that.

336
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:24.270
Brian Kern: I wasn't sleeping for days at a time like I wasn't eating or anything.

337
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.490
Brian Kern: Like I just felt really terrible and time no one

338
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.130
Brian Kern: And like it wasn't like

339
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.210
Brian Kern: Is it's like, I don't know. It's like my

340
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:45.690
Brian Kern: Thing things I just been sick, like, the best way to describe it. You know, I mean like I just

341
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.560
Brian Kern: This kind of like went off the rails, you know,

342
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:57.180
Brian Kern: I can't really like remember eight like emotional stuff that was going on, like, oh, it

343
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:09.420
Brian Kern: Wasn't like it was like it was just like, it's like the best way to describe it. You know, I mean, I was very, very jittery all the time, shaking

344
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.150
Brian Kern: Stuff and like, so I thought like, you know,

345
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.850
Brian Kern: If I use like I'll feel better. You know what I mean, like, I wouldn't feel better.

346
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:27.030
Brian Kern: Afterwards, and I'm feeling worse. Pretty much that's happened.

347
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To me that

348
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:47.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Addiction is more addiction relapse is more regarding physiological symptoms or do you think there are some emotional triggers that lead to relapse.

349
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.660
Brian Kern: Mean, I've had

350
00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:10.650
Brian Kern: Both you know cuz I relapse. A lot of times, and like feeling most the time, it was like about emotional stuff, pretty much, you know, I mean, really, this was the only time where it felt like it was like physiological just like I was shaking

351
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, but like most other times I realized is like

352
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:24.810
Brian Kern: Either just emotional stuff or maybe like Alice surround the wrong person to, you know, I've had a relapse is where

353
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:31.800
Brian Kern: I was just around the wrong person. Pretty much you know i mean like Eric, they were getting high.

354
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.080
Brian Kern: And then just leads to me. I, you know, yeah.

355
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.110
Brian Kern: Right, yeah, I have to say that most of my feelings.

356
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And earlier you mentioned the best way that you process your anxiety is through distraction.

357
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:54.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Video game.

358
00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:01.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You mentioned exercise. He said journaling, but you haven't done it often

359
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:12.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is buying aware of his emotional responses or is buying emotionally detached.

360
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What makes you unsure if the way I worried. The question or something that you've never even thought of.

361
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.520
Brian Kern: as it sounds. I never even thought really

362
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:34.080
Brian Kern: Yeah.

363
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:45.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I want to give you an assessment right when I see you were engaged in this session, I still feel a wall.

364
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I still feel some disconnect

365
00:39:51.600 --> 00:40:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what I'm feeling I believe is the emotional detachment that you have had to experience over the course of your life.

366
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Over the different traumatic experiences, your protection has been avoidance separation.

367
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now just attachment

368
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's

369
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:33.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Different because you're engaged familiar paying attention, but it's still not something, there's something that I should be hearing, there's something that I'm not kidding right now that I need to dig deeper. Like, that's what I'm getting

370
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that a safe assessment is what I'm feeling right now.

371
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.470
Brian Kern: Yeah, probably. Yeah, I think so.

372
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.300
Brian Kern: Make sense

373
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's it like with in your relationship with your wife.

374
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.040
Brian Kern: I mean, we're really close, you know,

375
00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.700
Brian Kern: I can tell her like anything, pretty much.

376
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.230
Brian Kern: Yeah.

377
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.830
Brian Kern: You know we like never fight or anything like that really

378
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:21.180
Brian Kern: You know, like, I don't know if we have like a perfect marriage, like we do here like really good buried. You know, I mean, we don't get mad at each other for anything. You know, we've known each other since we were kids.

379
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.790
Brian Kern: You know, so

380
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.960
Brian Kern: She like understands me. You know, she knows it's like why

381
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.060
Brian Kern: Where I am

382
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:39.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so is this a personality characteristic, are you more like kind of leave that personality like describe that personality.

383
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.280
Brian Kern: Yeah, Sam pretty laid back

384
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.110
Brian Kern: People think I'm fine, you know,

385
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think you funny.

386
00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.490
Brian Kern: Yeah, me, I have no sense of humor.

387
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A straight face.

388
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.380
Brian Kern: Yeah, so

389
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whichever humor. Like, is it more like sarcasm is it like waiting is what, what's your humor like

390
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.860
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty weighty, you know,

391
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:22.950
Brian Kern: Now I can like somebody like you know making fun of me. I can come back really quick. You know, something like that.

392
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:24.810
Brian Kern: Oh,

393
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.290
Brian Kern: This

394
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.170
Brian Kern: Is like that yeah I do enjoy like watch a lot of comedy stuff so

395
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.290
Brian Kern: I don't know makes people think of playing way back pretty much have

396
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A great personality characteristics.

397
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not easy to be considered a funny person and someone comes at you funny that

398
00:42:49.560 --> 00:43:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's good to be tend to want to be around people that have a good sense of humor, because in stressful situations in situations where there's anger, you know, you can go through this person, they can kind of help you to release whenever tension that you may be feeling

399
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.730
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, I do have like a couple friends that have

400
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.410
Brian Kern: Always come and talk to me when they're like having something going on.

401
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:20.820
Brian Kern: Now,

402
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:23.730
Brian Kern: So,

403
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.510
Brian Kern: Yeah.

404
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:50.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, that's fair enough, that gives me a little more perspective about your personality and people come to you as a source of support. Do you consider yourself to be someone that when there's issues or windisch troubles that you

405
00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:00.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Talk about what those concerns may be do you give it time are you Wendy easily express anger or emotion.

406
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:10.950
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, if there's like something like an issue or something, usually like there's an issue with my wife, we will talk about in a great way. I mean,

407
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.400
Brian Kern: I don't mind.

408
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.150
Brian Kern: Telling people when I think something's like

409
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.140
Brian Kern: Our Lady. I don't like

410
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:23.520
Brian Kern: Oh,

411
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.870
Like with your boss.

412
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:32.250
Brian Kern: Yeah, you know, like with him like he takes care of early either, you know, I

413
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:41.910
Brian Kern: Know this is like I wasn't like you want to relapse. I was freaked out about them and telling them what happened or a

414
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.700
Brian Kern: Mystical word

415
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.260
Brian Kern: So,

416
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.220
Brian Kern: You know, yeah, for the most part, I don't mind like

417
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, the next time we meet, we can be two weeks from now. Well, I

418
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Didn't want to

419
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:12.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Discuss. I always say that there's different boxes. We can unpack while and fear they could be small boxes and we can build up to big boxes are the boxes, meaning like

420
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:21.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The harsh trauma that you experienced and wanting to really talk about it and some people say, I don't really need to unpack the big boxes.

421
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:33.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to unpack the smaller boxes because I'm packing a big boxes, really won't help me with my trauma and all but unpacking the smaller boxes might be a little more helpful for me.

422
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How would you like to tap into their

423
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.200
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean,

424
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.150
