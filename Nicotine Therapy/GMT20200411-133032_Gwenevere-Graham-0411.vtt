00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost there.

2
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

3
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.900
Nick Graham: Good morning. How are you

4
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

5
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: A little hurry. So can I kind of slow my energy down a little.

6
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Well, I'm glad you made it here. Looks like we're in the car getting caffeinated or tea or something kind of a nice morning ritual.

7
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: hopelessly addicted to that one. Yeah, so, um,

8
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, the withdrawal from caffeine is three days of a headache. I think we can all just sort of agree that you can decide to do it whenever you want to or not.

9
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I had imagined that today was going to be about picking a target and sort of having, having some MTR today. I didn't know if you had already sort of set up or you already had an idea of what you wanted from today that was different.

10
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:53.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, I haven't figured out like specifics like but yeah i mean i think i don't really know exactly what to go into

11
00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, that's, that's my job. You don't have to. You just gotta pay attention to you. So let me open up a note and we'll, we'll pick a target.

12
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

13
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have to to coffee cups or some coke cans up there that we just heard about if that's enough movement. I think that's fine.

14
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It is maybe half inch apart, maybe even a little bit more part might get a little bit more, but I don't want to hurt your eyes and also when you do it if you're going to be sitting back then they would want to be wider so

15
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to want you to feel comfortable very sort of present in not having to strain, but really tuning.

16
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of inward, not having a whole spine up. So what do we got nope nope nope

17
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting at 730 I'll take a look at some

18
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have here.

19
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A nice way to start is to sort of say, well, where we asked, Where are you at, in other words, you know when your mind goes to just dropped stress. Does it seem to

20
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to things that are triggered in present day. And it's sort of, I'm overwhelmed with this. Well now it's this and it's happening right now. This person says this, I feel that. Look at this, look at this and they're very present as if they're these triggers that are happening present time.

21
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we might call them stressors.

22
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is this preoccupation maybe or this this mind does it wander into the what ifs of the future. Is it preoccupied with

23
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Distress into the future. Well,

24
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.130
Nick Graham: You're like, oh, like for example, I guess rooms are pretty stressful day because I like tonight I'm losing my job, mostly I'm getting like furloughed

25
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.450
Okay.

26
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:37.320
Nick Graham: I was like stress in like a lot of the day, but I didn't. It's like I'm not having specific thoughts of like what if this goes bad, like, but I would probably agree that, like, like it's mostly in the future. Okay.

27
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go.

28
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.600
Nick Graham: But I don't have like whole thoughts of the future. I have like

29
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.440
Fleeting ideas of what the future might look like. And then like this stress that I can't place. It's always like a

30
00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a, like a feeling I can't really place every go that's the one I think because this one this for low as horrifically inconvenient. This is an I am blessed to be able to call it just an inconvenience. And I know I'm privileged to say that because my life wasn't disrupted, very much.

31
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that it won't change.

32
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's really good. And I'm bracing myself, but I know it, it will pass

33
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to be where I meet my strengths or whether I sort of collapse into it. And so I know my clients like you two are going through this

34
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're all in it, you're, you're going through something I am to it from the same. It's the same topic. It's amazing. It's this whole global crisis. So there's a stress. I can't place.

35
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That one has my curiosity.

36
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And

37
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm suspecting that

38
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Existed before this for low now it's been sort of there.

39
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:05.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, that's like why I can't wedding fly into rage. And I fly into it because it's like almost like

40
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.160
I don't quite know what like I never, I never really like

41
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know. That's what we're up to. You just your job number one. Just to review can't do it wrong, it's impossible for you to do any of this wrong.

42
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The job for you is just as attuned as you possibly can be, not to the big sweeping experiences.

43
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are fine and good, and I care about those. And I want to know about them. But if we can catch the subtler ones, the progressive ones, the ones where

44
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice a movement, a slight movement or you notice you want to adjust something even in a even in a shoulder and it may seem really silly.

45
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.780
Nick Graham: Yeah.

46
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see them. Yeah, you're, you're kind of doing something with you right now. Yeah.

47
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.320
Nick Graham: Yeah, and it like it actually has caused me to have like a

48
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Good questions to you know some some weird name, but okay so much like

49
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.320
Nick Graham: It would happen like usually when I would

50
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:25.530
Nick Graham: Well, it would have been usually like when I would like us or stressed or play like sometimes when I like play video games. I would like just do this a whole lot

51
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.180
Like

52
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so are there any more of those movements that if we sort of scan the body and we said that there might be more just sort of work through. Let's see what the body is trying to suit itself. Tell me, for sure. Okay face. But what specifically, you've got a whole face their

53
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Nose.

54
00:07:51.810 --> 00:08:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it like an ice when I squint okay yeah I remember a conversation with your brother around that one. Yeah, it's terrific. Okay, and what's that one the mouse. What do we call that one.

55
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.850
I don't even know. Like a

56
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a mouth stretch, almost. Okay, that's fine. I'll stretch

57
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time I saw some jaw horizontal. Now there was that additional and going on. Are you aware that one at all. Um,

58
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There's like there's maybe like know if the job was doing it on its own. It was, it was also doing something. Okay, maybe, maybe it's

59
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not. Okay. Okay. Come on in here that are any, any kind of things going on sort of learning experience kind of space. The voice to think they used to be something but not not not for a long time, like used to be like a

60
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:56.910
Like a

61
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Long, long time ago, and it would come like after a sentence.

62
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'd have to make that noise. Yeah.

63
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about in in in the neck and shoulders. Anything in there.

64
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.110
Nick Graham: Though, just like always, there's always been like tension in there. So I would like do this, but

65
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just because like my

66
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.890
Nick Graham: I feel like I got a neck and dream like sixth grade that was never diagnosed

67
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.910
Okay.

68
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about shoulders back, arms, any kind of, you know, needing to kind of repeatedly sort of adjust and subtle suit itself. OKAY. AND DOWN THE ARMS AND YOU FLEXING anything going on.

69
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.190
Nick Graham: Sometimes like a

70
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.820
Trying to think like a

71
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.850
Nick Graham: Baby like a bicep flex

72
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.800
But not, I guess I never really thought of that one as

73
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we don't have to go too far into it. I'm just gonna put a little note here and just gives me someplace else to explore because I am not.

74
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to see all of it you know you you might have been sort of more of a observer and I might have caught it, too. But I'm stuck with you haven't to tell me

75
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is they have some benefits, too, because then you have this dual awareness that I can name it, and it's going on. And so there's some some good things that can come from it. So it's not all bad.

76
00:10:54.030 --> 00:11:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about in I already know about the right thumb. Is there anything even down into forearm breast. Anything else that that's going on. No, nothing else. Okay.

77
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything in like stomach sort of breath now getting a little bit more visceral anything sort of in that lower part the sphincter, you know, maybe clenching or anything kind of going on in there. Anything that sort of is this bracing experience of that size. Sighs knees calves, Pete.

78
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. So we've got some we've got some stuff here. So, possibly fixing. Got it.

79
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

80
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's a sense of a long enduring

81
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A stress. I can't place.

82
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And some

83
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of connection. Although unnamed to this.

84
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: flying into rage. There's some although you may not know this stuff in between. You said those pretty close proximity to each other when when you were sharing under rage or like becoming frantic or overwhelmed. Like, it all comes up like something I

85
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:28.860
Nick Graham: Mean I guess like I can place like the route, but then I could be my way through, like, Oh, well, it's gonna be fine. I have like, you know, either family to say store unemployment and things like that. But then there's something else like that that's there.

86
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.850
Okay.

87
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we said rage overwhelmed said frantic so rage. That's your anger frantic to your fear. Tell me more about what other words synonyms, maybe for overwhelmed. What's that one.

88
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.840
Yeah, I would probably

89
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.540
Put overwhelmed and fear. I think

90
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.320
I think that that's like how I how I see that

91
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.540
Or maybe

92
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.340
Nick Graham: preoccupy your double

93
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.780
Nick Graham: It's like, usually the what comes with it. Okay.

94
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress. I can't place.

95
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's this going into rage. There's an overwhelmed fear irritable. There's also frantic

96
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Does this unnamed source of stress does it

97
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, activate any other big emotions.

98
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.840
I mean, of course, like

99
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.040
Big depression, sadness, like, stuff like that.

100
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.400
Sometimes I wonder if it's like rooted in like, I don't know, like yesterday.

101
00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:08.340
Nick Graham: I had this frantic episode, like, just like you know overwhelmed with everything. And then I like. When did my taxes and then it was gone and I maybe it like represents because like I put a lot of things off. I don't know if it's like

102
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.740
Partially connected to, like,

103
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Okay, so what's your suspicion. I put things off.

104
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:30.420
Nick Graham: Yeah, we're like, for example, I have this this stimulus check that's coming. And it's going to like solve a lot of the problems that have been on my plate. Well, not really because it's not a whole lot, but it will help a lot.

105
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.260
And

106
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:41.160
Nick Graham: It was about taxes and they're going to deposit into your tax account and I couldn't they don't give any guidance on how they're giving the stimulus and

107
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:55.260
Nick Graham: So I was like, my last year's deposit like who like were deposited into was an account that I like when I was using I overdo it like $600 and just like ghost in this account, you know,

108
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:05.580
Nick Graham: So I was worried that the stimulus check was going to be deposited into that account was my last year's taxes. And so I was like feeling like frantic about

109
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:15.720
Nick Graham: Losing my job. And then I was like, What about the stimulus check whatever. And so then I did my taxes and I felt like a little bit better. So I don't know if it's

110
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.420
Maybe it's more close to the surface and then I realized in a few cases.

111
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt better after you completed the tax account piece. Yeah, definitely.

112
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I like just filed my taxes for this year. Okay.

113
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I put things off being your insight into this, like, maybe there's that's a piece of it.

114
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:45.720
Okay.

115
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got

116
00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see what comes up with these. So you're you're identifying actually very present present things, you know, that's kind of how you're coming in today. I don't get this furlough you've got these things that that are

117
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That are coming up for you, and you've got some introspection into I put things off, it does bring relief when I do, I do. The undone thing.

118
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

119
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we kind of go back a little bit and just see

120
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to sort of take in less than less from from the video taking less than less.

121
00:16:42.180 --> 00:17:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: From your problem solving. Mine were you having to work so deliberately so hard. This morning to come up with a target you worked very hard. Already know you're analyzing you're doing my job for me. That's very generous of you. But now all you need to do is just go subtle just those micro

122
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: shifts and changes just turning inward now sort of pain into into intention to the body.

123
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that grounding piece of feeling, feeling the gravity allow that shoulder to kind of come down. Notice how it wants to pull it to the center to the core of the earth pulls it down in your spine and your seat bones.

124
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Be aware of that.

125
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a consistent poll, does it shift and change.

126
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And make sure to be an audit of its consistency and its power.

127
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how your leg. Stay down in the feet, stay

128
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Down to the bottom of the floor, the car.

129
00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice there's still still being pulled down to this core

130
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to whether you're resisting it and fighting it in the neck or the shoulders, the arms, the legs just sort of tune in my fighting it or am I gonna concede to it.

131
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your relationship with that with gravity.

132
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to hear sounds have come from my side.

133
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Come from your side. You may notice your mind wander.

134
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's doing its job to keep vigilant of your safety, you can just share gratitude. Thank you. And turn inward. Again, going to the breath.

135
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to the temperature on your cheeks, going to the texture of the clothing as it meets your skin.

136
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to become aware with these invitations.

137
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of what your eyes are doing

138
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: How are those ocular muscles spawning

139
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to the cheekbones and

140
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Jaw

141
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: muscles that move and nose and mouth.

142
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Neck.

143
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they want to do something and you're holding them back.

144
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a flexing or

145
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A release.

146
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into throat

147
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Their movement.

148
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The absence.

149
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something where the presence of something or a shift.

150
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to that neck.

151
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And pay attention to how you feel and will do this together, bringing that neck very, very slowly to the degree that it's comfortable and safe.

152
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing the neck and the direction will be we're heading, chin to chest. But so slowly that you can't tell, I'm doing it with you. I'd like you to pay attention.

153
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Up in that area of the neck.

154
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: A thought and emotion.

155
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe a memory just slowly turning down opening the neck up

156
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To what happens for you.

157
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.500
Nick Graham: Here just feels like

158
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.510
Like a release almost

159
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do the opposite. I know your head rest there, but I'd like to see how you feel when you actually left the chin up

160
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to lift the chin up, as if to the sky and just so slowly says we're returning we're focusing and attending to the subtle.

161
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it like to have your chin up and have that space.

162
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, an open its kind of

163
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.710
Weight like it's you know it's really uncomfortable.

164
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.100
So it kind of feels kind of

165
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Natural and like dirty and weird. Okay. Okay.

166
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you slowly get to the place that feels comfortable natural clean

167
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Spring that where it feels comfortable and natural and clean.

168
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just settling in till you find that place.

169
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.270
Maybe

170
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.530
Maybe found it. I think I'm also finding out that I like actual neck problems and I'm doing this.

171
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

172
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fairly comfortable

173
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Breast just want to stay where you're flexing it

174
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: almost feels like pulled

175
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.380
Pulled up even though they're uncomfortable.

176
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to any other shifts, you notice I had not sure you remember it's okay if you don't, because I focus on the neck. But do you remember any other shifts that were going on any notice things as I was inviting some awareness of gravity in the body.

177
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know, it felt

178
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: really relaxed, like the only thing was like

179
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.040
It was only the neck. There was only thing that I was like during the time like thinking

180
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.760
Nick Graham: Like it would be like almost like it'd be nice to be able to move in some way.

181
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, some strange

182
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

183
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

184
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I want to review.

185
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Some resourcing so I'd like to do some anchoring with those. I'd like to really get very, very resourced want you to feel that sensation of resource would like to do some iterations, where you get very present with the imagery

186
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandfather, and the dependability that personality.

187
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The consistency of always there when he was needed.

188
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have a sense also that the guns were relevant that he owned a bunch of them. So you can hold on to those pieces add more pieces or discard pieces that's up to you if you want me to change something, and probably like to change, like, just take put grandfather to rest. I think

189
00:24:53.310 --> 00:25:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so would you like to for a moment re cultivate a protective figure

190
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined. Remember, this can go

191
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantasy

192
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, go ahead. I think it would be. I'm like,

193
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.480
Like the river is like protective

194
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.100
Nick Graham: Camping I always worried about like wildlife and

195
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can't near a river, I think, like,

196
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:36.630
If there is something harmful. It's just there to drink or if there's something that's harmful on the other side of it, it would have to cross it to get to me.

197
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, provides a nice like comforting background noise. Okay.

198
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So really be present with that. See if you can pull in temperature of the water. If you were to touch it or even being around it and

199
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The case. Yeah, hold water.

200
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're welcome. You don't have to announce it if you don't want to. This is truly a personal experience just being very present with them. So the cold water. That's your choice. If you want to share or not share this is you pulling in that imagery just is there, but as you can.

201
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's just hearing the sounds maybe of its motion.

202
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it stay the same. Does it have variability or somehow combination and

203
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of getting a sense of

204
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Its protective quality.

205
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To me sounding like a barrier.

206
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: From harm on the other side.

207
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's natural.

208
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Comfortable.

209
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Its nature.

210
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And

211
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing in. Additionally, this relationship or quality of nurturing figure you have cristiana and you have Gandalf, see if those still ring true check in with the body there's any adjustments we need

212
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.730
Yeah yeah

213
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that that that would probably be fitting. Let's just stick with Christiana, yeah. Okay.

214
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is nurturing quality with cristiana and you can feel her presence.

215
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it be near interacting in some way connected to and relating to the protective quality.

216
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Of this background noise right of this river.

217
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: cristiana wanting, pure and simple your growth your development.

218
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel honest genuine and true.

219
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.060
Nick Graham: I think it does, however, I just have associations with like

220
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.620
With like my family dynamic

221
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I think it kind of almost feels out of place like to have anywhere.

222
00:28:51.660 --> 00:29:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we don't really want any income grow and see. That's why I'm checking in on these these need to be pure and simple. They need to be that stuff that is comfortable natural clean

223
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's revisit again our creative fantasy mind that right brain that opens up to archetypes two images and animals two

224
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: things you've seen where you grow rocked really hit the sense of, Oh my goodness. Can you imagine the perfection of something someone

225
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere some some energy force wanting for you, your full growth and potential nurturing. Take care.

226
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go ahead, like an elk like a like a good maybe like a herd of elk.

227
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. Like with a big

228
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.900
Nick Graham: Strong bold, like let's protect her and

229
00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Got another image for protecting their to any sort of a combination nurturing and it's a whole herd of elk with a strong ball. This where's that bull placed in this this heard

230
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:18.960
Nick Graham: He's kind of off towards like the edge of the of the could be in the woods and he's kind of off towards the edge of the woods.

231
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.120
And you have like the cows and the caps and it's all kind of a

232
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely nurturing

233
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you see the protective quality of this background comforting River.

234
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see them present with the herd of elk and the bowl off the edge of the word.

235
00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Counts and calves.

236
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the ball.

237
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the ball on kind of like towards the edge of the woods. And then the third is within the woods and then there's a river kind of protecting their their their their flank.

238
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with that just picturing it

239
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you there with it somehow, someway your presence is there as well. You are part of that.

240
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving yourself.

241
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: full consent to be a part of that protection and merchants.

242
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing also in

243
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The spirit of a mountain.

244
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or for us. And you mentioned the word. I don't know if those are already there and your imagery

245
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The wisdom.

246
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a spirit of mountain

247
00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: bringing it all together was

248
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Nick there too.

249
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious to know how your presence interacts with these figures.

250
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.830
Nick Graham: Yeah, must feel like

251
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.360
Like an invisible bystander.

252
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't see you.

253
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.110
Nick Graham: I think that that they they know I'm there and they kind of

254
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like they're, they're like teaching me like to

255
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.480
Nick Graham: To be able to track and follow them and

256
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.750
teaching me to learn to be able to like to help me grow a little bit

257
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:13.380
Like they're aware of my presence and it's like my job to kind of like

258
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.880
Figure that figure them out and their movements and where they're going.

259
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling right now.

260
00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.390
Probably

261
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.650
Must like

262
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.560
Like excitement almost to

263
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.590
To be able to like be there into

264
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, like, because there's like also bringing up that's like how

265
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:08.580
Like I've done this similar scenario in it, like where I would like follow through the woods and

266
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.890
Like I never thought about like living so harmoniously like

267
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.420
Almost like we're helping each other.

268
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So I'd like you to open your eyes.

269
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'd like to do, I'd like you to go with what you just said living harmoniously together. Okay very good at doing bilateral stimulation. So I'd like you look at my fingers on the set the pace hold that living harmoniously look at the two figures that you have on your dashboard.

270
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be slow.

271
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And keep breathing.

272
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're holding that imagery

273
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together into the belly.

274
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's exhale it deliberately out of the mouth.

275
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your mind go blank for a beat.

276
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let it drop dead space.

277
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice

278
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.700
And I really thought about a

279
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.480
Person named Ernie who's kind of

280
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.300
Like a

281
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:12.630
Like a teacher in a guide like since I moved to New Mexico. He's like a friend of my, my, my father and I would consider him a good friend of mine, and he's kind of shown me

282
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.710
He's like a person.

283
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.260
Nick Graham: Where all you like all he talks about is like the nature in the woods and

284
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.110
Experiences almost like

285
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:37.650
He grew up in a place like advocate, which is like, technically, like a problem, I guess, maybe it's a lot of like Native American influence and he just speaks in like a really simple.

286
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Way that just conveys like

287
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:51.540
Things and how they make you feel and nothing more, nothing like deeper and more complex.

288
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion. Are you having right now.

289
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.710
Well, he's also

290
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.450
Kind of

291
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:28.650
Well, I'm not great at like replying to texts and things like that. And so I can't help but like think about how he's like a maybe 60 year old man like lives alone, and I don't reply to a lot like. Like, I replied to some of his messages. But I think that

292
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.270
Nick Graham: There are probably a lot of

293
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.150
Things that get lost.

294
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.650
That I probably feel in relation to people.

295
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:55.890
Nick Graham: Like I might like care about someone and think very fondly of them, but the fact that I'm not, like, really, I look at a text message. And I like or phone call and I like don't

296
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.820
Nick Graham: It's not that I don't want to reply. It's like something

297
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.600
Doesn't feel comfortable with with doing that. And so it kind of makes me feel like

298
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.100
It's great to think about

299
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you did a nice long story to describe to me. Thank you for that.

300
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And yet.

301
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only guess what the feeling is that you may have lost things because maybe

302
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't comfortable replying quickly. What's that feeling you just had you shake your head just slightly. What is that feeling was that emotion.

303
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.600
I think that would be

304
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.890
Maybe like isolation.

305
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's typically an action.

306
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're almost there. That's a solution, perhaps

307
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.520
You'd almost be like

308
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.920
Maybe like

309
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.780
Nick Graham: Oh, definitely, like sadness in relation to that feeling like

310
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.900
Or not being like

311
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.610
Sadness. Yeah.

312
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some reason.

313
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling

314
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This word guilt. It's bizarre. I don't know why.

315
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know why I'm thinking that word.

316
00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.940
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean I think like that.

317
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.980
Nick Graham: That would be a good underlying like feeling in relation to it. I think that

318
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.030
The guilt is a product of of that.

319
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Which action or inaction.

320
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:15.780
Nick Graham: Yeah, the guilt is a product of the inaction of, like, I'm just not. I just don't

321
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.540
Nick Graham: Do well it like responding to people like i don't i don't know

322
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, like if it's like a I feel obligated to do it. Okay. My rebellious to. Yes. Okay.

323
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking in your body, which has happened. Pay attention.

324
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: To, you know,

325
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.060
I think that

326
00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.290
I feel like more like I'm like I'm slowly like hunting and like slouching as I as I

327
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.720
Think about those things.

328
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, slowly hunching is it close to a label of sad.

329
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, slowly hunching okay

330
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we get in touch with breath. Can you get in touch with

331
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That comfort that nature mountain quality of wisdom.

332
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective quality.

333
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: In the river.

334
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And the nurturing quality.

335
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh.

336
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to ask you to open your eyes. And I'm asking. Think about that.

337
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Weaving it in with

338
00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: rebelling against obligation, can you open your eyes.

339
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can hold those two things together.

340
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then look at your objects at my pace.

341
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Those two things.

342
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery

343
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Your resource team.

344
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: rebelling against predation.

345
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember to keep breathing.

346
00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still in that body.

347
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's a little different. I want to know what thoughts what

348
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.180
Nick Graham: Makes you think like

349
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.390
There's, there's two are

350
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.700
Very much connected. I think

351
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.340
Leaving somewhere.

352
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:14.580
Like leaving to go somewhere that is simpler.

353
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna go with your eyes.

354
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's catch the thoughts and just share with me. You don't have to do the analysis, I'll do that for you. You just stayed exactly what that thought that passed by.

355
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Their conducted definitely eating somewhere.

356
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna go with that.

357
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Great thing going great.

358
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Down in the lower part of the don't forget about you.

359
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

360
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Together. Inhale, big belly breath.

361
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And a slow breath as you can't let it out slow, slow, slow.

362
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that mind go blank for a beat.

363
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Or two

364
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up.

365
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.830
Well, I think like physically. There's something almost like blocking a deep breath right now like a

366
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.790
Like a chest tightness and I can't quite

367
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up your resource figures and see was what do you can open your eyes from you get cabinetry ready to go with that you're ready.

368
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Physical blocking

369
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello, I'm going to go with that.

370
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in your resource team.

371
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull those two together, be present with both great you kind of

372
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: tuning into to actively. What is to be done.

373
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Something comes up.

374
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To share what passes through your mind, body,

375
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.710
Like a campfire writing a campfire would be

376
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: On to that solution.

377
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: campfires live

378
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the body's response tuning in

379
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially around

380
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The breathing.

381
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's have a nice inhale together. Inhale.

382
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And then just let it all go

383
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that quiet be that space between the notes music and our thoughts and see what presents itself.

384
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.020
Yeah, I just can't help but

385
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:42.900
Feel

386
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.620
Like guilt and why do I feel like why do I not

387
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.210
Do those things like why do I not

388
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.670
Like look at something a message and just not reply or

389
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.150
out of spite in like these things like

390
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.330
It kind of is like hurtful to people. I think in some such a simple act like

391
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.080
Nick Graham: I'm almost like physically barred from

392
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:21.450
Maybe not physically, but I'm barred from doing an action that could make people feel good that it's quick.

393
00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I could help people feel good. Okay.

394
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.160
But I don't

395
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the physical barge I

396
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.220
Think it's just

397
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:42.390
Like I personally feel like it's like an excuse that I make, like, I could do it. I could reply to it.

398
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.960
And I just feel like there's

399
00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.760
Maybe

400
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:56.130
Maybe I'm not like like in a selfish way. Like, I don't see anything. Maybe in it for me.

401
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Please.

402
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to check in what emotion kind of

403
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, how are you, how are you doing over there.

404
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:21.240
I'm doing I'm doing okay. Just like a gross thought like, to me, personally, like a like a

405
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a sickening thing to just say,

406
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's sickening landed somewhere in the body where we don't be

407
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.070
Probably like

408
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:38.820
Nick Graham: Shoulder

409
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.610
This way to my right, Saturday in my

410
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe like the top of my chest a little bit. Okay.

411
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's fine. Chillin not doing anything hasn't been no

412
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: May seem arbitrary and out of place.

413
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That I want to number, since I'm doing all this organic stuff.

414
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to still no zero to 100 how distressed. You are 100 is the worst.

415
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:32.940
35 okay

416
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's bring it back to an earlier time when you've had that gross sickening.

417
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Status now.

418
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:51.630
Yeah.

419
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.840
Nick Graham: I was like a young child, probably five or six

420
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.710
In my, I was like, at my. So my parents split up and I would go to my

421
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:16.920
Nick Graham: family's house to go visit with my dad, he would fly from New Hampshire to go to Ohio and I visit their family and my uncle had. It was like this dirty house like because

422
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.400
His family's like doesn't have money.

423
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.030
Nick Graham: They had frogs, like in this little area.

424
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.030
Nick Graham: I remember as a young child, just like

425
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.680
These tiny like like tadpoles

426
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.320
And I like like put one like as a young child.

427
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:47.250
Nick Graham: I wouldn't like I would like hurt like little, like, things like that. Like I would like

428
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:49.800
Like put

429
00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, put it in a fan. Okay.

430
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body. Catch it intention or squares that landing

431
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: At fucked up thing. Where is it right in the chest like like okay let's towards the back. Okay, what is the belief about yourself around this this memory that that's

432
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.760
Nick Graham: pretty disturbing thing to do.

433
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

434
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief I am

435
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Disturbed oh

436
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's making me want to tear up

437
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How's it feeling for you. What's the emotion. If I'm disturbed.

438
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I see a tier

439
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion. What do we label that

440
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.740
Probably

441
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.840
I definitely feel like out of place.

442
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to pay close attention to time.

443
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like to just take

444
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Take out of place for a moment, which is take that one piece and this is a very specific narrow right

445
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Part, we're not going to take the whole network which is going to take the sense of out of place maybe even in the chest, maybe tuning into physiological where it landed in the chest.

446
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm out of place. And I'd like you to bring in your resource and let's let's end today with with that. Okay. I want you to

447
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to get there. This. So I want you to pull in that resource team.

448
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And they there. They may not at first. Right. So those two things. I'm out of place to the chest and pull in

449
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your protective nurturing and we are and why speakers summon them up.

450
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of place.

451
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Chest.

452
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to open your eyes.

453
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to hold all of those can

454
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

455
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing into that chest

456
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And belly.

457
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In that area to go deep into the bottom of the alarm.

458
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: holding those protective nurturing and wise.

459
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing.

460
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Come. Great.

461
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here to

462
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale and

463
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

464
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let the mind go blank.

465
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Resting into the quiet.

466
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Space.

467
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:31.500
Yeah, I think, like,

468
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.070
When I was like a young kid.

469
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:44.310
I would kind of game like what I felt had like like since like

470
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.560
And I like I i I'm still on that.

471
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:51.480
And so

472
00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.110
I believe that there was a lot of like chaos in childhood, especially like surrounding like family visits and things like that.

473
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.110
And maybe like I felt like so.

474
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:15.300
Nick Graham: Like not in control of my circumstances and what was happening that I like.

475
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:17.730
Wanted to

476
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:21.300
Like play like

477
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:33.150
Nick Graham: God or play like in control of like something's life like something so small that I wouldn't at the time deem that it has any kind of sentience, or any kind of

478
00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to control

479
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:41.460
Yeah, yeah. I wanted to control that.

480
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

481
00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to pull in your figures, I want to control. Want to sense control.

482
00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Development.

483
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Safety

484
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Pearson's just take him in

485
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming up

486
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:24.930
Nick Graham: Yeah, I've, I think like that term control I've, I've heard that I've been on the receiving end of being told that I'm controlling you know like or that I have qualities

487
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:28.200
That would

488
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:33.510
You know, come off as being controlling

489
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.320
Nick Graham: And I've never quite seen it.

490
00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.320
Nick Graham: Like I see like actions like when I get like insecure and then that cause so

491
00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:49.080
I think like when

492
00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.080
I was like a kid like maybe

493
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.400
I'm just expressing it in different ways.

494
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

495
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.320
I think, back then.

496
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.860
Nick Graham: Back then, I always believed like

497
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:47.700
I don't know if it's a common kid thing. But I like thought I would do anything and everything I wanted to and I almost had like

498
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.300
Like

499
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.320
Visions of like Grand year you know like

500
01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:08.790
Nick Graham: I remember as a like similar age child like I would, I never was like a person that didn't have friends like I always have friends, but I remember one day, like I went in, like, told my mom like

501
01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:12.150
Nick Graham: Someone came up to me and said that

502
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:17.250
Nick Graham: You have so many friends like like to where I would like

503
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:25.590
Nick Graham: I guess like exaggerate a lot of the stories to try to

504
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.320
Seem like

505
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.170
Nick Graham: Like I was really popular. And, you know, so I think

506
01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.680
Back then, I just felt like

507
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.180
Nick Graham: Like I was an exaggerated form of myself.

508
01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe now it's like almost the opposite.

509
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's the I exaggerate.

510
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself. See if you can find an I am

511
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: An action is exaggeration, and the belief about the self having to exaggerate. I am

512
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.600
Nick Graham: I think as a child, I would say.

513
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:34.290
Nick Graham: Lost in authentic like those two I think go together. I would say live or that's not even that's not in a feeling

514
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling I'm lost is a self that's fun. There's something more to it. And I can tell you're searching for more clarification, something about, I think you said in authentic.

515
01:02:47.250 --> 01:03:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think so. I think I think anyone who lives. It is like, is that where anyone can fabricate to a narrative surrounding themselves in. That's kind of what I think I'd done. Okay, go back to I'm lost.

516
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Likely to get a sense of, again, arbitrary, but just hang in there with me again. And number one to 10 How true is it

517
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lost.

518
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: First

519
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.250
Nine.

520
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like

521
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To think of yourself.

522
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

523
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.790
Found. I mean, I think that would be

524
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is it today 127 different scale. How true is it I am found

525
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.820
Three and a half. Okay, three

526
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Minutes 3.25 or something like on a four.

527
01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

528
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to leave today with time to process. So I am going to pull back and spend some time to sort of really

529
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of gently take care of the work you did want to create time for that. Okay, I've got some pretty good targets. Okay, which means that when we come back we won't have to kind of do all the wandering we did

530
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: really productive.

531
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got some some solid targets.

532
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do want to take care of your emotional numbness

533
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's why we set this timeframe. So I want to be deliberate about it. Okay, so

534
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just kind of tune into those

535
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Those presence of, you know, is it enough to just be an invisible by standard with the cell can the river and, is that enough

536
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go there and see if you want more.

537
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you want to be more or less a part of that quality of protection and

538
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing and wisdom.

539
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What prevents you from being more part of it. If you long to be a part of it or

540
01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you want more distance just tune into

541
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To my invitation and what comes up.

542
01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:50.010
I think

543
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.180
They are

544
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:08.730
They are elk. I'm not. I think that it's fine.

545
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:15.120
To kind of be

546
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:17.610
Where I am in relation to them.

547
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.680
But it's like a

548
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.840
Almost like this.

549
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.500
Nick Graham: Connection that like living like living things share

550
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: In this space like

551
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.590
Like we understand each other.

552
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:44.160
And it's I think it's okay.

553
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Appreciate

554
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Love connect with you.

555
01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:01.530
Think they were both helping each other. They're helping me learn to seek and I'm helping them learn to

556
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.190
To hide, which I think it's like important to their ability to

557
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Teaching them how to high

558
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Quality is to share with them they have in common.

559
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.150
I think they're both of us wanted. I want to grow.

560
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.160
And I think we both appreciate the setting.

561
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.500
That we're in at that time.

562
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend some moments, really, really honoring gently that reciprocal exchange that offering that each of you give

563
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You bring resource.

564
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And qualities to the relationship

565
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And they bring resource and quality.

566
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To you.

567
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be in that space of gratitude for appreciating it.

568
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's any charge left in the body.

569
01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's there. That's

570
01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Still, yes.

571
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:10.650
I think

572
01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:18.480
Because you know a little bit residual but I think it's fine.

573
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Residual

574
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.140
Really like like speckles up in my chest like

575
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.660
Static

576
01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Static still in the chest area.

577
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you imagine that the elk have those as well.

578
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.250
Yeah, I think so.

579
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.580
I think probably

580
01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:00.810
Everything does

581
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: keep them alive.

582
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.380
It gives them a reason to

583
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To need to run in certain situations to hide.

584
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's in service of survival.

585
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:25.740
Yeah, I think so.

586
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to force that cycle to be there. Can we just rely on it intuitively

587
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:40.680
Think we can probably rely on it.

588
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just if you could look at me and you and I just sort of tear humans interacting, for a moment, just for going to this.

589
01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This stepping back place. And again, just sort of picturing you know this film strip with different images in it and having it be in front of you.

590
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And if there's something you don't have to hold it all in your working memory. I can do that. But if there is something that you want to still sit with what would that be

591
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.440
Well, I mean,

592
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:42.690
I just, I just think about like

593
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.530
Like my

594
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:54.960
Nick Graham: Needs to go to to nature for things. And I remember there's this this guy that I used to work with. And he was like,

595
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.960
I would consider him to be like really wise like like really wise person.

596
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, in some ways, but

597
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.080
Really flawed and others, and I would talk about

598
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:09.960
How I needed to go to nature.

599
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:20.400
You know how I felt like I needed to work from home like certain times and I needed to be in Nature Center certain times like to get a certain feeling in here. We said, whoo, something, something weird about that, like there's something

600
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:35.610
Like, like, like, not in a bad way. Like, but there's something like surrounding the reason that you want to go to nature, like this, like, why is it that every protective every wise every figure that I that I experiences is from nature and that's

601
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.360
Nick Graham: Something that I'm really, really thinking about, like,

602
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:50.040
I think, why isn't it a person like I don't know. Like, why does, why does it. Why does that figure, being a person not feel right. And to me, that just like

603
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.830
makes me really wonder about that.

604
01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't just simple psychology be that people have betrayed you. Why does it have to be complex. Why can't it be you probably already know that we're a mess. We're selfish recruiting more impulsive.

605
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: When unbalanced. We're out of time.

606
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We are often untrustworthy, and yet you coexist with us. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're that way.

607
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But

608
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's just that simple.

609
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we're just untrustworthy. And there's mixed messages are constantly coming at you with us as humans.

610
01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But nature's linear. It's just we know it's predictable, they're gonna

611
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to eat us if they're hungry. They won't because we're bad or because they're hungry not overthinking they're going to run because they're scared they're gonna, it's just more linear. It's not tripped up with

612
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Mixture. What if it's just that simple. Is there a part that kind of thinks, maybe it's just that simple.

613
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:13.860
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's what I've always like felt felt like that's, that's why I really like that part of stuff like that.

614
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.890
Nick Graham: He's it feels, it feels that way.

615
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:19.230
And you know, that's

616
01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.180
Nick Graham: I guess like reinforces like the fact that it does suck that

617
01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:31.140
Nick Graham: They can also like I'm also one of those humans who is

618
01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's just unfortunate.

619
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:37.290
That it is that way. I mean, I

620
01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you do so, just make contact with me. It feels different to look man I

621
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Say your truth I i can be mean and selfish and cruel and I can be loving and generous and self sacrificing just to just sit with that duality in your own

622
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own way.

623
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But a witness to it. I'm witnessing and you're looking at me.

624
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you to

625
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You two are like that. And you're also this other stuff.

626
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, both

627
01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:22.920
Yeah, I guess it's

628
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:30.180
At the current time the balance.

629
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Think I must have worked something recently, try to bring it up, up, up, up, up to the superficial to then get to chit chat.

630
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

631
01:15:52.800 --> 01:16:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is, the more you investigate right your, your friends that you're, you know, your roommate, you know, at the philosophies that are out there.

632
01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is you'll end up coming back to seeing it's opposites everywhere you know

633
01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, bad, and kind and selfish and

634
01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That evil and he already have cheeses, kind of, how does it know itself without knowing the other kind of thing.

635
01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's an odd place to be.

636
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And to say that

637
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be over and over again living with both. And that's the skill.

638
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be a longing to want to have one summary to want it clear, but it's going to be i i'm have to sit with the conflict and how will I sit with conflict. Right.

639
01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How will I sit with I both in this and I want this, but I don't like that about myself and like that. Another people but there it is.

640
01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And there'll be a longing to want to just go to one side or the other.

641
01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's so much philosophy and information out there, psychology, certainly offers it to that that Yang Yang, things got some going on with it because there it is.

642
01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, yep. And how will I need it. Oh my gosh, I was just afraid. And so instead I acted out and I was mean.

643
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wouldn't have to sit with my own vulnerability. Oh, I hate it. And other people. Oh, and I'm doing it myself. It's going to be that again and again and again, but it's how you meet it. It will make the difference whether you will reach out

644
01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it can seem to be human and flawed like me like us.

645
01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And that in that humility. That's our brilliance. It's like I can sit with just falling deeply in love and just horribly betrayed and terrified and. Oh, I am so in love. And what if this person gets six sick and dies and

646
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: can't skip over them. It's just part of the journey and it's not it's not enough to just say it means you're going to meet them minute by minute it's how you meet them.

647
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not one thing enough I think to say it because there's plenty of religions and stuff. That'll give you all of that.

648
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's another to to get to what I think you're doing. I think what certainly I'm transparent, I can tell you everything I'm up to over on my side.

649
01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm finding some that I think will be useful, I think there have been some key moments where that young mind, the one that hasn't developed

650
01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The prefrontal cortex, the one that can't distinguish between right now and the future of five year old brain simply has 25 more years before to grows that so it can't. And so the way a thing is remembered as a five year old.

651
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what if we

652
01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Use all that experience and intellect of a man not a boy and in the presence of someone that hopefully you're feeling safe and that cares about you and that wants for you what you want.

653
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the same as what what that chaos and it's not that's then

654
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not now.

655
01:19:50.520 --> 01:20:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm optimistic. So what we did today was trying to do some investigation and nosing around a try and see where might be a useful target. Okay.

656
01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So knowing that, that's what I'm up to what I'm inviting you to do.

657
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up for you. Yeah, I mean I think

658
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:15.900
I think

659
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.560
Nick Graham: The early on.

660
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like like misconception about like being like Zen, you know, to use that. Yeah.

661
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.880
Just being overwhelmingly positive all the time, you know, and I think that

662
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:43.830
Nick Graham: Like, like, I think that's a lot of people look at somebody, like, Oh, they're so peaceful and so happy like like that was all. But really, it's like, no, that's not it at all.

663
01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Side, they're managing the conflict. Oh, how do I meet that oh I don't eat that. How will I meet that in

664
01:20:54.090 --> 01:21:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's in the forest or Powerline media out there it is again, I don't like it. I want it to do we meet it over and over and over.

665
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you meet it. Yeah, yeah.

666
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.130
Nick Graham: I think like just the outward appearances that

667
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Look like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, like, I mean, I think that

668
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.430
Nick Graham: That's the

669
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.750
I guess the, the part that's

670
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean it's, it's fine. I mean it's it's more comforting that way almost that there's no one who sees everything in an overwhelmingly positive lens all the time like like they're getting

671
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: die young, aren't they, I mean, because if we can't register threat real like actual danger. Right. That's the little speckle maybe

672
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The alchemy, you need. We all have that I'm gonna

673
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Not easily walk into some ridiculous like no common sense traffic, you know, we come on

674
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it just looks like that. And so I have come to

675
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like this ugly and me well.

676
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Brings me deep deeper and deeper connected to. I think of you guys are my family of the people in my life. I'm like, well, I share that in common. I too am flawed. What do I do with it.

677
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, brings me closer to means I'm going to be. I am not afraid of you or him or her. I'm like, fucked up to okay we're closer for that. So I don't see it as a way to be further away. I see what I have in common, and it's in our flaws. It's in our fallibility

678
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's how I make meaning, and I don't get too attached to that either. So I get a little meaning that when works for me and let it go. Let go outcome.

679
01:22:51.630 --> 01:23:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That may not work for some people that may not work for me in the moment and that's that groundless notice that I was telling you about with my children. It's all you got yourself a label. Well, good for you. Guess what it's going to change in about 60 seconds.

680
01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get hung up on the outcome on your expectation around something because it's going to throw you throw you off course again and then what are you going to do you think you got to settling in over a year. Well, good luck with that.

681
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And something's going to be something else that's going to throw you off course and how will you meet that how will you meet that it's just over and over and over.

682
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And the people that I think this Zen appearance is

683
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the radical acceptance of what is but it really is radical that this and justice. This in justice.

684
01:23:45.630 --> 01:24:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have to live with this injustice of maybe being imprisoned for something of which I am completely innocent that I'm supposed to somehow carve out happiness in here like that that exists that these people are going through that all over our planet.

685
01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: They didn't deserve the poverty, the abuse the deprivation, they don't deserve it, nor are there people that do I don't decide that, but there it is.

686
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How will they find some happiness and peace in there, they can keep fighting. What is or they just say that happened. This is happening and I don't want

687
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To be unhappy.

688
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really about acceptance. It is. It's huge. That's why that word radical. It's not your regular which is you know it is what it is and

689
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It is hard, is what it is. It's part. This time, though, this one's hard to

690
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Take that one went a little better but it's, I call it skills and you hear me use that word a lot you don't roll in a group, very often, but I use them a lot. I don't know. Something I picked up.

691
01:24:53.040 --> 01:25:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone learned them they passed it along and we we keep sharing it. So I'm going to share mine. And it's a skill, meaning I don't have it practice. So like, that means I can practice it. I can do more of it. I just need to practice it more often.

692
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.140
And thank you for making a longer time slot. I appreciate it.

693
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.500
Nick Graham: Definitely better

694
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:34.200
Nick Graham: Towards the end then like the last time I mean like, obviously, I think it's fine to

695
01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:38.220
Have that static, you know,

696
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:40.710
I appreciate the wind down

697
01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's nice

698
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't require me

699
01:25:50.760 --> 01:26:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice to have that done inner personal peace. Yeah, definitely. What was it like for you to have me almost demand right eye contact, what did that feel like for you.

700
01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:08.970
I think

701
01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:20.250
Nick Graham: I think it's fine. I think like sometimes when you're in, you're like, I'm in my head like I'm not generally an

702
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:30.420
Eye contact avoider but when it comes to, like, I guess. Think dealing with things that are like shameful thoughts shameful like things past i think that

703
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to like realize that it's not just you there in your head and there's just some magical voice.

704
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.780
Talking to you. So yeah, I think.

705
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was good. Okay, so I'll probably be doing it here in there because

706
01:26:52.110 --> 01:27:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I do come from part of my foundation of my sort of theoretical orientation has to do with attachment theory where we're wounded if its inner personal that the healing will happen here in presence of another. So I'm just a lot of pieces. A lot of moving parts going on.

707
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But just know that I'm also interested if a version comes up. If something happens where there's this

708
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Repulsion or whatever, again and again and again there's no wrong way for you to do it, except to not do you

709
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You're missing you'll miss out on come just ever so fraction of a second. If you miss something that comes up and decide not to share that because you think it doesn't belong in here.

710
01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You might miss something. It might take months or years

711
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: don't rob yourself of

712
01:27:49.470 --> 01:28:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to. Okay. Because you think the therapeutic relationship might be damaged or I might get my feelings hurt. I'm not going to get my feelings hurt. Okay, I am taking care of myself.

713
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:07.260
