00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.490
Robert Hammond: Good.

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.230
Robert Hammond: Good, good.

4
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you been up to since we last spoke

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.350
Robert Hammond: Nothing. Just working

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.840
Robert Hammond: I kind of stopped talking to that one chick, that's all good. You

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.380
Are bad

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
Robert Hammond: That one she don't know it seemed like all she wanted to do is talk like she never wanted to meet or nothing.

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.280
Robert Hammond: So over the phone, right.

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.240
Robert Hammond: So I was getting kind of tired of that I was like I never going to see the person

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, well, is it possible because of everything went out with my team that maybe that's why

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.890
Robert Hammond: No, she she just like avoiding old things so

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.030
Robert Hammond: I think she just did her way of intention.

16
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where did you meet her.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.600
Robert Hammond: Online.

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.600
Robert Hammond: But I did start

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.580
Robert Hammond: So,

20
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.840
Robert Hammond: I didn't start talking to somebody new

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
Robert Hammond: So I'm supposed to be actually going to see them today.

22
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In this relationship.

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.370
Robert Hammond: Much the same thing is

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.610
Robert Hammond: Just something that's really to give me, you know, same as I putting in

25
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.310
Robert Hammond: So far, this one that I've been talking to she's been doing pretty good. With that, I guess, mutual mutual respect there. Yeah.

26
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what will you be, what would you do different in this relationship in previous relationship.

27
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.280
Robert Hammond: To boundaries right away.

28
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

29
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.970
Robert Hammond: So,

30
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Last time we talked. I know, over the course, some of the boundaries you thinking about implementing

31
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our, you know, just like the standard principles.

32
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.370
Because

33
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was control issues. It was some violence so

34
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're having your, your side in this relationship will be the way that she would communicate

35
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.420
Robert Hammond: The boundaries that you're wanting in this relationship.

36
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that look like

37
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.040
Robert Hammond: That I'm not too sure because I've been trying to work them into trying to figure out how to do it myself.

38
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

39
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:18.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So one. I just want to start off by saying that, um, I appreciate just the growth that I've, I've witnessed with you coming to your appointments, you started off not talking much

40
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:30.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now you you're open you talk more. You show up for your sessions. I don't even send reminders. You just, you just show up. So I appreciate that. So,

41
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think the development and the progress that you're making will also help you to want that same within whoever you're dating.

42
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because as you continue to evolve and develop into someone that's more responsible that has a strong work ethic.

43
00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:08.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That people can trust those sound like attributes. I wanted someone that I'm dating as well someone that's responsible as someone that I can trust so perhaps you know that something that you can start off with know in relationships, some of the things that I feel is key is someone that

44
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:19.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is responsible and someone I can trust. And then maybe give that person examples about what a responsible person looks like for you and what a trustworthy person looks like.

45
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think that will be starting off when would you, what would you think you'll have the right to bring up this conversation.

46
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.430
Robert Hammond: I think that that would be something I do need somebody I could dress. No.

47
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Depend on. Yeah.

48
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.700
Well,

49
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because, can I share my feedback with you about the previous relationship.

50
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sure she held you back.

51
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.110
Robert Hammond: Right.

52
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm actively using in front of you.

53
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The violence.

54
00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean that that session we told me that she ran over you with a car and thinking, wow, how, how, how does a relationship get to this point.

55
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.260
Robert Hammond: Right.

56
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:21.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And as soon as you know, I started noticing your growth, little by little bit. Soon as you started recognizing it. That's when that relationship. And so the key in going into the relationship is identifying what you're worth and what your values are

57
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think that's the fundamental elements and being able to build respectful boundaries and I'm healthy communication skills and a relationship and making that foundation from the beginning so that it's very clear what you will tolerate and what you won't tolerate

58
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.500
Robert Hammond: Right. I agree.

59
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.620
Robert Hammond: I mean actually noticing that much. Oh.

60
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.910
Robert Hammond: I know like the better. I feel about myself, like the more I start drawing other people that are like

61
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.370
Robert Hammond: Categories and

62
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

63
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What have you noticed I shared some of the things I've noticed with your progress. Have you noticed about yourself.

64
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.950
Robert Hammond: I just been more sort of more being able to tell people know

65
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.200
Robert Hammond: I can help of whatever

66
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.990
Robert Hammond: He's like, I've been able to

67
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.220
Robert Hammond: Avoid debt other relationships, like you said she was much easier way back. She's been trying to get

68
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.290
Robert Hammond: it all to me so I can try to picture truck.

69
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.030
Robert Hammond: But like right off the bat, I already know it's going to be the same crap so I don't even bother doing it. Yeah.

70
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.130
Robert Hammond: Whereas before I be overdoing

71
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.250
It.

72
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:49.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We kind of just walking into the relationship of whatever happens, then you would assess and now you come into it, you know, assessing first looking out for

73
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some of those things that might be red flags, like you said, with the other person, you know, she just wants to talk, but she never wants to see me.

74
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is a red flag. You know, it's just about attention for her. Okay, let me move on. So that was good. You know, you're already assessing some of those things that are important to you.

75
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you've always shared when you talk about relationships that connection and feeling support it was important for you. So because you already know going in as a value for you when you're with this person that she wasn't even

76
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:39.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Physically available to see you. You know, you were able to establish from there. But this won't work because I'm not going to get the connection support. Now I'm looking for this person can he can meet face to face interaction.

77
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.860
Robert Hammond: Right.

78
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.780
Robert Hammond: Yeah, I also noticed on that other one though.

79
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.320
Robert Hammond: Cuz I almost did get drawn into it but I kind of hesitated, and waited. Just to see going to be

80
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like right off the bat.

81
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:59.040
Robert Hammond: Start going off about missing somebody else and all these other things. And I was like, if we're not doing it together, then why does it even matter.

82
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.730
Robert Hammond: And you should already started my dad and she's already got

83
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.750
Robert Hammond: Jealous issues she thinks that we are so I didn't want to leave it on

84
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good for you. There will be other people that wouldn't be as honorable and we'll just

85
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Leave her on

86
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.540
Robert Hammond: Right.

87
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any other relationships, that's right for you, other than romantic relationships.

88
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.830
Robert Hammond: Talk to some other brands do everybody's friends. So you're there.

89
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.930
Robert Hammond: So,

90
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.020
Robert Hammond: He's been, I've been doing better. I work

91
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.960
Robert Hammond: A lot of word of mouth spread so

92
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.310
Robert Hammond: Get a lot more business.

93
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.570
Robert Hammond: That's pretty good.

94
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.890
Robert Hammond: To go to a job today, but I had to postpone it, let's go fix this little kid's bike.

95
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.690

Robert Hammond: So it's her grandson.

102

108
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.360
Robert Hammond: There's just because he had been he was already to go for it.

109
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow. How old is he

110
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.310
Robert Hammond: What is he about 11

111
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:58.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, sounds like he's already developing on what it looks like to be responsible and

112
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:06.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Room. I'm clearly he's witness. His family valuing your work and what you do. And so he's honoring that

113
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:16.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sounds like a good family that you're connected with, um, besides work. Do you guys have like a friendship or establishment.

114
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.670
Robert Hammond: Oh there. Yeah, someone, like I said, right.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, yeah.

117
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How's it been going for you in the medication and all that. What's that experience been like for you.

118
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.980
Robert Hammond: With the medication.

119
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.030
Yeah.

120
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.480
Robert Hammond: We went down another

121
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.340
Robert Hammond: Quarter of a strip

122
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.440
Robert Hammond: So,

123
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.980
Robert Hammond: And I try not to know when I take it.

124
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From my streets where I can't

125
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.340
Robert Hammond: I don't know which one I get

126
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.490
Robert Hammond: That way they'll try to keep my mind off.

127
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.750
Yeah.

128
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

129
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.600
Robert Hammond: I don't know which one you know, besides the less less amount

130
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:01.680
Then

131
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.320
Robert Hammond: It works, but

132
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.030
Robert Hammond: It's been a little bit

133
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.420
Robert Hammond: No, I'm not to say it's like my body gets like Kimberly and weird after

134
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.720
Robert Hammond: Someone's like I could feel like some, some of the withdrawal, but

135
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah around what time of the day. Do you notice it. Is there a pattern.

136
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.600
Robert Hammond: Know, you'd be like I said it was but now that I'm taking it like without, without knowing which one stupid. Is it like

137
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.320
Watch rates.

138
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.580
Robert Hammond: But I noticed I don't usually get up in the mornings.

139
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.490
Robert Hammond: So it's usually in the afternoon and evening.

140
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like medication may be wearing off.

141
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

142
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About sleeping. Does it impact your sleeping at all.

143
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.210
Robert Hammond: No, I feel asleep. Oh, good.

144
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.620
Robert Hammond: Just a little bit too much.

145
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm looking at your, your band score.

146
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

147
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It says that you want to help identify your triggers to prevent relapse.

148
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:13.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your doses lower you feel your cravings have been going up. So you want to monitor it so that doesn't cause a serious problem. So I'm

149
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:20.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I'm right, reading it almost seems that you know you want to identify your triggers because there's a little concerned.

150
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:36.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That with the tapering getting lower. You don't want them to be a slip. Is that accurate when I read. Okay, so what we have been doing in our work is just think about people, places and things. And what do you think

151
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those domains. My whole a target for you.

152
00:12:42.840 --> 00:13:02.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's certain individuals that are associated to your addiction or that give you feelings of guilt or shame that might make you want to use again. Are there any strong emotions attached that are parallel between when you last in the past and what emotion you are currently experiencing.

153
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.370
Robert Hammond: What I've noticed is a

154
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.900
Robert Hammond: Graduate group.

155
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.220
Robert Hammond: Or

156
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.020
Robert Hammond: Even like a big process right now.

157
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.950
Robert Hammond: Like I get like really nervous, I guess.

158
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.420
Robert Hammond: And this is when I started lighting up and I'll smoke.

159
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.630
Robert Hammond: So even if I haven't smoked all day like light up no matter what, like right then.

160
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:26.880
Robert Hammond: You're

161
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:42.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Doing so well and the individual. So is it still the same amount of intensity of anxiety as when we first met, is it the same hasn't lowered or has it increased

162
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:46.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Increased

163
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.290
Robert Hammond: Yeah, but look at get more and more anxious like

164
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.230
Robert Hammond: I got a bad anxious when it's like more

165
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:53.670
Robert Hammond: Like a good engineer.

166
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's the difference between a good anxious versus back into

167
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.920
Robert Hammond: The bed. He is when I'm like worried about something.

168
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.760
Imaginary

169
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

170
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.330
Robert Hammond: It's, it's not like I'm worried. It's just like

171
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.600
Robert Hammond: Oh no, not

172
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.720
Robert Hammond: Really worried you like something else.

173
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.300
Robert Hammond: Like I said, it's like more exciting.

174
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:29.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, OK. OK. So would that be more of a better distinction of it that it's more anticipation than a variety

175
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.590
Robert Hammond: Right.

176
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:44.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because like I said, when people have diagnosis of like depression and anxiety any emotion that feels uncomfortable. They tend to just totally into that that descriptor.

177
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:53.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it's a rough day they I'm actually I felt the press and sometimes it really wasn't that maybe they were hungry. Maybe they were irritated.

178
00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:02.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And because they don't really know the poor of the emotion or feeling that it's it's almost impossible to adequately address

179
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What the underlying thing is that creates that so having anticipation is actually good. You know, um, it creates like

180
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: an expectation of curiosity of, Hey, I wonder what's going to happen. So, um, that's something good and if you

181
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:30.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think of it in that aspect that not getting anxious about this, but I'm more anticipating what are we going to talk about in group or

182
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know what we talked about in this individual session that looks a lot different than come into group.

183
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:47.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And actually being anxious because I think the doctor is going to want to put me down another bills and I'm not ready. You see the difference between those things. Those are two different emotions.

184
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even as I shared those two different descriptions. My body responded in a different way.

185
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:05.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I made that statement about Dr. Mike taper me and I'm not ready for that my heartbeat, a little quicker versus anticipation of

186
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious. I wonder what we're going to talk about in this session was a little more chill. So I'm to help with the triggers. Robert, I would encourage you that whenever you have that fight that you're anxious to really challenge if this thing's it or if it's any other emotional

187
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:44.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and the relevance to that, based on what you said you wanted in your band survey is that I'm having a better understanding of what your emotions are then helps you to know how to respond to

188
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.490
That

189
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:56.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm alive when you told me you had that anxiety of that panic attack and you have actually what to do because you experienced it before so you know how to calm yourself down.

190
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But from what you share with me anxiety. Puts you in an element of don't know what to do. So I'll just smoke to calm myself down

191
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:23.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what if, you know, instead of thinking this is inside you were able to really pinpoint that okay what I'm experiencing really isn't anxiety. Maybe I'm excited.

192
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe I'm worried

193
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe I'm embarrassed.

194
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ashamed

195
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To say hi furnace, you know,

196
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:53.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it a certain time of the day that group happens or individual sessions happen that maybe has nothing to do about what's happening, but it's the timing of the day for you notice you kind of act a little different.

197
00:17:53.910 --> 00:18:02.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So these are just different elements to assess with things i and this will also help you to realize okay

198
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The things I is a trigger for me to want to use again.

199
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:15.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then I'll need to really properly identify when anxiety is presented itself. And what I'm going to do about it.

200
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what you do when you have that panic attack about everything else.

201
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did you understand about what I just said.

202
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.580
Robert Hammond: Yeah, I just, I noticed something today that that happened with one of my friend Jackie bug.

203
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.510
Robert Hammond: You just offer BE A FUCKING COOKIE AND

204
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:51.900
Robert Hammond: And the response I gave him when I I told you as your I'll take one he's oh yeah of course they'll take one or something like set with unit was weird because I was like, I kept on thinking about it. Like why would you say that like corn and I like that.

205
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

206
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.050
Robert Hammond: You know, after I

207
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.490
Robert Hammond: Did yesterday, I was like, just because you know, back in the day I was still there.

208
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.620
Robert Hammond: So,

209
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.300
Robert Hammond: It was a it was like, I hurt my feelings. I was all dripping on it.

210
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.330
Robert Hammond: Normally I wouldn't even care.

211
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

212
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:32.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To as you continue to go through this journey of long term sobriety. You're addicted brain will try to present itself and kind of remind you of all the reasons by using the past, whether it be guilt, shame, or why it's isolate yourself from other people.

213
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:50.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so some of the irrational beliefs that we have that allows us to experience that feeling of guilt, shame or isolation is jumping to conclusions. Right. So who knows if he said

214
00:19:52.230 --> 00:20:01.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She'll take that cookie because he knows a good cookie, you know, or he knows around this time of day, everybody wants to snack, we know, is everybody has a sweet tooth. So, of course,

215
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What it had nothing to do with what your weight was in the path.

216
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:08.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

217
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.780
Robert Hammond: I know that's what I do is I didn't even know me like doing so.

218
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.770
Yeah.

219
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:21.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. But you see how our brain. If we don't catch the fights. It will just run on reckless

220
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:33.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like a toddler in a grocery store. All right next to the candy and be a total know if it doesn't get team is going to do it every one.

221
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.040
Robert Hammond: Right.

222
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:42.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So by you sitting there and thinking, Why am I doing affiliate about this this comment back in your brain.

223
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:59.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The extra time to really process it and compartmentalize this like it was that really a threatening comment was that really is to comment. Okay, let's take the high road and process this up here in the rational brain. And so that's what you did.

224
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There brain automatically wanted to take the low road and just feel the addict Robert felt everything. And that's what caused him to use

225
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:20.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The only way to stop that reactionary Robert is to think in process. And that's what you did.

226
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:29.400
Robert Hammond: Right, does that, that kind of thing would have got me to use do start feeling more and more than I would have ended up drinking or something.

227
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:29.880
Yeah.

228
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:31.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

229
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:50.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you're doing the work. It's just a matter of recognizing that oh I didn't do that. I I tapped into my rational brain instead of taking the lower route in my brain, which just act solely on emotions and all it does is work in fight, flight, or freeze.

230
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when he said that, um,

231
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:13.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What exactly after after he made that comment. What were the range of emotions that you went through in processing to get you to the point

232
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh,

233
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.320
Robert Hammond: Whatever versus like I like right off the bat, I got mad.

234
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.870
Robert Hammond: I felt like it was anger and I was like,

235
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.450
Robert Hammond: Oh no, I got the anger. And I started thinking about. I was like, Why do I keep thinking about it like

236
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.490
Robert Hammond: Because it kept on coming up in my head.

237
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I started feeling like

238
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.890
Robert Hammond: Well, it's not anger than just like we can hurt.

239
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:38.820
And

240
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.890
Robert Hammond: We're going to get

241
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.180
Robert Hammond: And then I started thinking, why did you hurt my feelings, because I'm not even pretty bad anymore.

242
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.940
Robert Hammond: And even when I work like that. It didn't even bother me then.

243
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.450
Robert Hammond: So it's

244
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to hurt. Yeah.

245
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:09.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is good work that you're doing. Robert, because you're getting curious about why you feel the way you feel. And if there's any any reason why she feeling

246
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so carry this same process in the relationships that will be establish romantically personally and identifying, you know, okay, what I'm feeling here. Is this just me operating my emotions or is this really processing this want to take time.

247
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

248
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:45.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To be able to activate the higher road of the brain is to stop yourself and you're about to do yet initially

249
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then process and then respond

250
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:59.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To be you being more patient with yourself and not being reactionary, which I don't think will be difficult for you because

251
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:15.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see you as like an attentive listener, comma, comma pauses and listens before just automatically speaking, you seem like you're already a processor a thinker. So this out. See this mean below a big stretch for you.

252
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:27.030
Robert Hammond: I know as I was all driven out two days. I started getting myself mad about somebody who actually owns me some stuff.

253
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.200
Robert Hammond: I let him borrow a video camera mine.

254
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.400
Robert Hammond: And then I let him borrow a phone on top of that.

255
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.920
Robert Hammond: And they ended up losing both of them.

256
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:41.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

257
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.920
Robert Hammond: Now, I was like, Okay, this is a bunch of crap. I was on I'm expecting this person pay me back and she hasn't done it yet.

258
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.640
Robert Hammond: And I was just thinking today. I was like getting myself while we're done.

259
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.220
Robert Hammond: Because I haven't heard from her nothing, and then

260
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.530
Robert Hammond: I told myself, I'm going to wait for a while.

261
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.350
Robert Hammond: Until after group, but I get older.

262
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: After

263
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We talked

264
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:02.970
Robert Hammond: And just by waiting

265
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.500
She's already texted me twice.

266
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.960
Robert Hammond: So,

267
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's pretty cool. That

268
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.810
Robert Hammond: You know, I just took a moment they actually notified me or got a hold of me.

269
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

270
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:15.900
Robert Hammond: So I would have

271
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.760
Robert Hammond: Reacted and I would overreact.

272
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:34.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if there's moments where you don't get the opportunity to activate the higher brain and overreact. Are you responsible for your reactions. It's not too late to you know what covered from

273
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is where the work comes in.

274
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:45.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Coming back after the fact, asking for forgiveness. So, do what you need to do to make the conflict, you know,

275
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be the you know reestablished

276
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.420
Robert Hammond: Right.

277
00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:02.040
Robert Hammond: See that same person as install reminds me of a queen. She asked me about how to do that because she had blown up on somebody kicked him out of her car.

278
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.070
Robert Hammond: Made a walk and everything.

279
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.410
Robert Hammond: And she turned around and she was in the room.

280
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now people are asking you for advice.

281
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.190
Robert Hammond: Right, because I was like

282
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.490
Robert Hammond: Just go down with it on my way, you know, on your borders, but

283
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I said,

284
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.280
Robert Hammond: What did he tell them

285
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

286
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you go

287
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:33.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, what would you like for future sessions and what, what would you like to discuss. We've talked about

288
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know the trauma for the past briefly talked about

289
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:49.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Regain custody of your son. Discuss Relationships boundaries kind of navigate conflict, what's been most helpful for you.

290
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.580
Robert Hammond: Don't want to be like, I know I still wonder about like give us individually.

291
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.610
Robert Hammond: I know it still has an effect on me now.

292
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:10.920
Robert Hammond: I could almost like

293
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.220
Robert Hammond: Like I wanted or something or

294
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:15.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Attended

295
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.430
Robert Hammond: Like

296
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.540
Robert Hammond: I know it gets bored easy for me to be taken advantage of.

297
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some just being treated like shit.

298
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:29.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

299
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.350
Robert Hammond: So it's going

300
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.550
To be

301
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I'm research has shown that people victims of childhood abuse or PTSD.

302
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They tend to repeat the cycle.

303
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:54.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They will keep experiences because subconsciously, they're hoping that they'll be able to

304
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Desert mastery or

305
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Finally, over the situation.

306
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's like the movie that has all these different ending

307
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're hoping that eventually they'll get to that happy in the same setting.

308
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:29.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so what that looks like. Is what you said going to environments, that's not healthy, that you see the red flag and you get her all over again. But because of the trauma, you've experienced you've almost been conditioned

309
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:40.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To repeat the same cycle because of consciously, you just want to exert mastery over what you couldn't control in the past.

310
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the way to address that is to go back and research. Okay.

311
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:55.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I had no control over being abused as a child, but now I'm an adult.

312
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what areas do I want control over.

313
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:09.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What areas. Am I willing to release some of my control and what areas do I realize I have absolutely no control over the beginning

314
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:21.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Once you have those different domains in place your brain begins to reprocess what are safe and unsafe environment.

315
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:26.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because now it's not rerouting you back to the past.

316
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That unhealthy relationship, you were in was kind of like you reclaim that childhood. Let me go back to

317
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: an abusive situation.

318
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I can fix it. I can make it work. It doesn't have to be this bad

319
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you saw the outcome.

320
00:29:51.480 --> 00:30:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So being present is really key and not you know you explore the past so you can learn about it, but the present day is where you activate all the tools so that you don't have to repeat the past

321
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:23.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you want. We could, we could talk about that the next session if it helps you for some patients. I've had them write letters to

322
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:34.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, whoever it was that abused them. There was an opportunity to just let it all out. And then we read the letter in the session in the process from there.

323
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then we work backwards.

324
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.190
When

325
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:45.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whenever you find helpful. I know some people have felt the relief and being able to get all thoughts out on paper.

326
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:56.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Before processing it and some people. They just want a short session and just a memory comes up, they just talk about it and go from there.

327
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.840
Robert Hammond: Alright, yeah, I've done that. That right one for

328
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.160
Robert Hammond: That actually

329
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go through that to a couple people before too.

330
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that something you'd like to explore the next time we meet. Yeah.

331
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.800
Okay.

332
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's do that.

333
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the next session.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.280

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, I'll see you then.

338
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.030
