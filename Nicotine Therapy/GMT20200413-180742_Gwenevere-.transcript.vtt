Debbie Barker: To us. All right. She just was going through withdrawals. I guess in wasn't acting like yourself when making no sense about what she was saying, or anything like that. I didn't know where she had took an overdose or or what was going on. So I ended up calling 911 and they kept her overnight.

21
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250

34
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If it is physicians have been unable to determine what it is. So just so you know, since college, and I'm 50

35
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So I spend with me so long that I forget. And so I can look really goofy and I do apologize for that.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But that'll be. That's what I'm doing.

Debbie Barker: The first

40
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Idea. Okay.

41
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:07.740
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I would have been the hospital at least once or twice a year with pneumonia and then they started testing me for my allergies and come to find out I'm allergic everything around

Gwenevere Abriel: What was she doing mask.

70
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:35.010
Debbie Barker: Um, she was talking and not making no sense, getting into the doors, you know, an emptying the doors out and you know into the bathroom moving things around. And, you know, talking to herself, and like just not making any sense at all.

71
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.550
Debbie Barker: Or she was doing anyway.

72
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.920

Yeah.

79
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.790

Debbie Barker: She's 38

86
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.120

88
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.690

89
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:59.100

90
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, the likelihood of that happening is so low, and right to think

91
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That happened twice to one person.

92
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.520
Debbie Barker: We're going to try to understand her. Yeah.

93
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.420

96
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:48.450
Debbie Barker: He just got sicker. As the years went by, of course, he was older than her. But hopefully, she'll find somebody around her age. And she's got a boyfriend now. But he's he's just pretty mean to my opinion.

97
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He's mean

98
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.550
Debbie Barker: I think so. My boyfriend, talk to me that way.

99
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.220

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Since she's been living with you. Have you tried to get her into treatment and she refused, or there's been some treatment and it failed.

103
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.810
Debbie Barker: There's been some treatment and it's found

104
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.800

For you.

184
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, good, good.

185
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the past, um,

186
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got this in front of Gannett I call it a relapse prevention plan and it evolves over the months that you and I are going to work together. I'll hear something and I might put it in there and it will start to grow.

187
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things is a category of an emotional trigger. One of them's a relationship trigger. One of them is an event or situation that's going to trigger for substance use in the past and I already know one of them. I can type it in before you can say it is going to be pain.

188
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm already gonna put that one in. So that was covered already

189
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But there. There is a sometimes

190
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be triggered by something other than physical pain the distress of an emotional pain can be just as distressing and same part of the brain processes physical pain as it does emotional pain, you can feel

191
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life threatening and just awful.

192
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at your own in the past, what has been an emotion that has been a trigger for your substance use, like let's say you wanted to escape that feeling. I don't want to feel it. I don't want to think about it.

193
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.790
Debbie Barker: If I think about in you the abuse from the past.

194
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the emotion you feel when you used to think about it, you would kind of think about it. And then what was the emotion and emotion is different from feeling when I say feeling I'll probably be referring to the body like

195
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The stomach turning a tight chest type job. Those will be those are physical feelings, but no emotions are happy, sad busted angry scared jealous right those are emotions.

196
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger. Anger. That's the one.

197
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: In your family.

198
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I said your thing in your family. The way you were raised, where you raise when you were coming up that anger wasn't acceptable for a child to have

199
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:36.870
Debbie Barker: Yo,

200
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.490
Okay.

201
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.320
Debbie Barker: I had a good mom but I didn't have a very good father

202
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And he was an alcoholic.

203
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.410
Debbie Barker: When he was an alcoholic in a child.

204
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.730
Debbie Barker: He sexually abused me when I was a child.

205
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.360

Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been able to sit with or is there because notice how on that topic. There was a

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: An explanation shared about why what mom did

225
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The needs of your brother and sister superseded yours, somehow, is it okay if you and I don't agree on that.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were angry. And can I just hear what the angry voice used to say like in your head like

231
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.070
Debbie Barker: I just couldn't understand why she wouldn't leave my father for that reason.

232
00:23:53.910 --> 00:24:01.020
Debbie Barker: But she wasn't a very strong woman like you said she was sick all the time and she didn't have any education.

233
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:24.330
Debbie Barker: My mom never worked a day in their life, except for, you know, she sewed on this. My dad was an approach turn when they had big jobs for like first cafeteria and things like that where she would. So on things like that. But as far as the job she never had a job.

234
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And I thought I was hearing that she was trying to go to school.

235
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.180
No.

236
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:42.360

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:38.760
Debbie Barker: Hmm.

253
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your boyfriend asking you a question.

254
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Your hair up cute. Okay.

257
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's I'm gonna take a little look

258
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote something down I wrote down in the past and trigger has been maybe anger.

259
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: At some of that history in the past may have or you tell me may have been a reason to use drugs and alcohol sort of to escape thinking about or reliving those memories that sound right. In the past it used to be like that.

260
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.170
Still

261
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And

262
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And still currently. Does that ever happen where something might come up and you don't want to think about it. Don't want to remember don't want to feel and instead

263
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You think, well, hey, I've smoked weed for quite a while, or I'm just going to go reach for something and not feel that feeling, does it still come up even to this day.

264
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.040
Debbie Barker: You know, it does not as bad as what it used to do. Okay.

265
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.230
Debbie Barker: I get many go out and stomp on his grave and call him everything in the books.

266
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.710
Debbie Barker: Well, I tell

267
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.950
Debbie Barker: I don't know it.

268
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.850
Debbie Barker: No, it's a funny way to do it, but it has helped

269
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.960
Debbie Barker: Got my anger out anyway.

270
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

271
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: He's dead.

272
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're not, you got to keep living and we can we can sort of say,

273
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out that some of our work together might be changing that relationship with that memory if there's any charge left in it. And that's something we can do together but

274
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

275
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.420
Debbie Barker: Good. That makes me feel bad, is, you know, I hope you didn't do anything to anybody else.

276
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.750
Debbie Barker: That what you know I think about

277
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Okay.

278
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you concerned, like the worst thing that could happen is to your own children, is that the worst fear.

279
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.350
Debbie Barker: Where you didn't. I know we didn't touch my kids.

280
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.950
Okay.

281
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.410
Debbie Barker: He was told.

282
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.100
Debbie Barker: I heard

283
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.630
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

284
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:20.370
Debbie Barker: I tell you,

285
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:29.220
Debbie Barker: And of course I didn't leave him, you know, along with my girls for very long, either. And my mom was always right there.

286
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.750
Debbie Barker: My girls would have spoke up

287
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that they were raised with really knowing their, their physical their emotional boundaries.

288
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

289
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you said, I hope he didn't do it do anything to anybody else. What's that worst fear, then

290
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:14.820
Debbie Barker: That that had a difficult time as I did with things and you know having to get their feelings all straightened back down because that's not an easy thing to live with it, you know, even as an adult woman.

291
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.220
Debbie Barker: You know,

292
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.190
Debbie Barker: Anyone made a lot of bad towards is when I was younger, because of that.

293
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:32.370
Debbie Barker: I wish I could have finished school and you know had went to college and stuff, but just didn't do it.

294
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:41.520
Debbie Barker: It took me a long time to get them fillings striking down, you know, and to know that it wasn't my fault.

295
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What helped you the most with. It's not my fault. What really was a turning point for you.

296
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.760
Debbie Barker: To know that there's all kinds of men like him on this world.

297
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.230
Debbie Barker: Is the ugly, but it's the truth.

298
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.860
Debbie Barker: Unfortunately,

299
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So knowing that there are more out there like that sort of somehow that lifted the burden as if you had anything to do with the blame like that helps knowing there's more like that.

300
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there anything else that helped

301
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:32.370
Debbie Barker: Oh, I'm I'm wanting to quite a bit more. Yeah. Don't turn because again.

302
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.140
Debbie Barker: I'm hanging on to the phone for a minute. Okay.

303
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.070
Debbie Barker: Again, hopefully it won't throw you on the floor again.

304
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.260
Debbie Barker: If it does, well you know what happened.

305
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.830
Debbie Barker: The phone went wacky. Yeah.

306
00:30:51.060 --> 00:31:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I, I am grateful that you were able to connect with a professional that you could sort of turn turn that blame where it belongs, which is to that behavior and to the person that engaged in that behavior and had nothing to do with you.

307
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad to know that.

308
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.690
Debbie Barker: When you're challenged you don't know any, that kind of thing.

309
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.190
You know,

310
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.140
Debbie Barker: Kids don't come up with that just off the wall, that's for sure.

311
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And was there any working through anger towards your mother as well to work through that part as well.

312
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.660
Debbie Barker: Yeah, okay. Yeah.

313
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:49.020
Debbie Barker: Good to go up a little bit to understand that mom just wasn't strong enough to raise the three of us like that she had no education. She was raised on the farm.

314
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.080
Debbie Barker: Mary data, a week before she graduated

315
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.650
Debbie Barker: I really think my dad just controlled their life.

316
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.810
Debbie Barker: And usually them kind of men do that.

317
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see anything similar to

318
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The behavior of Kathy's boyfriend and your father. Do you see any similarities between the two.

319
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.650
Debbie Barker: No.

320
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:34.170
Debbie Barker: I don't know what his excuses for being mean. He says he got some quarters something in his brain that makes them like that, but I don't believe that.

321
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So he did. He is not controlling doesn't try to control Kathy.

322
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.780
Debbie Barker: No, he doesn't.

323
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.430
Debbie Barker: Want to know where she is all the time, but he doesn't try to control

324
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:54.600
Debbie Barker: He lives in Texas and we live in New Mexico. He just lives over the Texas border, though.

325
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.440
Debbie Barker: It come last weekend spend a night with her.

326
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:05.700
Debbie Barker: Everybody, you know, we're just kind of scared kitchen this right now. So everybody pretty much hunker down

327
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.480
Hey,

328
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So we touched on.

329
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger and

330
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there ever a period in your life where you know your counselor probably worked through any kind of shame from the past. Right. She probably helped you or he helped you work through that.

331
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.590
Yeah.

332
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I was hearing you say, well, it's not my fault will typically people until they've sort of work through it. They think somehow I'm bad, I'm bad

333
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:49.200
Debbie Barker: I'll tell you what helped helped me the most out of all of it because my grandmother never believed to me and

334
00:33:49.560 --> 00:34:01.620
Debbie Barker: Years, not too long before she died. She apologized to be for being so mean to me all my life and that she farming believed what my dad did

335
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.450
Debbie Barker: But that that helped a lot that she apologized to me.

336
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah we we we people. We really need to be believed.

337
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't

338
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:23.910
Debbie Barker: Mean to me all the time, no matter what I did. If I'm more short dress long dress just nothing ever satisfied my grandmother

339
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: She ever say what her history was to explain

340
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:31.980
No.

341
00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.050
Debbie Barker: No.

342
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.070
Debbie Barker: She just didn't want to believe it. The truth.

343
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:59.550
Debbie Barker: I think we were all together one Christmas up in Clovis and all my aunts and uncles were there and she just looked around and she asked, so did Melbourne do what Debbie said, and all of them said, Yes, ma'am. He sure did. And that's when she apologized to me.

344
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that her son.

345
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's why. Right. We don't want to believe our own side do such things. Yeah.

346
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And that feels like a real turning point like having had that apology really felt good.

347
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Wonderful.

348
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:36.420
Debbie Barker: Good couldn't understand why she was so mean to me all the mirrors over nothing. You know, because I always tried to pleaser always brought the girls to see her.

349
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.430
Debbie Barker: Always make sure

350
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I do to this day. Understand, do you have a little story in your head about why she was so mean to have a story that you have in your, you do know why.

351
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:53.340
She

352
00:35:54.810 --> 00:36:04.470
Debbie Barker: I don't know, I just always look down on me because I left home early. And everybody thought I was nothing but a troublemaker. But I never done any trouble.

353
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:15.510
Debbie Barker: You know, there's never been any trouble with the law or anything like that. I'm behaving myself. And when I was old enough, I got a job and supported myself from there on out.

354
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No understanding

355
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Of why

356
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference like you haven't you have an understanding about why your mom did what she did, but not a real understanding, you can say, well, she was always grounded was always mean

357
00:36:48.750 --> 00:37:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say that she apologized. But what the psychological reasoning was that grandma took out these feelings on you. I wonder what was going on with her history. Wonder what

358
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:15.990
Debbie Barker: I know I've wondered that too. I even had an uncle that my dad abused and sexually abused and he swore he would get even with them to his oldest daughter, which is me.

359
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:28.260
Debbie Barker: Well, I let my uncle SPILL HIS GUTS and SPILL HIS GUTS, and he finally came out with what was you know that he would, he wanted to have sex with me or whatever. I told him to get

360
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:39.810
Debbie Barker: Get out of my house and then never come back. I never wanted to see him again really hurt my feelings. He always come to see me and I thought he loved to me and

361
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.250
Debbie Barker: That will donate it all.

362
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that was your grandma's

363
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.990
Debbie Barker: That was my grandmother's youngest son my father's youngest brother.

364
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.190
Yeah.

365
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.660
Debbie Barker: Just don't want him around me anymore.

366
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes.

367
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I concur. I completely concur. I'm trying to just look in our generationally if for

368
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What's grandma's name.

369
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.840
Debbie Barker: Laura.

370
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

371
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.260
Debbie Barker: Laura. Yeah.

372
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If grandma Laura hurt herself for her to have two boys. So as we known as the acting in such a unhealthy way makes me think something may have been going on with grandma.

373
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.170
Debbie Barker: Yo, with grandma or grandpa. I often wondered that.

374
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, because it does get passed down

375
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, again,

376
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:19.170
Debbie Barker: My grandfather died when I was about eight years old. So I remember being around him a lot. And he was a good Christian man, but he never tried anything or he would just a good Grandpa.

377
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad.

378
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:34.740
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I spent most of my time when I'm going to get out on the farm during the summers with my mountains pants.

379
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Those were good Christian folk

380
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.730
Yes.

381
00:39:50.850 --> 00:40:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you currently still have any intrusive things that come in to your dreams. Do you have any sort of workshop or still sort of coming up into your dream life.

382
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:09.450
Debbie Barker: Know, every now and then I'll have creeping dream or something like that never wake me up, but it don't have anything to do with that.

383
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:10.470
Okay.

384
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's can put some turn back to this relapse prevention plan.

385
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got this emotion anger in there, but I'm guessing that there are other emotions and I just would like to hear them from you, what emotions names of them in the past, used to be a trigger for substance use, besides anger.

386
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.560
Debbie Barker: When I get really sad about something.

387
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.480
Debbie Barker: That when things were out of my control.

388
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how do you feel when you're not in control. What's an emotion to describe that your hands. I'm not in control. I don't feel in control.

389
00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.820
Debbie Barker: Pretty helpless sometime

390
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.660
You

391
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Said. That's an awful feeling

392
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

393
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Any others that you can kind of remember boy. Now I see in, in retrospect,

394
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I was having this emotion and I didn't want to feel it. And so then I would reach for a substance outside myself and

395
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other emotions.

396
00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.860
Debbie Barker: Maybe when I was really down about line.

397
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that depressed.

398
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:32.730
You know,

399
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.000
Debbie Barker: Don't get don't worry too often.

400
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: About how many times a year. Do you get down about your life.

401
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.520
Debbie Barker: Maybe about three or four times a year.

402
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have a pattern to it. Notice, and keeps happening right around the same time.

403
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.740
Debbie Barker: No, not really. Um,

404
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.760
Debbie Barker: Easter was different yesterday, but that's the way it was for everybody.

405
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that because your daughter was in the hospital. So is different.

406
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:17.340
Debbie Barker: No, just, I'm not be an emerald to get together as a family, you know, and that sort of thing, like we always do.

407
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.570
Debbie Barker: We didn't have a big family dinner or anything like that yesterday.

408
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.010
Debbie Barker: And we always get together and have a nice dinner on Easter.

409
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that because you guys are sequestered you're sort of

410
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:35.340
Russia.

411
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

412
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm kind of kind of lighten it up a little bit here and mentioned, I know you're learning the technology.

413
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to remind you, this can be kind of fun for families to you can actually meet in zoom

414
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Up with your family and you can have Sunday dinners everybody

415
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to have meat and potatoes and we're going to also the same recipe. This is the family, the family run

416
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:19.410
Debbie Barker: I gotta get my sister's phone in in like that. So at least she she's got Facebook and messaging from that we can talk back and forth and so on. She can't read or write. Very good, but I think she wouldn't enjoy the videos and things like that.

417
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't that be fun you guys right you can be

418
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: All

419
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be cracking jokes on each other about oh I don't make my life that you make yours like this you don't you know you have some fun.

420
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.380
Yeah.

421
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the time to use our technology and not feel alone and they see

422
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we can use this technology, you can actually maybe get even closer to your sister, believe it or not, by having a Sunday we always do this or pick a day.

423
00:43:50.640 --> 00:44:05.580
Debbie Barker: Yeah, when I call her I'll push the camera so that she can see me on up and then she'll push the camera so I can see her on I'm going to get her on Facebook, so she can get on messenger and and be able to do that.

424
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just something something fun to think about

425
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:09.300
Yeah.

426
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And little things like we can have

427
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What would we say book club or we can pick a topic and we can you know whether it's cooking that day or whatever it is we can kind of set a little theme that can be be a nice routine and nice ritual.

428
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:39.030
Debbie Barker: I can remember my boyfriend said that this that you can teach other on on the phone and I can't remember who I called and I woke him up and I said, look, look, look. And he was just so amazed.

429
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.050
Debbie Barker: You know I

430
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:40.770
