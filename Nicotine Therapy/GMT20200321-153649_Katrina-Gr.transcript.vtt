9
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.050
Nicholas goddess. First, although he got confused and went to the clinic in person. So maybe a little late.

10
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.570
His Date of Birth is

11
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.280
At

12
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:18.570
Galaxy S8+: 188 though. Three years later, I went to Methadone clinic in Portland. And that's when I tried to stop for the first time, you know, three years in and I didn't like it.

13
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.150
Galaxy S8+: And then I was on methadone.

14
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.420
Galaxy S8+: Which really worked for about

15
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.440
Galaxy S8+: all the way till

16
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.710
Galaxy S8+: 2000

17
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.230
Galaxy S8+: It was pretty steady I'd stayed in the dedicated to the clinic.

18
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.560
Galaxy S8+: For, you know, eight years.

19
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.400
Katrina Groves: Wow. Every day going in every day. Well,

20
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.870
Galaxy S8+: What so you graduate.

21
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.820
Galaxy S8+: Yeah. So once I showed him that I was going to be clean and I was dedicated the program about three months in

22
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.640
Galaxy S8+: They start giving you take homes and they trust you more and more with the take homes until you get all the way up to a month worth and you just go in. Once a month.

23
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.960
Wow.

24
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.540
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, and

25
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.140
Galaxy S8+: They just give you a prescription. They give it all to you right there in the clinic, you have to go pharmacy or anything like that. They give you the liquid. All right there in the clinic and

26
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.330
Galaxy S8+: They do random with you, random us or random bottle checks and they so they say you know you can't be doing anything with it, except for taking it.

27
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.720
Galaxy S8+: Yeah.

28
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.270
Galaxy S8+: And then when that failed is when I moved down here because I moved away from the clinic. Then there was no methadone here. I didn't know that. And

29
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.210
Katrina Groves: So you mean when it failed. You mean you made a decision to, hey, I'm going to move. Why did you make that decision.

30
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.050
Um,

31
00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.770
Galaxy S8+: There was a lot of things that happened. We were going to get a house up there and that didn't work out. And then my mom lives here. And so she said, well, you guys can come down here.

32
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.210
Galaxy S8+: You know, save some money until you guys can go back and

33
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.670
Galaxy S8+: Try again for another house.

34
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:24.240
Galaxy S8+: There was a lot of things that happened back then with the house and stuff that we were trying to get. And so when I moved down here. I moved away from the Methadone clinic and that's when I felt

35
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.100
Galaxy S8+: Since it's really hard to come off the Methadone

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.760
Galaxy S8+: And that's when I went to heroin and that was 2016

37
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.180
Galaxy S8+: Wow yeah and and then it was just all bad. From there, because it wasn't just heroin because you get into the party scene again and it was

38
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:53.520
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, whatever they had. And then it was just bad. And then it became homeless and it was a train wreck. It was a really, really, really bad time for me here.

39
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.510
Galaxy S8+: Until I finally found this place.

40
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.950
Galaxy S8+: With the Suboxone and all that and I

41
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.090
Katrina Groves: Actually was humble. Humble first year at me. Yeah.

42
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:27.900
Galaxy S8+: Well, I found this place. First, but I could never make it in here because I was homeless and then I was embarrassed to come in because I was dirty and you know I didn't. I was just, yeah, it was just really hard to get here and I had some really bad medical issues I

43
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.520
Galaxy S8+: I had been through a fire someone tried to kill me in my shop and

44
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.890
Galaxy S8+: And that's when

45
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:52.230
Galaxy S8+: Naomi and Jennifer from CPS when I was going in for visit. They told me they had like an intervention with me and they told me I had to go to humble to save my life and that's when I did it. And so, Naomi drove me all the way down there to waterfront.

46
00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:05.730
Galaxy S8+: And admitted me in there and I went through their program and then graduated and came back here and I could finally dedicate myself to this boxing program here and I did.

47
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.600
Katrina Groves: And so you were clean. I think around. I don't remember.

48
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.200
Katrina Groves: What one was your clean data and humble.

49
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.850
Galaxy S8+: It's December 21 2018

50
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.080
Katrina Groves: Nice.

51
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.550
Galaxy S8+: And I've been clean ever since.

52
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.350
Katrina Groves: That's great.

53
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.980
Yeah.

54
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.510
Galaxy S8+: Yeah.

55
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.230
Katrina Groves: That's a lot to go through. Yeah. Um, do you feel like the Suboxone works as well as the methadone or you like it better or worse or the same

56
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.600
Galaxy S8+: Um, so with the with the Methadone

57
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.110
Galaxy S8+: It would still get me high

58
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.120
Galaxy S8+: So I would say the Suboxone is better because it's not like that with the Suboxone

59
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.870
Galaxy S8+: So they they both have pros and cons. I think in the end the probably the same, I would say I would probably say the same.

60
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.720
Katrina Groves: What's the cons for you.

61
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.070
Katrina Groves: The downside of the Suboxone what what's the downside.

62
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.790
Galaxy S8+: Just don't have to take it all the time. Right. No, so

63
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:30.630
Galaxy S8+: It reminds me of, you know, having to depend on something. Exactly. I'd like to not have anything I want to get to the point where I don't have to have it. Of course, I mean, I'm sure everybody says, I

64
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.730
Katrina Groves: Know, not everybody does say that

65
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.350
Katrina Groves: Oh really now.

66
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.280
Katrina Groves: Many people just want to stay on it for the rest of their lives so

67
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.990
Katrina Groves: That's, that's a good thought you we've talked maybe before about some blockade.

68
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:58.110
Katrina Groves: The shot. So at least that would take it away from the hand to mouth everyday thing and you can kind of get it out of your head, you know, once a month shot is so much better than

69
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:07.110
Katrina Groves: And it's not for people that have just started you know most Pete, you have to go through taking Suboxone for a while, till you're stable and then the shot really can help.

70
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.340
Galaxy S8+: Okay, so

71
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.380
Katrina Groves: We can think about that. Yeah.

72
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.060
Katrina Groves: And it doesn't. And you can always take her down and off of that too. Okay.

73
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.950
Katrina Groves: So, um, any other substances that you're

74
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.550
Katrina Groves: You were using before you told me a lot of them. But what did I marijuana to use marijuana

75
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.270
No.

76
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.380
Galaxy S8+: No, I, of course, have tried it and I've just had bad experiences with it and so

77
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.250
Galaxy S8+: an anxiety attack, stuff like that. It's not for me.

78
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.170
Katrina Groves: Okay, good. And Benz's value. Okay.

79
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.110
Galaxy S8+: No, I mean, like I said, Of course I've tried them but

80
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.950
Galaxy S8+: All it would do is making me go to sleep and then I couldn't do it couldn't go to work. I couldn't, I couldn't function.

81
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.260
Galaxy S8+: And I can't imagine

82
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.520
Galaxy S8+: why anybody would want to do that all the time. You know, I mean, you can

83
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.350
Katrina Groves: brands are different.

84
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:09.510
Galaxy S8+: Right so i mean i i like to stay active, productive, I have goals I have ambitions, I have things that that kills

85
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.490
Galaxy S8+: And yeah, not for me.

86
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.070
Katrina Groves: Great. And so, you are still taking the Suboxone three times a day.

87
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.840
Galaxy S8+: Yes, right.

88
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.330
Katrina Groves: And any other medication that you're taking right now for any medical problems. No.

89
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.410
Katrina Groves: You don't have thyroid problems or diabetes or

90
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.710
Katrina Groves: And allergies to any medicine.

91
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.330
Galaxy S8+: You were through my son. When I was a kid I broke out in hives. Okay.

92
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.640
Katrina Groves: I've got your other computer from the clinic on my left. So that's why I'm

93
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.630
Oh, yeah.

94
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.910
Galaxy S8+: That's cool.

95
00:08:49.500 --> 00:09:00.150
Katrina Groves: And you're so any family. Oh, I got family history here, but you don't know a lot about your family. Your mom, your mom still alive. Yeah.

96
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:00.720
Yeah.

97
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.780
Galaxy S8+: And she's a

98
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.710
Galaxy S8+: Her my dad are both hardcore alcoholics.

99
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.960
Galaxy S8+: And

100
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:17.880
Galaxy S8+: My dad that's as far as it goes. But my mom, not so much. We've even used together so it's

101
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.540
Galaxy S8+: And that's why I stay away from her now.

102
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:29.070
Galaxy S8+: But we have a rocky relationship because I think that the drugs have really changed through personality.

103
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.180
Galaxy S8+: And and a lot for the worst. It's really sad.

104
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.250
Galaxy S8+: I barely know or not.

105
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.270
Katrina Groves: Have a son who

106
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.610
Katrina Groves: Will not have to see his father, go through what you had to see your parents go through

107
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.740
Galaxy S8+: Right. Yeah, exactly.

108
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.200
Galaxy S8+: So I don't like drinking. So it's definitely going to be different.

109
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.440
Katrina Groves: Or drugs, you know, you're, you're breaking the cycle.

110
00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.730
Galaxy S8+: Oh yeah, definitely.

111
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.280
Katrina Groves: So any high blood pressure or heart disease and your family or strokes.

112
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.510
Galaxy S8+: Not that I know. I know there's been some cancers.

113
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.910
Galaxy S8+: But what kind of colon cancer. My grandfather breast cancer with my grandmother sister.

114
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.400
Galaxy S8+: And that's all I really, that's all I really know about

115
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.950
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, my grandmother is really healthy

116
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.350
Galaxy S8+: And your, your

117
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.620
Katrina Groves: Your grandparents on your dad side or alcoholics as well.

118
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.220

119
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.840
Katrina Groves: It looks like depression runs in the family. But now, like schizophrenia or

120
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.120
Katrina Groves: Any other and so has bipolar.

121
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:59.580
Galaxy S8+: I think my mom is because it's drug induced right but other than that, no, um,

122

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:28.350
Galaxy S8+: They actually demoted. Some people. So, of course, that got taken out of the loop or put to the side for a while, but now they're talking about it again.

150
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:37.380
Galaxy S8+: And I don't know if I wanted, if I want to do it or not. I mean, it's not that much money and I'm be taken on a lot more work so

151
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:50.910
Galaxy S8+: I don't know if the, I don't know if the pros outweigh the cons on that one. So I'm really, I'm thinking about it I but then again, I think it would be nice to have some more management under my belt, I guess, while I'm there.

152
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.400
Katrina Groves: You know, so what are your goals. You talked about you had goals and dreams and stuff. What are your long term goals.

153
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.460
Galaxy S8+: So I've been

154
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.970
Galaxy S8+: I've been working on my credit really really kind of hardcore. I got a couple of credit cards.

155
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.880
Galaxy S8+: Cool. And yeah, and I've been

156
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.200
Galaxy S8+: Buying car parts for okay so that's one of my dreams.

157
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.310
Katrina Groves: That

158
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.660
Galaxy S8+: You have it so.

159
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.790
Galaxy S8+: In fact, that's where I just was I got a new door for it that came in mail yesterday.

160
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.100
Galaxy S8+: So that's a big one. I'm spending like a lot of my free cash on that.

161
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.820
Galaxy S8+: To get up and going. So that's a big one.

162
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.620
Galaxy S8+: Let's see. I want to get my credit going

163
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:42.630
Galaxy S8+: I want to get into a bigger house and where I'm at. So that Jillian can move back in with me and Callum

164
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.030
Galaxy S8+: My son and

165
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.720
Galaxy S8+: So that's another big one and then

166
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.710
Galaxy S8+: So Job thing is good right now because I'm on probation.

167
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.760
Galaxy S8+: And

168
00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:05.010
Galaxy S8+: I'm kind of locked in with with my groups and things I'm doing for probation and then Suboxone and everything's kind of localized right here in town. And so I want to keep it.

169
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.830
Galaxy S8+: Keep it simple and that that job. It doesn't require too much of me just my time.

170
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.270
Galaxy S8+: It really easy.

171
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.560
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, so it's it's really kind of stress free

172
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:29.400
Galaxy S8+: And I've got myself in a place where everything is just kind of easy going for me, you know, to start off with this whole sobriety thing and everything. I don't want to stress myself out to Ben.

173
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.520
Katrina Groves: Sounds very, very wise.

174
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:33.990
Galaxy S8+: Right.

175
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.010
Galaxy S8+: Inside

176
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.670
Galaxy S8+: And so I don't talk to like anybody anymore. And if I do, it's just new clean sober people

177
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.510
Galaxy S8+: Most of the time it's just people that have never even experienced that side of life. You know what I mean.

178
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.600
Galaxy S8+: And that way you're not talking about the old things or things that you don't want to be involved in

179
00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:08.610
Galaxy S8+: It's just a refreshing, uh, you know, oh, let's go work on this Mars today. Oh, let's play some video games or, oh, let's go, let's go get a burger and talk about girls or you know what I mean, something like that. Like, like how it used to be.

180
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.600
Katrina Groves: Right.

181
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.130
Galaxy S8+: So it's really nice, you know,

182
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:12.960
Katrina Groves: Nice.

183
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.100
Galaxy S8+: Really reminded of it.

184
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:24.990
Katrina Groves: Okay. And so now we go, I want to go to a part where we do review systems, where can I go head to toe. I hope you're not freezing out there.

185
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.070
Don't know.

186
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.030
Galaxy S8+: Your local but it's all right. The sun's out so

187
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:38.400
Katrina Groves: One question I had first was any what legal problems do you have leftover you're on probation for what what happened.

188
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.600
So,

189
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:52.470
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, so the I was parked and I passed out from using the night before and I was actually living in the car with Jillian and my son.

190
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.010
Galaxy S8+: In this big truck thing and

191
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.400
Galaxy S8+: We were interest area and the cops had

192
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:11.250
Galaxy S8+: Pulled up to me to check on us, or whatever, and they caught me with heroin on me and stuff. And so the charge me with child endangerment because I had to heroin on me.

193
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.360
Galaxy S8+: And he was in the car, you know, there were sleeping in the back. And so

194
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.550
Galaxy S8+: That's what they charged me with but they lowered everything down.

195
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.610
Galaxy S8+: They even took the drug charges off.

196
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.670
Galaxy S8+: And they said if I go through a

197
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:34.080
Galaxy S8+: Probation and and I proved myself. You know what I mean. I had like goals that had to me. I met them all.

198
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.630
Galaxy S8+: And so they they promised they would take the drug charges off until that wouldn't linger.

199
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.570
Galaxy S8+: And, you know, hold me back from anything. And so I just had the child endangerment. That's it.

200
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.190
Galaxy S8+: That's all I had grain water.

201
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.440
Katrina Groves: How much longer. I'm cremation.

202
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.800
Galaxy S8+: So the initial was four years.

203
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.420
Galaxy S8+: Right, but

204
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:10.110
Galaxy S8+: They told me if I do everything right, which I have been then I'm eligible in 18 months to get the early release. So that's coming up really soon. And so I'm looking forward to that.

205
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.660
Katrina Groves: Wow, it's a good idea. Yeah.

206
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.770
Katrina Groves: It sounds to me like when you decide to make your mind up about something, you kind of do it 100%

207
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:29.400
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, especially if I'm passionate about it, you know, in, and this is something I'm really passionate about a lot of things involved with with. Yeah, definitely.

208
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:30.570
Galaxy S8+: Yeah.

209
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:39.150
Katrina Groves: You get and you get your feelings back to, which is a blessing and a curse. Sometimes I mean, are you still bombarded by your, your emotions. No.

210
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.220
Galaxy S8+: No, that's long path.

211
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.780
Good. Yep.

212
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.540
Katrina Groves: And then, were there any hospitalizations, you had for overdose or suicide or anything.

213
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.350
No.

214
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.520
Galaxy S8+: No, and any surgeries, you

215
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.110
Had Nope.

216
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.660
Katrina Groves: No tonsils, nothing.

217
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:09.240
Galaxy S8+: No, just my my wisdom teeth. But I don't think that really qualifies. I mean, that was, you know, okay, they had to get an impacted was in 2000 but that's where it all started. But I don't think it

218
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.920
Katrina Groves: Was not crazy.

219
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.960
Katrina Groves: Yeah, so

220
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.360
Galaxy S8+: The drugs are super powerful. And I think it's really underestimated the way they prescribe them.

221
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.500
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, I mean,

222
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.810
Galaxy S8+: I could have been just fine with my growth and I'm sure

223
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.330
Katrina Groves: Wow. I mean, the odds are you would have come across it at some point, but maybe not.

224
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.080
Katrina Groves: You're right.

225
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:35.370
Galaxy S8+: I mean, I did. I came across it all the time, but I would just, I would just either say no or avoid those people that were in my life, you know,

226
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.090
Katrina Groves: So, so how are you, is your the past week or so have you had any Fevers or chills.

Katrina Groves: As your dental now.

235
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:41.790
Galaxy S8+: I'm so, so I bought all this stuff and I studied on how to do it all myself.

236
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.580
Katrina Groves: Oh, that's right. Tony told me that that's pretty cool.

237
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.040
Galaxy S8+: And so I made this partial

238

240
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.430
Katrina Groves: You know business on the side. Dude, you need to charge

241
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.370
Galaxy S8+: I know that's, yeah.

242
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.560
Galaxy S8+: I was thinking about that.

243
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.600
Katrina Groves: I mean, just start out like 10

244
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.040
Katrina Groves: Bucks or, you know, you gotta have your money for making all the time and the

245
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:23.070
Galaxy S8+: Right, that's kind of great. Yeah. So yeah, I got into that and

246
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:33.630
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, that's that's been kind of fun. And I really needed this is this was really bad. And it got my confidence back. You know what I mean. So

247
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.450
Katrina Groves: All right. So on your neck any trouble with pain or stiffness in your neck.

248
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.400
Katrina Groves: Or the lamps in your neck. No.

249
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.170
Katrina Groves: Trouble with breathing shortness of breath. COUGH wheezing.

250
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.380
Galaxy S8+: Nothing out of the normal like cuz I've been out in the weather like

251
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.790
Galaxy S8+: You know my sister's wedding and stuff because it's so cold out, but that's

252
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.700
Galaxy S8+: That's normal. Yeah, I mean that's that's weather induce the, I don't have anything beyond that.

253
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.110
Katrina Groves: Um, any chest pain or chest pressure or heart palpitations.

254
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.830
Galaxy S8+: I'm know like sometimes I think I'm a hypochondriac.

255
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:24.390
Galaxy S8+: So because like I think I asked my doctor before if the occasional like

256
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.350
Galaxy S8+: Heart like skip or miss. Or you know what i mean it's letters sometimes like

257
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.960
Galaxy S8+: Once in a great, great while but I still, you know, if you don't know then that can freak you out. You know what I mean in

258
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.900
Galaxy S8+: A heartbeat like

259
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:49.080
Galaxy S8+: You know, thousands, hundreds of thousands of times. I mean, they're just sometimes in in their muscle like anything in the body and sometimes they have twitches and stuff so

260
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.920
Katrina Groves: Think of it like a spark plug in a car.

261
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:53.670
Galaxy S8+: Right.

262
00:21:54.390 --> 00:22:00.870
Katrina Groves: It just kind of misses once a while right okay it happens to everybody. The more caffeine you drink the worse.

263
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.660
Katrina Groves: I think the caffeine makes it worse. Yeah.

264
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:10.650
Galaxy S8+: And I do drink caffeine not hardcore and you have like I just had a coffee just known so so yeah I'm sure that contributes to it.

265
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:19.770
Katrina Groves: But it doesn't sound like you have heart problems like you don't have swelling in your legs. You don't have to wake up at night like not been able to breathe.

266
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.490
Galaxy S8+: No.

267
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.810
Katrina Groves: You don't get short of breath when you're trying to just do normal activities so

268
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.630
Galaxy S8+: You know I ride my bike every day. So, I mean, I think I keep up on that. Good.

269
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.760
Katrina Groves: And anything with your skin. Do you have dry skin dry nails and he rashes, or

270
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.720
itchiness.

271
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.080
Katrina Groves: Any weird malls, no.

272
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.170
Katrina Groves: Weird is not a medical term isn't

273

But I always track. Nope, okay.

278
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:18.300
Katrina Groves: And you don't have any problems with your muscles as far as weakness cramps pain.

279
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.060

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:34.350
Galaxy S8+: It was last summer or right right as fall started. She asked me when the last time I got my tetanus in it. Coincidentally, had been exactly 10 years. So wow okay I got the tetanus shot at

296
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.220
Katrina Groves: That one hurts.

297
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.370
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, yeah, it was, it was really painful for like a week.

298
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.420
Katrina Groves: So did you have any other bloodwork done yet for bright heart or where are you at with that.

299
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.220
Galaxy S8+: No, I just started with it.

300
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.250
Galaxy S8+: Okay. I barely have had like two little one on ones with them like this.

301
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.000
Katrina Groves: Right.

302
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.230
Galaxy S8+: And that was it. Yeah.

303
00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:03.600
Katrina Groves: Okay, I don't, I don't know what the I'm kind of new to this myself. So I know at some point they're going to want you to get blood work at the clinic.

304
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.500
Galaxy S8+: Right, okay.

305
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.770
Katrina Groves: You may want to call or ask them how to do that. And they also going to send you a urine cup in the mail.

306
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.430
Galaxy S8+: Okay.

307
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:21.750
Katrina Groves: Did they talk about that at all. Nope. So when they send you one. You don't want to open it right there. You want to just give them a call when it's convenient for you and say, hey, I want to do my pee test.

308
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:30.690
Katrina Groves: And then they'll actually walk you through it and tell you how to do it and you'll look at it together on the screen, or excuse me, or take a picture or something.

309
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.980
Galaxy S8+: It's kind of weird, but

310
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.150
Galaxy S8+: It's going to

311
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.170
Galaxy S8+: Set up

312
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.940
Katrina Groves: You still go to Tony's group.

313
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.930
Galaxy S8+: Yes, I do.

314
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.390
Katrina Groves: Great. And what what days do you go

315
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.470
Galaxy S8+: Well, I mean,

316
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:49.560
Galaxy S8+: Yeah, they've had a close this week. So, this week I didn't go my normal time. I usually go on Tuesday and Thursday morning at nine.

317
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:58.320
Katrina Groves: Okay, so, because we don't know what's happening with the virus stuff. I think they're, you know, the clinic is probably gonna do

318
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:11.550
Katrina Groves: Telemedicine like this. So I think Monday. She might be having a group and then I'm going to do them here on bright heart on Thursday at 10 so

319
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:22.590
Katrina Groves: Between those two yeah please keep in touch with Tony. She's awesome. And you can do both, you know, the more recovery visits. You want to get them, you're welcome to have them. Yeah.

320
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:29.550
Katrina Groves: I probably don't need to see about once a month because you're so stable okay um

321
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.950
Galaxy S8+: So yeah, graduating graduating. Speaking of that, so

322
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:42.180
Galaxy S8+: I forgot to tell you, like, I'm really excited about it. The, the CPS thing that we had the CPS case.

323
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:54.540
Galaxy S8+: Yes. Our son got taken and he was in foster care for almost three years. So it's for us to get our lives back in order and everything, or to see if we were going to do that. And we're we're graduating

324
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.190
Galaxy S8+: My class.

325
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:03.780
Galaxy S8+: We just had our last CF team meeting and we're graduating. Like, I think it's like April, the first week of April. We're totally off the any of that.

326
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.680
Katrina Groves: Oh my gosh. That's like not even two weeks.

327
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:22.650
Galaxy S8+: Right. And so, yeah, that's something I'm really, I'm really happy about. I'm really because I used to have the UAE randomly I in fact yesterday, I just went in for another random you you're calling for your color and they go, if it's your color, you know,

328
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:32.190
Galaxy S8+: Like every day you have to do every weekday. You have to do it. And so that's going to be nice, not, not to do one of the three ways. I have to do every week.

329
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:32.970
Exactly.

330
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:34.920
Galaxy S8+: Yep.

331
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:40.650
Katrina Groves: So nice to get that off your back. You guys earned it. You've been working really hard towards this and

332
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:57.750
Katrina Groves: It's amazing that you all were able to do it. That's pretty rare. Usually, the more couples, we see, they don't either get back together. You know, if one of them gets the kid. The other one doesn't. I mean, that's very rare that you see a whole family intact so right that you should be

333
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.770
Katrina Groves: Very proud of that.

334
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.470
Galaxy S8+: It definitely wasn't easy and

335
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.650
Galaxy S8+: It was one of the hardest things to go through in recovery to go through what I went through with Julian, but I made it.

336
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:25.890
Galaxy S8+: I made it and and hopefully it makes us stronger and it doesn't make me a presenter. I'm hoping for that right now. Not there yet. And we're working on it together. We're talking a lot, and I think that's going to be the key is to talk through things

337
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.470
Katrina Groves: True. And the important thing is you got your son and your parenting hopefully well together.

338
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:38.340
Galaxy S8+: Yeah. Oh, definitely. That's one thing that that never faded like even, even if our relationship was diminishing

339
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:51.030
Galaxy S8+: We love our son, and then that's what that's what he's seen you didn't see any of the stuff he doesn't need to see, you know, going through. Yeah, I think he's completely oblivious to it.

340
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.950
Galaxy S8+: Absolutely.

341
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.920
Galaxy S8+: That's, that's great. Yeah.

342
00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.960
Katrina Groves: Alright, so your Suboxone when you do for refill again.

343
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.610
Galaxy S8+: I just got it. It's every month on the 14th and I just got it.

344
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.740
Galaxy S8+: A few days ago.

345
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:14.490
Katrina Groves: Okay, so if I can make, how is which is better for you. I'm

346
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.450

Katrina Groves: Know I just started doing them.

356
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:56.430
Galaxy S8+: Oh it cuz I'm really glad because that's my days off. And I was thinking, Man, if she just has Mondays. I'm not gonna be able to do this. And yeah, so Thursday for sure because that's my my days off.

357
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.570

Katrina Groves: So if we do the ninth and your prescription is do you said the 14

Katrina Groves: I know you don't have a calendar in front of you, but let me put you on Thursday. The 19th at

361
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.530

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:31.290

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:40.050
Katrina Groves: And then I will get you your prescription that day and we'll go from there. Okay.

365
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.050
Galaxy S8+: Sounds good. Alrighty. I'll see if

366
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.150
Katrina Groves: There's anything else I messed

Katrina Groves: So, oh, do you need any Narcan

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.270
Galaxy S8+: I'm Mike just gave me some of the pharmacy. Okay, great. Yeah. So I have one. Yeah.

369
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.290
Katrina Groves: Just keep it, you might be able to save somebody's life and help somebody get into recovery. So

370
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.150
Galaxy S8+: Right, right.

371
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:17.610
Katrina Groves: Okay, I think I'm done. I really appreciate your time and coming in and I look forward to seeing you. We have a different counselor, but she's awesome. Her name is Becca, and you'll get used to the system. There'll be like

Katrina Groves: Three or four or five of your friends up there that you know from group that depends on you know who comes but

373
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:24.840
Right.

374
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.540
Katrina Groves: Any questions for me.

375
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.770
Galaxy S8+: Um, I had some and now I can't think of any.

376
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.760
Galaxy S8+: Words that important. I know.

377
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.650
Galaxy S8+: We do.

378
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.410
Katrina Groves: The labs. We talked about the urine test.

379
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:51.180
Katrina Groves: You can still you know Tony can still reach out to me at any moment as far as like if you're having a problem. I'm kind of going between the two places right now so

380
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:51.750
Okay.

381
00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.130
Katrina Groves: Alrighty. Well, I'll see you next month done and you'll be off CPS. Yep.

382
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.960
Katrina Groves: You have a wonderful day.

383
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:04.890
Galaxy S8+: Thank you.

384
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.230
Galaxy S8+: All right. Bye bye.

385
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:29.670
Katrina Groves: Okay, I'm so sorry. The first part, I keep forgetting to push record when they come on up. Alright, so the first part that you missed next started using drugs at age 25 and his first use was when he had his wisdom tooth pulled teeth and they gave him bacon.

386
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.780
Katrina Groves: And he had never had any drugs before us actually a pretty

387
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:46.980
Katrina Groves: Clean kid. He didn't want anything to do with drugs or the drink alcohol. A couple times when he is 21 but he never got wasted. So his first experience was actually a from a dentist, unfortunately.

388
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:58.830
Katrina Groves: And you know, we didn't know could have given him ibuprofen, but he went from bike it in and started using it made me feel so good, he decided he wanted more. And then he

389
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:12.960
Katrina Groves: Graduated to Percocet and Oxycodone oxy cotton was getting it from his friends, and then they would have parties, so he just started partying with everybody. And then people, of course, bring things to parties cocaine methamphetamines

390
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:34.860
Katrina Groves: All other drugs. So he got into a pretty harsh for about three years. And then realized he didn't like it anymore. And I think that's the part that you picked up on where he at age 28 he went to a methadone clinic up in Portland in was 2016 I believe no

391
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.230
No.

392
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.270
Katrina Groves: Right, anyway.

393
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.940
Katrina Groves: He went to a methadone clinic and he

394
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:49.590
Katrina Groves: Maybe that's when he graduated in 2016 but he was 28 and he dedicated himself to that clinic for eight years.

395
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.010
Katrina Groves: Was taking methadone daily and then after

396
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.980
Katrina Groves: Three months he got to start taking take home meds and and he was in that program for eight years.

397
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.580
Katrina Groves: And I think you heard the rest so sorry about that. There's no suicidal ideation.

398
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:17.040
Katrina Groves: So his diagnosis is opioid dependence severe in

399
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.050
Katrina Groves: Remission

400
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.870
Katrina Groves: He does not use other substances at all.

401
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.740
Katrina Groves: Doesn't like issues.

402
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:51.720
Katrina Groves: And I think you got day if you can put on Slack for me please, that he's going to be my first patient on Thursday, April 9

403
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.720
Need a prescription at that time.

404
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.150
Katrina Groves: Okay, thank you.

405
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:01.890
Joseph Ramos: Hey,

406
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.720
Joseph Ramos: Hi, Joey.

407
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:09.930
Katrina Groves: I see you, I see you, I see your name, but not your face. Do you have a video or do you want me to

408
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.430
Joseph Ramos: Oh, yeah.

409
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.240
Joseph Ramos: Let's see here. Oh, start video

410
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.270
Joseph Ramos: Got it. Okay, yeah, I'm in my car.

411
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.020
Katrina Groves: Okay, it's probably warmer in there.

412
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.440
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, it's I didn't want to wake my girlfriend, so

413
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:36.450
Joseph Ramos: Oh, nice. Yeah. I stayed up late last night and also work well. I work till 11 every night, but I usually drive to get up so

414
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.170
Joseph Ramos: So I end up staying up pretty late.

415
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.140
Katrina Groves: I used to work in up at the mill.

416
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.890
Katrina Groves: Yes. Wow. How many, how long has that been for you.

417
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.350
Joseph Ramos: A year and a month.

418
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.590
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, I remember. I remember when I was telling you I got the job. So

419
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.440
Katrina Groves: He looked mean and lean

420
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.580
Katrina Groves: Are you okay

421
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.020
Katrina Groves: Is it exhausting.

422
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:08.610
Joseph Ramos: It's pretty exhausting. Yeah, I'm used to it at this point, though, I think, what's the overtime. The 12 hour shifts,

423
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.910
Katrina Groves: So what you do with your money.

424
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.520
Joseph Ramos: Uh, well,

425
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.250
Joseph Ramos: I got a lot of bills.

426
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.490
Joseph Ramos: Got a lot of bills, pretty much.

427
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:35.730
Katrina Groves: Sometimes, the reason I ask is, when people start getting money again, it makes some kind of like it's almost a trigger. Like, wow. If before. If I had this money I could buy this much no dope. So

428
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.490
Joseph Ramos: Oh yeah, I don't know, since I

429
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:47.670
Joseph Ramos: Was already kind of conditioned to taking Suboxone and I really haven't you know it's math every now and then for me like that gets me

430
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.010
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, that's my

431
00:36:51.750 --> 00:37:06.060
Joseph Ramos: That's the hook for me sometimes. But money now is I'm just used to it and used to it kind of goes all the time. It's, it's weird. Yeah, I wouldn't have imagined it would be this way. But, you know,

432
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:07.740
Joseph Ramos: But yeah

433
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.410
Katrina Groves: So this part is like a history and like I

434
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:28.380
Katrina Groves: Am a new doctor, even though I'm not. It's a new place. So I have to kind of go through your whole medical history and drug use history all over again. So it may take us about a half hour depends how how fast it is.

435
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:29.940
Joseph Ramos: Okay.

436
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:40.980
Katrina Groves: So how old were you when you began using drugs, the very first time I mean that as you can remember, was it alcohol was it pot was and what age.

437
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.010
Joseph Ramos: Alcohol.

438
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.630
Joseph Ramos: 12 years old.

439
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.240
Joseph Ramos: But, you know, that was only a couple times really

440
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.350
Joseph Ramos: When I I guess it was we'd like it 14 that was, that was the steady thing.

441
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.640
Joseph Ramos: But I just I just did that to be accepted, really. I didn't

442
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.300
Joseph Ramos: Like the feeling it gave me. Well, I mean, after a while, I did but

443
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.240
Joseph Ramos: A lot of anxiety involved.

444
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.390
Katrina Groves: Social anxiety.

445
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:22.980
Joseph Ramos: Yeah.

446
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.390
Katrina Groves: Peer pressure

447
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.280
Joseph Ramos: Yep, yep. And just the anxiety that the weed gives you. Okay.

448
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.430
Katrina Groves: And so then when did you progress to after that.

449
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.060
Joseph Ramos: When I was 21 is when I got injured.

450
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.480
Joseph Ramos: For my back snowboard.

451
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.790
Katrina Groves: What was it again.

452
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:51.360
Joseph Ramos: I fell, and I was snowboarding, and I, I got the herniated disc doing that so

453
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.840
Katrina Groves: So,

454
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.560
Joseph Ramos: Yeah.

455
00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:08.520
Joseph Ramos: So I got prescribed a Percocet and yesterday to be using those, but it didn't help at the time that I was already using opiates and like them, but I was using them every now and then kind of recreationally

456
00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:16.890
Katrina Groves: So what age were you doing that sometime between 14 and 20 when you started using opioids on the street or hard

457
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.440
Joseph Ramos: Or just probably at

458
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.080
Joseph Ramos: I was starting to use opiates.

459
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:22.890
Katrina Groves: Okay.

460
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.940
Joseph Ramos: Well, I didn't start too late. Yeah. So yeah, it was after the injury and then it was on after that then it was everything.

461
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.800
Joseph Ramos: All opiates.

462
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.150
Joseph Ramos: So, and math every now and then.

463
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.940
Joseph Ramos: Oh yeah and then math was an everyday thing that's when I was homeless.

464
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.940
Joseph Ramos: You know, around 24 to

465
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.700
Joseph Ramos: 28 or so like I saw four years of

466
00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.230
Joseph Ramos: Horrible.

467
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.260
Katrina Groves: Wow homeless for four years.

468
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:00.540
Joseph Ramos: No, not

469
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.730
Joseph Ramos: This season. A lot of it was homeless, though. Yeah, yeah.

470
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.410
Katrina Groves: Let's heroin involved at that time, Joe, you're

471
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.730
Joseph Ramos: A interestingly, not really, no.

472
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:16.980
Joseph Ramos: Heroin was

473
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:31.440
Joseph Ramos: Just for short periods of time. And then I would get off of that, like beyond methadone and then get off that. But then I would use the method to help me get off of that. And I'd be on that again. So it was kind of off and on.

474
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:34.800
Joseph Ramos: When

475
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:38.670
Katrina Groves: When was your first attempt to try to get clean or what happened.

476
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.850
Joseph Ramos: To those 2016

477
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.710
Katrina Groves: Okay.

478
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.690
Joseph Ramos: That's when I went to rehab. So that was like my first solid attempt

479
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.240
Katrina Groves: And did you go because you had to like, was it a legal thing or you just decided this

480
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.830
Joseph Ramos: No, actually I got lucky. My mom got some insurance out for me and

481
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:07.230
Joseph Ramos: In. Yeah. And then I went to Florida to rehab. So, and then now is my first rehab was six months.

482
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.860
Joseph Ramos: And then I kind of just bounced around after the

483
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.410
Katrina Groves: What do you mean by bounced around

484
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:19.260
Joseph Ramos: bounce around different rehabs and kind of just used up all the insurance and

485
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:28.380
Joseph Ramos: Yeah. And then in the garden Suboxone and that's actually what maintain me

486
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.200
Katrina Groves: And when did you get on the Suboxone

487
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:42.210
Joseph Ramos: Oh boy. Well, back in the day, I did it before I went to rehab. I was in programs. This one I was in the one in Humboldt County.

488
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.480
Joseph Ramos: That program. I was in that

489
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.590
Joseph Ramos: A couple years it was on the job and everything.

490
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.980
Joseph Ramos: Right, so I knew that would, that was something that in the back of my mind. Once I came back from Florida.

491
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.090
Joseph Ramos: And yeah, so

492
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:06.420
Katrina Groves: And then how did you end up you actually from Seattle, right. You were in Seattle, and then came down here. No.

493
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:13.980
Joseph Ramos: No, I, I, THAT WAS AFTER FLORIDA actually then I was in Arizona. God, it's such a long story.

494
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.260
Katrina Groves: I know it's so many states, you should have like little buttons every state, you know, gone.

495
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:30.600
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, yeah, it's been, I've just been moving my whole life. So it wasn't anything new. But the pace. I was doing it was pretty crazy moving here in their rehab.

496
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.010
Joseph Ramos: Even state run rehabs where I didn't have insurance.

497
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:35.700
Katrina Groves: Right.

498
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:41.940
Joseph Ramos: I was Arizona. I was in a state run. It was horrible because that's where all the conflicts, we're going and

499
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:49.920
Joseph Ramos: It's they didn't want it was Fuck OH is the kit shell for sure. Yeah, pardon my language and

500
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.460
Joseph Ramos: Yeah.

501
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.090
Joseph Ramos: And then see I actually, I was getting kicked out of a sober living

502
00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.670
Joseph Ramos: Forget what

503
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:05.940
Joseph Ramos: For I wasn't paying my bill or something like that, because I was using

504
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.240
Joseph Ramos: Yeah. And then I went to Seattle.

505
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.970
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, where I got on Suboxone again.

506
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.340
Joseph Ramos: Was working drywall for a while, but that fell apart because my boss wasn't a

507
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.590
Joseph Ramos: paying me

508
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:29.220
Joseph Ramos: And then. Yeah. And then my mom was like, why don't you just come let you know because she knew I was pretty steady at that point.

509
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.710
Katrina Groves: So it's a long

510
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.310
Joseph Ramos: Time, you're

511
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.630
Sorry.

512
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.670
Joseph Ramos: Oh, I said, now I'm here.

513
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.460
Katrina Groves: What, what's the longest time you've had clean them. Do you think I'm in a row.

514
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.270
Joseph Ramos: Right. Oh, probably right now. Yeah.

515
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.130
Katrina Groves: And then spending a month.

516
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.820
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, yeah. It's been a while. Um,

517
00:43:53.040 --> 00:44:00.720
Joseph Ramos: You know, I've used mess every now and then. So I guess that would be in the eyes of like a or any not clean but you know

518
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:03.690
Joseph Ramos: Well,

519
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:11.370
Katrina Groves: Yeah, exactly. I mean, you're so much better. You're not on the streets. You're not homeless, you have a job.

520
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.160
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, you

521
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.060
Joseph Ramos: Are that

522
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.090
Joseph Ramos: That just makes me appreciate it that much more so.

523
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:26.550
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I mean what you call that as more recreational use. I mean, the math. It's not like an everyday thing that you're addicted to. Yeah.

524
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.130
Joseph Ramos: I'm know

525
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.930
Joseph Ramos: That because I

526
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:39.960
Joseph Ramos: I know for a fact that ain't gonna happen again. Because when I use it. I just after a couple days. I'm like, oh, right, I gotta go to work and

527
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.610
Joseph Ramos: Too many things at stake. I got a girlfriend.

528
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.640
Joseph Ramos: And I just, I get sick of it after a couple days so

529
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.340
Joseph Ramos: You know, and I, I just, I didn't know for a fact that ain't gonna happen again.

530
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.280
Joseph Ramos: With the math anyway.

531
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:10.440
Katrina Groves: And that's good that you remember, you know, play the tape like Tony says play the tape and backwards and see where where it was.

532
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:17.880
Katrina Groves: So do you have any any legal issues, Joey, that you're working on. Are you not on probation. You're not anything from the past. You've all

533
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.470
Joseph Ramos: Nope.

534
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:20.580
Katrina Groves: Good.

535
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.560
Joseph Ramos: Hey. Did you see anything from the past.

536
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.530
Katrina Groves: Yeah, past legal issues that are fixed.

537
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:33.270
Joseph Ramos: Oh yeah, I have a felony grants theft. I spent a year in jail, actually I didn't tell you but yeah

538
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:41.370
Joseph Ramos: Well, a year in a year. In total, they gave me drug court but I failed that so they gave you my terminal.

539
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.950
Joseph Ramos: And then I spent

540
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.030
Joseph Ramos: A good amount of time and don't hurt county jail so

541
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.370
Katrina Groves: Some people. Some people are getting their felonies expunged. Is that something you thought about doing

542
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.400
Joseph Ramos: Yes, but I heard you have to get an attorney and

543
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.120
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, I just yeah I

544
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.440
Katrina Groves: On your list right now.

545
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.880
Joseph Ramos: No, not really because I'm employed and they don't really care about the

546
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.820
Joseph Ramos: Felony I told them about it so

547
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.370
Katrina Groves: That's nice. You're getting honest.

548
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.140
Joseph Ramos: Yeah. Yeah, but I didn't tell them I was in this program. So then again.

549
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:17.460
Joseph Ramos: You

550
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.860
Joseph Ramos: Feel is necessary at the time, so

551
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.080
Katrina Groves: Right. It's none of their business. It's a medical

552
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:22.800
Katrina Groves: Condition.

553
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.090
Joseph Ramos: So it's like diabetes, you

554
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:30.390
Katrina Groves: Don't have to tell your doctor. You're taking insulin. It's none of their business. I mean, your doctor. You don't have to tell your employer you're taking insulin or

555
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:42.480
Katrina Groves: thyroid medication. So I want to normalize it you know Suboxone is like any other medication you're taking for a chronic disease and other business. So maybe that takes some of the guilt away.

556
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.320
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, yeah. I didn't, I didn't really think of it that way.

557
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.310
Joseph Ramos: I didn't have, like, major guilt for from it but

558
00:46:51.360 --> 00:47:02.790
Joseph Ramos: I was told, like you don't want to lie to your employer. I heard that recently. Like, you don't want to lie to them because then if they find out you're lucky, and then I'm like, well, yeah, like, kind of, it's none of their business is kind of what I thought so.

559
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:07.050
Katrina Groves: Right. I mean, they're allowed to drug test you. But they're not testing for Suboxone so

560
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.030
Joseph Ramos: When

561
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.780
Katrina Groves: So let me ask some family history Joey Is your mother's still alive.

562
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.960
Katrina Groves: Yes, and any kind of medical issues that she has high blood pressure.

563
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.090

587
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:56.700
Joseph Ramos: Nope, I'm just taking 100 now. I went down on it. So, okay.

588
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.890
Katrina Groves: And you also have asthma. It looks like.

589
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.330
Joseph Ramos: Yes.

590
00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:01.680

Joseph Ramos: Yeah yeah and

594
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.500
Joseph Ramos: Oh for asthma LB at all as well. Sometimes

595
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.950
Katrina Groves: Good. And do you still take singular

596
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.570

Joseph Ramos: Okay.

598
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.270
Katrina Groves: And then you have

599
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.380
Katrina Groves: Is it that Advair disk. I see in your chart. It's

600
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.880
Katrina Groves: I don't know if you know that is the 100 or the higher dose.

601
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.240
Joseph Ramos: I think it's the 250 okay

602
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:49.770
Katrina Groves: And do you still take quantity. And that was an old medication because you were going through withdrawals. We can probably take that off of there.

603
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:53.310
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, no, I don't take any more. Okay.

604
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.550
Katrina Groves: And then the Suboxone. How do you feel that is working for you right now.

605
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.740
Joseph Ramos: A really good

606
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.900
Katrina Groves: No cravings. Do you feel it gives you 24 hour coverage.

607
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:08.130
Yes.

608
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.240
Katrina Groves: And you're doing eight milligrams three a day.

609
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.100
Yes. Okay.

610
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.100
Katrina Groves: You're good with it under your tongue, you're not having any problems with nausea.

611
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.610
Joseph Ramos: No, no, not at this point.

612
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:33.810
Katrina Groves: So you've heard about this shot right the sunblock hate injection that's once a month Suboxone instead of having to take strips three times a day.

613
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.570
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, I'm not interested in

614
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.740
Okay.

615
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.290
Katrina Groves: Because you don't like shots or you're just happy with what you're doing.

616
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:48.390
Joseph Ramos: Happy with what I'm doing. It's a mental thing. So I think the shot. It would just be very

617
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.220
Katrina Groves: Weird

618
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.400
Joseph Ramos: Yeah, yeah. You just a mental thing.

619
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.070
Joseph Ramos: Okay, yeah.

620
00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:06.060
Katrina Groves: It's not for everybody. It's like, you know, some people with diabetes. They need insulin. Other people need pill. So it's all very dependent on the individual.

621
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.130
Katrina Groves: Wanna

622
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.750

Joseph Ramos: You were like, yeah, no.

627
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:27.420
Katrina Groves: Okay, I'll give you a medium. So it's the vapor. The vapor is a chemical that's gonna affect your asthma. But how much do you bake.

628
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.290
Katrina Groves: A lot. Okay, that's honest.

629

Well done.

755
01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.630
Katrina Groves: Okay, so that was

756
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.850
Katrina Groves: For Joey

757
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.690
Katrina Groves: About it was a bad recording at the end, but I think I got you on everything.

758
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.910
Katrina Groves: I know what I forgot. On the last client.

759
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.490
Katrina Groves: If I hope you're my same transcriber and on Nicholas Goddard, the patient before

760
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.060
Katrina Groves: I forgot to do my usual

761
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:29.880
Katrina Groves: Mental mental status exam or whatever it's called psychiatric impression, please put my usual for

762
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:40.050
Katrina Groves: Nicholas. He was alert and oriented normal concentration and attention span no evidence of any short or long term memory problems.

763
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.480
Katrina Groves: His mood and effect. He was

764
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:52.050
Katrina Groves: Attentive calm and in good spirits.

765
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.750
Katrina Groves: And

766
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:16.140
Katrina Groves: He was well groomed, or I would say casually ground normal body habitus speech normal rate wrong volume coherence thought content and process linear logical non tangential no auditory or visual hallucinations or delusions, no evidence of psychosis.

767
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.200
Katrina Groves: Self.

768
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.070
Katrina Groves: Reflection. Excellent.

769
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.490
Katrina Groves: Very good insight and judgment.

770
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.680
Katrina Groves: denies any suicidal ideation.

771
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:38.370
Katrina Groves: So that's all my usual and oh yeah and so back on.

772
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.700
Katrina Groves: That was Nick Goddard last time. So please do the same.

773
01:03:47.370 --> 01:04:01.440
Katrina Groves: Joey, however, I would say his mood. He was distracted. He was in his car and he kept looking around and seeing things going on around him, but he would be able to focus again and

774
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:17.550
Katrina Groves: So on Joey his diagnoses are opioid dependence severe and our mission. I don't know if there's a I think if you've vapes that would be nicotine dependence.

775
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.640
Katrina Groves: With a vapor

776
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.930
Katrina Groves: And I wouldn't say moderate

777
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:35.250
Katrina Groves: I think that's f 17.29 but I may be wrong.

778
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:42.630
Katrina Groves: And also, asthma, which is moderate persistent

779
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.190
Katrina Groves: Let me know if you need more clarification on that.

780
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.920

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:34.290
Charlena Douglas: Kinda but I did figure it out. And actually, what's the people on the front. They actually kind of step me step for step two. It was kind of nice of them.

803
01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:44.490

Katrina Groves: So you didn't mess around. You didn't start with pod or alcohol or anything yeah and and that's continuing right you're continuing to use. Yeah, yeah, that's hard one. Yeah. Do you think it's harder than the opioids.

811
01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:32.100
Charlena Douglas: Now that's the same

812
01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.370

Katrina Groves: Yeah, and she probably forgot, and she doesn't know she's not a medical doctor so she doesn't think about things like asthma or, you know, being people at high risk. So she's worried about you. The reason she gets upset is because she worries and she's wanting you to be off the math.

1077
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:06.150
Charlena Douglas: I know I want to be off. Did you

01:27:53.970 --> 01:28:01.380
Charlena Douglas: Why did you vote. Always has been. I really don't sleep that much. I keep on an hour and awake and then I go back. I really don't volunteer deep sleep, I guess.

1129
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.860

Charlena Douglas: Method all yesterday. Not one bit.

1166
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:37.650
Katrina Groves: Interesting. So when you're anxious, you don't crave them up.

1167
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:38.370
Right.

1168
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:41.250
Katrina Groves: What makes you crave the muffin.

1169
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:47.730
Charlena Douglas: Maybe over having too much to do and not enough time to do it in or something like that. I see.

1170
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:51.030
Charlena Douglas: So when you're already using the not make longer crave it to

1171
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:51.930
Okay.

1172
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.840
Katrina Groves: All right. Alright, we're getting close to being done here.

1173
01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:58.440
Okay.

1174
01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.580

1175
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:11.040

1176
01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.070

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:31.950
Charlena Douglas: And you want me to start that writer. Oh.

1180
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.700
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I'm going to call that into the pharmacy for you.

1181
01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:36.450
Charlena Douglas: Okay.

1182
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:44.010
Katrina Groves: Probably the downside of it. Is it some people that makes them a little tired but you know for you to shut your brain off that might be a good thing.

1183
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:45.660
Charlena Douglas: Really, am I

1184
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:50.790
Katrina Groves: And you don't have to take it all the time. You can just take it when you're having anxiety attack.

1185
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:51.120
Charlena Douglas: Okay.

1186
01:31:51.750 --> 01:32:00.000
Katrina Groves: And if one doesn't work. You try. You'll remember the pill. Once you get it because you are on it before. What if one doesn't work. You take a second one.

1187
01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.020
Charlena Douglas: Okay.

1188
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:10.950
Katrina Groves: And then the Gabba Penton I see that Dr. Peter must have sent it to you on this 17 that's at the pharmacy 600 milligrams three a day.

1189
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:17.010
Katrina Groves: But so you'll probably have to talk to her about if you want to increase that

1190
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:19.380
Katrina Groves: And you can. I'm

1191
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.060
Charlena Douglas: Thinking on the 17th of this month.

1192
01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.860
Katrina Groves: What it says

1193
01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:31.140
Katrina Groves: It says, yeah. Dr. Peter at 930 in the morning on Tuesday. She sent it over to the pharmacy.

1194
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:35.610
Charlena Douglas: The pharmacy must have addiction. I think my last bottles of the 11th last month.

1195
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:40.680
Katrina Groves: Yeah I would call them, ask, ask them to deliver your Gabba Penton because she just did it.

1196
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.540
Charlena Douglas: Okay.

1197
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.490
Katrina Groves: And that's good for mood swings.

1198
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:53.280
Katrina Groves: Alright, so did you find a difference. Take I think I only gave you the Suboxone day give you to tap to a day.

1199
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:54.090
Charlena Douglas: Yeah.

1200
01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.480
Katrina Groves: Do you feel better on three or did you find to

1201
01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:00.030
Charlena Douglas: Agree to de stress me out.

1202
01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.370
Katrina Groves: Okay, tell me how it feels.

1203
01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:06.690
Charlena Douglas: And I want you to take in that third one. I've been taking forever.

1204
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:15.180

01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:48.630
Katrina Groves: Same info as the chief complaint of all the other ones.

1226
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:57.600
Katrina Groves: Premier care providers, Dr. Michelle cater at opened our community health center her speeches very rapid or volume is loud.

1227
01:35:03.210 --> 01:35:12.060
Katrina Groves: Her effect and mood is anxious and they are angry at times dysphoria, but she had full expression of feelings.

1228
01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.220
Katrina Groves: Attention span was moderately

1229
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:22.080
Katrina Groves: unfocused at times.

1230
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:25.500
Katrina Groves: She had

1231
01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:28.530
Katrina Groves: Poor

1232
01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:34.080
Katrina Groves: Insight and self reflection and poor judgment.

1233
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.970
Katrina Groves: Otherwise, the normal psych exam.

1234
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:59.400
Katrina Groves: Increase her back up to Suboxone three strips three eight milligrams per day.

1235
01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:02.790
Katrina Groves: And

1236
01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:06.420
Katrina Groves: Also add propranolol

1237
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:21.780
Katrina Groves: 20 milligrams at the onset of a panic attack and repeat as needed. I'll type that in the med list and send it off and you heard the rest of the plan.

1238
01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:28.680
Katrina Groves: So diagnosis would be opioid dependence severe in remission.

1239
01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.240
Katrina Groves: Let them better mean abuse.

1240
01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.510
Dependence or abuse.

1241
01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:54.000
Katrina Groves: Intermittent

1242
01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.130
Katrina Groves: Severe

1243
01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.810
Katrina Groves: Or stimulants. I guess that would be stimulants.

1244
01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:17.970
Katrina Groves: Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I'm looking at my cheat sheet. It looks like mild intermittent abuse is

1245
01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:25.650
Katrina Groves: Different than dependence. So let me go back and say that methamphetamine dependence severe

1246
01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:41.970
Katrina Groves: Stimulants so that's f 15.20 instead. Thanks also nicotine dependence severe cigarettes also asthma.

1247
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.330
Katrina Groves: I already said that with

1248
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:51.450

01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:14.250
Katrina Groves: Next plan on in place that is expired and needs to be taken out.

1252
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:20.040
Katrina Groves: The plan will be for her to visit her primary care provider to get this out when the

1253
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.140
Katrina Groves: Virus.

1254

1257
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.240

1258
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.750
