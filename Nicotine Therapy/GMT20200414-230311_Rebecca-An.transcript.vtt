79
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.810
LG Stylo 5: You know, I grew up in an environment. I grew up in the body or South valley here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.700
Yay.

115
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.940
LG Stylo 5: That was probably from using dirty needles. When I went to prison. I was using dirty needles in there too so

116
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:33.120
LG Stylo 5: I would always have them because there every six months in prison. If you've got to do a take on HIV test.

LG Stylo 5: So I wish you all a

118
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:48.420

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.510
LG Stylo 5: I smoke some weed.

120
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.940

LG Stylo 5: Joy.

123
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.200
LG Stylo 5: I mean, I

124
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.230
LG Stylo 5: Try buju through because I know they told me, they're going to send me a package for a urine.

125
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.170
LG Stylo 5: But other than that, no.

126
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.340
Okay.

127
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me some of the things that you want to work on why you're in treatment with bright heart.

128
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.920
LG Stylo 5: Well, I know I need

129
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:33.060
LG Stylo 5: A Norman and needs a box and you know, I mean, it helps me because I do get bad grade means to get high on heroin. IT'S ALL OVER THE STREET HERE IN ALBUQUERQUE

130
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.350
LG Stylo 5: No, I haven't, I haven't. The last time I use heroin was before I got in prison.

131
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:48.090
LG Stylo 5: And that was the last time I've used it. So it's been over four years almost five years now.

132
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.580
LG Stylo 5: But

133
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.040
LG Stylo 5: It's hard. I mean,

134
00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:08.040
LG Stylo 5: My appeal. You know, I went to the doctors here and they told me that I would probably have to stay on, man, I don't know, but I feel sometimes if I don't have it. I'll probably go get higher on heroin. I mean, so

135
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.460
Yeah.

136
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.300

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.920
LG Stylo 5: Work took an anger management and I I've gone through all the classes I've done a lot of that.

141
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.980

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:39.960
LG Stylo 5: I've been in I've been been an arcade all my life so glad seen a lot of people, they can have they had an isolated for all those

164
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.190
LG Stylo 5: Places, but you know I

165
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.610
LG Stylo 5: Guess I'm pretty strong because I've seen a lot of people kill themselves and then phases and

166
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.110
LG Stylo 5: A lot of people died and everything, but you know I

167
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.120

170
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a lot to take in. How

171
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:27.780
LG Stylo 5: Right, it's confusing that Bernie for computers there in there in the prison. I never really messed with it so

172
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright.

173
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what we wanted to do is we want to get you back.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On a regular basis.

176
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really

177
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:57.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working on coping skills to help you with triggers and cravings and to help you with relapse prevention to help you with

178
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cognitive thought processes that may interfere with your recovery.

179
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really just kind of being a support, you know, taking a look at the things that are working in your life right now.

180
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluating that versus what is not working and what we need to work on.

181
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that

182
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:32.010
LG Stylo 5: Excuse me, I think I need a lot of work, but I'm you know I've done good. This is the longest I've ever been on it. I did 20 years

183
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:49.980
LG Stylo 5: And I went back to the door, you know, I mean it took me another 30 more years to figure out, it doesn't work for me. I mean, but you know sometimes I get great means bad. I want to get high, but I don't. I mean, I take, I take my medication Suboxone

184
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.320
LG Stylo 5: And it doesn't help me and I started using the box and I was shooting it in the prison.

185
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.940
LG Stylo 5: My homeboys came and told me try this.

186
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:12.780
LG Stylo 5: Range there with me and that's how I used it the whole time I was there. And then I started, I got rid of that. And I started taking it by ma, and there's no really no dip.

187
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.380
LG Stylo 5: Right away. Yeah. I mean, when you shoot it.

188
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

189
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

241
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:31.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you'll get a package in the mail. You don't want to open it or nothing until you call the number that you called for your meeting today.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you tell them that you received your you a packet and you're ready to take your UAE. And so what happens is is it's really simple. They have you open it right in front of the video.

244
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You go to the bathroom, you come back, and then you show them in your camera, they'll look at the temperature and then they'll look at the substances.
