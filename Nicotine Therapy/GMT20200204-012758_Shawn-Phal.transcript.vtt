00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.150
Shawn Phalen: Me.

2
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.020
Randy McWilliams: Show.

3
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.300
Shawn Phalen: How are you, I'm

4
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.190
Randy McWilliams: Doing. Okay, good to see

5
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.520
Randy McWilliams: What's the good word. Well, everything's going well I think everything

6
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.650
Randy McWilliams: You know, in terms of

7
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.020
Randy McWilliams: School and job are still going while

8
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.810
Randy McWilliams: I'm still living in this sober living house, which has been really good.

9
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.150
Randy McWilliams: For me,

10
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.130
Randy McWilliams: Back.

11
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.220
Randy McWilliams: I had an incident last night.

12
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.940
Randy McWilliams: With this new roommate who had moved in two days ago and moved in and

13
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:33.870
Randy McWilliams: Just smell really really bad. The order was really adding they reminded me of some of the folks I work with it the shelter and I just really politely started talking to them and suggest that you might

14
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:43.530
Randy McWilliams: You know, he was a little ripe and might want to just clean up here at the house and stuff like that was to go. And then last night.

15
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:56.190
Randy McWilliams: at 2AM. He just starts blaring like this. Death Metal music and get he got up and wanted to start a fight, you know, saying, I'm up and stuff that was just really

16
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.730
Randy McWilliams: It really threw me off.

17
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.720
Randy McWilliams: And put my head in this weird space, obviously.

18
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.860
Randy McWilliams: All night. But then, of course, I'm thinking about it all day. You know, I'm just replaying it so I just kind of

19
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.620
Randy McWilliams: I think it's a good reminder

20
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.210
Randy McWilliams: You know how you know unpredictable things might throw you off.

21
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.460
Randy McWilliams: Handle really unpredictable things that really might shake you up.

22
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.640
Randy McWilliams: Needless to say, I got home here today, and they told me the guy was discharged and stuff like that so

23
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.910
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

24
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.070
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, you know, I just

25
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.720
Randy McWilliams: I don't. My instinct. Last night was to get furious.

26
00:06:49.770 --> 00:07:02.700
Randy McWilliams: But I didn't, I just tried to ignore him. And you know he didn't. He didn't do anything. You know, to physically touch me or anything just kept talking and talking talking like you must have been

27
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.030
Randy McWilliams: Tweaking he probably got his hands on something, but

28
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.590
Randy McWilliams: You know,

29
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:18.180
Randy McWilliams: It's really had to practice a lot of just calming kind of techniques. A lot of breathing today.

30
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.410
Randy McWilliams: And are trying to redirect my thoughts to, you know,

31
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:34.290
Randy McWilliams: Work and things that matter. And, you know, not let it really upset my mood or anything like that. It's just so crazy.

32
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:43.890
Randy McWilliams: But that's really the only crazy thing that happened works going well they switched my job there again so

33
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.870
Randy McWilliams: On doing pretty much the same as I always have just kind of entitle

34
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.690
Randy McWilliams: And hopefully getting a raise. So that'll help

35
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:17.010
Randy McWilliams: And I did here today in regard to my field placement. This threw me off to because the guy, the clinical supervisor told me that he may not be able to take my schools students from St. Mary's because St. Mary's as a program is requiring

36
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.800
Randy McWilliams: Take supervision.

37
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.600
Randy McWilliams: And he said, just on principle, he wouldn't be doing that and would have to stop partnership and school

38
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:42.030
Randy McWilliams: So I'm, I'm really hoping I can do it there and he suggested I kind of lobby to the to the staff about doing it without that. So I'm hoping I can. That's kind of what I want to take my

39
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.290
Randy McWilliams: You know, my professional trajectory toward this work at this point and

40
00:08:50.760 --> 00:09:04.320
Randy McWilliams: You know, if I can't do it there. Then I'll, I'll find someplace else and just utilize that training toward where I'm working, you know, if I want to continue in in this field, so

41
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:13.740
Randy McWilliams: You know, I guess it's so this is just kind of a lesson on today on how to redirect the hands for the good.

42
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.460
Randy McWilliams: You know, so

43
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.680
Shawn Phalen: It's not a new thing that they've started

44
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.380
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, the tape supervision.

45
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:34.980
Randy McWilliams: Really covers and it's out of need. According to my supervisor or my supervisor told me that

46
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:42.720
Randy McWilliams: It is new brand new to the school. I hadn't even heard of it. And I guess they were pushing for it last year but at the last minute, they didn't

47
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:56.070
Randy McWilliams: So he took some interns for this season, but he got word just today that they were going to require it. And he said that he hadn't heard of any other

48
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.850
Randy McWilliams: Program that he's ever dealt with requiring tape supervision some

49
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.680
Randy McWilliams: That seems so strange. Do you know

50
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.430
Shawn Phalen: Words of super like what's the point

51
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:30.570
Randy McWilliams: Five people full time to be going over these tapes and right i would you require that when your supervisors already licensed and right i i find that absurd. Yeah. And that's exactly his stance was

52
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.140
Randy McWilliams: You know, he feels just on principle. It's kind of absurd from his point of view to

53
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:45.810
Randy McWilliams: You know, be taped in something that you know he's a licensed professional to do is they don't he feels like almost like there.

54
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:53.430
Randy McWilliams: Are there. Who are they, who are they, reviewing here the clinician or the trainee so

55
00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:05.610
Randy McWilliams: I think it's, you know, I'm not experienced enough obviously at all in the field or have any enough anywhere near enough clinical training to speak on it.

56
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:28.620
Randy McWilliams: But it just seems to me on its face that it is a little absurd to make license Clin why even bother doing it, why not just do all mock trainings at the school with licensed people and not require field placement at all, except that the hours are required by the BBS

57
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.460
Randy McWilliams: So it's, it's worth 3000 hours.

58
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.270
Randy McWilliams: It is 3000 hours now. So

59
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:49.500
Randy McWilliams: You know, hopefully I won't have to go out and try to find some place new so just so perfect, because it's where, like I said, I want to be.

60
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.960
Randy McWilliams: You know ultimately be working and maybe even on this man's team down the road, but

61
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.260
Randy McWilliams: So it would be just so perfect.

62
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.010
Randy McWilliams: Really throw a wrench in the plans.

63
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.910
Randy McWilliams: But if it happens. It happens right

64
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:14.790
Randy McWilliams: Because, you know, because it's a full time job. So you working 40 hours a week, so right.

65
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.070
To get every week and would count towards your, you know, towards getting

66
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.180
Randy McWilliams: You know, getting your hours right

67
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.460
Shawn Phalen: You know, to get those hours finished within like a year and a half or so.

68
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.140
Shawn Phalen: Right at least a 40 hour

69
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.420
You know, a job.

70
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:49.710
Randy McWilliams: These hours. Right. That's about as quick as you can get it done right and 40 hours a week and about a year and a half to two years about is

71
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:57.270
Randy McWilliams: It would be ideal. And you also want to think about going over the hours.

72
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.320
Randy McWilliams: That are required because, you know, there's the

73
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:15.780
Shawn Phalen: You know Murphy's Law. It's one of those things where, you know, you just kind of, you just you something can always happen and at least you have that padding and

74
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:22.800
Randy McWilliams: All right, you know, that's what I did. So I made sure that I was well over 3000 hours and I needed.

75
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.420
Randy McWilliams: It consciously or I needed that because there were

76
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.540
Shawn Phalen: 500 hours that they weren't going to take because they said that my supervisor wasn't nice.

77
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:49.860
Randy McWilliams: Wow. Yeah. No, you know, just, just FYI. That's a great, that's a great point. I appreciate you saying that because, you know, I was kind of doing some research on the tape supervision thing.

78
00:13:50.790 --> 00:14:00.150
Randy McWilliams: From the perspective of the BBS and there's nothing on there about that, but of course they change things from year to year. Sometimes

79
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.100
Randy McWilliams: Right.

80
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:16.440
Randy McWilliams: So, absolutely, they could all the sudden require 500 more hours and from a specific population or or whatever. So I think as many hours as you can do. I wish I could

81
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:25.650
Randy McWilliams: You know, transfer some of the work I'm doing now over but obviously you have to be at a certain place in the master's program before you're

82
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.550
Randy McWilliams: Eligible for that in the training so

83
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:43.560
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, I think in this would be such the ideal, this would be like the perfect scenario for coasting through to get the hours.

84
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.230
Randy McWilliams: So, but if not,

85
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.080
Shawn Phalen: You

86
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.170
Shawn Phalen: Know, something will have come at you know you just have to. Yeah. You know, you just have to know this something

87
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:10.350
Randy McWilliams: I think that the, you know what, hopefully, the good thing, even if it does that, that is required. I guess I could look at it from the standpoint of, it's only a years or the training hours.

88
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:17.130
Randy McWilliams: If I have to do that somewhere else. That's, I can make that work. And then once that's over.

89
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:33.510
Randy McWilliams: And I get my degree, but that I'm still required to get 3000 hours for licensure, then I could go back to the place I work to do the hours there. So I guess it'll work out. Either way, we'll say

90
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:42.090
Shawn Phalen: You need to get is it so right now because you're in school, you need a certain amount of hours to graduate. Right.

91
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:50.370
Randy McWilliams: That's right. Yeah. And I forgot the exact number 900 or something. Yeah, it's like six or seven or something.

92
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.130
Randy McWilliams: Okay, yeah.

93
00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.360
Randy McWilliams: So, you know, if I have to get that from somewhere else and I can make that work.

94
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:07.410
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know. Okay, so you're right you can because I'm

95
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:18.600
Shawn Phalen: So that would be like you figure about 500 600 hours is about once a week.

96
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.230
For about. Yeah.

97
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.900
Randy McWilliams: Exactly. So even if you found something that you could do.

98
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.540
Randy McWilliams: One day, maybe two days a week. Right.

99
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.250
Randy McWilliams: You're still okay i think that's absolutely true.

100
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:44.700
Randy McWilliams: And I know. Yeah. And I know that there's. Yeah, it's definitely not my first instinct is like, oh my god, it's gonna throw everything off but

101
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.470
Randy McWilliams: You know, it's not like I'm having to do this.

102
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.290
Randy McWilliams: For the whole 3000 hours. It's only a very small part of it for a limited time

103
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:07.770
Randy McWilliams: You know, like you just said, Great suggestion I can pick up a day or two that another agency and then go back to my agency after graduation and finish the hours so right.

104
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.400
Shawn Phalen: I think I did it.

105
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.790
Shawn Phalen: I did it one day a week.

106
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.030
Shawn Phalen: You know, it was for the whole day.

107
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.700
Shawn Phalen: And then you had super

108
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.570
Randy McWilliams: Towards and so I I've been out those hours.

109
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:39.180
Randy McWilliams: Oh wow yeah no for the field placement. Yeah, I think that's right. It I believe it starts in

110
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.320
Randy McWilliams: September and ends in June or July or something like that. So it's just under a year.

111
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:54.900
Randy McWilliams: That's the way they have the program set up like you're talking about to to get those hours done in that amount of time.

112
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.040
Shawn Phalen: And there has to be plenty of places right i mean

113
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.830
Randy McWilliams: There are there really are. There's some

114
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:18.030
Randy McWilliams: We, you know, when I went to the training for getting the field placement. They of course handed us a book of resources and contacts for different agencies all over the Bay Area. So yeah, there's hundreds and hundreds of places.

115
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.620
Randy McWilliams: To request this from you know and varying degrees of, you know, what they do.

116
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:34.260
Randy McWilliams: So there's no doubt I can find something I've been talking to my colleagues and my classmates and

117
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:45.360
Randy McWilliams: You know everybody's panicking, where is it, where am I going to get it. Am I gonna be able to find it. But everyone seemed to been able to find something somewhere.

118
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:52.380
Shawn Phalen: I mean, the school has to like they have to. There has to be enough place.

119
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.380
Randy McWilliams: You know, like, you know, so all right and

120
00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.070
Randy McWilliams: You know,

121
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.870
Randy McWilliams: Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off there. You're right. No help you, you know, they want you to graduate. Obviously so.

122
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.100
Shawn Phalen: You know that's you'll be okay. Keep your options open.

123
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:25.620
Randy McWilliams: That's exactly right. And that's what this guy was saying to is just apply to a bunch of different places, just in case you can't get around the tape thing. And it's interesting. You were saying that

124
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:41.520
Randy McWilliams: And it's true. They have to have enough places but you know I think my school. And I think a lot of other programs are starting to admit, more people in class sizes are getting bigger demands growing and

125
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:54.270
Randy McWilliams: For the profession and so lot more people are getting into this and the class sizes have gone from like 12 my first year to like 26 now.

126
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.640
Randy McWilliams: People per class. So they're just really starting to stream in

127
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.960
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so I think what happened is, you know, when the economy crashed alive faces closed.

128
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:17.340
Randy McWilliams: Right now that you know things are getting a little bit better. And he cares expanding release healthcare's always good in California. All right. Are you getting

129
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:37.350
Randy McWilliams: MIT license or yes yeah yeah so you know there's there's always. I mean, that's a li mo basically a California license. Right. So, that's right, yeah. So there's, you know, the school has to make sure that there are enough places for

130
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.000
Randy McWilliams: Get

131
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.230
Shawn Phalen: If there's not, they have to disclose on the phone and

132
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.340
Randy McWilliams: Oh yeah, absolutely. You're right about that and

133
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:56.160
Randy McWilliams: That's one thing about the tape supervision. So it seems to be a new phenomenon from the school.

134
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:03.690
Randy McWilliams: That they may be losing more and more agencies to partner with with that requirement.

135
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:22.920
Randy McWilliams: You so you know I'm hoping that that doesn't happen. I'll be because I'm figuring, you know, if one clinical supervisor from one county agency is saying no than many other county agencies probably will, too, and

136
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:41.760
Randy McWilliams: You know, so it's really at the discretion of the clinical supervisor to say yes or no, I can't. They can't require it. Who are you, right, in San Francisco right outside the Bay Area in Walnut Creek, which is 25 miles out. Yeah.

137
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.560
Randy McWilliams: Okay.

138
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.560
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so just keep your options open.

139
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.880
You know something on nothing will come in and you know that guy got discharged. So you don't have to go

140
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:12.540
Randy McWilliams: Meetings, the meetings are going really well i i went to three last week, I'm still talking to my sponsor. I'm doing a lot of step 11 or which is the

141
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.330
Randy McWilliams: You know, consistent meditation or for some people, prayer.

142
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:33.180
Randy McWilliams: Been doing kind of a little mix of both. I've been going to more and more leaves unity center church functions with my girlfriend, which are more much more spiritual based

143
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.960
Randy McWilliams: Things you know a lot I shared with you a lot of Reiki kind of stuff and

144
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:51.150
Randy McWilliams: You know, the main thing about that those things is you know whether or not you believe in kind of the metaphysical side of some of those therapies.

145
00:22:51.660 --> 00:23:09.570
Randy McWilliams: Is just soothing. They're really soothing. They're really positive kind of message of peace and tranquility and you I that's exactly what I need to hear. So, you know, the crystals and all that stuff. I mean,

146
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.260
Shawn Phalen: You know,

147
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.100
Precarious

148
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.980
Randy McWilliams: God, I know it's

149
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:26.910
Randy McWilliams: Good people that know what they're doing there, you know. They do a really there. You know, you don't have a bunch of fake key people trying to pull it off, you've got

150
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:36.780
Randy McWilliams: 30 plus years when it wasn't even popular well now it's true. And I'm and I'm constantly

151
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:44.250
Randy McWilliams: surprised at you know how much more research is done on the actual

152
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:56.160
Randy McWilliams: You know, serious scientific properties of the energy transference of crystals and stuff. I mean, more and more. One of the biggest

153
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:16.770
Randy McWilliams: Teachers and kind of, I don't know if he would be called a guru or whatever at this unity Center is a physicist UC graduate a UC Berkeley physicist and he said that he got into the crystal thing. You know, when he was younger and there's just

154
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:30.240
Randy McWilliams: That you can't deny the, the force, if you will, of energy transference of different crystals for different chakras and all that. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating.

155
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.890
Shawn Phalen: And there's some really good books on your chakra centers.

156
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.540
Randy McWilliams: You know how energy gets trapped in your chakra centers and how you try, it's all true.

157
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:51.780
Shawn Phalen: Kundalini Yoga is also a really good one for all of that. So if you're ever in you know if you ever feel like Googling and it's it's really amazing.

158
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.650
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, got Ching, and

159

Randy McWilliams: I'm showing really solid in my sobriety I ma

162
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:30.540
Randy McWilliams: You know things come up like these situations that happened, whether it's this crazy thing here at the house or getting a bit of bad news that might change plans. It's just really learning how to redirect.

Randy McWilliams: Money my old

164
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:45.870
Randy McWilliams: You know my really set ways of catastrophizing yeah and I mean that is just what I've done for decades and

165
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:55.620
Randy McWilliams: I'm just really staying aware of it. This term because even in the past when I thought I was doing well and had a little bit of time under my belt.

166
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:13.260
Randy McWilliams: something would happen. And I would just go to F it and throw it all away. And so I'm just really trying to stay work on staying balanced and centered and when something happens just going back to the center. Stay grounded.

167
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.030
