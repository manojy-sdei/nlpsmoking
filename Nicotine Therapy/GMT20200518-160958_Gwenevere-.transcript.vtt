Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you're able to meet on the fly.

5
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.630
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

6
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We, I hope you are already up today.

7
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.160
Debbie Barker: You know, I was up.

8
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.630
Thank goodness

9
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.430
Debbie Barker: For quite a while.

10
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I wanted to hear more about your daughter's plans.

11
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.560
Debbie Barker: Well, she's in Texas right now.

12
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at that.

13
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, wow.

14
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.280
Wonderful.

15
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

16
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.840
Debbie Barker: The day before

17
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Unhappy terms you guys kind of have leveled out kind of communication as of yesterday.

18
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.640
Debbie Barker: Oh, yeah.

19
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.250
Debbie Barker: I've been hearing from her every day.

20
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You think she'll get any treatment out there or

21
00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.830
Debbie Barker: So yeah, hope so, plenty of stuff with her, but she's going to try to work yourself off but

22
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:13.050
Debbie Barker: She's got her own little trailer and you got a car that needs a couple of parts and so on. So it sounds pretty promising and she likes her job.

23
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.090
Debbie Barker: So let's good

24
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And did this fellow that you're not a big fan of. Did he go with her.

25
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.580
No.

26
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.740
Debbie Barker: No.

27
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like a blessing.

28
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.820
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I think so.

29
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:36.600
Debbie Barker: I just wanted to get her life straightened up live like a normal person instead of living off of me all the time.

30
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, yeah. Oh, yeah. Good. So you're setting me up. Yeah. Fabulous. So I'm opening up a note here want to take a look at some of the things that we started to work on.

31
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know in group. You had mentioned that you're sort of in this learning curve of patience.

32
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.100
Yes.

33
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That was insightful.

34
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.030
Debbie Barker: Sometimes our patients with yourself.

35
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.390
Debbie Barker: Hmm, especially with everything going on.

36
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So on.

37
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.110
Debbie Barker: beauty shop, one day, but they did.

38
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.150
Debbie Barker: No, no.

39
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Any word when when it's opening up for you guys out there.

40
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.580
Debbie Barker: Who probably, probably June or sometime later this month.

41
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there your governor give that information out.

42
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.080
Debbie Barker: Yo, one place is open in town, but they just want too much money to cut hair.

43
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:49.860
Right.

44
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.840
Debbie Barker: I'd rather wait and go with my same lady that's been cutting it for years.

45
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sense and you're not going to give it a shot. You tried that once. And it turned out a hot mess.

46
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.420
Right.

47
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.800
Debbie Barker: No, I wouldn't try to cut my hair, I thought about it because it's down in my eyes already

48
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.780
Debbie Barker: I hate that.

49
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.100
Yeah.

50
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe today if you're up to it, we could do a little bit of work that

51
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little bit. I'm on the creative side, we've done a little bit with the protective figure we did some imagery over there.

52
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be okay if we did some of that again today.

53
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.500
Debbie Barker: Well, we can work on it.

54
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

55
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is I'm

56
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like the distancing metaphor that you did well with the balloon. Right. Remember that one.

57
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep.

58
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. We did that one and then this. It's this container emotional container is kind of similar except instead of it going away like a balloon. This one's going to be

59
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Just in a container doesn't have to be small like this can be as big as you want. But this is what this activity is is

60
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: In and of itself, that can be useful, but later on down the line. These are all pieces of a bigger part of work that I want to do with you.

61
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly doing some em, Dr. And these are sort of the preparation pieces.

62
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think about

63
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting your emotional

64
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say a distressing emotion, whether it's fear, anger, jealousy, or discussed or something and you were to put it inside of a container.

65
00:10:52.050 --> 00:11:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you tell me in your imagination. What that container might be the instructions on this are that it be big enough and strong enough to hold all that negative stuff. What comes to your imagination, what would that be a container.

66
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.490
Debbie Barker: Wouldn't have to be a very big box.

67
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you want to be a box. What's okay so box and what is it made of

68
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.240
Debbie Barker: Paper box.

69
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.620
Okay.

70
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So paper box is

71
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oftentimes,

72
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If it gets wet, it can disintegrate. So it's kind of nice in the imagination to make sure that it's strong enough that whatever's in there can't escape.

73
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.440
Debbie Barker: But will make it a metal box.

74
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like paper can dissolve. So we got metal and about how big is it imagination.

75
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.960
Debbie Barker: Mm hmm can bike in

76
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 by 10

77
00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: By 10 beautiful and in order to keep some of those whether there's thoughts or beliefs or memories or negative emotions inside that container, you get a sense that there might be a locking system to keep, keep the lid down to make sure that it all stays there.

78
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:12.990
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

79
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What would the locking system be

80
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.390
Debbie Barker: Just the lock and unlock

81
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, lock, I can unlock have a key combination

82
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.320
The key.

83
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful. Okay.

84
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that is done. Nicely done.

85
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And currently,

86
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that your daughter has relocated very recently.

87
00:12:50.070 --> 00:13:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might still be around your daughter. This is shifting gears that containers complete and we're shifting gears. We're going to start to work on this thing called an anchor room, which is basically a safe place.

88
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, it's in that that right hemisphere, where the creative mind is, but first I want to understand what dilemmas. You're still challenged with

89
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So in your life these days.

90
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are your biggest challenges.

91
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.700
Debbie Barker: Just the uncertainty right now.

92
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha, you talked about the coven

93
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.220
Debbie Barker: Right.

94
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

95
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.840
Debbie Barker: I can't get my other car tagged in just

96
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.630
Debbie Barker: Few things I want to get done. So life can be a little bit easier.

97
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got the older

98
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.890
Debbie Barker: Older van and sometime it don't start it has to be jumped and

99
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.340
Debbie Barker: Been sitting there since Christmas so

100
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.300
Debbie Barker: I didn't call the DMV, maybe they'll be open today so I can get that thing gagged

101
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.200
Okay.

102
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.890
Debbie Barker: Vehicle

103
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.210
Okay.

104
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you have

105
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A dilemma and you basically have a solution figured out, well, I'll make a call and I'll find out what their hours are so that maybe you could go down there, if possible. Maybe they've got it something online as it means to solve it.

106
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:30.840
Debbie Barker: I've tried, we went in and try that. But just hadn't been registered in a while. So it's got to be done at the DMV. Oh.

107
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

108
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And

109
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This goal that you have, which is I'd like to feel better about myself.

110
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about what that is where the challenges with that.

111
00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:06.450
Debbie Barker: Well, I think, I think the stress and everything will, you know, gradually, settle down with Gabby and things kind of slowly go back to normal. Okay.

112
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see here kept the the information you

113
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Regarding the I did a little survey, just to see if you're presenting with any PTSD symptoms.

114
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You had mentioned a couple of things which was awesome. Interesting activities that you use to enjoy. Is that, is that part of just sort of this temporary

115
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Environment.

116
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.430
Or do you think

117
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You think so.

118
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so that's not so much about the PTSD symptoms. It's more about just life circumstance.

119
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:51.930
Right.

120
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So the, I would like to feel better about myself. So something that I had

121
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: written out here as an objective to kind of take a look at that is asking you to identify what the challenges are to increasing self esteem.

122
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see, April, we said it was about a 3.5 so is in your own words, what do you think would bring that self esteem up

123
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.990
Debbie Barker: If I gained a little bit of weight back

124
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

125
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.450
Debbie Barker: Was able to get out a little bit more

126
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:48.360
Debbie Barker: I think I just got stuck in a rut with Kathy here. And I think the weight loss that I had last year which strictly just stress.

127
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.290
Okay.

128
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And worry over her.

129
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.680
Debbie Barker: I'm in the middle of things, between the two of them.

130
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.190
Debbie Barker: Yeah, so I get, you know, move things

131
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're your

132
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Husband.

133
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You think

134
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.400
Debbie Barker: Might as well be.

135
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.950
Debbie Barker: Okay yeah years

136
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's it's a sometimes I forget whether it's common law or what have you. So I'll probably just refer to my husband.

137
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: He's never had any children have is that right

138
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:43.170
Debbie Barker: Yeah. He's got three kids of his own, but he doesn't have a relationship one come out and seeing them for a while, but he's in prison, but he's working on trying to have a relationship with them.

139
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just have animals in your room with you now. Right. You have a sense of privacy this morning.

140
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.510
Yeah.

141
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: For for getting his first name, if you could, so I don't

142
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.420
Debbie Barker: Know me

143
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How many. That's right. So,

144
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When Tommy and Cassie, kind of, have you in the middle.

145
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that Tommy wants to Cassie wants no part of

146
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:36.060
Debbie Barker: Me just one, sir. It's straight known in it could be you know something about what she did. The, the day before that, because she was real bad about going in and out of the house at all hours, you know, day and night and constantly WAKING US UP.

147
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.020
Right.

148
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want the same thing. So is it more about Tommy's delivery. That's the concern.

149
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.930
Debbie Barker: You know, but I think he's come down to choose left to

150
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And we do

151
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.430
Debbie Barker: You know, reached our limit with her going

152
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.630
Yeah.

153
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:07.080
Debbie Barker: And never getting anything back never get any respect and she's never have be about anything.

154
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.250
Debbie Barker: Even if she gets what she wants to keep it that way all of our life.

155
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:27.750
Debbie Barker: When me and my husband separated our property and divorced. I got remarried and if I said no. Was she would go to her dad, and of course or dad would do it.

156
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:29.730
Debbie Barker: And

157
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:40.500
Debbie Barker: She just text me. But anyway, and if they would say no. Well then, my husband would say yes, you know, so she

158
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.610
Debbie Barker: She always got or she on which was a big mistake.

159
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.290
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

160
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:55.290
Debbie Barker: They wouldn't do moving along with what I said, you know, we've seen break something. Well, it's broke. You know, it's about once we're not replacing it.

161
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.940
Debbie Barker: Right. You know, I've tried to be a lot more

162
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.680
Debbie Barker: Stricter with or

163
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:11.940
Debbie Barker: You know, not you know out of reason, but I don't see replacing something when she's broken it

164
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.400
Debbie Barker: She got to learn it, there's consequences to things.

165
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a natural consequence. And so when people come in and they prevent them from learning those natural consequences it carries on into adulthood.

166
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, expecting everyone to clean up her mess.

167
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.180
Debbie Barker: Right, absolutely all the time.

168
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is about to change for you. So what I'm doing right now is trying to see what an area.

169
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Of target might be that we could do some work on today. So at this point, you're not too worried. It sounds like about the stress.

170
00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about to get better. That's what I'm hearing from you that without Kathy there the tension between those two. You won't have to put yourself kind of in the middle to

171
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to Tommy and make sure Kathy's okay too.

172
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think that that 3.5 self esteem. That's kind of low. You think that's going to go up.

173
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes. Okay.

174
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.590
Debbie Barker: Interesting. Once you get my hair cut.

175
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So funny.

176
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So really this is about you getting out now i'm ok so I'll just say once haircut.

177
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're like a by getting out. Are you talking about just walking around the block kind of thing or

178
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:47.490
Debbie Barker: I'm going fishing and, you know, being able to do things that we used to be able to do

179
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Tommy up for sufficient

180
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.550
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

181
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:54.480
Debbie Barker: Oh, yeah.

182
00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's a real that's a real possibility, don't even take a bunch of people for that being around people around.

183
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:09.690
Debbie Barker: No real nice little like you get up there and you just forget about everything else that's going on, except fishing and having a good time.

184
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that kind of addresses the loss of interest in activities. That's going to change, you're gonna be able to go fishing. That's going to help the self esteem, um,

185
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This one here. There's a little. It's a pretty low number. It's a one, which you had mentioned was just a little bit, which was avoid. In other words,

186
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Over that last month, you were bothered a little bit by avoiding external reminders of the stressful experience. For example, people places conversations activities objects or situations.

187
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you were referring to back then.

188
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.120
Debbie Barker: I'm thinking over just be depressed and counted down on myself.

189
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.020
Okay.

190
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me some of the depressing thoughts. What are some of those thoughts.

191
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.230
Debbie Barker: With Kathy here. I just didn't seem like I had

192
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:27.660
Debbie Barker: You know, I was going to improve very much. It was always going to be stressful, you know, and always going to be a conflict with our

193
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So trying I've come out this a couple of different ways, trying to

194
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Cover if there is anything that you still kind of have some stress or worry or discomfort. I know, physically, you're in pain and you're waiting for surgeries to happen.

195
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: From trying to see if there's anything on a psychological level that might be disruptive of sleep might be causing nightmares might be causing some tension inter personally trying to check in on there and see how that's doing

196
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.520
Debbie Barker: Well, one thing with my sleep. It's hard to sleep with that bad knee.

197
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:44.610
Debbie Barker: Hmm. Wake me up. I've been putting patches on it, but that burns it after a while. And I've gotta leave Martha put in batches on it. At least I don't wake up in the middle of night working straighten my knee up.

198
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And

199
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.660
Debbie Barker: Have been the middle of the night was her going back and forth, back and

200
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.010
Debbie Barker: Forth, all the time, dude.

201
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.730
Yeah.

202
00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but nothing from your abuse history comes up. Is that what I'm hearing

203
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing from though.

204
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.960
Debbie Barker: I'm pretty well work through that.

205
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.950
Okay.

206
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.770
Debbie Barker: That's in the past. He's gone back every mended abuse me is gone.

207
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sometimes for people that haven't processed it when something is reminded if there's something that sounds like it looks like it all those old feelings come up. So for you, that does not happen is that right

208
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.360
Debbie Barker: Every now and then, but I don't let it bother me.

209
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then if it's not bothering you, then there's nothing to fix, right.

210
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I agree. Okay, so I really want to just make sure I carefully touched on that topic.

211
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is that without current stressors.

212
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And without you, it can change if something changes and you tell me boy, you know, I'm starting to have disrupted sleep.

213
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm starting to really know have these difficult communications with Tommy a you and I can eat more frequently. But I think what we'll do is we'll move our appointments out because it doesn't sound like you have any current

214
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of stressors going on.

215
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want to develop

216
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: A

217
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: relapse prevention plan.

218
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The difficult part is I'm you tell me, is it your plan on staying on Suboxone forever or did you want to eventually come off of it.

219
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.710
Debbie Barker: Maybe eventually after my surgeries and stuff is over with.

220
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.150
Debbie Barker: Okay. Hopefully the pain will go down to where I can do with that a lot better.

221
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.020
Okay.

222
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're talking about months from now.

223
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.150
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I'm not sure when

224
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

225
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:11.250
Debbie Barker: No, I don't need them. One of them called me, you know, or trying to schedule. I still got to see the back specialist, but at least they found me somebody to go see him and he said that you know he'll do it, that sort of thing. Okay.

226
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

227
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I was going to go to an anchor room, but I think I'm going to shift gears instead we'll just take a look at your relapse prevention plan. Maybe we'll kind of fill that in a little bit more

228
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right right now.

229
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not coming with you're not telling me any kind of current psychological stress. So it's difficult to build on that I if you're heading in the direction of healthy, happy.

230
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're about to get back in your groove with hobbies and fun. Then let's stick with that. So we'll stick with what's working

231
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So if that comes back up. I can always develop that with you.

232
00:27:48.540 --> 00:28:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, I'm looking at a relapse prevention plan right now. I have emotional triggers, relax. I'm sorry relationship triggers events that are triggers healthy coping skills. People like and call self soothing.

233
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have anybody under people you can call. So Debbie, if you were ever in a moment where

234
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You started to feel like your use of an opiate was starting to head in the direction of self medicating psychological distress or you were seeking out the euphoria that would be addictive behavior, right, you recognize those kind of terms.

235
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was heading in that direction or you were in it. Is there someone you would trust enough to talk to and call

236
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.600
Debbie Barker: Yes.

237
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.700
Debbie Barker: Who my sister.

238
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and give me that sister's name.

239
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.200
Debbie Barker: Me.

240
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Tammy. Okay. Excellent. So I got her name in here. Anyone else that you would trust enough to call reach out to

241
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.490
Debbie Barker: Me.

242
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. It's good to have that right there in the home.

243
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And

244
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ever just part of the self soothing the self care. I've got a couple of things. I've got canning. You like that and doing some cartoons. Did you ever kind of pull out the, the, the, the paper and the ink and start doing any or does that still today.

245
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.140
Debbie Barker: But I found that some of my older drawings and things like that, though.

246
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a start, isn't it.

247
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.380
Debbie Barker: Mm hmm.

248
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Get inspired. Excellent.

249
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:51.240
Debbie Barker: Trying to turn this room upside down and we just need to have a good thrown away party for a while. We just got duplicates of a lot of things and things. We just don't use anymore.

250
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.140
Right.

251
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.670
Debbie Barker: He had a full house of stuff and I already had a full house of stuff plus

252
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So if added that I put Tommy and Tammy under people you can call and for emotional triggers in the past. Anyway, um,

253
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I have anger I have sad I have depressed. I have helpless. Helpless. So those are sort of historically may have contributed to to to triggers, um,

254
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any sort of craving that you have currently that comes up where you think, gee, I'd like to get out of this and be numb emotionally said

255
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: No. No. Okay.

256
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, this was very brief little meeting, but at least we got to touch base.

257
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's actually put something on the books. So that's not so on the fly.

258
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.620
Debbie Barker: All right.

259
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.410
Debbie Barker: I'm gonna work on quitting smoking.

260
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.430
Oh,

261
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm going to do. I'll write a goal that has to do with that. What's your actual goal around that.

262
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:20.280
Debbie Barker: To try to go down to 10 cigarettes a day. Okay.

263
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it beautiful and then your that would be

264
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.130
Debbie Barker: Again, we can support each other.

265
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.240
Debbie Barker: That way.

266
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. Okay, so what I'll do is I'll put that down, ultimately, you want to quit boat on a short term goal. It could be you'd like to see yourself cut back to 10 a day.

267
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Um, let's see, I want to go down.

268
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To 10 cigarette. How many, how much you smoking now.

269
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:54.660
Debbie Barker: pack a day.

270
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I have no idea how many are in a pack.

271
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

272
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.220
Debbie Barker: It's a nervous habit.

273
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I just give you at least one thing to experiment with until we meet again.

274
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:15.390
Yeah.

275
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So number one, you're more than welcome. If you're not already on a Wellbutrin which is sounds a lot like

276
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The generic name Bupropion sounds a lot like the sub

277
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.590
Debbie Barker: On mobile, yeah.

278
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

279
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have one. Yeah, yeah. So

280
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Wellbutrin actually has a pretty good history for addressing the cravings mess. Number one, which you may want to talk to the physician about

281
00:32:48.060 --> 00:33:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Number two, and this is the part that you could be doing this, believe it or not, helps people tremendously. So it goes like this. The second I have the thought or I catch myself starting to reach for the cigarette. I say I'm going to wait 90 seconds.

282
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't think you can do anything for 90 seconds right

283
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You say you know what, I'm just going to wait 90 seconds. I'm just going to delay for 90 seconds that cigarette and you go use a distraction. You go distract yourself, whatever it is. I'm draw walk watch tv youtube

284
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That 90 seconds often turns into an hour.

285
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:35.940
Debbie Barker: The

286
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We forget about the thing. And we're going and we're distracted. So then you just got rid of an hour, but honestly even Debbie. If you get 10 minutes

287
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a win.

288
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.370
Debbie Barker: That's true, that's true.

289
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a trick you just say, You know what, I can wait 90 seconds.

290
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, you know, and then if you want to you can say

291
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

292
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also because it's so convenient. I have them right here in this room.

293
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They know that you leave here and you go put them somewhere in convenient if they're not there. They're not right here because it's unconscious. We're just automatically grabbing it and just not even thinking about it.

294
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.920
Debbie Barker: You know,

295
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So I would say somewhere that is similar to in the trunk locked. Now that might not be for you, but somewhere like that where you are inconvenience having to schlep over there and go get it.

296
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the amount of time that it takes to find the keys to go to that puts that 90 seconds that you need that you may be able to think this is stupid. What am I doing, why am I doing this wrong.

297
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm taking a second. And I'm like, I really How badly do I want to know. I can wait another 90 seconds. I'm going to go wash the dishes. I'm going to go think about a recipe for this weekend. So, those, those two things go make it inconvenient.

298
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That embeds the amount of time it takes for you to go reach for it. You might think of something healthy to do or you might snap out of it. What am I doing, I don't need to smoke, that's just, that's just habit.

299
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And then deliberately and putting sticky notes around wait 90 seconds until your sweetheart, Tommy. Tell me wait 90 seconds, help me remember

300
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.030
Debbie Barker: You just gotta let me

301
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

302
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you got to set something up here, I've

303
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Already mentioned that. And I figured I'd throw those out for you. They've been really handy for people

304
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so why don't we look at June 8

305
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: At noon.

306
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.240
Which is a Monday.

307
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:51.780
Debbie Barker: Writing

308
00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.160
Debbie Barker: Sounds good to me.

309
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And but if other things come up

310
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Please don't hesitate, we can meet a whole lot sooner than that. But it doesn't sound like you're having any current sort of pressures. Aside from this, this medication that's addressing the pain. But if something does come up. We can certainly nice to them that

311
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.890
