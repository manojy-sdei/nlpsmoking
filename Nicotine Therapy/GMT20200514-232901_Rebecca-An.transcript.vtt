00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.080
Amanda G: But I want only that one email so she put an email the other day, but she doesn't remember she set up.

24
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.180
Amanda G: So I've been trying to set that email. I'm trying to get into that Outlook email so I can give it to you. So knowing it rings that I know I have mail.

25
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.990
Uh huh.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.690
Amanda G: I was have a computer on it but it said it didn't detect the computer.

30
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.080
Amanda G: So I spent two hours doing that. And I'm not even using it.

31
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As crazy

32
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.200
Amanda G: I'm frustrated

33
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing is something miles on it.

34
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.200
Amanda G: Yeah, the other day, some lady just ran into us.

35
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.880

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.610
Amanda G: mother's name around nothing

39
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.920
Amanda G: And I did I hear from people that she just got out of a program, but I can tell that she does drugs. I don't know that for sure, but I can. I'm pretty sure she does.

40
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:28.710
Amanda G: So, um, I said the baby right there. She my wife, grab the baby and left. And she started screaming. I said, oh my god, I said, you just should have just brought him inside. So she's planning on that girls door and

41
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.730
Amanda G: She doesn't come in and she comes out of the room was money in her hand. So is your babies at my house and she goes, oh, I didn't even know the door was open.

42
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.640
Amanda G: She might say, Oh, thank you. Oh, I didn't know was gone, or they didn't even know he was missing.

43
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.980
Amanda G: So, then chances, like, oh, we wish to call the cops. This is no I don't want to call it up. I see my cheese that taken away. I

44
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.310
Amanda G: Don't know, it kind of sucks. I don't. I know they're doing drugs, whatever, but just wait and then there was a dog that they don't watch either. So we started taking care of the dog.

45
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.810
Amanda G: For me to get food and this lady, she's just on her phone. And she just barely caps us but sending me look up from her phone.

46
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.720
Amanda G: For chassis goes out there screaming and I knew that girl wasn't going to pull over, but I get out and I look at the license plate that girl India printing off.

47
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.300
Amanda G: She's all pissed off, but she gets her stopping it is an accomplished nothing

48
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

49
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.900
Amanda G: I get pissed off, and she was already never thought to look at the license plate. I see what we're going to do with the fucking Window key grass.

50
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.570
Amanda G: What the fuck was actually help

51
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.520
Amanda G: Like that and I sit. Exactly. You don't think like that. You're not helping.

52
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.620
Amanda G: The situation right now.

53
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.960
Amanda G: I mean you she was mad when she got out the car that girl didn't roll the window down

54
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.840
Amanda G: She wasn't gonna pull over.

55
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, so you do

56
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.560
Amanda G: Where she worked it out presents and I got the license plate.

57
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.940
Amanda G: So we went to this Albertson but she was coming from that way. This way. So we think there's she works with our sins.

58
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.000
Amanda G: Are just not right now. And she didn't even really do damage. She just scratched the car, but

59
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.460
Amanda G: That's why you're not supposed to text and drive

60
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Miss the Jews to talk to you probably didn't have insurance or anything.

61
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.440
Amanda G: I wouldn't want to get out of Chelsea was banging on my window, either.

62
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.890
Amanda G: Right or wrong, I would want to get out either. I probably get my ass kicked. But if I didn't. I still want to get out.

63
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.100
Amanda G: And we're in the middle of an intersection like

64
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.400
Amanda G: It was she just she's a stuff to think sometimes it's not. That's not going to help us, that would have been

65
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.240
Amanda G: Would have been in more trouble. We started with and we didn't do anything.

66
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly. It would have turned out to be, you know what I mean, you guys would have been it

67
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.060
Amanda G: Would have been our fault. Yeah, yeah.

68
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.510
Totally

69
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.110
Amanda G: She doesn't see that she just blows up.

70
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.140
Amanda G: And don't get me wrong, I get pissed off too but

71
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.450
Amanda G: I may get pissed off. And I'm going to, I need to do what's right. I'm not just gonna

72
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.910
Amanda G: I don't know, I'm not those one of those people I do regret, a lot of things, but I don't wonder. Oh my god. Oh, how did I get here, what happened. I know exactly what Whoa, why on there. And what happened.

73
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.320
Right.

74
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:26.010
Amanda G: But I also a lot of things went through my head before that. I'm like, oh, should I make this choice to make this choice, like a lot of things go and I don't. I think she is now like she's an airhead. But I think her head is just really empty.

75
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you say that

76
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.890
Amanda G: Because I can tell that I'm always thinking. And if I talk to her. She's a call.

77
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.480
Amanda G: And then a while later, she's like what happened. I see you don't remember that conversation. She's like, no, I wasn't for you.

78
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.490
Amanda G: All take away and it's not that she doesn't care. It just she doesn't. She worries different than I do.

79
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.230
Amanda G: She read everything

80
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.840
Amanda G: She's broken like every bone in her body.

81
00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

82
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.710
Amanda G: She's 11 years younger than me and I've only broke one bone.

83
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

84
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see active and she's like, really active

85
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.070
Amanda G: Yes, you know I'm not seeing that movie, you got served

86
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.610
Amanda G: It's a dancing movie where they break down to where they pop dance. No. Well, she knows how to pop gets she's a white girl.

87
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.990
Amanda G: Usually white girls don't get

88
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.880
Amanda G: It. I have no rhythm.

89
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.890
Amanda G: She does. That's why her leg has been her leg in three years.

90
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She hasn't been to her like in three years.

91
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, why

92
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.570
Amanda G: She had to go bad.

93
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.630
Amanda G: That's what we lost her house in TLC.

94
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

95
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.160
Amanda G: So, um, she has to fix her knee. She was just supposed to go in for a meniscus tear

96
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.420
Amanda G: It was a second one on that same me because she dances and it got infected and he just sold it up.

97
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:13.950
Amanda G: On my god yeah it was horrible, but he's in his 80s to but still we should have not went to him, but we didn't think nothing of it because he had a really good to others.

98
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.470
Amanda G: So,

99
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.860
Amanda G: Yeah, and honey. She had a buckle hand on one knee and the right one. And then she had two torn meniscus on the left one.

100
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

101
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.980
Amanda G: There was a third one that he had did

102
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:37.830
Amanda G: And it's like her legs got stuck. It doesn't bend. It's like it got stuck to it was because it was infected to

103
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:46.050
Amanda G: Move it. So the tissue just grew to all of it if they had been moving it went to grow like that. So, it grew just the way her leg was

104
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

105
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:59.790
Amanda G: So all we have to, I mean, I'm pretty sure whatever it is actually didn't mess that up but. So in this case, is it better because she can she says she feels like bone on bone. Yeah.

106
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.340
Amanda G: So that that ruined, but then

107
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.210
Amanda G: They have to click at kisses to bend her knee.

108
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was gonna say I wish she'd been checked out by another doctor

109
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.010
Amanda G: Yeah, we went to physical therapy they tried to put to put us in physical therapy for six months to try to bust it. Mm hmm.

110
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.100
Amanda G: He said, it's not going to the physical therapist.

111
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.660
Amanda G: Because I guess.

112
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:31.740
Amanda G: before surgery. They want you to, um, I guess, Medicaid is asking you to get all these pre authorization. So you have to go to physical therapy to do this to get another authorization for surgery.

113
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.010
Amanda G: So, but then

114
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.340
Amanda G: It was like surgery or the house.

115
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.460
Amanda G: So other shooters always end up coming up.

116
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.080
Amanda G: Yeah, like kind of how I feel about the meetings and I do want to come to the meetings, but

117
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.170
Amanda G: I was over here trying to didn't get in work.

118
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

119
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to start checking in, like,

120
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 30 minutes you can actually check in up to six hours before

121
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.210
Amanda G: I was going to ask you that I was going to check in this morning when I remembered

122
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, you can actually check in up to six, six hours before so

123
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally. And then that way you're already jumped in and you you're already. You've already got the number to zoom and so you didn't, you can go straight to zoom

124
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.640
Amanda G: Is always the same.

125
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.990
Amanda G: But I don't ever come here because you guys said we have to check in for it so

126
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:35.340
Amanda G: That you're not going to get paid if I don't check in, but it's not your job to find out who you get paid or not that you know what I mean. Yeah. So I mean, I kind of figured that was why. And then, so I don't know so

127
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.530
Amanda G: He has a lot of problems like a lot more than I do but so

128
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.780
Amanda G: She needs to do something like she was, she was on the opiates minister to them. And I told her to get off of him, but

129
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.970
Amanda G: So now. She smokes weed.

130
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.530
Amanda G: But she just got her pot card so that tells you something in between.

131
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.010
Amanda G: She's been doing that.

132
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.310
Amanda G: You know what I'm saying.

133
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:13.860
Amanda G: Yeah, so that's where I was the other day, they told me $95 I took the paper and then he told me, Oh, that was three years old, they didn't tell me that when I went there and asked me how old the paper was

134
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:26.820
Amanda G: So then, but I haven't asked you for that paper when we first got here. We've been here three years and I had been asking for that paper, but they sent it to my dad's house. My dad brought my stuff in February. We didn't go through that stuff until April.

135
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:36.150
Amanda G: So now we went to go do it. And then they said it was too old, but then it looked at it and then they were like, okay, instead of 95 it's 150 or they can just do it.

136
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

137
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.480
Amanda G: What are you going to say no, like they should have told me all that before. Yeah.

138
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:51.660
Amanda G: He only asked what was on the paper. So I told him, but he didn't ask, like, all it needs to be within this time frame. See, a lot of people don't do their jobs.

139
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.300
Amanda G: Yeah.

140
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How can it be

141
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.980
Amanda G: It can be over two years old.

142
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

143
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.630
Amanda G: It was 2017 the year we got here.

144
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you still have to have a marijuana card in New Mexico.

145
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:09.870
Everywhere.

146
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.130
Amanda G: It's legal. But you still you can't use habit.

147
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.620
Amanda G: Yep.

148
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.920
Amanda G: It's illegal. She seems to think it's legal, but literally right now it's illegal.

149
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.220
Amanda G: But

150
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.100
Amanda G: I don't find anything wrong with it. I don't

151
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.310
Amanda G: I don't do it, but I used to

152
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.640
Amanda G: I just don't see any point

153
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.160
Amanda G: Eating and getting investing

154
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.860
Amanda G: I have some, I have a problem with later today. Why would I want to eat more.

155
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, it's true.

156
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.310
Amanda G: So, I mean, that's all it did for me. And then after I started doing other drugs and then it's like a paranoid.

157
00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:02.700
Amanda G: I don't do it at all. I really out I'll drink a beer or smoke weed I Pew can. Am I go to bed. I remember what happens. I don't remember anything.

158
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

159
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.870
Amanda G: I just don't do it anymore. I don't know why. What happened to me that I can't, I can't, I'm glad, but

160
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.070
Amanda G: I think, I think, way more than I already do as it is.

161
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, probably.

162
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.160
Amanda G: Yeah, my

163
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:25.320

164
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.290
Amanda G: from Arizona. He's in the Marine Corps.

165
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.610
Amanda G: And he said he wasn't coming here. He said he only had to go straight through. He had four days to make it

166
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.700
Amanda G: He called to call me at five o'clock. That's how you look, they're coming now.

167
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's coming to visit you.

168
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you happy.

169
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.210
Amanda G: Yeah, I just have to make it there and back by seven.

170
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.180
Amanda G: See, he should have told me this before I wouldn't, I wouldn't kept a car today.

171
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.630
Amanda G: You know what I mean, it's like

172
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:14.850
Amanda G: Yeah, just step back. I wasn't able to keep the car went out to start the car at seven o'clock, and I don't usually started early. So I have a car that starts itself from inside. I don't have to go warm it up. I start. Well, it wouldn't work. So I took the remote control apart.

173
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:26.460
Amanda G: I said, Oh, well just switch keys because I have another key is a dummy cute only will open the door. It won't start the car. But if I start the car with the original key kick it off with the other one, it'll start. But then I can lock the doors.

174
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.330
Amanda G: But they can't go. Can't get very far because the car will shut off.

175
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.700
Amanda G: So I said, Okay, I'll do that might get to the client requirements.

176
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.060
Amanda G: I like my lights on last night.

177
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

178
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:51.930
Amanda G: They're automatic but I turned them off because we've got this drive through and they were shining and somebody's window. So I turned them off and then it, put it back on. But I didn't put them on auto I put them on on

179
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.350
Amanda G: And when I got out it was being and I clicked it once and it wasn't a model. So they were on all night.

180
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your battery got drained. Yeah.

181
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.960
Amanda G: So I kept it to make sure that

182
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.170
Amanda G: When she got at 730 she wouldn't get in the car and when start at least I'm home and I can get. I can get it started.

183
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

184
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:18.240
Amanda G: I didn't plan on going today but and then got it started at seven because we didn't even end up leaving until 830 just be there at nine.

185
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.570
Amanda G: Imagine if I started at 30 minutes before she had to go to work.

186
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

187
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.710
Amanda G: And I don't know why I did that this morning, but I did. I don't ever remember started for her. She doesn't herself.

188
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.770
Amanda G: But today, I did it for some reason.

189
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's good thing you did.

190
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How

191
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.830
Amanda G: Have you been

192
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working

193
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working working

194
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

195
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.910
Amanda G: We have to wear masks out here now.

196
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We've all we've had to out here like can't go into a store without a mask on.

197
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That will really review.

198
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.610
Amanda G: Just barely today that they did that, it starts on Saturday.

199
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:13.290
Amanda G: Oh really, yeah. I've never wore a mask anywhere because I don't go anywhere ways, but the places I do go I stay my distance But I wore one today and oh my god

200
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.990
Amanda G: I can't handle it.

201
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.370
Now, I know.

202
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.620
Amanda G: Where to my car, but

203
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.340
Amanda G: I just put on the sun visor. When I go in, I put it on and then

204
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.720
Amanda G: We're locked down until maybe do and I don't know.

205
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot of places that are open starting what they call a soft open opening back up. You know where they're beginning to start providing services again.

206
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's, you know, limited

207
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:50.070
Amanda G: I understand. Okay, so they say that we're doing it a little bit at a time because

208
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.280
Amanda G: New Mexico has more. We had more cases where we're increasing the declining

209
00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.920
Amanda G: And why open at all.

210
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.600
Amanda G: But then I understand that we won't make it like the economy won't make it without it.

211
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.410
Amanda G: And why did you give away all that stimulus money to all of us in mind to give it to the business, business owners.

212
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:11.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um,

213
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They did have a program for some of the for

214
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Small business owners to

215
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.260
Amanda G: But a lot of some people don't. Some people didn't sign up, or they did and the money was already gone but really

216
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.840
Amanda G: I'm not saying that we shouldn't. Got it. But if that might be shared with us where the economy is going to be that bad.

217
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well, small businesses, they, they, you know, they rob Peter to pay Paul, they

218
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go from day to day

219
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, busy seasons are what carries them over.

220
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:40.500
Amanda G: Yeah.

221
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in the slow seasons.

222
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so there's gonna be a lot of small businesses, a close because, you know, there are certain you know events that happen.

223
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That bring in those

224
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally. And they don't have backup money.

225
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At all.

226
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.650
Amanda G: Because nobody got this will happen. Nobody everything

227
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.410
Amanda G: it'll never happen to them.

228
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.490
Amanda G: Remember the last session we have

229
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.540
Amanda G: Yeah, that's what everybody think anything can happen to anybody.

230
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.240
Amanda G: Always be prepared for

231
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:21.450
Amanda G: So this, this covert 19 year didn't really affect me. I mean, it did because she has to go to work all the time, but he didn't have to stop work.

232
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.510
Amanda G: The paychecks have been the same. Nothing's changed for us, except that I don't keep the car as much

233
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.930
Amanda G: Right, I don't, I don't need to go to the store. I don't

234
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.430
Amanda G: Whatever we need she can pick it up on the way, or we don't need it.

235
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.770
Amanda G: Not that important.

236
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:45.870
Amanda G: Back, knowing that it's an entity, but other people have lost her job like they can't pay rent. Like it's affected a lot of other people.

237
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, it really has

238
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

239
00:18:51.900 --> 00:19:05.280
Amanda G: But it wasn't unprepared either like so before all this. I don't know if I told you, but I went shopping and I go to the dollar, the Dollar Store apps or the Dollar General and they'll have tied for like $2 the big one and

240
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:12.030
Amanda G: So I'll get three coupons and then you can only use one phone number. So she uses her phone number. So I bought eight bottles.

241
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.850
Amanda G: And then I buy I don't buy a FOUR PACK OF tissue at a time i by the big one.

242
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.610
Amanda G: Patel's like that I bought Lysol

243
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.680
Amanda G: And then we went into this lockdown. But I didn't go anywhere for a month, but I was okay.

244
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We had everything you needed

245
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:33.690
Amanda G: Yeah, because I was taught you don't might go to the store, ya bye for packing gotta go back in two days or three days.

246
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

247
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.290
Amanda G: You want to go see people every day. I can't handle Walmart, as it is.

248
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.450
Amanda G: to shop at midnight. I don't want to

249
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.100
Amanda G: hear the noises

250
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.420
Amanda G: Can handle those noises in there. I have to leave sometimes

251
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.680
Amanda G: I'll just leave the basket walk out because I can't handle it. My anxiety is way too bad, and then they're rude.

252
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.220
Amanda G: And I'll be right back. But I

253
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.610
Amanda G: Might be rude and wherever we're gonna get. We're just getting into fighting and nothing's going to get accomplished and

254
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:06.960
Amanda G: I

255
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.290
Amanda G: Gotta go. But people will run into you there. They just don't care.

256
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.370
Yeah.

257
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. People are very busy. Just like when this whole thing started. People went out and buy cases in cases in cases of

258
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, toilet paper they selfishly, you know what I mean, thought that you know they were going to use 15 cases of toilet paper. While this whole thing was going on.

259
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For getting

260
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:37.020
Amanda G: You know, always wants to stand together when they they say, Don't go nowhere. It's all gone. Yeah.

261
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.000
Amanda G: How we supposed to stand together when look what you told us what you do and liquid everybody did

262
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:55.260
Amanda G: Uh huh. My wife died was like she didn't really know what the disease was it what was going on. Just you works a lot. She thought it was like a stomach thing. Like why is everybody buying tissue. I said that's not what it is or should it come from China. What do you mean

263
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.970
Amanda G: Oh, I didn't know that I was like, yeah, that's

264
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.280
Amanda G: Why are you here is freaking out. I haven't you nobody was ever had a Lysol wipes. But now I don't have any

265
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.720
Amanda G: That I use them everyday.

266
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.280
Amanda G: Look, I have so many of these night with money.

267
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.410
I

268
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:23.790
Amanda G: Put my tide pods in there, my sponges my tennis balls for the laundry mat.

269
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.120
Amanda G: Plants, all kinds of stuff.

270
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.540
Amanda G: But I bet you nobody has that laying around.

271
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.280
Amanda G: Because they didn't use it before.

272
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:33.540
Nope.

273
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree.

274
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's insane. This whole thing and I just read the other day that

275
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Other symptoms that are popping up with people that are coming are coming up with it. Our loss of smell.

276
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.870
Lots of us buds.

277
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they're in some people, the infection isn't just

278
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: attacking their loans, but it's putting holes in their brains to

279
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:04.950
Amanda G: Oh well.

280
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:15.090
Amanda G: Yeah, I would think you would attack all that to begin with. Because if you're sneezing and coughing. That's the first thing that goes. Anyways, when you have allergies or if you have a cold. Mm hmm.

281
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

282
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:23.700
Amanda G: So i and then they said, it can, it was coming into like pink eye or whatever watery eyes or something like that.

283
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: watery eyes congestion, you can't breathe. But some people have had like the stomach flu.

284
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: puking few you know pooping, you know,

285
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think as you just asked

286
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.260
Amanda G: I just think it's a common cold just really bad that you can't get you can't get past

287
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:55.770
Amanda G: That there's that lupus or there's, um, it's a cancer disease. I mean I cancer pill and they're giving they're giving it to the patients and they were getting better.

288
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it was lupus medicine.

289
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.040
Amanda G: Yeah, I think it was

290
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:10.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My, my sister in law has lupus and so she went to go get her medication and the pharmacy was all out and it's because when they did that research.

291
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And said that they thought that that medicine, you know, on a couple cases and that medicine worked

292
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doctor started prescribing it to people to keep them safe from from getting the virus. And so the people that actually had lupus couldn't get their medication.

293
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:27.660
Amanda G: I know

294
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's that it's

295
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.420
Amanda G: That I turned out they were America so you know how people have these

296
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:45.930
Amanda G: Where they have the kids like guns and soldiers and they have you there present, tell them what to do, and they can't do much like everybody comes here because you know we can. We're happy to speech and all that.

297
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.420
Amanda G: We better be we'd be better off like them because you put us to go to share and

298
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.620
Amanda G: We're like cockroaches. We just did whatever

299
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.580
Amanda G: That's what we did.

300
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We didn't stand together right

301
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.410
Amanda G: Now I feel sometimes

302
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:09.930
Amanda G: Yeah, like you said, they're buying bread all white. How much bread, can you keep in your fridge.

303
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.920
I don't

304
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:24.240
Amanda G: I was over here, handing tissue out because this guy in a wheelchair, we strike the bus with him. And I asked him when he said that he'd been to a couple stores. He couldn't find any. Why didn't find tissue here. I found in Berlin. Oh.

305
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.960
Amanda G: But he can't go all over, like the way I can

306
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.620
Amanda G: And people are out here at. So this lady that remember I told you that lady that I help

307
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.460
Yeah.

308
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:43.200
Amanda G: She's seven years old. She shouldn't be going out she's older today. I mean, I am too because I'm 40 book. I don't have health problems.

309
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

310
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.000
Amanda G: I don't know. She does. But she's still older she can get a cold faster than I can.

311
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:48.720
Yep.

312
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.660
Amanda G: And then we didn't have water for over a week.

313
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have water now.

314
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.480
Yeah.

315
00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:03.060
Amanda G: We got water Friday, I think I put it in Friday. But we ended up leaving because everybody's gonna want to take a shower. It was gonna want to do dishes.

316
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.130
Amanda G: We were barely gonna

317
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.450
Amanda G: It just would have. I just don't think it would have worked out so we just left. So I've been at my ass for a while.

318
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.490
Amanda G: Killing

319
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.820
Amanda G: My aunt only lives 15 minutes from Chelsea's job.

320
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh well.

321
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.620
Amanda G: I have to drive 30 minutes there and we have to drive 30 minutes back.

322
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.550
Amanda G: That's I don't keep the car.

323
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:38.610
Amanda G: It is. It's hard. It's hard on gas and it's just sometimes I don't need to go anywhere. I could just do a lot of it here. I don't mind being here.

324
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.660
Nobody right

325
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No reason why can't

326
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:52.170
Amanda G: I do have something to tell you. I use math. I think the last few days, I haven't used any today because I haven't had medicine since Monday.

327
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.400
Why

328
00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:01.230
Amanda G: Well, because maybe okay I didn't go last week, but I even last week before that I remember. So I got ahold of Angelina

329
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:13.080
Amanda G: And she ended up doing it shouldn't ever tell me that she got back to me. I ended up getting a message from my doctor or no I think Walker Albertsons text me let me know when he sent it to the truth. But I asked on Friday.

330
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:20.820
Amanda G: I was texting you saying I forgot me my wife were arguing, though. Yeah, so that day I text, but nobody got back to me.

331
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.470
Amanda G: And then I got a text on the six saying that my prescription was there.

332
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.570
Amanda G: For three days.

333
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.720
Amanda G: So it wasn't going to ask again.

334
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.790
Amanda G: So was it dismissed. I did a little bit her method on to just, I wouldn't hurt. You know what I mean.

335
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:44.250
Amanda G: There's still I make another meeting because he obviously only gave me to be for a reason and I missed again and then I'm gonna ask. So I didn't ask. I didn't even ask this week.

336
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.740
Amanda G: Cuz I canceled on Friday.

337
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:50.640
Amanda G: So,

338
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.270
So,

339
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you have it now. No.

340
00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:01.230
Amanda G: No, I don't have any right now, but I did do it cuz I'm going to try to wait because my meeting tomorrow, so I'm not hurting like that that bad.

341
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.590
Amanda G: But I don't want, I didn't want to hurt like I did with the Methadone how I got on the Suboxone to start with. You know what I mean.

342
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

343
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.100
Amanda G: Right. Is it a little. And I know not going from one drug to another is going to be better, but it just going to hold me over till I can get to him.

344
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.120
Amanda G: Because it was obviously a reason why he did it for three days.

345
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, um, it's when you miss appointments

346
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.310
Amanda G: Yeah.

347
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.970
Amanda G: And he had said before, and I and I understand why.

348
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.180
Amanda G: So, I mean, I've never, I was when I was a methadone. I didn't give a dirty two years.

349
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.700
Amanda G: I want to give a dirty.

350
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.300
Amanda G: So I would have had it, but I'm going to be dirty.

351
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.800
Amanda G: But once all the boxes back on again. I don't need to substitute that pain.

352
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.140
Amanda G: You know, anything that's what I want to get off. They don't have to depend on anybody or anything to be better.

353
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.130
Right.

354
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.070
Amanda G: And I only got on it like I don't even think I should be on for I think I should be on has

355
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.780
Amanda G: Because then I'm going to get

356
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.660
Amanda G: So addicted to the forums and how am I going to get back down.

357
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're on four milligrams a day.

358
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.140
Amanda G: Yeah.

359
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.420
Amanda G: That's nothing. I know, but it really does help. It's weird, but it does

360
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:26.250
Amanda G: That's why that was only on it for three days. I got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So I think I made last till Monday. Now we're Thursday. So I said only did it for two days. And I think I took like maybe five or 10 milligrams of her methadone.

361
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.230
Amanda G: Uh huh. So

362
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.530
Amanda G: It's just to take the edge off just to

363
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.250
Amanda G: I don't know if you've if you've been inadequate.

364
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.980
Amanda G: Say growing pains, you know, growing pains.

365
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

366
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.950
Amanda G: It's like that inside. You can't ever. You can't get to it water hot water.

367
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.920
Amanda G: You know, feel good for a little bit, but it's just not

368
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.400
Amanda G: Just ask you all the time. You want everybody to get to help me.

369
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.070
Really bitchy

370
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.490
Amanda G: I am like I'm irritated.

371
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want to be around anybody

372
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.690
Amanda G: Yeah, that's exactly exactly how it is.

373
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.180
Amanda G: In my phone doesn't shut up.

374
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.530
Amanda G: That's how I was on the Methadone I can talk for two weeks to nobody.

375
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

376
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.020
But, Chelsea.

377
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:22.860
Amanda G: And I did that because I didn't want to get sick. I wouldn't sick, the whole time. But I kept taking 1020 1020 I made those eight bottles last three weeks.

378
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:31.920
Amanda G: Last three days hurt me real bad. That's when I got a Suboxone I was going to go heroin. But then I don't know how to fix heroin. So I was like,

379
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:40.260
Amanda G: That was gonna ask somebody to solve it hurt anymore. But then I got Suboxone and I couldn't thirds. And I was like, oh my god, I felt better in 10 minutes

380
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god.

381
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.460
Amanda G: I should have done that a long time ago.

382
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.010
Amanda G: So then, okay.

383
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.420
Amanda G: I got into some awesome program.

384
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.220

395
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would rather

398
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I evil because

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.020
Amanda G: I don't have his email I asked you last night. If you can email it for me because I don't

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.180

Amanda G: Okay yeah cuz I don't have his I would email him to I've emailed both of you. But that's why I tell you, and I just feel closer to you. I mean, I don't mind telling him either. But

402
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.020
Amanda G: You can know more that's going on that I don't share with him in group.

403
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Right, right.

404
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:14.730
Amanda G: So, I mean, I would have told him to. It doesn't really matter. But I don't have is I don't have a way to contact him.

405
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: An email. Yeah. Come through me and let me ask him for meds because I would rather you come to me and say, look, this is what's going on.

406
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm out of meds, so that I can relay that to him so that he can fill your prescription so that you don't have to use any other alternatives. You know what I mean.

407
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.700
Yeah.

408
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.670
Amanda G: And and he probably did it for the three days. So I would be here on Friday. And then I didn't make it. You know what I mean.

409
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:53.190
Amanda G: Yeah. And then I don't know why I'm posting a text message when it's field. And I told him, I said, like this is two days later than he said it two days ago.

410
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.070
Amanda G: So she took me out a system and put me back in and it's still feeling work so

411
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:12.780
Amanda G: When I text Angelina, because I have to talk to Angelina, that's what they told me to talk to you. So I guess I'll ask you. Hopefully I don't miss, but I'll just had spoke to you. I mean about you, but she never even told me that she asked. I never got an email back

412
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.540
Amanda G: So I just

413
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.160
Amanda G: Actually they they text me on the six but I don't even know what he said to

414
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll know

415
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll know when you look on the bottle. When you pick them up. It'll say, well, yeah, it'll save the day they feel that

416
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.350
Amanda G: Okay.

417
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:47.280
Amanda G: Let's see what he says me he tells me he said to eat that your doctor sent you a prescription if I don't pay attention to that and go that day or the next day I will get one for two days from them.

418
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:48.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really

419
00:32:49.110 --> 00:33:00.540
Amanda G: Yeah, I'm thinking that they had already sent my prescription before I didn't miss on the six I missed the six and the one before that but I only got a text message on the six

420
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you talking about from your pharmacy.

421
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:15.450
Amanda G: Yeah, I don't know why I'm not getting it. As soon as the ability as soon as they scan that thing saying it's field you're supposed to get a text message immediately like Walmart, you

422
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:25.260
Amanda G: Know, and I told her I had got one because I went one day and I was like, well, is this prescription ready. She was always been ready since 11 I said somebody six o'clock, have a better message.

423
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.830
Amanda G: If I would say she took me out the system and put me back in

424
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.320
Amanda G: Time, if that works. And I totally didn't work.

425
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now,
