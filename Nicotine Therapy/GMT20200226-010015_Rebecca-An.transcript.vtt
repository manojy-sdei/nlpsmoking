00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.590
Kiara: Hello.

2
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello, how are you

3
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.610
Kiara: All right.

4
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.980
Kiara: I almost had to

5
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.060
Kiara: Call bright heart and tell them to let you know that my phone wasn't working.

6
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's wrong with your phone.

7
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.370
Kiara: When I tried to login to the virtual clinic.

8
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.720
Kiara: It just had like

9
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:23.160
Kiara: A just had like a like a black box. It is said like loading or waiting or something and I like waited for like almost five minutes and it just kept saying it. And then, so I

10
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.320
Kiara: Like cleared out all of my apps on my phone. And then I try to go back onto it. Because sometimes, that helps. And so I turned off my phone. I turned it back on.

11
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:45.060
Kiara: I tried it again. It didn't work. I literally had to do it four different times and it finally worked. And then I got all these text messages notification. So something was wrong with my

12
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.590
Kiara: My phone like a service on it or something so

13
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.050
That's crazy. Yeah.

14
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It could have been the service. Maybe it was backlogged and

15
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know congested. Sometimes that happens there's like certain times of the day when it's the internet slower than the rest.

16
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.530
Kiara: Yeah.

17
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing.

18
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so, so. How have things been

19
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.630
Kiara: If at all right.

20
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.080
Kiara: I went to a meeting last night.

21
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.880
Kiara: I actually went to one of the places that I used to go to

22
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:30.270
Kiara: Uh huh. Because I really liked it there. When a race to go there, like, a year ago I would go like between four to five times a week. So I went like almost every weekday to it so

23
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.820
Kiara: I went back there and

24
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.670
Kiara: Everybody that

25
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:46.530
Kiara: So there's pretty much like when I went, nobody was really there that I remember. So because I go to like one of the later ones. I went to eight o'clock.

26
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.190
Kiara: And the, the meetings, you should use the last for an hour and a half. But now they only last an hour there.

27
00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.510
Kiara: And that was kind of another reason why I didn't want to go to those ones, you know, to kind of start off with, because sometimes they're like really long and

28
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.340
Kiara: They're kind of boring at those ones because there's not very many people there.

29
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:18.570
Kiara: And you know they do like the big book readings, they'll do the history when I then they have like women's meetings. And then, you know, like all these different types of meetings, just to kind of keep it fresh, I guess. So, you know,

30
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.130
Kiara: That was kind of, I guess, like my home like my home meeting or something is what they call it. I can't remember his own group. There we go.

31
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:41.490
Kiara: The last two times I went, I went to one where every single time I go like nobody's really ever the same there, you know, and it's like a really, really popular. It's called happy hour.

32
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.100
Kiara: And it's right off of fulsome and they have it only like maybe twice a week or so it's just like a really small room and it's like if you don't

33
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.160
Kiara: Get there like 10 or 15 minutes early, you don't have anywhere to say there's usually people like standing up and

34
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.550
Kiara: You know, but it's usually like a really good group and it's only an hour long and stuff. So I went to those ones. A couple of times, but

35
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:17.010
Kiara: When I'm around like a lot of people like that. I can't really talk in front of like all those people are, you know, I'm sitting like right next to people and I don't like to sit really close to strangers, or people that I don't really know. You know,

36
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.810
Kiara: Yeah, oh yeah.

37
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:33.840
Kiara: Yeah, so, but I went for my third time since actually really being clean because I used to go before and say that I was clean. But I never really was so

38
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:48.750
Kiara: And I was afraid that I run into my old sponsor there, but she only went there, like maybe once or twice a week, like every once in a while. So, but I know I'm supposed to like get a sponsor and everything, but

39
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's the hesitancy

40
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.970
Kiara: I don't know, because I don't want to do it.

41
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.650
Kiara: Because I hear a lot of people that you know they're like this step is really hard. That's really hard, or it's really difficult. And I mean, I know I have to go through, um, you know, but

42
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.790
Kiara: I felt like the first time that I was doing it. I think it's because I was lying to myself and everybody else. I didn't really want to, I guess, confront

43
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:33.810
Kiara: The addiction like full on while I was lying about it. So, and I felt like somebody just gave me a sponsor. It was like, thrown on me and I wasn't like ready for it. Plus, I was lying about it too, but I just felt like it was too soon.

44
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:51.690
Kiara: Kind of thing. So I want to try to like find somebody that actually like a notice and then I kind of liked the way that you know their story like that girl that I had she, I mean, she was like sober for I can't even know how long. But she was like an alcoholic. You know, I don't

45
00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:01.950
Kiara: I know I should probably go to like na meetings and stuff because that really pertains to like me, I guess a little bit more than like a but

46
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:13.830
Kiara: With a because they're, you know, like the first kind of group out there, kind of thing they have better apps for like meeting locators like they have on the after us. I think it's called like

47
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:24.570
Kiara: Meeting guide or or something like that. But you can find like all the places that are located next to you, but when I've looked at the NA ones.

48
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:40.650
Kiara: It's like it. They don't really have like a list of places and times and you know like addresses and stuff. So it's a lot harder. And I'm pretty sure I might, if I go on Google or something. I might be able to find something that way, but

49
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.100
Kiara: I don't know, I just kind of like the easier convenient thing that the a pass so

50
00:06:48.660 --> 00:07:01.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, if you take out the, the differences, you know, which a lot of people, a lot of people can't do that are. And this isn't a judgment. This is my experience.

51
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But a lot of people that are alcoholics only and they're never experienced the other side of things.

52
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:17.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have a real issue with people that are struggling with substances, going to a but the reality of it is, is that

53
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The addictions. The same. Yeah.

54
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so if you can take out the substance and not label it alcoholic or

55
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know drugs or whatever.

56
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the bottom line. It's all the same and

57
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing wrong with going to a there's nothing wrong with that at all.

58
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If that's where you feel the most comfortable and that's where you

59
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feel that you get the most out of and connect with somebody there, then by all means do it you know

60
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

61
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You definitely don't have to be one of those people that have that same judgment, you know, well, I'm not an alcoholic. I'm an addict and, you know,

62
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Substances the substance is a substance. Yeah.

63
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:11.880
Kiara: But I think, just like with me personally like for a sponsor, though, because, like, that's how I am too. I'm like, I still have like an addiction and alcohol. It's

64
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:26.070
Kiara: It like like addiction is the same for like anything kind of thing, you know. But for me personally I want somebody that not necessarily has a similar story as I do, but you know

65
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.270
Kiara: I like a problem or like with pills, then like alcohol kind of thing.

66
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.110
Kiara: You know, like I just

67
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:41.370
Kiara: Want somebody. It's like with my, my best friend. She's, she's like a you know a pill popper. But she doesn't pop pills like I did kind of thing. You know, like

68
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:53.460
Kiara: She just really like to take them and I don't really hang out with her. I literally talk to her because she lives up a Chico, or whatever. But she doesn't really do them a whole lot anymore. It's just like

69
00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:06.060
Kiara: You know she ever sees her mom her mom lives in Clear Lake kind of thing. But like when I'm around her. She's not taking them because she knows that, you know, I've always seen her. I think once since I became sober so

70
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.650
Kiara: Actually, I haven't seen her yet SINCE I'VE BEEN SOBER

71
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:21.090
Kiara: Yeah, I haven't seen her since I've been sober, because I don't ever really remember taking the Suboxone, you know, while I was up there, visiting yourself.

72
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah,

73
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you don't know if she's sober or not she could be

74
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:36.180
Kiara: Well, the thing is that I know like the last few times I've hung out with her. I'm like, with her constantly so

75
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:47.250
Kiara: whenever she's to take pills and stuff like that, you know, like when I used to do them to just take in front of me because we're, we're both comfortable where we didn't really like judge each other or

76
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.570
Kiara: You know, that kind of thing. It was like, Oh, you got pills. Let me get one, you know, kind of thing so

77
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.530
Okay.

78
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With that

79
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.480
Kiara: Yeah, there's like the last few times that I've seen her.

80
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:05.760
Kiara: I think probably since we became friends again after our little year or a year and a half. Little break up kind of things.

81
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.210
Kiara: Since I've been coming up there visitor.

82
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.520
Kiara: She hasn't really been taking any pills, so

83
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:25.260
Kiara: I mean around me, I should say, because I would have them. Can I like, hide it from her you know because i again i was doing the whole lying thing. I wasn't telling anybody you know so but

84
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:39.150
Kiara: Yeah, like she she said she takes him like here and there, but she doesn't really do them like I ever did, like, ever because she's she doesn't have the money, like I did, you know, just got like by them, you know,

85
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.700
Kiara: Yeah, and plus

86
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.280
Kiara: Like with her when she would take them. She could take like one of them and make it last.

87
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:56.130
Kiara: For like ours me. It was more of like I would take like three of them, and then wait like an hour to then I take like two or three over

88
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:12.210
Kiara: Wait a few hours to take a couple more. So mine. It was more of like, you know, with her. It was more of like like she had a prescription for them. She could probably take them and not like run out of them me if I had a prescription that blow through it a couple days.

89
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.740
Kiara: So she's a lot more control than I am. So

90
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Hmm.

91
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when's the last time you saw

92
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.080
Kiara: Probably

93
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.670
Kiara: Know maybe like either before Thanksgiving or after Thanksgiving.

94
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, long time. Yeah.

95
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:51.510
Kiara: Cuz I have a friend, you know, my friend. She lives up in Chico. And then I have a friend that lives in Red Bluff. So it's like every couple of months I'll kind of like

96
00:11:52.710 --> 00:12:05.520
Kiara: Cooked Chico. And then, like, come back home and be home for a few months now. Go up to Red Bluff, and then come home and go to Chico now. So it's like every like two or three months. I'll go up there, kind of thing so

97
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.070
Kiara: It's more of

98
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:14.310
Kiara: A Yeah. And like our all of our sons are all around the same age so

99
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.270
Kiara: I usually pick my son up there with them and you know kids have a little play date, I guess.

100
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's cool.

101
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well how's it going

102
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:38.400
Kiara: It's all right. We just got a new guy and it's surprising his, his name is the same as my husband's name, which I thought was kind of funny, but um he's pretty good. He doesn't seem like

103
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:49.410
Kiara: clueless of like what to do or how to do things like he caught on really easily like he's never really done well, I don't know if he's ever really done

104
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.540
Kiara: Like he's worked for the VA, but I think he's worked in a different department than, you know, sitting down and making appointments, like I do.

105
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.620
Kiara: So,

106
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:10.080
Kiara: I don't know what do you, I remember I was told before but I completely forgot, but he's pretty nice. And, you know, he asked questions and they're not like

107
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:16.200
Kiara: I mean, there's never really ever stupid questions to me you know cuz I'm a really, I feel like I'm a really understanding

108
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:27.840
Kiara: Person, you know, like if somebody asked me something and they're like old is probably a stupid question. I'm like, it's far and, you know, like everybody has questions I ask stupid questions too. So

109
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.260
Yeah.

110
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's no

111
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no stupid question when you're learning and trying to you know get a job down pat, that's for sure.

112
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:45.150
Kiara: Yeah, and I mean like, there's another girl there who started like a couple months before I did. I think I kind of explained it to. She's like,

113
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.010
Like

114
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:54.570
Kiara: If I tried to help her something she likes snaps at me, or she tries to be rude and stuff like that. It's like me.

115
00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.620
Kiara: I'm just trying to help you. Like I almost want to just pop off on her and be all like I've been doing this longer than you have. So

116
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:14.490
Kiara: Just because you've been here at this location or, you know, you just started here before I did. I've been technically scheduling appointments. A lot. Lord, who have kind of thing. But I'm not going to say that to her in front of my face.

117
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. And it hasn't gotten better with her.

118
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.450
Kiara: Yeah. She'll. She'll kind of be like, Oh, hi, like, she'll try to say hi, or whatever, but

119
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:44.340
Kiara: Last Thursday we had, I think it was Thursday, I don't know, sometime last weekend we had like a little town hall meeting and it's like mandatory that we go kind of thing. So they it's basically where everybody in the department. They all gather

120
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.110
Kiara: About like

121
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:58.170
Kiara: I guess just like news and announcements and stuff like that about you know our particular clinic of like what's going on and what needs to kind of

122
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:13.230
Kiara: Like what we need to work on and they give us like numbers and all this kind of stuff. And they do compliments or complaints, you know, it's just kind of like a big meeting so but anyways I was hands to mosquitoes why

123
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a nice hot day.

124
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.980
Kiara: Yeah, it's been pretty nice. I like the weather.

125
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I'm new to

126
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.260
Kiara: Me. So the meeting that we had

127
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:37.890
Kiara: It was a few minutes before 10 o'clock when the meeting was starting and there was a guy who the VA. They have this company that comes out and picks up people that are little chairs and stuff.

128
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:47.220
Kiara: Well, I guess they had the wrong address for this guy because you can have like a mailing address and the residential address will

129
00:15:48.030 --> 00:16:06.540
Kiara: I guess whenever he changed his address. It only changed his mailing address not as residential address because you can like anybody can kind of change their mailing address because sometimes people have temporary addresses and I was kind of stuff. So, um, anyways, the company, they

130
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:16.260
Kiara: They did go pick them up, but they had the wrong address. So he was finally able to get his eight year old mom to give him a ride.

131
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:29.190
Kiara: And he's in a wheelchair and as you can tell that his foot was like really really messed up. And, you know, like there's no way in hell. He can walk or stand, probably not at all, but his mom was able to

132
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:35.790
Kiara: drive them here, but she had an appointment or she had to go to something herself so she

133
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:49.830
Kiara: So she had to go and the guy was asking me if I could get ahold of that company that the VA uses so that way he can get right back home. Well, they

134
00:16:51.570 --> 00:17:01.770
Kiara: So I called the company and I asked them, and you know, I had to like do a whole bunch of work to try to get them to come pick him up, because normally once it's

135
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:10.440
Kiara: Normally they won't just take people home like they have to pick you up and they have to take you home. They can't just do one, you know, one of the other type of thing.

136
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.110
Kiara: So anyways, I sit down. I'm like, trying to work.

137
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:24.990
Kiara: To get this guy. Right. And I'm like, I have to wait to call somebody back and this and that. And all this crazy stuff all she tells and she's like, you're the meeting starts at 10 o'clock, you need to go up there and I'm like,

138
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:34.920
Kiara: I know I told my boss, you know, like I said, it really, really nicely. I forgot exactly what I said, but I was like, I know I'm just trying to do this, that, you know, I'm trying to get this guy.

139
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:43.800
Kiara: So he can go home, you know, because he was already there for like two or three hours because APPOINTMENT WAS THAT LIKE seven o'clock I think

140
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:59.640
Kiara: Or 745 or whatever, but it was like seven simpler. So she kind of like snapped at me, or she was like being rude about it and I just nicely said, you know, setting back. I was like, I understand. I'm like, trying to do this and everything and

141
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.030
Kiara: My boss like 15 minutes earlier than that he came out and he told me about it and I was like, Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to work on this. It took me like 45 minutes to try to

142
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:16.440
Kiara: You know, deal with this guy. Plus, I'm trying to schedule appointments for people and you know multitasking do a whole bunch of stuff.

143
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:27.000
Kiara: Right. And then I ended up not going up to the meeting until like 10 or 15 minutes after and, you know, but just the fact that she kind of like snapped at me a little bit. And it's like,

144
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:38.880
Kiara: In my eyes. I'm like, Why are you telling me what to do. I like you're not my supervisor and if my supervisor told you to tell me to do something, then

145
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:49.260
Kiara: He should let me know. Like a let you know or like he should do something. Or like, I don't know, like he could have said something but

146
00:18:49.860 --> 00:19:02.790
Kiara: The way that she said she's like john said you need to go up there to the meeting. She just said it all room got it just got on my nerves. So I just try not to really like talk to her conversation with her a whole lot because

147
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:19.170
Kiara: I feel like I think I've said this a couple times is that I feel like I'm a really nice person, in a way, you know, like, I don't really talk to people are rude or anything like that. But then when people like that. It just makes me want to just be read back at them, you know,

148
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:19.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

149
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.180
Kiara: I don't want to be like that. Like I have with this fear of people hating me kind of thing.

150
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.050
Kiara: Like, I think most of the people here, they don't they don't really

151
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.460
Kiara: Like like nice I care for me but

152
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:44.340
Kiara: Like, I don't want to say they hate me, but I just feel like they because I'm younger than everybody else. That works here in my department, you know, I just feel like they treat me differently.

153
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't see them treating each other that way.

154
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I

155
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:57.870
Kiara: Don't know like the thing is that, like, I'll see them like two or three of them, they'll be talking and they'll compensate with me or not me, but they'll conversation.

156
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:08.880
Kiara: And then I'll kind of like, you know, they're talking about that, oh my oh I know something, you know, and I'm like, I'll start to talk and they'll kind of like look at me for a second and then just like turn around. Keep talking. It's like

157
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.120
Kiara: In a way I can kind of see like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have been. But it into their conversation or whatever but

158
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:24.330
Kiara: You know, like, you don't have to be rude about it like that. Like, I literally feel like I'm in high school, because that's what happened to me when I was in high school. Again, I was the youngest

159
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:42.690
Kiara: Like one of the youngest in my class because I was, you know, like everybody was like 18 when I was 17 when we all graduated. You know, so, you know, I just feel like, and I work with all girls, except for this one new guy and then my supervisor, of course, but I mostly work with girls.

160
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:52.170
Kiara: So like one of the girls. She's like the head or like the lead MSA, we're all MSA is here and

161
00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:10.500
Kiara: She's always pretty nice to me. But the other girls. There's two girls that don't work there anymore, but that used to work there and, you know, like I've kind of they're still just one girl I guess technically two girls there Brenda and Kim that are kind of like

162
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:18.510
Kiara: They're, they're just kind of rude or if I say something they don't really say anything back you know I'm more. It's kind of almost

163
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:32.400
Kiara: Kind of like hypocritical of me because, like I say that I'm a huge communicator. Like if I say something just say like, okay, or K or sure like I don't care what you say, just let me know that you actually heard me so that

164
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.440
Kiara: Way, if I say something again because that's like the thing with what happened with Brenda like there was one day when I said something to her.

165
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.860
Kiara: And she didn't reply back. So then, like, a few minutes later I told her again. She's like, I know I heard you the first time.

166
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:57.120
Kiara: I'm like okay then say something so that way. I'm not repeating myself and pissing you off, you know, like that like I hate when people do that. And I tell my husband, the same thing.

167
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:04.410
Kiara: I'm like, if I tell you something. Just say k. So I know that you heard me or that you got it or something to

168
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.220
Kiara: Come to you and then make you all pissy because I said something again.

169
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a respect that into, you know,

170
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we

171
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.100
Kiara: Don't feel respected there.

172
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they're all older than you. Yeah.

173
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.890
Kiara: Probably about at least

174
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.070
Kiara: I'd say about maybe maybe 15 years or older.

175
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.050
Kiara: That's what I'm guessing, because I think most of them are probably

176
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:44.940
Kiara: Like 4040 something 50 something and Brenda, I don't really know how old she is, she might be like, either in our late 30s, early 40s. I think, but

177
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.730
Kiara: Or she might even be a little bit older.

178
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.110
Kiara: I'm not really sure. But

179
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.830
Kiara: Yeah, everybody. There's, I mean even the nurses and the doctors will, of course, the doctors, but the nurses, I think.

180
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:07.770
Kiara: They're probably a little bit older than me. I think there's one girl who might be around my age. But other than that, like out of my department. I'm the youngest, I think.

181
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's a and you can feel that difference within their attitude and how they

182
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah how they treat you. It's got not you just can't bite into it.

183
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it's got to be

184
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Older and bigger than them. And you know what I mean. And it can be tough. I get it.

185
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:35.130
Kiara: Because it definitely ago. I know we were like talking about it and people say only to get, you know, I, Mike.

186
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:47.790
Kiara: When people tell me that because multiple people told me, Oh, don't like to get you just because somebody says, don't let it get you doesn't mean it's going to stop it from happening kind of thing. It's like when people are having anxiety and people say, oh,

187
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.810
Come on down.

188
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.870
Kiara: Calm down. Okay. Yeah.

189
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.400
Kiara: Sure, I'll just turn the switch off.

190
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.800
Kiara: Happened like that, you know,

191
00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:03.240
Kiara: So, especially when I have like the whole stress and stuff like that happening. It's like I'm more sensitive, so

192
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:13.290
Kiara: Pretty much since I kind of like told my dad and my step mom with them like fighting and then you know my dad would tell me something, and then a couple minutes later, my

193
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:21.480
Kiara: step mom, she would text me and tell me her side of the story. So it was like always, like, a back and forth thing and I finally told her.

194
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:29.430
Kiara: And I definitely told my dad. I was like, so like I don't want to hear what you're going through, because I know you need somebody to vent to but

195
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:42.000
Kiara: You know, like I can't have this thing where you know she's saying something, and then you're saying something, or he's saying something, and then, you know, because they're two different like completely different stories.

196
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:47.400
Kiara: And they're both saying they're not lying, and that they're, you know, everything is true what they're saying. So it's like

197
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:56.550
Kiara: Obviously there's three different stories, you know, because what really happened and the both of their sides of the stories you know so it's like

198
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.080
Kiara: I told him I was like, you can't just put me in the middle of it because I'm dealing with a lot of

199
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:09.360
Kiara: You know, I'm trying to like work on my health and all this stuff and all my concerns like with me or like my anxiety and all that kind of stuff. So

200
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:22.260
Kiara: You know, like they don't you know I told my dad and, you know, he was like really understanding about it which my dad isn't really the understanding like he doesn't really understand a lot of stuff.

201
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.130
Kiara: You know, because he's older and he is old fashioned and

202
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:34.740
Kiara: And usually my step mom is the one where you know she'd be like, Oh, you just need to you know to my dad, like, Oh, you just need to understand, you know, this is

203
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:44.310
Kiara: Like a different generation, you know, kids do things differently. These days, and you know the whole you know usually she's the one that tell him you know

204
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:51.330
Kiara: To like chill out kind of thing, you know. So, but they're just kind of like

205
00:25:52.860 --> 00:26:02.220
Kiara: Like bickering and fighting and stuff like that. And I'm just like, I can't take it. You know, so I kind of felt like I like set some boundaries, kind of thing, you know.

206
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, because it's easy to be drug in the middle of something and then somewhere down the road, it's your fault or the fingers get pointed at you.

207
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.180
Kiara: Another thing is is that

208
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:29.460
Kiara: A lot of the friends that I've had in life and being an adult. It seems like I'm always the friend. That's the listener or the one that they try to go to a vice, for they pretty much dump all their problems and

209
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:39.810
Kiara: Everything on me and like I think I was talking about the last time we had a, like a meeting. Is that like I have a lot of like empathy, like when people look very like

210
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:48.270
Kiara: You know, like a lot of people that come in here. You know, like they don't have legs or, you know, like they told me stories and you know it's like I feel

211
00:26:49.410 --> 00:27:05.820
Kiara: Like, I feel really bad and I feel like really really sad for these people. And so it also translate the same thing when I'm like talking to, like, I have less really, really dramatic friend. She's not really my friend whole lot anymore but

212
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:13.410
Kiara: And I think I'm going to talk to you about her long know that might have been my therapist.

213
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:25.680
Kiara: But anyways, my brother in law has his wife, but they're separated in when they were together. She was just very, very, very like high strung like anxiety and like

214
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:33.720
Kiara: Always fighting and it was just drama, drama after drama and every single thing that was happening in her life. She would just

215
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.480
Kiara: Tell me about this, you know, all the stuff that was going on in her life with my brother in law and her

216
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:46.320
Kiara: And just dumping everything on me and I just couldn't set those boundaries and I couldn't just be like, Hey, I know.

217
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:57.390
Kiara: You need to vent kind of thing, but I just can't have you doing this because she was also suicidal. So I mean like cutting herself and like taking, you know, like overtake medications, you know,

218
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:06.180
Kiara: Like, and she has two kids like she has a son that younger than mine. You know, and she's just, you know, very dramatic and have like

219
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:21.420
Kiara: I was telling my old therapist. I was just like, I don't even know how to like really break it all off, kind of thing. And that was just a really, really hard time. But since they separated. They're a lot more happier, especially her. She's not like always having anxiety.

220
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:28.020
Kiara: But what I was trying to get out of that is that every time that she was having anxiety. It was given me anxiety.

221
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.430
Kiara: Like really bad anxiety. Like I could feed off of other people's emotions. So it's like

222
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:43.650
Kiara: The same thing with when I'm at work when people are treating me a certain way. Like, I, I feel like I have like this weird sense of thing. It's just, I mean, it's probably what everybody has. But people can just feel

223
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.290
Kiara: Like if somebody doesn't really like you kind of thing, because you can tell by their actions or

224
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.040
Kiara: You know, like little things you know even like with other things like I felt like when I was in high school.

225
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:09.480
Kiara: Example, I guess kind of stupid or whatever. But I could tell when guys like me, you know, just the way that they kind of after all that kind of stuff. Like I can usually kind of read people for the most part of it. So,

226
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:16.020
Kiara: But I don't know it's just like I feel like a Empath or whatever it's called.

227
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.990
Kiara: Whatever the cliche thing is called but

228
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.640
Kiara: I also feel like it's kind of normal

229
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.870
Kiara: You know, because like when people

230
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.440
Kiara: You know, it's kind of like know what it's called, like, oh,

231
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:36.060
Kiara: I don't know, like when people are like, oh, you know what I mean, like, kind of like understanding, like I just feel like I'm understanding and understanding and, you know,

232
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.780
Kiara: I could just do stuff. Sure.

233
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can because it's the energy in the room. Yeah, you know that you feel you know if somebody's open and they like you and you know what I mean, you're going to know that by their behaviors and

234
00:29:51.630 --> 00:30:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The energy, the energy in the room, you know, is shifted towards that way. But if you're in an area where you have people that are judgmental and

235
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know aren't giving you an opportunity to get to know you, then, you know, you know, you know. Yeah, there's no

236
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

237
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just wouldn't feed into it. Yeah.

238
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

239
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So doesn't feed into it and you know there's a piece to that says, you know. It's their problem, not yours.

240
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:24.870
Kiara: Yeah.

241
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. You gotta let them, own it, because if you carry on their attitudes. You know what I mean you go right into the same behaviors them. So you just want to kind of, you know, what do your job, let them have their attitude. It's their own not yours. Yeah.

242
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And they're just two people that you're not going to invite over

243
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.870
Kiara: Christmas. Yeah.

244
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:50.850
Kiara: I mean, yeah.

245
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:52.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

246
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because, you know, life's too short to worry about what everybody thinks about us.

247
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're not going to come across, you know, every person that that mixes with your personality.

248
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's okay. You know, that's okay.

249
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you gotta let them own their, their little cattiness

250
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know drama filled circle.

251
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

252
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to me, just the Life's too short. There's just not enough time to worry about.

253
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean other people like that, especially in that time frame. If you'd be different if

254
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They were your friends and they tried to be your friend. And you guys just didn't click you're talking about, you know, a couple people that you work with that are imager and caddy and

255
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

256
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.490
Kiara: And not only that, but unprofessional.

257
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah because think about if that's how they're acting with you. How do they really act with the clients. Mm hmm.

258
00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:09.720
Kiara: Yeah, you know, because like I told one of the girls because one of the girls who kind of like gives me out of to, like, I understand she's been here the longest out of all the people that have, you know, have worked here and left to, like, and she always

259
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:24.660
Kiara: Like she kind of will speak to me like you know maybe once a week or once every two weeks or something and but one of the days when we were kind of like talking with kind of conversation and stuff and

260
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:32.940
Kiara: I said it nicely like we were just kind of like, you know, like she didn't feel like I was attacking or anything, but

261
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:40.500
Kiara: I just told her I was like, can I kind of knows about. You can, she's like oh what you know. And I was like, I noticed a lot of the times when

262
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:55.980
Kiara: People say like, Oh, thank you, you just stay quiet like you don't say like, Oh, you're welcome, or no problem or sure like she never really communicates back after somebody says thank you to her, you know, she's like, That's so weird. I never noticed that before.

263
00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:57.600
Kiara: And

264
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:06.030
Kiara: For like a couple weeks after that. She's still in say it. And then there's like maybe once or twice a week to hear her say

265
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:18.930
Kiara: You know, like, yeah, no problem, or like she'll say, sure. I think that's what she says. I think she just says, Sure, you know, but I mean it was just like a weird thing that I like observed about her, you know, like how

266
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:29.010
Kiara: She how she is. I mean, she's a veteran herself so I know with a lot of veterans or you know people that are in the military. They're kind of like

267
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.770
Kiara: Raised or taught a certain way, you know, so it's like some of these people because

268
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.850
Kiara: Another thing that I was telling your, you know,

269
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.700
Kiara: Weeks back or a month or so back. I told her about how

270
00:33:46.920 --> 00:34:00.240
Kiara: A lot of the times when I work with people. I'm I usually speak like really really nice to people and people like especially when I worked at Starbucks, because I feel like everybody at Starbucks, whether they work there, or they go there.

271
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.320
Kiara: And you're like a regular kind of thing. Like you go there, a lot

272
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:15.750
Kiara: When I worked there. I'd be like, really, really nice to people or like I think that was being really nice and I was telling her this and it was like, yeah, there'd be some people that would

273
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:25.260
Kiara: Be like, oh my god. Hi, how are you, you know, and I just tried to talk to them and just be super friendly and then they sit there and say that I was being rude.

274
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.250
Kiara: And I'm like, How am I being rude. I was trying to, like, you know, tell her that

275
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:38.310
Kiara: And she was like, some people think that when you're being overly nice you're kind of, I don't know if it's condescending, or what the word of it is, but

276
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:47.970
Kiara: You're basically treating like the way that you're talking to them is kind of like how you talk to a kid like a lot of people when they talk to kids. They sound like overly nice

277
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.830
Kiara: I don't know exactly what the word is. I think it's condescending. I don't think that's the word, but I think it's similar to it. But, you know, like they

278
00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:10.050
Kiara: Just like how some people talk because I know when I talked to my kid I sound like really really overly nice so she's like some people think that you're talking to them like a kid and I was like, you know, I never really thought about that. So,

279
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:19.530
Kiara: I think that was I me and her talked about that once and I think it was a couple days later I mentioned that to her like what she does kind of thing so

280
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:32.730
Kiara: She didn't really take it like badly or negatively, but you can tell that she's kind of sensitive, in a way, but it's not sensitive like she's gonna cry. It's just more that she gets pissed off easily kind of thing.

281
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.050
Kiara: So, so

282
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.090
Kiara: My

283
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:45.000
Kiara: Main but I'd say that work has been like, all right, but yesterday, like with the

284
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:57.480
Kiara: Little we got out of the group yesterday, like I had to take my dad to an appointment, like at 12 o'clock I still had a drive from over here of walk all the way till to

285
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.520
Kiara: What was it

286
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:08.580
Kiara: Is it to pass Ohio know Oakland Park and really really get to wear a sweater drive all the way from here to there, pick them up.

287
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.080
Kiara: And I actually drove about halfway because I called in.

288
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:24.240
Kiara: Set up the, you know, trying to get the member ID. And then I drove there. And then when I had to start the meeting. I just stopped and then have the meeting with you guys so I drove like maybe about halfway

289
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:39.720
Kiara: Before starting the appointment So wherever the halfway point is to there. I had to drive all the way back to mercy San one to take him to his appointment, because he's trying to get like an injection and his back, I think like an epidural, or something so

290
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:49.860
Kiara: He thought he was just going to get it yesterday. You know, like I was appointment, but I guess it was more of a consultation and then they schedule it later. So

291
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:56.100
Kiara: My dad wanted me to go so I could take on because I guess when you have that you can't drive afterwards, I guess.

292
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:06.210
Kiara: You know, that's why I was like, I really got to go. And my dad is very prompt like he always gets places like like half hour early because he does not like being late.

293
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.580
Kiara: Even if I'm at somewhere.

294
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:18.570
Kiara: Like he used to give me crap for if we would go places and I was taking to them if we got there 15 minutes before the appointment started, we were late, you know,

295
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:23.640
Kiara: And we actually technically yesterday we were about 10 minutes late.

296
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:31.050
Kiara: But the only reason why is because over there were mercy and one is, I don't know if you notice, but there's like a whole bunch of little buildings and it's like

297
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:38.970
Kiara: Where are we supposed to go like his paper didn't have the address on it. It just said mercy San Juan Carmichael, and it had some like

298
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:53.220
Kiara: Numbers letters. It didn't really say what the address was and give a telephone number. So it's not a call and ask, so finally just stopped and I saw a nurse pushing somebody on on wheelchair and I asked them, and

299
00:37:54.270 --> 00:38:00.900
Kiara: She said, there's actually two locations for, I guess, it's an imaging building. I don't know how an epidural.

300
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.940
Kiara: Really goes with imaging. It was really weird and

301
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:17.820
Kiara: The place. She said, because I think the regular imaging was probably for like maybe like radiology, or I'm guessing you know like that kind of imaging and then the other one.

302
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:27.900
Kiara: I don't know exactly what it was, but I just know that when we went outside the building. They were definitely like remodeling. So it looks really, really ghetto like they just had like

303
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.150
Kiara: Like a seating area and then there was just like a desk and a computer with the girls sitting there.

304
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:49.530
Kiara: And then like the hallway. If you looked up there was not like a ceiling. It was like, you know, industrial tubes coming out like the air conditioning vent. It was like a big old circle. You know, like when a laundry hose looks like when it out here. It was like that but bigger

305
00:38:49.530 --> 00:39:04.380
Kiara: But cold air was coming out of it. So it and then in the doctor's office. I mean, it just looked really really ghetto and very like, you know, if you were to go to the hood and try to go to a doctor's appointment. It just really, really, really rundown. But I guess they were remodeling so

306
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I got this consultation and the appointment for the procedure.

307
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:20.700
Kiara: Yeah. Well, he gave them because they said that they were going to call me within the next couple days because I actually have to take off more time to go take up to it because

308
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:35.610
Kiara: You know that time. You definitely can't drive. See if they weren't to tell him, or they probably did tell him, but my dad doesn't listen. He or he just forgets really easily so I used to go to all those appointments before

309
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:47.670
Kiara: Before I moved out of the house with them, and even before that for a couple of years. I was, I always used to take my data every single appointment, because

310
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:58.410
Kiara: My dad is stubborn and he's very forgetful and he thinks, everything's fine. He's like, Oh yeah, I got this. And then it's like you're not doing it right. Tag like

311
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:08.400
Kiara: I finally had to tell him, I was like, you really, I think it's a nephrologist that deals with like diabetes. I think that's what it is, or no endocrinologist.

312
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.240
Kiara: I told him I was like, you really need to see endocrinologist because those are the doctors that actually deal with, like, people with diabetes and

313
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:24.300
Kiara: My dad sugar because he's kind of like a, I think it's called like a diet Lima. If that's the thing, but he's he's more of the type where

314
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:36.870
Kiara: He doesn't he hardly ever eats and he's diabetic and it's like super dangerous and you can't just not eat because then your blood sugar drops. And when he does that.

315
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:46.290
Kiara: Obviously doesn't feel good and it's usually when he pukes and stuff like that. And it's like, or he feels really, really nauseous and then sometimes he ends up puking but

316
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.810
Kiara: And then hold just eat like a candy bar to spike your sugar backed up and it's like can't do that.

317
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:10.440
Kiara: My dad has like to amputate of legs and then like an amputated finger when they were the to the legs were diabetic related. Of course, he has the right leg that's under the knee amputated. And then his left foot. It's half of the foot. So pretty much know toes.

318
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:11.790
Kiara: You know, he has a heel.

319
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.090
Kiara: So he's like

320
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:23.640
Kiara: A lot of this stuff I've, I told them, You know, I was like, you can't, you know, like you need to eat like you can't just

321
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.550
Kiara: Not eat and then you candy bar just drink some orange juice and think everything's gonna be fine.

322
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.780
Kiara: You know,

323
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:43.380
Kiara: It's almost like you really need to go see a nephrologist I really wish I would have went with him, but he pretty much kind of like did this all by himself in a way. Like I told him about it and then it was like months later.

324
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:56.460
Kiara: He I guess he actually spoke to his doctor about seeing the diabetes. Diabetes, Doctor, why they didn't put them or, you know, given him an endocrinologist. I don't know why they didn't because I feel like anybody should really

325
00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:04.620
Kiara: You know, have some type of diabetes management in some way. Like, I don't think a primary care doctors sufficient enough for that so

326
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.580
Kiara: He finally went and now he's on

327
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:19.380
Kiara: Like a I think it's like a once a week insulin, where he just takes it once a week and then it it does something but. And that was another thing I told them is that

328
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:27.150
Kiara: My aunt who lives up in Reno that I visit a couple times a year, she was telling me she's like yeah this is insulin that you take once

329
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:37.320
Kiara: Once a week and you pretty much like she dropped a whole bunch of weight off of it and stuff like that. But she also stopped drinking every single night like she usually does.

330
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.160
Kiara: But she's not. She's not like an alcoholic.

331
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:50.070
Kiara: Of say is just more of like she would have like one or two of her little cocaine or jack and Cokes kind of thing and

332
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:56.220
Kiara: She pretty much cut that out, like every single night. And she only drinks on Saturdays and Sundays.

333
00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:06.060
Kiara: But she's the one that told me that I told my dad. I was like, You should really ask about that, you know, and he would do that and but

334
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So are you going to have to step in a little bit more with him and his partner separating

335
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:13.800
Kiara: Well,

336
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.030
Kiara: Like, yes. And what I mean like

337
00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:25.680
Kiara: Of course, yeah. I mean, the thing is they they've always had, like, a really weird relationship like Dave for years.

338
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:37.320
Kiara: Like they they weren't. I don't know. It's just really weird, like in the beginning, like, yeah, they were, you know, kind of like boyfriend and girlfriend and they've kind of just stuck with the label, but

339
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.360
Kiara: I mean, I don't know about their personal life or whatever, like sex wise and stuff, but I'm pretty sure they haven't had sex and probably

340
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:53.190
Kiara: At least 15 years. I'm guessing because they sleep in separate rooms. They're not really affectionate with each other.

341
00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:01.410
Kiara: And when I told my dad. I was like, yeah, you guys always have, like, really weird leadership, because the whole room thing and you know like my dad would

342
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:10.110
Kiara: Give her like a Valentine's Day card or something for her birthday. Like, that's the way that I guess he showed affection, but didn't really ever

343
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:21.900
Kiara: Hug or kiss you know like they weren't I guess in a traditional relationship. So just the way that they were and stuff, but I'm with my dad. I've always

344
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:33.030
Kiara: I would say probably for at least the past like maybe eight months or so, maybe a year and their rent just keeps going up and up and up and up.

345
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.900
And

346
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:44.250
Kiara: I've been buying him groceries or we would have too much groceries like frozen stuff that I've just give him whatever groceries, we had

347
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:51.960
Kiara: Not like all of our stuff. But since we have so much. I just give him the stuff before it went bad kind of thing. Yeah, and

348
00:44:52.950 --> 00:45:04.140
Kiara: They're always literally living like paycheck to paycheck. I mean, like, really, really, really close to being poured. I mean, I guess they would be kind of considered poor but

349
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:12.810
Kiara: Their whole thing is that they always fight about money because my dad does the edge. I, ah, SS thing.

350
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.580
Kiara: Do you know that is

351
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.940
Kiara: Not available everywhere. But what you're talking about you. So

352
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.920
Kiara: It's like in home supportive services and it's basically where

353
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:32.160
Kiara: Either you can work for the world. Basically, it's like a person that takes care of you. So it's like a caretaker.

354
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.650
Kiara: Okay, so with the caretaker.

355
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:47.940
Kiara: You can have somebody from the it says like people who apply to actually do the work, or for like incidents like I've been the caretaker for my step mom before and for my grandmother before, not my grandma, but

356
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:58.800
Kiara: My step mom. Mom, I wouldn't call her my grandma only mentally just said that. But, um, she, the way that my step mom is my guy.

357
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:09.870
Kiara: She has this thing where it's like, you don't really do stuff for her. It's more of being illegal and actually just, you know,

358
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:17.370
Kiara: Getting the money from the state or, you know, because the ISS thing. It's like a state program. So, um,

359
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:27.510
Kiara: You, she would pretty much just be like, hey, if you're my worker. I'll give you like 300 out of the $600 or out of the 700 whatever dollars.

360
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:33.150
Kiara: And you don't have to do anything for me. I just want the money, kind of thing I did it for a couple months. And after that, I was like,

361
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:41.250
Kiara: I'm not doing this anymore because when I don't feel comfortable with it and to I think it's pretty messed up that you get most of the money for it, but

362
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:54.060
Kiara: I'm getting taxed out the apps, because I have a full time job and I take on this other job that's considered a full job, but I'm not really doing you know all the hard labor for it. But the way that you know

363
00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:10.200
Kiara: I guess the government or, you know, taxes, sees it, I'm making like a lot of money and I'm getting I would have to pay taxes and just the whole money situation. It just wasn't really working out, it'd be one thing if I was actually getting all the money for it, you know.

364
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:18.900
Kiara: But I just couldn't do it. And it was like the same thing with well is a different situation with, you know, my

365
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:29.400
Kiara: My mom's wife that other step mom her mother, I guess when I say was my grandma She was

366
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:43.260
Kiara: She didn't want the money like we were doing it legally, but she was more of like overworking it because when you're a caretaker through I just says there are certain like things that you can do, and certain things that

367
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.240
Kiara: Will things that you can't do is and what they will pay you for

368
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:55.770
Kiara: You know, so it's like if you come over there and you're just over there, you know, sitting there like for her. She would

369
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:06.090
Kiara: Be like, okay, let's make a shopping list because she has like Parkinson's and all these other like crazy shit wrong with her or whatever but

370
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:14.010
Kiara: I'd be over there. I was going to school when I was doing the beauty school thing from nine to five. So, going to school full time.

371
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:20.970
Kiara: And then I would drive all the way to her house and out Grove, and it would take us like two hours to do a shopping list.

372
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:29.010
Kiara: And I mean when when you're doing that, you're not getting paid to do that. And she was very literal with what you know.

373
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:37.950
Kiara: Yeah, she kind of did everything. Not really to a tee, necessarily, but it was like, if you go grocery shopping for the you know the person

374
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:49.710
Kiara: Then you get paid for it, but you don't get paid for making a shopping list or I guess maybe we'll maybe putting the food away. But you know, it's more of somebody that could

375
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.500
Kiara: You know, do the chores around the house or actually physically take care of the person.

376
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.860
Kiara: You know shower them etc and all kind of stuff. So

377
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:08.580
Kiara: With her I would be there was just saying I got there at like six or 630 and I wouldn't leave her house until like two or three o'clock in the morning.

378
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:18.720
Kiara: At but i'd only get paid for like three or four hours, you know, because she was so literal, she's like, Oh, well, you don't get paid for shopping or for

379
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:29.550
Kiara: I think technically you with that you wouldn't get paid to go shopping. Maybe, like, put the food away or like you'd get paid for making dinner and

380
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.120
Kiara: You know actually taking care of somebody kind of thing.

381
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:42.810
Kiara: But with her. It was just more of like it was just wearing me out because I was doing a lot of extra shit and I wasn't really getting paid, you know,

382
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:53.580
Kiara: Properly, I guess, you know, like I feel like it's like, once I get over there. I'm technically clocked in and if I stay later than I should be getting paid more kind of thing.

383
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.420
Kiara: I should be

384
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.550
Kiara: Paid for my time but

385
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.650
Kiara: The way that it was there. It was it was

386
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:09.030
Kiara: It was just too stressful. And again, it was just, I was going to school full time working part time and doing that, like,

387
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:16.800
Kiara: I guess it was considered like full time, in a way, it wasn't like 40 hours a week, but it was like 35 or

388
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:24.210
Kiara: 30 something hours a week. But the way that I was over there was like those over there for like probably 50 or 60 hours.

389
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:36.660
Kiara: You know, not really. Probably not long, but probably close to it, but it was just too much to all handle plus my uncle passing away, you know, around that time it was even harder. You know, I was just going through a lot of shit.

390
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is allowed.

391
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.680
Kiara: I was just like him, do all this is too much.

392
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you got to be careful and set boundaries and not overwork yourself because

393
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I mean, you and your family and your relationships.

394
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Play definitely play the pay the price for for that kind of stuff.

395
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So are you planning on going to any more meetings this week.

396
00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:07.080
Kiara: Yeah, at least one more, but I'm gonna try to go more than just once a week or was like I was before.

397
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:24.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, it's time. Yeah, it's time to step it up a little bit. And, you know, to find one that works for you. A in a, whatever it might be, but really start engaging in that piece to start building your sober support system.

398
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bigger

399
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:31.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah, and everything's okay with home and

400
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You and your husband are okay communications. Okay. Yeah.

401
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.940
Kiara: Everything was fine. The only thing is, is that like this morning.

402
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:48.630
Kiara: Because I told I told my husband. I'm like, once you get out of the shower, make sure I'm awake because I usually set like I think I have about six alarms that go off.

403
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.840
Kiara: In the morning because sometimes it's just really hard for me to wake up.

404
00:51:52.320 --> 00:52:00.990
Kiara: Well, since my neck has been bothering me. I got the refill on the flex raw, because like I wasn't really taken because it says take three a day. I do not take three days.

405
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:06.810
Kiara: Because I just probably be a sleepy monster all day, you know, zombie so

406
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.790
Kiara: I only take it before I go to bed.

407
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:17.100
Kiara: Well, I wasn't really taking it for probably about a week or week and a half or so. So I took one of the pills and

408
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:23.430
Kiara: I was just sleeping, really, really hard. I guess so. I first woke up when my first alarm went off, but that's because

409
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:34.170
Kiara: I wear my Fitbit to sleep and I put an alarm on there to wake me up while I turned off my alarm instead of pressing snooze on it like I usually do, and

410
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:44.550
Kiara: I guess all of my alarms went off and I didn't wake up to any of the alarms that went off on my phone. So my husband came in and he just like

411
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:53.880
Kiara: Whenever he wakes me up. He's hell of rude about it like when I tried to wake you know him, or even, of course, like our baby you know like

412
00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:07.140
Kiara: I'm like, super nice about it, but with him. He just like hello rudely just like shakes the crap out of my shoulder and he's just like wake up and I just snapped it, I was like, you want to be so fucking rude about it like

413
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:16.650
Kiara: Like a lot of people like you know it's like when people flick on the light and you're just being rude. It's like you're starting my day off on a shitty

414
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:27.120
Kiara: Note, you know, like you're just start you're purposely making my day. Start off shitty because of the way you just treating kind of thing. So a couple hours later.

415
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:36.210
Kiara: I think it was about nine o'clock or so I messaged her. I was like, sorry to kind of snap that you, but I do feel like a lot of times when you wake me up.

416
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:49.200
Kiara: You're being like hello rude about it. You know, like, you don't have to be so being or so stern firm or whatever you want to call it, you know. But the way that I see it. I see that you're being rude about it.

417
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:55.290
Kiara: And you should say, well, you need to set like a better like you know allowed her alarm or something because

418
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:03.420
Kiara: You know, like I won't wake up or whatever because I usually tell them the days that he actually goes to work.

419
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:05.640
Kiara: Early in the morning.

420
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:19.860
Kiara: And I have to take our kids to daycare. A lot of the times, I'm late. And it's because my alarms go off so many times and I press news on them. It's just a lot of times I just don't ever want to wake up. It's just a really, really bad habit.

421
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.080
Kiara: So, and then when you add like tries it own or flexible or

422
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:33.990
Kiara: Makes that makes me tired. It makes it even harder than what it is for me and stuff, but I have been going to bed, a lot earlier.

423
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:51.600
Kiara: Than what I was going before like I'm actually going to sleep like a normal person, like I go to bed around like 10 o'clock or so, sometimes about 930 and then I usually wake up sometime around like 610 ish to about maybe 640 at the very latest

424
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.590
Kiara: And then I get our kids ready for school and all that kind of stuff. So, but

425
00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:06.240
Kiara: I usually tell my husband. I was like, make sure you call me every like 10 or 15 minutes to make sure I'm actually awake. Because if he's not there to like wake me up.

426
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:14.970
Kiara: Then I probably will just keep sleeping through my things. Yeah. So it's like, I need you to be there for me, you know, even though you're not there.

427
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:24.030
Kiara: So he like this morning when he snapped at me. You know, he was like, I'm not going to wake you up anymore. And I'm never gonna call you ever again.

428
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:40.920
Kiara: To wake you up, do it yourself like the way that he is. It's like, Thank You understand what I'm like he doesn't realize what he's doing, because it's not just this morning because he said that he tried you know shaking my shoulder, a little bit. You know, like he after like

429
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:52.260
Kiara: Like I could maybe kind of see like, yeah, he could have probably try to gently wake me up. But a lot of the times, like, I'd say probably about 99% of the time he tries to wake me up.

430
00:55:52.740 --> 00:56:08.400
Kiara: He's rude about it like he looks on the light and he says, Get up. Now you know like being hello rude about it, you know. And like I mentioned before, it's like whenever I wake him up. You know, like sometimes on the weekends or whatever. He'll be like, Oh, I'm going to take a 30 minute nap.

431
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:19.110
Kiara: Wake me up in 30 minutes I usually let them sleep a little bit longer than that. I'll let them sleep like an hour and then when I go to wake them up. You know, I kind of like rubbish shoulder. I like

432
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.170
Kiara: rub his hair, you know, like I'm

433
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.760
Kiara: I'm nice about it, you know.

434
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:34.350
Kiara: But with him. You just like shakes the shit out of my shoulder or he just yells at me to get up or get the fuck up kind of thing. And it's like, you don't have to be like that like

435
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that doesn't work, that just kind of put you on edge right off the bat.

436
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:52.470
Kiara: Exactly. Like I said, it just starts off my day a shitty day, but it didn't really last that long. It was just only like basically once I started driving to work. You know, like my grumpiness went away. So

437
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:55.470
Kiara: Stick all day so

438
00:56:56.490 --> 00:57:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know wouldn't hurt to have a conversation with them and just say, you know, that puts me almost

439
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:05.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instant anxiety.

440
00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you wake me up that way. Can you please work on waking me up. No, no, a better

441
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Softer nicer way to

442
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:13.560
Kiara: Win that's

443
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:29.190
Kiara: What I was trying to get to is that I thought was trying to tell him I'm like you know like what I was explaining to him what I did him, I was like, all right, like basically giving him like examples. You know, like I guess like kind of commuting communicating to him that I am

444
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:40.050
Kiara: Like kind of like what to do and all that kind of stuff. And, you know, like he was very understanding and you seconds okay, I understand you're grumpy and it's hard for you to wake up. So

445
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:50.130
Kiara: But basically I just said that I was sorry to him and stuff. So a lot of times out really say sorry to him because that's the way that I see. It's like when

446
00:57:51.150 --> 00:58:03.300
Kiara: Sometimes when somebody does something really messed up to me and they try to say sorry to me. Sorry, just doesn't cut it. You know, you can't just say, oh sorry, and everything's fine. You have to, like, show me that you're sorry kind of thing.

447
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Behaviors.

448
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Behaviors have to change. Yeah. Okay, we've got to wrap this up. I've got another one coming in and about two minutes.

449
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:25.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you're going to work on going to different meetings this week continue working on communication with your husband. Yeah, right.

450
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And work on building a turtle shell.

451
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For attitude at work.

452
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, right.

453
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, alright, I will see you in group and I will see you next week. Keep doing what you're doing and I will talk to you later.

454
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.620
Kiara: Alright, sounds good.

455
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right. You have a great evening.

456
00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.270
Kiara: All right, thank you. Oh. Oh wait, before you go, though.

457
00:58:52.410 --> 00:59:00.390
Kiara: Are we, are we on for next week at the same time, or like, how often do you want to see me like once every other week or once a week or

458
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let me talk to the doctor, but I don't see any reason why we can't boost it out every other week. Okay.

459
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:08.520
Kiara: That's fine.

460
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:16.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, let me talk to the doctor first get make sure that he's okay with it. I'm sure he will be because you're doing really, really good.

461
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just let me talk to him this week and let him know what I think on my side, and we'll go from there.

462
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay.

463
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:28.800
