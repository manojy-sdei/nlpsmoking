00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.130
Matthew Montano: Hi, how are you

2
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing well.

3
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me open up a note and let's figure out where we are here.

4
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow moving system here for some reason just pooped out on me. Bummer.

5
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.510
Matthew Montano: I've been a little sick, the past week or so.

6
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

7
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: attribute that to what

8
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.540
Matthew Montano: Um, I think it's, it's been the flu.

9
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.600
Matthew Montano: Oh, and maybe a little bit of with the withdrawals for a few days.

10
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you last take Suboxone

11
00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:00.870
Matthew Montano: Um, well, the doctor did finally send me in a scripts to three days ago.

12
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
Matthew Montano: But there's a few minute meetings I missed. I was there's a few misunderstandings.

13
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let's start here. Let's start with me start with when did you last ingest you producing this morning.

14
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.490
Matthew Montano: This morning

15
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.350
Okay, how many milligrams

16
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.350
Matthew Montano: Um, I've been taking

17
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.950
Matthew Montano: So if a Suboxone is 16 milligrams. I've been taking off to those milligrams

18
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So 14

19
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.470
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

20
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember

21
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'd be easier if I could open this program, but we're going to have to sort of just go on on memory for a minute until it

22
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wakes up

23
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.140
Yeah.

24
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When we were in in group and you had asked. I want to attend every other week. I want my prescription to be every other week and you mineable to beginning tapering at 13 milligrams. Do you remember that conversation.

25
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:40.020
Matthew Montano: 14 and you said I was, um,

26
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.820
Matthew Montano: I was at all to what, how many milligrams

27
00:03:45.870 --> 00:04:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's put the amount, I'm off to the side for a second. Let's just see if we have an overlap in recollection just around this part. Do you remember asking, boy, I would like to have my prescription be every two weeks to remember that.

28
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.040
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah. And there's an agreement if I came to that next meeting, which I missed because I got called into work.

29
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:19.620
Matthew Montano: We, we, that wouldn't be a problem. We go from two weeks from now on. I just had to cut down my milligrams a little bit more

30
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do remember that there was an agreement that we would do it every two weeks, but you would agree to taper every two weeks that part of that was that you'd begin this tapering process right

31
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and and two weeks is it's a general one because for some people they need a little longer. Some people there, they're like, Yeah, I can move faster than this, but this was the number that we kind of all said let's give it a try.

32
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And immediately, right. You didn't show up on that Monday, you remember, yeah.

33
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.720
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I get called into works on Monday.

34
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So the natural consequence of that right

35
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what like what happens to our agreement, what happens to it. Do you think

36
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.960
Matthew Montano: It floats off into the air and

37
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to start from scratch. We'll find another thing that works for you. And that makes sense to the doctor. So that's what we can do. We're going to start over. We're going to take a look again what works, what doesn't work. So you had moved to Monday, because Friday wasn't working.

38
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.430
And

39
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're still not quite there yet recovery still down here. Here's work. And here's recovering

40
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.620
Matthew Montano: And it's also, it's been a lot of problems with my boyfriend lately. I think where it's we finally just broke up.

41
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.780
Which day

42
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:13.140
Matthew Montano: It's we were he was living our anniversary was January eight, I believe, and I'm so we had our anniversary. I know you. I know I didn't matter what day right away, but we we had a shitty anniversary

43
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.580
Matthew Montano: After that we did talk. We didn't talk he was kind of living here, he would come home, I wouldn't ignore him.

44
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:37.140
Matthew Montano: Anytime we would start talking, it would turn into an argument, I would just walk into the other room. This went on for about three weeks and a yesterday. Actually, we decided to just split up.

45
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:55.440
Matthew Montano: We hadn't been getting we hadn't even know we've been talking for about three weeks, we've been living together three weeks without even really communicating he's he's coming on wasted every night and fallen on the floor and it's just is a mass

46
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So it's important that you're telling me this because you're giving me some context that

47
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's true, maybe right or not that I was called into work or maybe, I don't know, is there more to it than maybe there's a level. Little bit more information was something going on the night before on Monday.

48
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:21.900
Matthew Montano: It a lot of arguments, a lot of arguments, a lot of stress. A lot of lack of sleep and stuff.

49
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of your shift started on Monday.

50
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:34.530
Matthew Montano: On Mondays. If I get called in, they could start at if I get called in, because I'm a part 10 FedEx employee.

51
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you shift start on Monday.

52
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.000
Matthew Montano: On Monday, I got called in at eight.

53
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So why not, I'm

54
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, let us know when you get called in.

55
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.800
Matthew Montano: Uh huh.

56
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think that doesn't happen.

57
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:00.930
Matthew Montano: Well, because it usually just they call me there. They called me like at 730. They're like, hey, we need you in here. Someone didn't show up and I'll get up and brush my butt over there.

58
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what happened, that's exactly what happened. That's what happens.

59
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What about what keeps you from contacting your treatment when you said I will be there on Monday, hold on to yourself. Just don't

60
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:30.090
Matthew Montano: Just yeah I'm just bad with doctors appointments and calling I procrastinate after I, my gosh, that's a call and fix that. Now,

61
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:39.630
Matthew Montano: And I feel like I already have so much other stuff going on. But I know sobriety is important, but I'm just really bad with doctors appointments. That's all I wish they weren't every week.

62
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.540
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

63
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so let's go into this a little bit more. This has little to do with the frequency. This has to do with you identified I'm bad with doctors appointments

64
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's not about the doctor's appointment. Maybe it's about

65
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Having for some people they get something like this, they get so they can see the whole week.

66
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In review the phone.

67
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Will only remind you when you're already at work.

68
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you made different use of scheduling resources, you could see things from a distance, and every day review it. Right. And you'd have more on your mind from from a purview of looking at it. Oh, I've got these three other commitments.

69
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.930
Matthew Montano: We

70
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Call it 730 if it was a routine for you walk past the fridge and it had an outline of what the week look like

71
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.060
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I have. Let me show you something real quick.

72
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.600
Matthew Montano: I have a. Can you see it a calendar on my wall with all my needs.

73
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see what do you have for Monday.

74
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we got

75
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.980
Matthew Montano: did was to 10 31st.

76
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah okay so 31st was a makeup group. So you missed two groups you missed MONDAY THE 27th and then you missed a makeup group. So that's the 31st. So what do you have on the

Matthew Montano: Matt group therapy group therapy mandatory.

79
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have the time.

80
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.880
Matthew Montano: Um, I think it's written above where mark it out right here. Okay.

81
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you are walking through the kitchen, getting your coffee rushing off to get into work because you got like this last minute call

82
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What broke down in this system you have with the calendar.

83
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.600
Matthew Montano: It's what it is to be honest is on

84
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Always. To be honest, I love it. Always, always

85
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Always being

86
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.760
Matthew Montano: It's, it's this relationship. I'm in. It's, um,

87
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.790
Matthew Montano: And I even tell Ivan Ivan tell them that I'm like dude, you're not letting me sleep, even though you say it's um

88
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:31.950
Matthew Montano: It's my responsibility and all this stuff. You will literally go into my room at two or three o'clock in the morning, and the man to start an argument.

89
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.550
Yeah.

90
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:43.350
Matthew Montano: And he's just like, whoa, whoa. A few this or that. That's all your responsibility. It's not my and then he starts trying to throw this shit like

91
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:53.460
Matthew Montano: You're, you're not a child. You don't act like a child. You're not making your appointments I make my appointments. When you don't you don't make any of his appointments. He

92
00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't important point, you're talking about right now so massive you've been in unhealthy relationships in the past, you've told me that

93
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You were really looking forward to this one with Ryan right his name.

94
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.060
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Mm hmm.

95
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: My. No, it hasn't opened yet yet. So you were really wanting this one.

96
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To last. And for this one to represent a healthy one.

97
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not

98
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.580
And

99
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You pick someone who's actively using substances, who's still partying whose work ethic is not the same as yours. You are not the same.

100
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.370
Matthew Montano: Hmm.

101
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.820
Matthew Montano: He has no back for boundaries.

102
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You put up with it for quite a while.

103
00:12:48.390 --> 00:13:00.600
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and and he would. And he, he was like say my exes were this bad he was this bad so I thought maybe

104
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.130
Matthew Montano: He was good. It was I was getting there are some

105
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just just hear this.

106
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Often times we draw in what's normal we grow up with a particular thing we grew up with people crossing our boundaries, all the time. This is normal for me. My tolerance is high, I can put up with it, if that's what I grew up with.

107
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to protect one more step closer to protecting your recovery, I would invite you to consider. Most people and they're really taking them this seriously. They don't run into a relationship or even walk into it. They put that on hold while they grow up.

108
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They get to really understand what are my limitations. Is that just because that's the way I learned it, or is this is how I like myself best

109
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And oh, I like you. Because last few hours. I really liked who I am. I actually like who I am. I'm not having to pretend I'm not having to compensate and that takes practice. Matthew

110
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Grow up with that.

111
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This takes time and it takes being alone with yourself.

112
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And slowly like you'll dip into it a little bit at work. You'll dip into it with your friendships.

113
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But dating right away is is pretty basic. Everybody knows this, right, we put that on hold for about a year. We just some growing up. We do some healing so that you're a full

114
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole person that sharing your life with someone else and you are clear about what your boundaries are before you enter a relationship.

115
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.890
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah so

116
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now, you'll probably come back to me next week, and you'd be like, What back together.

117
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

118
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: coaster ride with you.

119
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.830
But many people

120
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.090
Matthew Montano: And

121
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation is to say whether it's Ryan or it's someone else that you put you first for just give it a shot.

122
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can really cuz. Notice how if you don't get this figured out. Now, it's very likely you will end up bringing someone in just like that. Maybe it'll be this much.

123
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The same stuff's going to happen.

124
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah because inch by inch tiny bit by bit, you're compromising your boundaries with another person. And guess what that person loves it. Oh my gosh, she's so generous. Look at him, he lets me get away with all kinds of stuff. But that wasn't what you really wanted to

125
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about you build some confidence first

126
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:51.540
Mm hmm.

127
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What might you, what would your life be like

128
00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just this week this coming week. What would it be like to not be in a relationship.

129
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.510
Matthew Montano: It's

130
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:22.110
Matthew Montano: It's gonna feel lonely at first. That's, that's a big part of it, it's going to feel lonely, like I get used to having him here, but this is the worst. It's been like he for three, like I said, three weeks straight. We weren't communicating or at talking, he would come home.

131
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.670
Matthew Montano: We if we did start trying to talk to you to start arguing and and run away and lock myself in the other room.

132
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.180
Matthew Montano: It was it just was becoming really depressing and and there's

133
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:45.180
Matthew Montano: Another issue that I haven't talked about he's, he, I know I've told you his tight. He's a type one diabetic.

134
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:55.170
Matthew Montano: And so I I've helped him deal with that because he's had those few seizures and he wasn't taking care of himself. He also, um,

135
00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:06.570
Matthew Montano: I know I could talk to you and confidentiality. He also has HIV i don't i don't have HIV. He has HIV. And that's another medical issue he has

136
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:19.050
Matthew Montano: That I've had to deal with. And I know, I know a lot about it. I know to use protection, there's a there's a medication that I take that protects me protects me from him, but we don't have unprotected sex.

137
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:31.890
Matthew Montano: And he doesn't he yeah and I get tested all the time and stuff and he does, it does it. He doesn't seem to understand that I'm that what I'm putting myself.

138
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.040
Matthew Montano: Not I don't separate myself at risk.

139
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:44.490
Matthew Montano: Because I am yeah I am even because i but i do i do protect myself. I do always be always use protection, I take something called

140
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:53.280
Matthew Montano: I forget the name of the medication, but it's it protects me from contracting, we think, but he doesn't seem to appreciate that.

141
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't appreciate appreciate the sacrifice.

142
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been nice if he could do

143
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:12.480
Matthew Montano: That yeah he's only been sorry. He's only been in one of the relationship and that guy screwed him over that guy was sleeping around on him the whole time and

144
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:21.630
Matthew Montano: And he Piet van Ryan was young and having unprotected sex with him and he gave it to Ryan and just

145
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

146
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.390
Matthew Montano: Like

147
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Ryan needs a therapist to

148
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.020
Matthew Montano: Yeah, he does.

149
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.260
Matthew Montano: He does.

150
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And Matthew. Are you going to be a therapist.

151
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.010
Matthew Montano: I can't be a therapist.

152
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Not right now.

153
00:18:43.230 --> 00:19:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be an equal maybe years in the future. Maybe he'll grow up, maybe. He'll. He'll maybe you won't find him attractive in the same way. But right now, Titian to you is you haven't really done a treatment program before. Once you did was maintenance.

154
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.360
Matthew Montano: Mm hmm. Hey,

155
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So really give yourself a chance

156
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If

157
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If you could have done it differently over these last three weeks and really put your sobriety. A little higher. What might have you have done differently.

158
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.280
Matthew Montano: Once

159
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: At least the last week three weeks.

160
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.010
Matthew Montano: Definitely. What made sure I made my appointments. I know.

161
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.630
Matthew Montano: A big part

162
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why would you have made your appointments. How would that why would you have done that.

163
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.390
Matthew Montano: Because I could have gotten on the better. I'm

164
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:58.650
Matthew Montano: A better you know track of. So hey, I made this appointment I made this point minimum a disappointment. Now we can go two weeks, and it just would have been

165
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.680
Matthew Montano: Better for me, you know,

166
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about the withdrawal symptoms.

167
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.790
Yeah.

168
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

169
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.590
Matthew Montano: You can either both

170
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.720
Matthew Montano: Those few days I miss my appointments and the medicine didn't get center right away.

171
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.700
Matthew Montano: And I

172
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:28.530
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I missed like so they didn't get sent him for like three days and I think I've messaged you to see if you could do anything about it and

173
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:42.030
Matthew Montano: So when I started going into redraws I think Ryan even came home sick with the flu. When he was still living here. And oh, that just gave me the withdrawals and the flu. At the same time, and I was

174
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.270
Matthew Montano: Are the call into work.

175
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can register the physical discomfort. You can see the value in there. That's good. So maybe that this negative experience might be

176
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of that negative reinforcement to say I better keep my commitment. I don't want to have this physical discomfort. I don't want it.

177
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.810
Might do it. Okay.

178
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So from

179
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.180
Matthew Montano: Oh, and, um, when I was going through these withdrawal symptoms. He didn't even care like after

180
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:24.600
Matthew Montano: You didn't even care. Like he seen me go through withdrawals before and he was completely there for me. He was like doing anything can waiting on me hand and foot

181
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:33.000
Matthew Montano: And just this was in the past when I was going to my last doctor and I missed an appointment for and I had to reschedule Week later.

182
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:46.650
Matthew Montano: So he see me go through withdrawals and he his sister's husband is um they used to be addicted to pain medication text box and whatnot.

183
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:57.660
Matthew Montano: Got off a bit and all this stuff. But so he understands the basics, but this time it's like you didn't even care. He's like, it's your fault you miss your appointments. It's your fault you miss your appointments

184
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, on one hand, the big piece of it is you

185
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Buyer um

186
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was also someone who sabotaging your life so

187
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.690
Mm hmm.

188
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:32.250
Matthew Montano: And it's such a small apartment, though, there's just my living room, my kitchen and the bedroom. So anytime. He's in there. It just makes and I try and avoid him. It's just like I'm stuck in my room, or I'm stuck in in the living room, you know, so it just becomes a really uncomfortable environment.

189
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you've been talking to, to get support around the disappointment or all the big feelings that you're going through right now.

190
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.230
I

191
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:50.070
Matthew Montano: I've been hiding it because I can talk to my dad about it on my, look at my son, my dad lives down the street medium are really close. Even my

192
00:22:50.610 --> 00:23:04.440
Matthew Montano: My mom if X, absolutely, absolutely need to my my auntie, I'm really close to I call her and there's a few friends from work that I talked to, but i've been i've been hiding it from everybody.

193
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why.

194
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:16.260
Matthew Montano: Cuz I'm embarrassed because I just wanted to work. I want it. I want my life to not be my my life for

195
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:29.910
Matthew Montano: Before the past three years has been really like like all over the place. And I just want a steady

196
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:39.360
Matthew Montano: Steady Pappy lie where you know other people don't have to worry about me like that.

197
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch

198
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And listen. Listening to what I'm saying, I'm, I'm saying you can have that right but it's unlikely.

199
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Until you do your healing until you do your work until you can really distinguish the stuff around

200
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: healthy and unhealthy boundaries and I'm going to pull up this little outline and I'd like to go over it with you because maybe it's like

201
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of nebulous. At this point, but these, these are growth points that if you can get a handle on these pieces around the boundaries, you're much more likely to be around people that are healthy and good for you.

202
00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at them together. Okay.

203
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.800
Matthew Montano: I just thought of something real quick. Um, I think the last time after me and you talked

204
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:59.340
Matthew Montano: A LOT OF THAT. THAT'S WHEN ANYTIME me and Ryan start arguing, I would. He knows I'm seeing a counselor. I tell a lot about it and stuff. I saw my rehab. I think I've really good counselor and

205
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:14.940
Matthew Montano: He, I would say, I can't argue with you like this, anytime it starts turning to yelling my counselors telling me to do this or to do this or I just have to remove myself from the situation and

206
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:32.580
Matthew Montano: He, he started, you just starting to get manipulative. He's all well let's call your effing counselor and that's how let's tell her how effing crazy. You are I'll tell her how you are in this and that, that he just started seeing a lot of stuff like that like

207
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.880
Matthew Montano: Because he was he was frustrated because I wouldn't feed into his crap anymore so

208
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Matthew. Notice how you're wanting to to tell me about Ryan's behavior check in with yourself and see. Do you trust your own assessment.

209
00:25:50.520 --> 00:26:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That you do not like and will not tolerate Ryan's behavior, whether you hear it from me or not. Do you realize what you think what you feel around him. It matters.

210
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't like it, if you have reached your limit that's enough. All validate, you know, I'll tell you, I can label what he's doing. We can do that.

211
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's important that you register that what you perceive with him is the most important thing what some lady in Florida thinks it's what you want. That's the most important thing. If he is not

212
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective supportive nurturing and it's sort of pulling out that sort of Best part about you holding you up to the light and encouraging your growth and development. Why would we want to be around someone who's not giving that to us.

213
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And why wouldn't you want to

214
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because you somehow have normalized or have an expectation that this is as good as it gets.

215
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.110
Matthew Montano: Hmm, I guess so.

216
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets better.

217
00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You

218
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know it yet because somehow along the way. It's become normal for you to just have just just I'll take some kind of attention. I'll take it. Maybe it's just, you know, take it from a man who's this attractive or or who really wants me this way and it feels so good.

219
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But be patient with yourself. Do some growth first give yourself some time if you can overcome being lonely, right, you might end up being a relationship, the one you want.

220
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to have to tolerate the fact that it takes time and maybe it's convenient for you to do some work first you're going to get what you want.

221
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is given some time.

222
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at these things together. Okay, are pretty

223
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:54.900
Relevant for most people.

224
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what a healthy boundary in a relationship looks like.

225
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all this slide and you you're more than welcome to take a screenshot of it. They're pretty handy.

226
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.000
Matthew Montano: Okay.

227
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll register, let's say,

228
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your life. Okay.

229
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Where my boundaries are. You might be running these questions through your mind. Can I say yes or no. And you said okay when others say yes or no to me.

230
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: an unhealthy boundary in a relationship is you can't say no because you're afraid of rejection or abandonment.

231
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You taken a screenshot.

232
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.790
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

233
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So it takes a while to go through this. I'll go through a few of them with you. But ultimately, this, this is a journey. This is like maybe one or two of them, you'll register a little bit easier than another one.

234
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're they're worth looking at each one is important.

235
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how you probably with Ryan had said no to something and he didn't accept it.

236
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.450
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

237
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to be able to accept people's answer.

238
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up going ahead and going with his

239
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll stay up late. I'll do this arguing thing with you because you don't want the relationship to end don't want to be abandoned don't want rejection. This would be a place for you to explore

240
00:29:53.640 --> 00:30:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I spending time with people for whom it is acceptable that I say no, they don't manipulate me. They just go up. Okay, another time.

241
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Healthy

242
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you catch yourself people pleasing trying to avoid rejection and abandonment by saying yes to something you don't really mean that's on you.

243
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You aren't setting a healthy boundary. You have to be able to say, yeah, this is my preference. I'm kind of, I'm going to do this recovery thing. I gotta, I gotta get to bed, you know, no later than 10 o'clock. That's just

244
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my deal if you run into someone who's like, Oh man, that's cool. You're really taking care of yourself. Yeah. Nice. Yeah, cool, I'll make sure you know we kind of hang out. It'll be early evening.

245
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:54.630
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and it seems like that a big part of the theme here. Like when I would say I need to get to bed early

246
00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:05.580
Matthew Montano: Cuz I have a doctor's appointment or, you know, I have an appointment you or your therapy in the morning. He'd be like, Okay. Go to bed and um

247
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:21.690
Matthew Montano: He would either stay up making a lot of noise till not just, like, three o'clock in the morning at four o'clock in the morning he stays up till about seven o'clock in the morning, eight o'clock in the morning. The next day, and then sleeps all day.

248
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Mess. I mean, that guy has to be

249
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.530
Matthew Montano: Doing

250
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A stimulant how you do that. No.

251
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:34.710
Matthew Montano: He's just he just that you don't do math, but he's it. He's a

252
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.370
Matthew Montano: As

253
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.290
Matthew Montano: He smokes a lot of we

254
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.420
Matthew Montano: I

255
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:50.550
Matthew Montano: Know we make you sleepy but he did. And then he watches the stupid cartoons and he puts on music and he's walking around eating on AI and

256
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.630
Matthew Montano: Messing around

257
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.280
Matthew Montano: Phone he's doing everything

258
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not respectful.

259
00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:04.170
Matthew Montano: Yeah, it's not respectful. He's doing everything to wake himself up in a way I would put up with it because I don't have kids, I guess, and I would

260
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:16.890
Matthew Montano: Kind of look at him as a kid in a way. Like, I guess I'm like, like taking care of my boyfriend. It's in a way. It made me feel good and nurture somebody, but it's not good. It's not good, and

261
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:25.650
Matthew Montano: And he also sometimes would just barge in the room, if we were having an argument and say, hey, can we talk about this right now.

262
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:34.320
Matthew Montano: I had fallen asleep. Bam. He would wake me up just he has no sense of like

263
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:39.030
Matthew Montano: Respect or urgency, or how important

264
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary the concept of boundary is you didn't stand up for yours.

265
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. You wanted this feeling of love this feeling of being needed more than you wanted to protect your boundary

266
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In its simplest terms, sometimes it just comes down to that if you do it again. Probably the same outcome will happen, you will have chaos, you'll have a tumultuous life.

267
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If instead you protect your boundary and you know you are lovable and you're going to have love again you can sit with the fact that I can't go out with you. I can't go out, I got to get my rest.

268
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes you falter and you have this sense of I'll be abandoned. I'll be alone forever, they'll never be an end to this, you'll end up compromising your boundaries again.

269
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Highly recommend you give yourself some time to cultivate this

270
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This set limits with people.

271
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, where yours. Are they won't be mine. They won't be somebody else's there'll be yours.

272
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.790
Okay.

273
00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll get to find out is this enough, do I like how my life is going, hey, it's more organized. I'm keeping my commitments. I like who I am. I'm not having to apologize make excuses. None of that I'm on point, you might like it or you might say rap.

274
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:22.380
Matthew Montano: And what I what I started thinking I could do, why I gave him this thing where he would, he would where I let him live here for like those three weeks to try and figure things out.

275
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:28.860
Matthew Montano: The main reason was so you get the money together to pay the rent, which he did. He gave me the money to pay the rent on the first

276
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:45.330
Matthew Montano: Was because I thought I could kind of rise above his bullshit. If he comes home late if he comes home I'm drunk or all you know pot it out.

277
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:54.150
Matthew Montano: And pass it out in the couch of you, like, I'm going to ignore him. I'm going to ignore him. And I would, I was ignoring him. I wasn't

278
00:34:54.450 --> 00:35:03.870
Matthew Montano: Communicating with him and what he starts doing like a child as he starts getting more and more drunk more and more wasted I he knows I

279
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:10.530
Matthew Montano: When he's in my house I worried. He's testing is diabetes. I know because you could have a seizure. You could die and

280
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:17.040
Matthew Montano: Why Men have to explain to his parents his dad on the floor because he has a seizure, while I was gone. Um,

281
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:23.250
Matthew Montano: What happened, but he doesn't care. And I'd say, like, dude, at least make sure you're testing your sugar and stuff.

282
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:35.820
Matthew Montano: And you're doing the things you're supposed to and he'd be all well I'd rather die or this or that he's just really manipulative, is what I'm starting to get at, and he He'll do anything you have to to

283
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you've heard what I just said. Let's say you run into someone and you catch a glimpse of that assign a warning sign. What would be one of the warning signs that someone just like Ryan is about to enter your life, what would you see

284
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.990
Matthew Montano: You risk.

285
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.900
Matthew Montano: Non respected my boundaries.

286
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That is very vague, try again.

287
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know. That's what we're talking about. I want you to picture someone

288
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:12.840
Matthew Montano: Okay, so like when I first met, Ryan. Um, I actually didn't even one date him.

289
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:22.320
Matthew Montano: Okay, yeah. Because when I first met him, and I had just moved to Roswell. I used to live in Albuquerque.

290
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:38.310
Matthew Montano: I just moved to Roswell. I had a job opportunity here and working with FedEx, it's when I first started working FedEx and I met him through this dating gap and he he

291
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.530
Matthew Montano: We would hang out. We go out, we'd have a go out to dinner or whatever.

292
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:56.310
Matthew Montano: And like, yeah, we got to get know each other. And then after a few weeks, I would be texting them all day, all day, all day. I would hear from him, what I'm here for. He was sleeping all day. This is how he

293
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:08.970
Matthew Montano: lived his life. And then he'd wake up around six seven o'clock PM, say, Hey, what are you doing, I'd be like a dude, I've been messaged you since this morning, where you been he's been asleep. I was up really late last night.

294
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:21.420
Matthew Montano: This was a routine every night. He was up, he was asleep. All day out partying driving around drinking all night with his loser friends.

295
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:30.690
Matthew Montano: And I, I remember for four months, telling him I can't teach you. We can be hookup buddies. We can have protect we can use protection.

296
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:43.260
Matthew Montano: We can we can make out kiss. We can go go on dates but I cannot be with you and he begged me. He's like, I cannot. I cannot just be friends with you. I have to be with you have to be

297
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Example you betrayed yourself you let your boundary get too porous you knew what was right for you. You didn't stand up for it. Do you know why compromise to boundary

298
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.910
Matthew Montano: And I did, I did hold that boundary for a long time. I didn't hold that boundary for a long time and he begged me and begged

299
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:12.750
Matthew Montano: And begged and begged me for weeks and weeks and he would cry and you bought and he would say, No one wants me and I would see his heart. I would see he has a really

300
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:31.110
Matthew Montano: Soft heart and that he had been hurt a lot in his past and I saw myself in that. So I ended up letting down my bounds you because I thought I could be some kind of savior, some kind of some kind of, you know. So kind of like, you know, I like helping people and he

301
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Found it again. My need to be needed will trump my need to protect my psychological space my recovery my sleep my sanctuary my need to be needed is so strong so big.

302
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.660
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I do have a savior. This savior complex and

303
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When I don't address that here in our work together.

304
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It may happen again and again and again. So I think that, let's put a pin in that right now in the sense that we'll talk about it again. We have more time. I think you did, did some some real honest work here. I want to message the doc and I want to hear from you.

305
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What the last thing, because we've been talking about. You're trying to figure out, because you fell off the map. We're keeping you were saying, I'm going to do this and not doing it.

306
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We've been wondering what to do. And the last thing we did was we had a quick little exchange. I asked him if he wanted to come by here. And he said, I will try. BUT I'M WORKING ANOTHER clinic.

307
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have patience. So my guess is what he may do is bridge you to your next appointment. Can you commit to Mondays at 9am

308
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:59.430
Matthew Montano: For group. Yes. And yeah, Mondays. Mondays Monday's

309
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.850
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I guess I can do that already.

310
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is a refresh.

311
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.490

Matthew Montano: And tell me time, I can't make it. I'm going to tell them out because they know like they know I'm in this program. It's not like I'm hiding this program from them to tell them I'm in this program that is

327

Gwenevere Abriel: You have a physician already scheduled to see you on that Monday. It's already set. How great is it that you have access to a physician every week. That's amazing. How convenient.

378
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about how hard it is to get an appointment with a physician.

379
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes a long time. You have one already scheduled on Monday, go in there, meet with them. Tell them why you're doing

380
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Protect your boundaries.

381
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Season like your life a little bit better. See if you can stay distracted spend more time with your family when loneliness starts to creep in.

382

Gwenevere Abriel: And let's address it therapeutically. Let's see, what else is going on underneath there. Okay, I'll see you on Monday. Matthew. I'm so glad you made it. I was worried you are going to kind of fall away from this program. I'm glad you were here.

383
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:51.300
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's not the plan at all. I do want to continue with the program.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

385
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.250
Matthew Montano: I'll select program.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:54.750
Matthew Montano: Are

387
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.630
Matthew Montano: Not those weekly group therapies, but

388
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Shift your thinking, why don't you call what they are, which is m a TI medicated assisted therapy.

389
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you're doing is you're you're getting two treatments. You're getting one that's medicated assisted therapy that's group.
