00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:14.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're, you're smoking meth pretty much daily and you're also using IV heroin like half a gram a day or so.

64
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.710
TCL LX: Right, yeah, it's, it's a

65
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.160
TCL LX: Close to a gram a day now.

66
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.350
TCL LX: Close to the ground and I'm

67
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.690
TCL LX: The mass intake is

68
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.640
TCL LX: Is a

69
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.110
TCL LX: Every other day or, you know, it's not can constantly daily, I guess.

70
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.180
TCL LX: Every

71
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Day or so. Okay.

72
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.320
TCL LX: Lot. Are you sick. Yes.

73
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you're still smoking cigarettes like half a pack a day.

74
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.780
TCL LX: Yes. Okay, well it's cut down now.

75
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.100
TCL LX: The

76
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.620
TCL LX: Funds to, you know, by many cigarettes cigarettes.

77
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.690
TCL LX: Okay. My, my, smoking is cut back because of

78
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.900
TCL LX: You know, financial hardship.

79
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:13.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I guess that's one good thing is the cigarette use went out, but you know it's not an ideal method right

80
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

81
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:33.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you're at a gram a day and you have been on Suboxone like twice now in terms of like with a doctor, I think you said that you were on eight milligrams three times a day at one point.

82
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.130
TCL LX: Yes.

83
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:47.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then maybe a year ago right and then about six months ago you were with us and you took some. What was your dose, then let's see. You were twice a day.

84
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:51.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

85
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: So do you want to get back on the Suboxone

86
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.360
Yes.

87
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.590
TCL LX: Yeah, I'd like to use that in conjunction with possibly a rehab or

88
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.790
TCL LX: You know,

89
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.610
TCL LX: outpatient services.

90
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:17.790
TCL LX: You know, and you know that will possibly get me into a sober living environment and and having

91
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.650
TCL LX: Spots

92
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.270
TCL LX: To

93
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:30.390
TCL LX: You know, utilize utilize this Boston to, you know, my benefit will

94
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

95
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.800
TCL LX: Give me positive, you know,

96
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.730
TCL LX: Chant more more greater chance of success. Sure.

97
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:48.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Of course, I think Suboxone is very important in getting sober and getting you in recovery.

98
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:57.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the important thing about the Suboxone is if you take it regularly like you're supposed to. It should be working for you.

99
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:15.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: The problem is when people forget or they purposefully don't take it and then they say, well, if I don't take it. Maybe I can use and then they use in between. So, so you really have to like discipline yourself okay I'm getting this medication. I went through all this trouble.

100
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.960
TCL LX: To do.

101
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: This, again, I want to take it. I'm going to take it right you know

102
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.340
Yeah.

103
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because when you take it, it does help you. Right. You notice that cravings go

104
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.660
TCL LX: Away. Yeah.

105
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:42.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. OK. So my suggestion is that we start to again and we get you to three times a day eight milligram eight milligram eight milligram breakfast, lunch, dinner.

106
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:52.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay okay and and the way you know that you've done this twice now to start. You have to be in withdraw.

107
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:59.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so I'm assuming you use not too long ago, right, you just used

108
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.450
Oh, yeah.

109
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.250
TCL LX: For for four to five hours.

110
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:17.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And so, probably you won't be in withdraw all until you know i don't know me tonight or maybe tomorrow morning, when do you think you'll start

111
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.540
Getting into what's wrong.

112
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.120
TCL LX: With late tonight. You know, I would I would start

113
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:43.050
TCL LX: This you know little after dark is when I would, you know, start securing a means of, you know, not being sick, I guess, because I know and it would soon become soon after that. So, you know, around midnight I

114
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.210
TCL LX: Would assume

115
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.800
TCL LX: When I would start, I guess, more midnight ish

116
00:11:50.730 --> 00:12:04.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so, yeah. So what we'll do now is, you'll go to the pharmacy, you'll get this medication and instead of, you know, trying to get more heroin, you'll be using this when you're in withdraw.

117
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:14.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's really important that you hate and you go into some withdrawal. You want to get too early because it'll make you feel worse for a little bit to take it to school.

118
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:29.400
TCL LX: I've never had that happen. I mean, I've like say, Have I mean I've been taking Suboxone for I've never had that happen you know being prescribed it and taking it just, you know,

119
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.120
TCL LX: Being by being given some

120
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.400
TCL LX: Okay.

121
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.690
I've heard it happens.

122
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You've heard of it. Right. Yeah, so

123
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: You have friends or people that you know that have had that probably

124
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.400
TCL LX: Yeah yeah

125
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.360
Um,

126
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: But for you.

127
00:12:51.330 --> 00:13:00.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: It sounds like you know how to take it, which is you wait you feel your withdrawal and then you can take your first dose under your tongue right

128
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.280
TCL LX: Yes.

129
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's really important that you melt it under your tongue so that it gets into your blood stream that way. Okay.

130
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.480
TCL LX: Yeah.

131
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:19.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, okay. So let's do that. And we can start with your first dose tonight, hopefully at midnight or after midnight. OK.

132
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.700
OK.

133
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm also going to prescribe Narcan, you know, for any in case of overdose.

134
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:40.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's good to have on hand, it's a spray in your nostril in your notes to bring back, you know, and I suppose it would be someone else using it, but it's still good to have on your person or have with you.

135
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.910
Yes.

136
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:56.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm OK. So those are two things. And then in terms of smoking cigarettes. How about I prescribe you do you want me to prescribe you some laws and just some candy nicotine candy that you could use whenever you get like a craving.

137
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.830
TCL LX: That would be cool.

138
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:00.630
TCL LX: To do.

139
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: That let's try that. Because you already are saying you don't have enough money for cigarettes.

140
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.370
TCL LX: Anyway might

141
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:23.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: As well, might as well use this candy to fill your need for nicotine. Okay. Each candy is like one cigarette. So you don't want to exceed like five or six a day. You don't want to like keep taking candies, but I'm just saying.

142
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.010
TCL LX: It might help kind of

143
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:43.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cut. Cut the craving. Okay, so I'm going to give you those three things. The Narc can for overdose prevention. I'm going to give you Suboxone to take three times a day. And then I'm going to give you the candy for the nicotine to help whenever you want a cigarette.

144
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.330
Are you

145
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you able to

146
00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:01.290
