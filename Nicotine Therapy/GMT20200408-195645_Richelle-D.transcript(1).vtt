Wes Smith: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. What makes sense. That makes sense.

143
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.950
Richelle Direny: So y'all just say, you know, just just come to the see either you had either one.

144
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.470
Richelle Direny: either one or the six i mean i

145
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.020
Wes Smith: Think that's something you guys just implemented. Implemented

146
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:10.860
Wes Smith: Because I didn't remember it being the last time when I was at the 12 to 612 or six one I like.

147
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.440
Richelle Direny: No, no, I just implemented that that's that's a meeting. I did that because if the groups are too big at 12

148
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.230
Richelle Direny: That's a whole lot of people

149
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.870
Richelle Direny: So I thought it would be best.

150
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.200
Wes Smith: To just split. Good. That's a good decision maker. I like that.

151
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:33.870
Richelle Direny: And then, and I also just started implementing for people that I meet with to send reminders.

152
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.450
Wes Smith: Okay, because sometimes you know

153
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.120
Richelle Direny: If you, if you schedule a session, you know, two weeks out or three weeks out

154
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:57.750
Richelle Direny: Sometimes people don't remember. So I try my best to remind everybody during the group time so like the first few minutes of group. I'll go over to remind everybody about their sessions their upcoming sessions. Also I send these reminders and I always tell, I encourage everyone

155
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:11.460
Richelle Direny: You know, just send me the same number that I text you on just send me, you know, if you're unable to make it to group or like in a situation, you know, sometimes people go into the hospital or there's a family crisis, something that's going on just

156
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:17.100
Richelle Direny: To say, Hey, Michelle. I'm not able to make it to individual or I'm not going to be able to make it to group.

157
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.870
Wes Smith: Is there, but I remember that you

158
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.550
Richelle Direny: Have

159
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.480
Wes Smith: That and bring

160
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.020
Richelle Direny: That number

161
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:31.350
Wes Smith: I did text say okay, earlier I thought that was confirmation that you know

162
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:41.250
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, yes, but I'm just saying if you ever need to make a change, or what have you, or who can't make to a session or whatever the situation is just that same number just

163
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.750
Richelle Direny: Respond just let me know.

164
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.160
And I can always

165
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.600
Richelle Direny: You know, make any adjustments as as far as your appointment times but for medication, getting your medication.

166
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.490
Richelle Direny: You know, I can always send a message.

167
00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:01.230
Richelle Direny: Now, the only thing that I would say is that if it comes down to like you're constantly sending me messages here, but you're not showing up to group or the individual

168
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.070
Wes Smith: Right, yeah.

169
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:08.130
Richelle Direny: It's a you know don't have the privilege kind of thing. You know, like that that's that's kind of just what I'm saying.

170
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.450
Richelle Direny: I'm here for you.

171
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.420
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

172
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:25.110
Wes Smith: Why I was like that you're over punctual like that because I do, you know, two weeks out. I did put it, my calendar that you told me, and I put it in my calendar and I just got the notification like two hours before

173
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.250
Wes Smith: But, uh,

174
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.700
Wes Smith: Yeah, I like it that you're you're implementing better

175
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.980
Wes Smith: That's that's the stuff that's going to skyrocket you to the top. Rochelle You doing pretty good.

176
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:47.640
Wes Smith: Mold needs counseling groups into you know mean something that's better structure foundation that they you know mean they'll, they'll, you know, make a precedent on probably I think you're doing good.

177
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.620
Wes Smith: I'm glad to see that you're still

178
00:15:50.670 --> 00:16:01.140
Wes Smith: Not yeah I really was. I was like, I was thinking I was gonna get out cuz I got a new doctor and stuff. And I was like, wow, she's doing good, she's sticking to it. Don't worry.

179
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:09.210
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's like it's convenient for you. It's convenient for me because I'm here, I'm not having to get my car and drive somewhere.

180
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.680
Richelle Direny: Right here.

181
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:21.450
Wes Smith: That's what I'm saying. That's why I tell people, like always praise you guys for like nobody believes me. I don't think I'm but I always give them the number and I know you guys number off the top of my head day for for

182
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:27.270
Richelle Direny: I you know what it is. I think it's just one of those things because I do hear people they say when they were looking it up.

183
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:37.980
Richelle Direny: They become a little skeptical. And I think the skepticism comes in because it's online and you know because of the way it's that everybody's used to going to a facility.

184
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:50.310
Richelle Direny: Young someone and being apart. So it's what you're used to. So when you're going for a change or something new. You're always going to question like, is that legit. Like how is that going to work. So the more

185
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:55.920
Richelle Direny: And it's not the bright heart is not something that I see them to a whole lot of advertising on TV or

186
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.340

205
00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:05.070
Wes Smith: You know, I mean we we did. We never had bad terms, but we just didn't work out back in the past, but since it was December 24 Christmas Eve. When we got together.

206
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:24.240
Wes Smith: And I'll tell you what I really didn't think I'd find love again hand and I know that sounds corny and cliche, but it's true. And I found somebody that is with me and 100% I'm with them and I'm happier. I'm a lot happier a lot happier. I'll tell you that.

207
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.920
Richelle Direny: That's good to

Richelle Direny: Hear

209
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:36.540
Richelle Direny: Some tips about are not some tips to just share because like I said, the last time I met with you back in

210
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.440
Wes Smith: The

211
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:44.520
Richelle Direny: Gloomy to get September I know like you were going through a whole lot. You were still grieving the loss of your arm, your girlfriend at the time.

212
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.300
Richelle Direny: I'm still trying to pull through and not being in necessarily

213
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:54.120
Richelle Direny: The best situation or what have you, like, what was it that helped you from

214
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:04.200
Richelle Direny: You know, then till now meeting like even up until meeting your new girlfriend like what are some things that you did and what are some things that you implemented to help you to get through that time.

215
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.980
Wes Smith: You don't mind. When I first transition get was Rachel, the new my new girlfriend.

216
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.320
Richelle Direny: Prior to that, I'm just saying from the last time I saw you. I think I want to say was like back in

217
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.730
Wes Smith: August or September August

218
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.020
Wes Smith: August. Yep.

219
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:31.020
Richelle Direny: Okay, so from August to now. Like, what are some things that you did going through the grieving process and just kind of like you said you weren't in a good space that thing it was

220
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.520
Richelle Direny: It was hard.

221
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:46.650
Wes Smith: But yeah, let's see things I did, I gotta say I got my brother's place i think i think that's what really helped me a lot like I was I was out there.

222
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.790
Wes Smith: And you know, I mean, it's out of town a little bit and it was just getting me down, and there was just certain people that were coming around.

223
00:20:54.330 --> 00:21:02.340
Wes Smith: And I gotta say it's got to be some of that a lot of that was the fact that I was around, you know, not the people that I should have been around.

224
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:10.650
Wes Smith: And that's part of the reason i'm not blaming nobody I blamed myself for leaving you guys, I'm going to sit there and say somebody else made me leave you guys

225
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:24.780
Wes Smith: Nobody made me leave you guys, I think it was getting out of that space and feeling like I'm alive again you know i because ever since from February to August and sep tember I was out there.

226
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:34.080
Wes Smith: And soon as I quit with you guys. I remember a couple weeks later I left there and I just started, you know, stretching my feet again getting out there.

227
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:51.000
Wes Smith: And and little by little you know mean like this person that I'm with now is we've been together before Stacy and you know I mean like we rekindled that old flame and we didn't leave on bad terms and you know mean she's a good person good girls don't do drugs.

228
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.460
Wes Smith: And I think that was part of the reason why I didn't really want to stay with her back in the day because she didn't do drugs really good girl. Beautiful.

229
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:08.940
Wes Smith: You know, I mean, like everything, like, you know, God would want. And I guess it was boring to me back then. But now that I'm settling down. I'm getting older and life is just short

230
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:19.470
Wes Smith: It was a lot to answer your question, I'm copying off the subject answer your question. It was getting out of my brother's place and around that toxicity that was

231
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.290
Wes Smith: It really was suppose that it was getting away from that place.

232
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:35.790
Richelle Direny: But how did what at what, how did you, how were you able to identify because it's very important. What you said is very important because even though you were grieving the loss of your

233
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:47.490
Richelle Direny: Girlfriend. It's very hard to grieve it authentically in a very clean way when you have so many other things that was going on. So how were you

234
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.680
Richelle Direny: Able to identify that movie.

235
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.390
Richelle Direny: Right in that environment.

236
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.600
Richelle Direny: Was what you needed to do.

237
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.240
Wes Smith: Yes. Yeah, yeah.

238
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.400
Wes Smith: And people

239
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.970
Wes Smith: And people you're breaking out. I thought were

240
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.990
Wes Smith: supporting me but was it

241
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.210
Richelle Direny: You said that he was you thought he was gonna support you.

242
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.960
Wes Smith: Yeah, I thought me but he really wasn't, you know, I mean, he wanted to see my downfall. Like, I still

243
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:22.260
Wes Smith: I mean, and even after getting with this girl like he was trying to, you know,

244
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:35.460
Wes Smith: Bring us apart, it was just like, and I'm not even a rounding them more. And it was just like, damn it really showing shoe collars, man. Like, I don't know, sometimes family console you sides of them.

245
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.460
Wes Smith: Like this is a game and you might be just because you got a pretty girl and you came out of the

246
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:52.860
Wes Smith: Out of the deep depression that they seem to go through that they stay. They even helped you get out of some of it.

247
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.790
Wes Smith: And then it's like, once they see you getting out there and getting on your own and and not even needing them.

248
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:09.330
Wes Smith: And they see that you know you got a great girl that loves him once you and you don't need nothing for it. Like, you don't need drugs or money or

249
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:21.480
Wes Smith: You know, and a lot of people can't fathom that, how is that happening. You know, like, and it's like, I don't know, there's something in me that I like that she likes. I don't know. That's a lot of her. I like

250
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:39.030
Wes Smith: And I don't know if you're right, though it to come from something authentic identify that to have a real epiphany. You're right. And you know, I started seeing the crowd. I was around. I didn't like, you know, I even left you guys so

251
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:40.500
Richelle Direny: Much

252
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:48.000
Richelle Direny: Like, what was that wake up call for you or what was like for you to recognize that. Okay, I need to tell people

253
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.470
Richelle Direny: To it shows a lot of zillion in the middle of your depression and the depth of your depression and the depth of your grief.

254
00:24:55.770 --> 00:25:10.860
Richelle Direny: In the depth of your despair, with all you have to be able by yourself to say, I have to change. I have to do something different. What made you get to that point where you decided to work yourself out of that and move away.

255
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:23.250
Wes Smith: After you guys, it was probably could be except my eyes and I started messing around with her again and it sounds bad.

256
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.900
Wes Smith: But the heroin. I think doing that stupid stuff made me want to get away from. I don't know. It was weird. It

257
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:38.250
Wes Smith: It was there around me at my brothers, but it made me want to get away from it is as bad as it sounds, the heroin made me

258
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:47.940
Wes Smith: Open my eyes when I started doing it again and I bumped off you guys and no bad terms or anything. I just stopped going. And I explained that to

259
00:25:48.480 --> 00:26:00.810
Wes Smith: Integrity and everything. We talked about that, uh, you know, I mean, once I started doing that and I left because we left on bad terms. Me and my brother did a little bit. Then we you know we know talked it out.

260
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:13.260
Wes Smith: But I feel like me getting high again made me open my eyes to certain things that I wasn't seeing when I was depressed because that heroin made me feel

261
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:33.150
Wes Smith: Well, I've again made me feel you know uppity again. And you know, I started seeing, you know, when I left that there was hatred coming my way for being on my own and it sounds bad, but sometimes the things that that binds you can be your salvation. Sometimes I'm not saying that.

262
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.230
Richelle Direny: That's my case but I

263
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.230
Wes Smith: Think to that that's that's what it was.

264
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:53.640
Wes Smith: It was kind of weird and things that to me was some of the things that help we offer. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to explain, because I wasn't on the heroin too long after I was there in and out of it. And then I stopped doing it back in.

265
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.400
Wes Smith: Into February this year.

266
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:10.230
Wes Smith: Like right on the anniversary and my girlfriend, she don't like it you know she didn't like that and quit for, like I said, I've been coming. You guys ever since beginning of March.

267
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:20.460
Wes Smith: Yeah, beginning March, and I think mid March. Yeah, some of the things that helped by me was the salvation. I feel like

268
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:22.380
Wes Smith: But

269
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.630
Richelle Direny: When you say the salvation in regards to reference to what

270
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:31.800
Wes Smith: What is it

271
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.560
Richelle Direny: I said, when you say in this topic. So I'm looking

272
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.580
Richelle Direny: In what terms.

273
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.540
Wes Smith: Though your question again, you were kind of cutting up my bad, I'm sure.

274
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:48.300
Richelle Direny: I said, when you said that the salvation is what buying. I mean, was to help you get that

275
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.100
Wes Smith: Going away from it what what we're bonding with part of myself. Yeah.

276
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.040
Wes Smith: That mean getting high again was part of the thing that helped

277
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.210
Wes Smith: It's hard to explain.

278
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.840
Wes Smith: Because, you know, it's hard to explain. Because sometimes I'm not, I'm not sticking up for drugs, you're not

279
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.730
Wes Smith: Getting it right here.

280
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:18.330
Wes Smith: Getting it sometimes life is weird in a way where when you do get high. You might open your eyes a little bit like because I felt more alive.

281
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:33.180
Wes Smith: And you always come on my depression. Like I said I was a little bit more and then in my brother seen that he didn't like it, you know, and from a good place in his heart. He wanted to somewhat take care of me. It helped me. You know what I mean. So I can't say that it's all malicious

282
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.940
Wes Smith: You know, but same time he wasn't doing anything to help

283
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.520
Wes Smith: The incubator. My, my, my force coming out of that.

284
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.050
Richelle Direny: And then he would rather

285
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.010
Richelle Direny: Action between kind of that place where you were.

286
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:57.420
Richelle Direny: You relaxing and going and getting back. Hi again and did. I did.

287
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:15.330
Richelle Direny: You just say, you know, did you just say after getting high get like this is not the life for me. Like, I don't want to do this or like, what, what, like what was that wake up call for you. What was that, that moment of I need to do something better. I want a different life.

288
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:25.320
Wes Smith: When I got with my girlfriend, because I knew that life is short and I knew that. It's like that's not why I got what my girlfriend, but I knew that life is short and

289
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:37.740
Wes Smith: You know, if I keep getting high. And I want to at least make some good memories, you know, I mean, and I got a lot of good ones, but I knew that. It's just can't go on forever. It really can't shows got to stop, you know,

290
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.700
Wes Smith: And that's why, that's what I mean. And I'm not lying. I. That's how I feel. So does have to end with that.

291
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:53.340
Wes Smith: That show, you know, not everything is going to be feeling good old time, you know, you gotta take the pain with the pleasure, I guess so.

292
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.390
Now,

293
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.080
Richelle Direny: That she has a history of addiction to or

294
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.040
Wes Smith: No, she just smoked weed pass

295
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.200
Wes Smith: Okay, so you

296
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.600
Richelle Direny: Had that meeting has helped you a lot.

297
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:15.600
Wes Smith: A lot. Yeah, definitely. Well, I didn't meet her. Like I said, we've been. We've been around each other before since 2017

298
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:25.920
Wes Smith: On and off and then I got with Stacy and I stayed with Stacy, and it wasn't like I stayed with her over her know we we we had a split and

299
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:34.500
Wes Smith: I don't know. We just bumped into each other again it just happened like it was perfect. It was perfect. Now I feel like

300
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:51.600
Wes Smith: You know me and get her that helped me out a lot. Did it saved me from puking excuse my language did it, send me from like more depression upon depression, of course, I still have depression but it ain't from her name stemming from her something she's doing or I'm not

301
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.840
Wes Smith: It's the fact that, you know, depression sticks, but it doesn't. It ain't with me. Like it was when

302
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:06.090
Wes Smith: You see me. You see me at my word. You did you see me at my bad, my bad. I remember, I mean, I was a mess.

303
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:19.290
Richelle Direny: You know, but I mean, but even the depression you had that was. I mean, would you say would you say you've had that depression pre the loss of your girlfriend.

304
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.950
Wes Smith: A not that deep

305
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.030
Richelle Direny: No, I'm not talking about dance. I'm just talking about depression just period.

306
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.960
Wes Smith: Oh, yeah, yeah. Always. Hi, everybody. I feel like everybody's got a little depression moments in life. I mean, but

307
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:47.070
Wes Smith: Depends on how far they go, you know, everybody's got some sort of, you know, pain, were some kind of completion or conviction in them, you know, I mean like

308
00:31:47.940 --> 00:32:03.570
Wes Smith: I feel like everybody does. But you know, I mean, no. No, I wasn't. I never had like bad bad depression. I always did in my own way. Because, you know, I mean, I just felt like it wasn't always going to work out the best, but no, no. To answer your question.

309
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:14.250
Wes Smith: But I'm doing good. I feel like I don't need a psychiatry string thing is like I feel like counseling drug counseling is a lot is good for me.

310
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:15.750
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

311
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.500
Wes Smith: I want to stay punctual and stay on it. And I'm sorry I missed that last one.

312
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.210
Wes Smith: Okay, I'll be there and you pay sound like if you were incarcerated. I don't think you had much choice.

313
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.800
Richelle Direny: There you can be like, I need a phone.

314
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.810
Richelle Direny: To get my group.

315
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:40.050
Wes Smith: I don't want you guys because you guys been left by me before, you know, I mean, so I'm thinking in my mind they're thinking that I'm doing this shit again.

316
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.760
Wes Smith: And I'm not, you know, I mean, you guys have felt that before so I don't want you to think that

317
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:56.220
Wes Smith: You know, I mean, that's why I was like I don't I don't I don't want to just feel like I bumped off again because I did. I went without a trace on you guys. Last time, and it wasn't bad terms, it wasn't nothing like that. I just

318
00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:16.590
Wes Smith: Stopped going I started, like I said, the toxicity that people my environment, AND I WAS STUCK OUT THERE AND I GOT anger and blame nobody I was blind. I did that myself. I stuck around it because depression fitted me there and you mean, and I didn't act and choose to act like I should have

319
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:26.130
Wes Smith: Yeah, that a lot of that's on me. I'm my own worst enemy. In the end, yeah. I mean, ain't nobody when nothing to me or

320
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:45.030
Wes Smith: Did I would make sure I'd let you know. I mean, even then I'd sound crazy, but I mean, I did a lot of this to myself, but I don't want you guys ever feel like I'm leaving again at least say something to you guys next time I'm never just say, by not say nothing.

321
00:33:46.950 --> 00:34:00.930
Richelle Direny: I mean, listen, like you said you you owe it to yourself sobriety belongs to you. If you want it maintaining that sobriety belongs to you. If you want it. The journey is there for you to to be traveled and to maintain

322
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:11.190
Richelle Direny: But again, it's you know the the drug, whether it's heroin, whether it's pills, whether you know opiates alcohol. It doesn't matter what it is.

323
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.340
Richelle Direny: When it's all said and done, it is you know you're using it.

324
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:21.090
Richelle Direny: To suppress or to help you to get through and to cope with.

325
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.050
Right.

326
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:34.710
Richelle Direny: Whatever it is that you're going through, um, it's kind of like it's kind of like when I think about and I use this with someone else. It's kind of like, okay, so like you smoke you smoke cigarette.

327
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.920
Wes Smith: And

328
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.270
Wes Smith: A lot of the times.

329
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:46.140
Richelle Direny: It's, it's, you do it because you're anxious or you just need something to help calm you down or, you know, just kind of take the edge off on

330
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.300
Richelle Direny: It that is it that. Oh, I like the whole idea of going like this is it.

331
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:52.890
Richelle Direny: How

332
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.600
Wes Smith: About just habit versus as a habit versus

333
00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:58.950
You know,

334
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:10.950
Wes Smith: Habit versus, you know what was another word. I was about to use was good. You're asking me is it just that, you know, some of it just a habit. I feel like

335
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:18.750
Richelle Direny: It's a combination of skills as you develop a habit over time in order to develop or two to

336
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.070
Richelle Direny: Start a new habit.

337
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.680
Wes Smith: Or you're tasting Comrie, or you mean like chasing a euphoric, like, you know,

338
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:34.140
Richelle Direny: Well, so, so it's it's a combination. Like you're you're chasing like this euphoric high but then with like, so I'm using the example like with cigarette smoking.

339
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.260
Richelle Direny: Wall, you're not getting your fork high off of

340
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.270
Wes Smith: Smoking. No, no.

341
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:55.890
Richelle Direny: I mean, I'm not a smoker. I know that you're not getting a high office. What it does, it just helps you. It's like, it helps you like you're smoking you're concentrating it puts you in a place where it calms you down. It focuses you so it does something to you.

342
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:06.420
Richelle Direny: So last ever habit you develop. So with the cigarette or the smoking. This is what it does, it focuses you, it helps to stabilize you, it helps to calm you down. It helps you

343
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:13.680
Richelle Direny: To be able to somewhat concentrate on it. So you develop this habit of doing it, is it that you like.

344
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:23.220
Richelle Direny: The whole idea of lighting a cigarette, putting it to your mouth puffing IT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE, LIKE, does it taste like Sugar. Does it taste like candy know what it

345
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:41.820
Richelle Direny: Is you're addicted to the caffeine, because what this does the nicotine everything within the cigarette this habit. What it does, it's connected to you needing having this overwhelming need to decrease your anxiety. If

346
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:42.990
Wes Smith: It's to

347
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:50.070
Richelle Direny: Decrease the fatigue, it is to stop the racing thoughts. That's what you develop the habit to do

348
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:59.820
Richelle Direny: Is to stop what is going on on the inside because what's going on the inside. You're losing control and you need you need to regain control so

349
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:12.420
Richelle Direny: Regain control you have taught yourself and you will have learned for you. One of the things that you use to regain control is oh, maybe I'll, I'll do a cigarette. It's kind of like our bodies.

350
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:21.030
Richelle Direny: Like, I feel for something sweet. So what do you do you find anything you find anything like sometimes I know I'm a creature. I don't

351
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:29.520
Richelle Direny: If I don't have candy. I'll go get like I have honey. Like I use honey and I'll go get my finger put in honey and and I like the honey.

352
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:45.960
Richelle Direny: What I just need my body feels for something sweet. So I just need to address. Whatever it is that my body is craving for in this your body so we develop this habit for smoking, simply because I need to decrease

353
00:37:47.820 --> 00:38:05.940
Richelle Direny: The stress, I need to be able to focus. I need to be able to concentrate. I'm feeling my body is shaking the fatigue is taking over. I'm losing control and I really need to regain control. So what is a way that I've learned to gain control. This is what I do.

354
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:06.870
Wes Smith: And oh,

355
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:07.980
Richelle Direny: Hi hmm

356
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:17.010
Wes Smith: You got that is very complex. And to tell you the truth, I don't think I have a good answer for that right now. Like, I'm trying to take baby steps like you're right.

357
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:18.540
Wes Smith: I think

358
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:24.810
Richelle Direny: About it in everything you take baby steps in every single thing you take baby steps.

359
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:34.380
Richelle Direny: And you learning what what is it, why do I do this is to understand it. And so, like you said, through cycle therapy through counseling.

360
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:49.350
Richelle Direny: You learn to understand your body you learn to understand ultimately your mind. That's why you call it cycle fair. It's understand like, what is going on in my mind, what are the different signals that's going out in my mind. Have I learned. I'm sorry.

361
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.200
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

362
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.410
Richelle Direny: Can you hear what is it

363
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.680
Richelle Direny: No, I said, so what is the question.

364
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.730
Richelle Direny: Yeah, through life. Have you learned how to

365
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:16.590
Richelle Direny: Cope with different stressors, anything that's thrown at you. Have you learned in. Yes.

366
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.110
Wes Smith: Little NGO certain has nothing. However,

367
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.160
Richelle Direny: You're breaking up.

368
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.790

372
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:48.150
Wes Smith: I said I'll sing with guys. I think a lot. That's me. Don't even know when I'm counseling group counseling, because I feel like you know I'm saying, and even if that

373
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:57.180
Wes Smith: Thing that I'm working for. I feel like subconsciously that counseling, go to a certain size me and helps in a certain way or do

374
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:09.330
Wes Smith: I said, I have the batch of right now, but I will. I will. My phone is on 4% that are just charge

375
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:20.790
Wes Smith: It's free or not. I'm sorry, I'm on 4% but I'm staying on. There we go. It's back on chores, but I'm are certain things.

376
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.330
Wes Smith: I said, subconsciously, it probably goes to that helps me but

377
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:34.830
Wes Smith: I can't really name them right now. And I feel like a lot of it does come from depressions and habits.

378
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.170
Wes Smith: But, um,

379
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.720
Richelle Direny: It's being

380
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.050
Richelle Direny: It's being able to identify

381
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:51.720
Richelle Direny: As being able to identify what are those things that makes you feel low like what are those

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.550
Richelle Direny: You know, sometimes I come. Mm.

383
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.500
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.600
Wes Smith: Is like that should be one of my goals. Learning to identify certain

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.770
Wes Smith: Here, I mean, trying to find identify those things.

386
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.660

Wes Smith: I'm sorry this phone is got a messed up cord and I've got to find my other court. I just don't know where it's at.

388
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.400
Wes Smith: 4%

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.520
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry, its own files and now I just want to

390
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:36.750
Wes Smith: Know, I got a Samsung Android, it's a it's a totally

391
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.520
Wes Smith: My other phone but broke. I broke it.

392
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:54.840
Wes Smith: And I got my I got my card. My SIM card from my old number my 732 O number. It's just I gotta get another straight talk phone and put it in there and then I'll have it back on. But for now I got, I gave them my new number

393
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:02.700
Wes Smith: Which is a 513 something 7215 I think

394
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.080
Richelle Direny: Okay hold on one second. I'm going to check to see

395
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:29.910
Richelle Direny: What, what is your goal for you. What would you say that is something that because looking back at your initial bio that you did with God.

396
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:40.950
Richelle Direny: What is something that you would like to this time around in your treatment. What is it that you would like to work on.

397
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:48.030
Wes Smith: identifying those certain things, identifying certain

398
00:42:49.650 --> 00:43:02.460
Wes Smith: You know pillars of, you know, I mean, that's a that's that's holding up this problem, you know, I mean, this problem I have, you know, I mean, I'm trying to identify it.

399
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:14.220
Wes Smith: But this time is to stick with you guys and to not just, I'm not going to do that again. I, I want to stay on point. Get a job and get my life together and

400
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.300
Richelle Direny: So you're saying we

401
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.640
Richelle Direny: Want to app you want to work the program.

402
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:25.740
Richelle Direny: But outside of just getting program. You want to be able to work through it and apply what your triggers are

403
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.700
Wes Smith: Exactly, yes, yes.

404
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:44.730
Richelle Direny: And so pretty much pick apart and understand, you know, I mean, you're right. Everyone at some point, you know, have listen if you work in if your employer tell you they not paying you today and you got your bills paid that's immediate depression.

405
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.800
Richelle Direny: That's automatic flowing through everybody that

406
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.630
Richelle Direny: When you are you sick and you can't go to work. That's immediate depression.

407
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.260
So,

408
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.450
Richelle Direny: So everybody if no one is is a

409
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.850
Richelle Direny: real person.

410
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:04.950
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

411
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.470
Wes Smith: Got the front, not like everybody

412
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.250
Richelle Direny: Everybody experiences, depression, anxiety,

413
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:22.740
Richelle Direny: Other. The only difference is that some people they it becomes out of control. It becomes something that governs your life. It takes over.

414
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:39.540
Richelle Direny: Your whole being, and you don't know how to control and how to deal with it. So now it's working on identifying what for you are those triggers to get into those depressed mode where you're not able to function where it interferes with your day to day life. That's what it is. What

415
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.650
Richelle Direny: It is a day.

416
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:49.380
Richelle Direny: When it gets it starts to affect your day to day functioning when you can't get out of bed. You can't do anything, it becomes

417
00:44:49.380 --> 00:45:11.970
Richelle Direny: crippling anxiety when it becomes crippling when it becomes an issue where in like for you or for anyone else when you go to an outside source or an outside entity to help you to get through your day. And so that's when so so it's working through identifying those triggers.

418
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:16.170
Richelle Direny: So,

419
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:19.110
Richelle Direny: Let's

420
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:19.740

Richelle Direny: Like, do you find yourself going out in the community to walk around.

458
01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:35.970
Patrick S: Well we yeah we leave the house and walk every day. Um, we got a routine where we go to the Salvation Army and get watch because my wife loves takeout and it feels like takeout.

459
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:41.880
Patrick S: That's that I'd really care. I'd rather not. But she insists on it.

Richelle Direny: Hmm.

469
01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.510
Patrick S: I don't think it's safe. But she

470
01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:15.480
Patrick S: Know, she wants to

471
01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.200
Richelle Direny: Oh, you said that you pay for. Well, you mean the food that you're getting

472
01:52:23.190 --> 01:52:26.850
Patrick S: Well, yeah, it's I just, I don't care to do it, but

473
01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:30.090
Patrick S: She's she likes to so we do

474
01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:35.430
Richelle Direny: Mean, I guess, look at it from her point. Is it because I'm

475
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:40.860
Richelle Direny: can maximize on spending.

476
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:47.670
Richelle Direny: You can maximize on what you spend to buy food.

477
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:55.680
Patrick S: Oh no she she likes it because somebody else made it and it feels like take up

478
01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:03.330
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen, you can wrong her for how she looks at things right.

479
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:04.230
Patrick S: No, I don't.

480
01:53:05.850 --> 01:53:08.040
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you're the only one going on a walk.

481
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:09.210
Yeah.

482
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:17.130
Richelle Direny: Hold on, I'm trying to come up here because I want to also with everyone a meeting with them going over their treatment plan.

483
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:25.470
Richelle Direny: I know I just wanted to, to, to look at yours. I know one of the things that I'm

484
01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:39.810
Richelle Direny: Signing in because I know one of the things you want to work on with like your own your spirituality and your kind of your reconnection with God. And as it's related to your recovery.

485
01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.200
Richelle Direny: How has that been for you.

486
01:53:43.770 --> 01:53:44.460
Patrick S: Well, they

487
01:53:46.050 --> 01:53:48.060
Patrick S: All churches are cancelled.

488
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:49.500
Patrick S: I'm

489
01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:54.270
Patrick S: Fine. Yeah, my wife. She likes to watch

490
01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:04.980
Patrick S: This sermon online, but we just got phones. We don't got a computer and I can't stay focused. I don't do it.

491
01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:11.160
Richelle Direny: Is very hard. It's very hard to stay

492
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:13.470
Patrick S: Well,

493
01:54:15.150 --> 01:54:18.510
Patrick S: I read the Psalms in the Bible, fewer day

494
01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:23.460
Richelle Direny: while you've been doing that daily

495
01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:27.870
Patrick S: Yeah. Well, not every day, but most days I read a few Psalms.

496
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:32.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

497
01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:38.730
Richelle Direny: Um, you do it with her. You just do it by yourself.

498
01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.920
Patrick S: By myself.

499
01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:55.380
Patrick S: It's been rough. It would be nice if we could go to meetings, but

500
01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:57.810
Patrick S: We, you know, we can't

501
01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:01.080
Patrick S: I don't know why we don't do them outside

502
01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.960
Richelle Direny: What the meetings.

503
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.920
Yeah.

504
01:55:07.050 --> 01:55:09.870
Richelle Direny: Well, you mean like the A meetings and things of that nature.

505
01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.020
Patrick S: Yeah, it'd be cool if we did some outside a meeting.

506
01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:18.330
Richelle Direny: I mean it's kind of hard because it's still, you know, the whole social distancing and all that.

507
01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.320
Yeah.

508
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:26.370
Patrick S: It'd be it'd be really good for a slow

509
01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:27.840
Patrick S: Being

510
01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.890
Patrick S: locked away from the world going to

511
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.420
Patrick S: It'd be good, but it's impossible.

512
01:55:41.850 --> 01:55:42.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

513
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.100
Richelle Direny: I mean, if it's

514
01:55:47.880 --> 01:56:02.850
Richelle Direny: I know there's some places, there are some churches where whether it's Celebrate Recovery and I know you weren't really big on that idea because of the feeling of maybe judgment or what have you. But then it's Celebrate Recovery of Christian perspective.

515
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:11.970
Richelle Direny: So pretty much everyone in it. And I think how I understand the ones that they have at the church is

516
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:20.790
Richelle Direny: That it's it's everyone mixed up. So it's not like just alcohol opiates or or whatever, it's everything.

517
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:26.130
Richelle Direny: Yeah, gambling, no matter what it is. So is everyone coming together.

518
01:56:28.050 --> 01:56:29.460
Richelle Direny: To look pretty much

519
01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.690
Richelle Direny: Recovery pretty much the

520
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:43.320
Richelle Direny: Other thing is that they're doing a lot more online. Everything is more going online.

521
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:51.780
Richelle Direny: Which is probably better for you know or you prefer just being able to go out and interact with people.

522
01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:53.640
Patrick S: Oh,

523
01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:05.070
Patrick S: Yeah I would prefer interesting, I guess. But at same time I want it right now. You know, I'm we've been as safe as possible.

524
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:06.510
Patrick S: Well,

525
01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:11.580
Patrick S: Except for the going and getting that free lunch. I don't know how safe. That is

526
01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.690
Patrick S: This tape as possible.

527
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:21.210
Richelle Direny: Why is the meal. Good.

528
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:32.610
Patrick S: I mean, a kind of sometimes, sometimes it's not. But it's probably nutritious, which is good for us.

529
01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:37.080
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

530
01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:45.840
Richelle Direny: What have you been to. I think the last time we talked, we were kind of going through like practical ways

531
01:57:46.230 --> 01:58:03.180
Richelle Direny: On how you can, you know, just kind of restructure your budget and kind of how you do things. I know. Like, even with this movie talks about smoking and even in this time with the health pandemics, let's just recap looking at overall your health and

532
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.070
Richelle Direny: You know, how can you be mindful. And how can you do things to safeguard yourself.

533
01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:10.230
Patrick S: Oh,

534
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:27.420
Patrick S: Well, I guess for health. We're going on walks and definitely washing our hands and sanitizing stuff like today, I went to drive through I gotta drive to gas station. I got a carton of cigarettes.

535
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:39.090
Patrick S: I got 20 ounce Coke and then a 32 ounce body armor thing for hydration and went home and I

536
01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:44.700
Patrick S: Use the sanitizing wipes and wipe down all the stuff we got

537
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:57.420
Patrick S: Arm I might wash my hands before wipe shut down. But then I wiped down to that I wiped the Sikh I'm

01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:14.100
Patrick S: But we've been taking

541
01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:16.590
Patrick S: The morning

542
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:24.510
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but you're breaking up a little bit. You just don't know. You just started walking through a patchy area because

543
01:59:24.570 --> 01:59:25.410
You're breaking up.

544
01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:30.240
Patrick S: Those traffic that's it, but

01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:38.520
Patrick S: M.

Patrick S: I'm

01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:02.610
Patrick S: Really good day and it's because my bathroom is is trash from

551
02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:19.590
Patrick S: I didn't add a good roof over the bathroom in my house and I got some major water damage. Then I was lazy and didn't fix the dryer hosts. So every time or in the dryer and they won't entire bathroom got sweaty.

552
02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:21.720
Patrick S: Well,

553
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:36.900
Patrick S: I replace the dryer hose and actually for years and it works perfect so like pissed myself or Rooney bathroom because I just didn't go and do some easy to

554
02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:49.020
Patrick S: Say I started scraping the paint in the bathroom, the plaster on the ceiling does vary the mold and we're just chillin in the house, you know,

555
02:00:52.290 --> 02:01:05.520
Patrick S: I didn't finish getting all the paint scrape and all that, but I'm like doing something productive. I think had a huge thing and my

556
02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.540
Patrick S: My good like really good day.

557
02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:11.790
Patrick S: You know,

558
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:18.870
Richelle Direny: Okay. And do you think that for you.

559
02:01:20.250 --> 02:01:20.670
Richelle Direny: See

560
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:32.460
Richelle Direny: I'm in. Did you tell for today. You said that you had a pretty productive day and doing everything

561
02:01:33.930 --> 02:01:39.780
Richelle Direny: Is this something that if you were working, would you have been able to do all that you got done today.

562
02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:45.390
Patrick S: No, because I work every day. I just never feel like doing

563
02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:54.780
Patrick S: Anything real. I mean, besides the dishes and bad me cuming and tightening the house i don't i don't like

564
02:01:55.980 --> 02:02:03.480
Patrick S: I don't know, working every day for me. I don't feel like doing around the house when I were because I worked so much

565
02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:07.080
Patrick S: And my wife's to say goodbye.

566
02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.870
Patrick S: So what's kind of cool like

567
02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:20.160
Patrick S: Gas Law trend in the House why needs painted. So we're going to do that if we have the money.

568
02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:29.970
Patrick S: Yeah, there's tons of stuff to do the house that I can do, but it also costs money. So I don't know. I'll probably just um

569
02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:32.700
Patrick S: There was some kills

570
02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.260
Patrick S: Primer. Primer on the walls, if there's more

571
02:02:38.370 --> 02:02:39.990
Patrick S: Than pain it again.

572
02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.810
Patrick S: That should take care of it, but

573
02:02:46.290 --> 02:02:46.560
Patrick S: There's

574
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:50.520
Patrick S: An extra $600 a week on

575
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:54.510
Richelle Direny: Your unemployment.

576
02:02:54.960 --> 02:03:05.310
Patrick S: Walter yeah they stand in the weeds but they're saying there's rumors that we're in an extra $600 on point that

577
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.760
Patrick S: And somebody told me it's because

578
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:11.820
Patrick S: Farmers aren't able to grow.

579
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:21.300
Patrick S: Right now, or they're not able to like go and get buy stuff that they need, because of social distancing

580
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:31.080
Patrick S: I'm saying, like everything is going to be crazy expensive to eat groceries. So we're supposed to get an extra $600 a week.

581
02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:33.960
Patrick S: But I, you know,

582
02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:39.450
Patrick S: Like we haven't got our first check. So I don't know if that's true.

583
02:03:40.230 --> 02:03:42.690
Richelle Direny: Well, I don't think anybody who's gotten a check, yet.

584
02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.160
Patrick S: Yeah, no.

585
02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:58.890
Patrick S: I'm that 1200 dollar stimulus. We haven't got yet. I talked to unemployment myself and I owe them about 18 1900 dollars from

586
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:13.800
Patrick S: quitting my job when I when I was when I had an unemployment thing open, and saying, I got fired or lie saying they let me go because I was working through attempt service.

587
02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:22.620
Patrick S: So like I had to repay him 3500 and or 3000 guess and

588
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:31.140
Patrick S: So I was paying 125 a month before the coronavirus thing.

589
02:04:31.770 --> 02:04:32.970
Patrick S: So they're saying

590
02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.350
Patrick S: That they're gonna take half of my unemployment until

591
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:39.840
Patrick S: Until they're paid back

592
02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:46.650
Richelle Direny: Man. So how are you supposed to survive if they do that.

593
02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:50.940
Patrick S: Oh, I don't know. Yeah. Well, my wife.

594
02:04:52.560 --> 02:05:00.720
Patrick S: Now that $600 an hour a week like they're saying, that'll get paid off in three weeks.

595
02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:02.670
Patrick S: Or

596
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:05.760
Patrick S: Six weeks.

597
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:13.260
Patrick S: If we if we did that x 600 whatever but my wife's getting on the phone.

598
02:05:14.610 --> 02:05:16.950
Patrick S: And I saw

599
02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.350
Patrick S: That

600
02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:27.210
Patrick S: I looked on the internet for work. You can do online and I haven't done it yet because

601
02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:37.650
Patrick S: We're waiting to see what's going on and find employment or whatever. But, um, because I don't know if we're allowed to subsidize like you used to in the past.

602
02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:40.920
Patrick S: But there's bookkeeping. I could do

603
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.930
Patrick S: And

604
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:44.580
Patrick S: You don't need to happen.

605
02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:52.410
Richelle Direny: With your job are you completely are like both of you laid off permanently or you're just like, kind of front load until

606
02:05:54.900 --> 02:06:03.030
Patrick S: We have returned of work day but I said there was just a day ever given us. They all know for coming back.

607
02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:20.550
Patrick S: Because like we have a my factories all auto parts and like GM and then are going to be doing half like hospital stuff for a little bit, but our I don't see our factory doing anything for hospital parts.

608
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:25.920
Patrick S: So I don't know.

609
02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:34.770
Richelle Direny: So what about um so in the meantime, like with your wife is she able to do like Instacart or Amazon or anything like that.

610
02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.920
Patrick S: I do our work at the Salvation Army

611
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.810
Patrick S: I know I do. Oh, she's I don't think she's anything right now.

612
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:52.770
Richelle Direny: Oh, she just wants to chill out for a little while.

613
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:53.880
Yeah.

614
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:58.320
Richelle Direny: So what are your thoughts about that.

615
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:01.290
Patrick S: Well, I'm like,

616
02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:05.550
Patrick S: I guess I'm just relax and to

617
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:10.170
Patrick S: A taken as it as it comes a

618
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:16.590
Patrick S: See what happens with that first unemployment shag what they take

619
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.810
Patrick S: If we need to do what will, I'll say we got to figure out a more money.

620
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:35.370
Patrick S: Oh, I don't like right now, we're not focusing on that.

621
02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:46.650
Richelle Direny: Now you're just you're able, you're just doing what you need to do to get things where it needs to be. We're getting the house, whatever you can get done around the house now.

622
02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:51.900
Patrick S: Marble marble side up right now. So there's a

623
02:07:55.050 --> 02:08:01.560
Patrick S: And we don't have to pay the mortgage for three months. I called you got that taken care of.

624
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:03.240
Patrick S: And

625
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:05.640
Patrick S: They said we could even

626
02:08:08.730 --> 02:08:11.130
Patrick S: And I call gas.

627
02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:19.320
Patrick S: Power companies I couldn't get ahold of the core in Peoria ought to try that again about the child support.

628
02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:23.760
Patrick S: But yeah, we're

629
02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:27.000
Richelle Direny: Going to be closed right now.

630
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:29.820
Patrick S: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I Benton

631
02:08:34.530 --> 02:08:36.810
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they're probably going to be closed because of the

632
02:08:41.970 --> 02:08:43.080
Richelle Direny: Until they get

633
02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:59.760
Richelle Direny: People think situated in that aspect that's probably going to be closed. Um, and I don't think anyone. I don't think they're working from home to the sense where it's anything pressing that they need to, you know, if you reach out to them that someone will call you back to let you know.

634
02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:01.170
Patrick S: Yeah.

635
02:09:02.070 --> 02:09:08.310
Richelle Direny: I mean I wouldn't say that they're not going to you know there. There's no they're not going to penalize you. But at this time.

636
02:09:09.630 --> 02:09:14.190
Richelle Direny: Excuse me, I doubt that there wasn't like if you call, do you, where are you able to leave a message.

637
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.570
Richelle Direny: Not

638
02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:19.830
Patrick S: The thing I call I couldn't leave a message. I'll

639
02:09:21.150 --> 02:09:25.980
Patrick S: Try again tomorrow because I was last week I called him but

640
02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:30.750
Patrick S: I'll get another shot and see if I can get ahold of somebody

641
02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:43.020
Richelle Direny: Oh, for the arm to try to see if you could get any a sit down to be able to where you're not penalizing you're not being penalized for

642
02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:46.680
Patrick S: Jobs.

643
02:09:47.550 --> 02:09:48.180
Yeah.

644
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:51.180
Richelle Direny: I would definitely

645
02:09:52.200 --> 02:10:09.330
Richelle Direny: Reach out to them and hear what they say. Because sometimes I know sometimes some places might say, Well, did you try calling, could you leave a message because then maybe they check it every now and again, or they find a way to you know put things on if they don't see that initiation

646
02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:11.160
Patrick S: Yeah.

647
02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:16.650
Patrick S: Cuz I

648
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:19.380
Patrick S: I was trying to

649
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:22.050
Patrick S: Get that paid back

650
02:10:25.410 --> 02:10:28.410
Richelle Direny: Support or just, I'm just a regular monthly payment.

651
02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.430
Patrick S: For this pay monthly and like I'm behind so

652
02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:42.600
Patrick S: Like I was gonna try to pay to two payments, Mom. But then this whole thing up.

653
02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:47.100
Richelle Direny: Oh, you're gonna make a double payment.

654
02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:52.230
Patrick S: I'll try to do this for a long time. I wasn't working. Like there's like

655
02:10:53.610 --> 02:10:55.200
Patrick S: And then she would have problems with

656
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.860
Patrick S: Twitter tab service so

657
02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:04.950
Patrick S: That's not always guaranteed you get let go, even though

658
02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:10.890
Patrick S: Sometimes. But, uh, so like there's

659
02:11:12.810 --> 02:11:14.820
Patrick S: Times like months where she

660
02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:33.780
Patrick S: Worked and then she was out of work for two weeks. So we get behind. Then there was like two and a half months where she just wasn't working all over the summer. And then her daughter stayed with us and that was crazy. It didn't work out.

661
02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:36.000
Richelle Direny: Daughter

662
02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:38.220
Patrick S: She's 17

663
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:48.150
Patrick S: But that was another mouth to feed and it was just me, but I was mostly working seven days a week, so

664
02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:55.170
Patrick S: Like we got we paid. Most of our bills, but I would get behind on child support.

665
02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:13.110
Patrick S: So when she started working where I work through time service. She's getting big checks again. So we're we made one double payment but but she was only there about five weeks before the coronavirus thing happened.

666
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:19.140
Richelle Direny: So she went back home.

667
02:12:19.770 --> 02:12:20.220
Yeah.

668
02:12:24.930 --> 02:12:26.640
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to find your

669
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:44.700
Patrick S: I'm looking, I might look into the bookkeeping, to see if I can do that.

670
02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:49.320
Richelle Direny: Bookkeeping

671
02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:57.630
Patrick S: Yeah. No, I've never done it before, but I took accounting in college one class.

672
02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.680
Patrick S: So I have a basic idea of how to do it.

673
02:13:03.570 --> 02:13:07.800
Patrick S: 20 years ago, but I'm good with numbers and

674
02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:14.970
Patrick S: If I don't have anything else to do. I'm sure I can do about making any mistakes.

675
02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.040
Patrick S: Like, that's all I have to focus on

676
02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:25.680
Richelle Direny: Okay.

677
02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:31.830
Richelle Direny: I mean, I hope you continue to explore the different things. Because the thing is, because you don't know how long.

678
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:47.400
Richelle Direny: This is going to last and even with unemployment. I mean, you know, you don't. You don't know how long any of this or whatever is going to. So if you can do something to counteract and make up the difference. To be able to even put money aside. That's a good that will be a good thing.

679
02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:48.840
Yeah.

680
02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.850
Richelle Direny: It would be definitely something to think about.

681
02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:57.840
Right.

682
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:14.340
Patrick S: I'm getting the generic subs again and

683
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.010
Patrick S: I got the good ones for a month.

684
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:18.240
And

685
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:28.410
Patrick S: We're going on walks and I didn't hurt, but soon as we so I switch back to the generic this week, like my body hurts.

686
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:33.240
Richelle Direny: Oh really,

687
02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:34.200
Yeah.

688
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.770
Richelle Direny: Did you tell, did you see Dr. On

689
02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:40.470
Richelle Direny: Bravo.

690
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:55.920
Patrick S: Well, no, I had the appointment with them last Monday, not two days ago nine days ago and I told him I needed a generic because of money, so I won't see him again for another

691
02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:58.440
Patrick S: Three weeks.

692
02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:04.500
Patrick S: It's just something I'm gonna have to deal with.

693
02:15:08.130 --> 02:15:19.620
Richelle Direny: But all one that's right because then you also for every visit, you have to pay a fee, right, because I was gonna say maybe you could just check in with him. So let him know how how it's making you feel

694
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:28.470
Patrick S: Well, I mean, there's not that I'm not gonna pay the $70 a week for the better ones when it's only for the

695
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.900
Patrick S: Ones that aren't as good

696
02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:36.270
Patrick S: Right now, at this time, I can't afford it. So I'll just deal with

697
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:40.830
Richelle Direny: What about we could I Rex, you can't use good Rx to see if you could get a little cheaper.

698
02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:42.780
Patrick S: Oh,

699
02:15:44.070 --> 02:15:45.030
Patrick S: I don't think so.

700
02:15:46.050 --> 02:15:47.340
Patrick S: Now have my insurance.

701
02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:53.640
Patrick S: Yeah, it's, it's a

702
02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:58.740
Patrick S: It's only thing. It's really an issue with his pain.

703
02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:02.190
Patrick S: Yeah.

704
02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:04.860
Patrick S: I feel more

705
02:16:06.330 --> 02:16:13.500
Patrick S: Like the other ones feel better. But really, like, the only thing that's

706
02:16:15.330 --> 02:16:18.630
Patrick S: Real bad apartment is like body pain.

707
02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:32.670
Richelle Direny: And that's what the side effect that you're feeling with the generic brand.

708
02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:40.860
Patrick S: Yeah, because they're not they because I don't know why it's just they're not as good.

709
02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:59.940
Patrick S: I mean I'm 40 and labor, my whole life. So, my body's gonna hurt, but you just can't tell it with the name brands, the box and you like it hurts a little but it's a

710
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:09.360
Patrick S: Bad a big deal at all. But when I'm when I got the generic ones and we go on a three mile walk. My back's killing me. But it's me. Oh.

711
02:17:13.470 --> 02:17:19.650
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, think about it for a second, though. Patrick was through my head. When was the last time you went on a three mile walk

712
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.010
Patrick S: Oh,

713
02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:32.610
Patrick S: Not for a while, but my job takes is more of a pain on my body than walking

714
02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:45.930
Richelle Direny: So, but you but either way it's always something new, you're introducing and if you're introducing something new. You have to basically proceed with caution. You have to. You can't just kind of throw yourself into him.

715
02:17:46.470 --> 02:17:47.460
Patrick S: Right. Yeah, I know.

716
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:56.670
Richelle Direny: You know your your your body's gonna definitely respond to how

717
02:17:58.710 --> 02:18:04.680
Richelle Direny: Know, once you introduced to it. And if you overexert yourself. It's definitely going to be a little bit more painful.

718
02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:05.970
Right.

719
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:13.560
Richelle Direny: Do you I mean outside of walking like before you walk or if you're going to go on a three my walk. Do you guys at least stretch

720
02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.350
Patrick S: No, no, no.

721
02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:22.770
Richelle Direny: I mean you got a stretch for. It's kind of like when you are. You remember. I don't know if you played sports in in in in school.

722
02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:23.910
Richelle Direny: But like before I

723
02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:28.890
Richelle Direny: Did anything they always made you stretch because if you didn't, you're going to pay for it dearly afterwards.

724
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:30.030
Patrick S: Right, yeah.

725
02:18:33.930 --> 02:18:37.170
Richelle Direny: I mean, do you like are you guys coming up or you doing

726
02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:42.900
Richelle Direny: Do you come up with like a routine a workout routine or are you just

727
02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:48.210
Richelle Direny: Guys decided to, you know, let's take a walk or, let's do this. Let's do that. Is that

728
02:18:48.330 --> 02:18:50.040
Richelle Direny: How you guys have been doing it.

729
02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:54.210
Patrick S: We just said walk in their shoes on.

730
02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:03.150
Richelle Direny: Just kind of enjoying the day as it comes and just using the moment

731
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:04.170
Yep.

732
02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:16.860
Richelle Direny: Like in and it goes so that takes me into one of the goals that you want it to work on and we can touch on that. It's like, improving your relationship with your spouse. It's like coming up with

733
02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:26.040
Richelle Direny: 20 that you guys have that time where you're not really there's no real interruption with work.

734
02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:35.340
Richelle Direny: If there's no, like the obligation of getting up every day and the monotony of the day of going to work and doing all this stuff. Now, you mentioned down

735
02:19:36.090 --> 02:19:42.180
Richelle Direny: And the side. Okay, you know what, we're going to give each other some alone time

736
02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:54.570
Richelle Direny: I'll make whether it's in the morning in the afternoon, whatever that time is we have a long time and then maybe in the evening, if that's better. It's that that's the time that you guys are spending together.

737
02:19:55.410 --> 02:20:05.250
Richelle Direny: And what does that look like whether it's going on a walk, whether it's cleaning whatever it is that you're doing. But I think now is that time where it's not like you.

738
02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:06.360
Patrick S: Have children at

739
02:20:06.450 --> 02:20:07.920
Richelle Direny: Home young children at home.

740
02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:09.270
Richelle Direny: Now, you guys can

741
02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:19.170
Richelle Direny: Just really improve your communication if that's something that needs to be worked on on your time management, if that's something

742
02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:30.570
Richelle Direny: You, ultimately, there's this word understanding each other's love language and start identifying what's her love language, even though it's not yours. But it's speaking

743
02:20:33.780 --> 02:20:36.780
Richelle Direny: You know, you, you're granted that opportunity now.

744
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:39.720
Richelle Direny: To do that as your home together.

745
02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:40.860
Yeah.

746
02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:46.680
Patrick S: Oh, he likes me to go in and wake her up.

747
02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:56.610
Patrick S: Instead of just come out come out and play video games and she asked me to spend

748
02:20:58.050 --> 02:21:04.110
Patrick S: The first hour with her instead of me playing video games. Soon as I wake up.

749
02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:05.910
Patrick S: And

750
02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:17.100
Patrick S: So on. I you know I'm learning that that's what's to me first thing

751
02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:19.200
Patrick S: And

752
02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.270
Richelle Direny: So when you wake up in the morning. So you're saying that you're early riser.

753
02:21:25.470 --> 02:21:28.230
Patrick S: Oh, I have been getting up to

754
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:37.050
Patrick S: Three times so I usually do wake up.

755
02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:48.240
Patrick S: Lately I've been waking up an hour before her, and I usually do go and play a little video game and

756
02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:58.980
Patrick S: But I tried to make sure so that i wake her up because she likes me Chrome back in bed with her and love and honor

757
02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:02.250
Patrick S: She likes waking up.

758
02:22:03.870 --> 02:22:04.050
Patrick S: To

759
02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.870
Richelle Direny: Her love language, which is called

760
02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:10.410
Richelle Direny: What is it call

761
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.380
Richelle Direny: physical touch or something like that.

762
02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:14.460
Patrick S: Yeah.

763
02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.060
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's, that's what it's called. If that's what her love language.

764
02:22:18.390 --> 02:22:24.240
Richelle Direny: Even though it doesn't do anything for you in that moment. It's not about you, it's about what she likes and

765
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:41.070
Richelle Direny: Spending any of your love language is that you want alone time. It doesn't matter what she wants. In that moment, that's your love language. You just want some time and if, and that's just sending it if you know you want quiet time and you just want it maybe an hour.

766
02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:44.580
Richelle Direny: For the day, it's just saying hey you know what

767
02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:48.990
Richelle Direny: At this time, you know, I will allow you, your time.

768
02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.280
Richelle Direny: To just reset.

769
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:51.720
Richelle Direny: Just sit with yourself.

770
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.440
Richelle Direny: Think about what

771
02:22:53.970 --> 02:23:03.600
Richelle Direny: You do with your time and if if your time alone is spending, video games, playing video games, then that's fine you just wouldn't overdo it in that moment.

772
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:04.830
Richelle Direny: Um,

773
02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:13.710
Richelle Direny: Let's just identifying what is she like what do you like and things that you guys could do together because the reality of it is like what they say there's five love languages.

774
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:20.460
Richelle Direny: You speak all of them is just that there are some that stands out more than the others.

775
02:23:22.650 --> 02:23:25.470
Richelle Direny: There's one there. There's like acts of service it for her.

776
02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:34.890
Richelle Direny: She likes like if you you wake her up and she gets up and coffee is made and you know you guys are, you know, that's that service you're doing

777
02:23:34.890 --> 02:23:35.160
These

778
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:39.090
Patrick S: Free

779
02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:43.170
Richelle Direny: And so those are little things that you can do.

780
02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:57.750
Richelle Direny: Building and working on. It's being intentional. It's being a little bit more aware but I think this time being at home. Definitely affords you the opportunity to be able to do that.

781
02:23:58.620 --> 02:23:58.920
Yeah.

782
02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:05.940
Patrick S: Yeah, no, no. It's every we've gotten a couple times where we had away from each other.

783
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.060
Patrick S: And it's always because I

784
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:11.790
Patrick S: played video games.

785
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:14.130
Patrick S: Too long.

786
02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:16.470
Patrick S: Arm

787
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:19.890
Patrick S: And that's, that's her off.

788
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:23.370
Patrick S: Or ignored or on

789
02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:29.970
Patrick S: Both times we got and like bird were to LA for

790
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:32.220
Patrick S: A walk and

791
02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.310
Patrick S: I got mad, so I

792
02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:41.790
Patrick S: Had a fight, I end up needing because because house needs it, but

793
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:44.340
Patrick S: That's

794
02:24:49.890 --> 02:24:57.390
Richelle Direny: Okay. I mean, and so, and this is where you learn from each other. So like if there are things that you do or you say to her.

795
02:24:57.690 --> 02:25:09.510
Richelle Direny: Or she does or say to you, and it kind of upsets you are aggravates you is for you to stop and reset and really think about, you know, what is it that, what is it that she said that really truly was irritating to me.

796
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:18.090
Richelle Direny: What was it that was said that was frustrating to me. And how is it that we can sit down, have this conversation. So for instance,

797
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:26.160
Richelle Direny: Like maybe for her. You said that she doesn't really care for the video games like you know you're spending time. And so maybe an argument will brew out of that.

798
02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:38.400
Richelle Direny: Why is the argument brewing out of it. Is it the fact that she hates to see you playing video games at all or is it that she just feels that you spent a great deal of time playing video games.

799
02:25:38.730 --> 02:25:44.340
Patrick S: Or she she feels I spend a great deal of time and she also

800
02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:55.200
Patrick S: She says that there's nothing she likes more than me. And she feels like I like playing video games more than spending time or thurs sometimes

801
02:25:56.190 --> 02:25:57.360
Richelle Direny: So how do you think

802
02:25:57.450 --> 02:26:10.290
Richelle Direny: Based on sold like so it's it's really we get upset, but then sometimes we have to stop and really analyze what is really upsetting in this moment is it that well she's saying that

803
02:26:10.890 --> 02:26:21.720
Richelle Direny: You really truly love the video game more than her. No, it's more, it's it or is it. Do you love her. The video game more than you love her. No, it's just that.

804
02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:26.760
Richelle Direny: The time management is what's creating the argument if there is

805
02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:38.550
Richelle Direny: You guys. The tension is not so much about you playing the video game. The act of you playing the video game or the act of you not spending it is your time management.

806
02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:56.310
Richelle Direny: And it's just saying if you wake up in the morning and if all you're doing is at if you wake up at nine and you're on the video game and you're on the video game till 12 and you are not paying any attention to her and or you're not even acknowledging her very existence then

807
02:26:57.330 --> 02:27:03.060
Richelle Direny: You just need to get better time management is that you come up with an idea and says, you know what

808
02:27:04.350 --> 02:27:18.990
Richelle Direny: whatever time you will play that video game because that's your time alone and you play the video game after that it's just saying, Okay, what was it that you want us to do. Let's do something together, whether it's let's take a walk together hold hands and, you know,

809
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:20.850
Richelle Direny: Whatever you can you

810
02:27:20.850 --> 02:27:24.090
Richelle Direny: Walk the sightseeing people watch, whatever that is.

811
02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:27.360
Richelle Direny: Whatever it is that she wants to do.

812
02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:30.930
Richelle Direny: That you're devoting this time and attention for her.

813
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.970
Patrick S: Yeah.

814
02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:45.840
Richelle Direny: And if you do, I think that if you make that intentionality and you put that time and you invest that time with her. It's good. And sometimes, you know, maybe for her.

815
02:27:46.620 --> 02:28:02.100
Richelle Direny: Sometimes I find. And granted, she's not here, but sometimes I find that if it is that, hey, I don't really care about video games, but maybe if she sits there and says, hey, let me play with you that's time spent together. I've seen

816
02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:13.890
Richelle Direny: They decide to play the video game together that's time spent together, but it's not using taking advantage and saying, Oh, let's play this video game hours on end now.

817
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:27.960
Richelle Direny: Because now you're joining my world. No, but it's more or less, you know, since she's taking that time to to join to come into my world. Let me find a way that I can go into her world. So for you.

818
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:35.310
Richelle Direny: You personally don't care to go to the goodwill and get the food because you're skeptical about the stuff, but for her.

819
02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.940
Richelle Direny: Together, you guys are going on this venture

820
02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.190
Richelle Direny: To get something together and you're having a meal together for her.

821
02:28:45.390 --> 02:28:53.850
Richelle Direny: You're just having this informed conversation and you're saying, hey, listen, I will go with you. But these are my concern and having those those real conversations

822
02:28:54.330 --> 02:29:06.750
Richelle Direny: About what is it that bothers you about going to the goodwill. If you come to if you come to find like okay well they're doing all of the they have all their protective gears on what they're doing.

823
02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:16.470
Richelle Direny: And he'll. Okay, let's do this together. Ultimately, it saves us money. Um, and you guys could come to some type of common ground and agree on something.

824
02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:27.090
Richelle Direny: I'm sure she will appreciate that you say Hey hon. You know what, it's 10 o'clock. We got to get up. We got to get in there in time so we can be in the line at a certain time. I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

825
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:38.160
Richelle Direny: To truly appreciate that. So it's just identifying what is it that this person is saying. And if you're not clear.

826
02:29:39.090 --> 02:29:50.490
Richelle Direny: I have that conversation. So you're clear about what it is that the frustration is or what did they said they are saying and seeing how now you can work together. Like I said, you have uninterrupted time

827
02:29:51.840 --> 02:30:00.900
Richelle Direny: You, you, you're not going to work. This is your time and your opportunity to do that because what better time than it now because when you go back to work.

828
02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:04.260
Richelle Direny: Both are you both are in the grind.

829
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.630
Patrick S: Yeah.

830
02:30:09.450 --> 02:30:11.490
Richelle Direny: Not to say that I'm encouraging smoking.

831
02:30:11.730 --> 02:30:17.250
Richelle Direny: But you say that that's something that you guys do together you smoking you drink a cup of coffee together.

832
02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:22.110
Patrick S: Morning.

833
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:25.440
Patrick S: Morning.

834
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:33.390
Patrick S: Coffee for the first couple hours cigarette.

835
02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:36.210
Richelle Direny: Will still drink coffee.

836
02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:39.600
Patrick S: Well,

837
02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.820
Patrick S: The normal amount of

838
02:30:47.010 --> 02:30:48.960
Richelle Direny: You say you drink you drink a lot

839
02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:52.200
Patrick S: Yeah I drink a lot. She drinks the normal amount

840
02:31:00.090 --> 02:31:04.770
Richelle Direny: I'm just saying, you know, those are the suggestions in terms of being able to identify

841
02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:11.880
Richelle Direny: From both aspects, what works and what doesn't.

842
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:26.730
Richelle Direny: Another thing in spending time together. I know you said you're Catholic and she is. I mean both kind of fall under Christianity but she's more of the of the Pentecostal faith. You said right and you're more

843
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:36.990
Richelle Direny: The Catholic faith coming to a common ground and saying, Hey, you know, you don't want to go in two different directions. How can you both come together.

844
02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:48.810
Richelle Direny: Where it's one common thing you're both working on your spiritual life. And together, watching something together and having that discussion about what you've learned

845
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:53.640
Richelle Direny: You said in reading Psalms. Do you guys read it together.

846
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:55.080
Oh,

847
02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:59.130
Patrick S: I mean all maybe I should suggest that we do.

848
02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:10.500
Patrick S: She has a app. She's got Bible app where she prays every night and every morning or whatever they give her and she reads that and then

849
02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:16.740
Patrick S: And some sometimes I'll sit buyer and look over our shoulder and look at it, but

850
02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:19.410
Patrick S: I

851
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.810
Richelle Direny: Wish. She has the new version app.

852
02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:25.680
Patrick S: She's got some Bible app. I don't know.

853
02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:27.720
Patrick S: I can't

854
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:32.190
Patrick S: She's got an app that I was gonna get but it took too much.

855
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:37.290
Patrick S: Too much data or something on my phone. So it's on your resume.

856
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:58.260
Richelle Direny: Oh, OK. OK. OK. Um, maybe that's something that you can do. I remember someone saying that if you really don't know like what to read in the Bible. You can start off with, let's say you read Proverbs, or you read Psalm. And so, like say say today is April today's what the eighth

857
02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:03.180
Richelle Direny: April. So you'll read Psalms Chapter eight today.

858
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:08.880
Patrick S: Yeah, that's a that's actually what the priests encourage us to do.

859
02:33:09.930 --> 02:33:15.630
Patrick S: Not specifically the song for that day. But he said,

860
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:23.280
Patrick S: Like you haven't really read the Bible, he told us to start or Psalms. So that's why I went there.

861
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:33.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you just start up. I've heard, I heard it more so with proverbs because Proverbs is more like it gives a lot more wisdom and understanding to certain things.

862
02:33:33.930 --> 02:33:47.460
Richelle Direny: So I've heard it with proverbs. If you haven't, you know, if you haven't, if you want to read the Bible, or you want. You don't know where to start. Like you'll say, okay, Proverbs, chapter eight, that's what you will read some. I mean, there's some chapters that are shorter than others.

863
02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:58.110
Richelle Direny: But like if you decide you want to read you know you could maybe meditate on that throughout the day. So in the morning you'll you'll read it and maybe revisit it again.

864
02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:03.390
Richelle Direny: At some point in the day, or you wouldn't hurt this at this time. That's something you could do with her.

865
02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:22.680
Richelle Direny: Hey, let's read this together this reverse together. She brings up her phone. Her you version and you guys read it together, or she has a Bible devotion on the you version that is just devoted just to you and her. Maybe a good arm thing that you can do is

866
02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:33.540
Richelle Direny: You could probably over coffee in the morning. If that's your routine, a part of that routine is just that you both of you read it together.

867
02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:34.410
Patrick S: And talk about it.

868
02:34:37.650 --> 02:34:41.520
Richelle Direny: If that's something that she likes, maybe that's something that you guys could do together.

869
02:34:41.970 --> 02:34:53.340
Richelle Direny: That you to build your faith, um, while you work through both of your working through your faith in your spirituality. It's also helping to create this bond.

870
02:34:54.450 --> 02:34:59.490
Richelle Direny: Or work through your relationship, you know, just time spent together.

871
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:02.550
Richelle Direny: That's definitely something that you can do.

872
02:35:04.050 --> 02:35:11.610
Patrick S: Also, we're doing a great job right now because I know in the area crime isn't like big right now.

873
02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:14.220
Patrick S: Might be down, but the mastic

874
02:35:14.370 --> 02:35:15.240
Richelle Direny: Everybody home.

875
02:35:15.870 --> 02:35:18.930
Patrick S: Yeah, domestic situation to going way up.

876
02:35:21.090 --> 02:35:22.830
Patrick S: We've done pretty good I think.

877
02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:27.060
Richelle Direny: You're hearing a lot a lot of domestic violence.

878
02:35:27.630 --> 02:35:31.590
Patrick S: Yeah, that's what is in the news, but, uh,

879
02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:35.160
Patrick S: Yeah, like, you know, if we had kids.

880
02:35:36.450 --> 02:35:47.400
Patrick S: And might be different, but just two people spending so much time together every day not getting to see other people like it's very hard.

881
02:35:47.850 --> 02:35:49.290
Richelle Direny: Very challenging

882
02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:50.220
Yeah.

883
02:35:51.990 --> 02:36:02.160
Richelle Direny: There's always a, is there a chance of why you can work on the relationship that's i'm saying is very important for all of what I'm saying, okay, we need some alone time we really truly need to own time.

884
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:07.050
Richelle Direny: So if my alone time is in the room watching TV, that's my little time.

885
02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:16.320
Richelle Direny: If I gotta go take a walk by myself. That's a little Don't call me don't think I need to spend that time alone because you're right, spending all this time together.

886
02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.900
Richelle Direny: You're going to hear a lot of things.

887
02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:27.270
Richelle Direny: You're going to hear a lot of things you hear a lot of but then the cry, cry, maybe not be so much because everybody's too scared to go outside.

888
02:36:37.770 --> 02:36:39.870
Richelle Direny: What you didn't. You didn't come to group on to

889
02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:40.860
Richelle Direny: Your every other week.

890
02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:45.600
Patrick S: Now right yeah I last week I just totally forgot about it.

891
02:36:56.010 --> 02:36:58.350
Richelle Direny: You said last week. But then, and then this week.

892
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:16.680
Patrick S: Um, this week it was we went for a walk and I lost track of time. And then when we got back, uh, we just sat down for dinner. Um, I don't have. I don't have time because I

893
02:37:17.850 --> 02:37:27.870
Patrick S: Like I knew it was happening, but the time didn't work out yesterday, but I was scheduled for last week and I totally slipped my mind forgot all about it.

894
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:38.550
Richelle Direny: Now with the with. I know that we have talked about it with you losing your job and kind of things being tight now. Um, I think we were meeting we you were doing.

895
02:37:39.570 --> 02:37:45.090
Richelle Direny: We were meeting every week in terms of one week you did group one week you did individual right

896
02:37:45.570 --> 02:37:50.460
Patrick S: Yeah. But now, if I could do once a month, that'd be better for his money for sure.

897
02:37:50.970 --> 02:37:51.450
Okay.

898
02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:55.350

912
02:40:13.530 --> 02:40:27.180
