Cynthia We: Hey,

4
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, everything my sounding like my voice and my video or on matched.

5
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm saying I know are yours. Well, then it fine. How do you do

6
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
Cynthia We: Good. How are you, I'm good, took a very long time this morning.

7
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.580
Cynthia We: Remember why

8
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.240
I mean,

9
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.690
Cynthia We: Strange. Yeah, so

10
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys can't tell when those other people there. Is that right,

11
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.930
Cynthia We: In the clinic.

12
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.790
Cynthia We: Yeah, we can, it will, it says I'm be

13
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.900
Cynthia We: You're assisting another customer. Oh, another client.

14
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can literally see the queue. You can't see there's five people 10 people, you can't

15
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.280
Cynthia We: No, no, no. Today I did notice that it said estimated wait time 15 minutes, which I thought was

16
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.740
Cynthia We: really surprising because it never takes that long.

17
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.880
Cynthia We: But I guess it depends on how busy people are

18
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you feel while you're waiting

19
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.890
Cynthia We: I'm a little frustrated because I was I was late than just you.

20
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.770
Okay.

21
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:31.230
Cynthia We: And angry with myself for not starting earlier so that I'd be prompt ready to go at 10 you know i i guess i kind of play a game a little bit like is it going to take five minutes we're going to be four minutes.

22
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
Cynthia We: And I today I estimated that it would take me three minutes.

23
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.670
Cynthia We: 10 minutes

24
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:52.680
Cynthia We: So, so yeah, frustrated with myself for not being a little more prepared and ready to go. I put a note on my door. Today though so that I would not be in Iran.

25
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you did.

26
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.710
Cynthia We: That listing

27
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anyone noticed it yet. You think

28
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.660
Cynthia We: Um, no. I do not know because

29
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:14.730
Cynthia We: Scott was in the bathroom when he's the he's the only one come in really and he was in the bathroom when I come in here so I couldn't talk to him and I don't. I haven't heard him at all out there.

30
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.120
Cynthia We: We had

31
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.760
Cynthia We: A shocking shocking thing and the other night.

32
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.590
Cynthia We: Okay, we were

33
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.520
Cynthia We: We were doing April Fool's Day jokes on the kids.

34
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:46.590
Cynthia We: We had so much fun and and we were just, I was cracking up because Scott put truffles, he melted them in the microwave and then put them all over the toilet seat like you know in

35
00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:04.830
Cynthia We: The bottom toasty. So they were all truffles were all over the seat that you sit on. And then all over the inside it. So when you take it went to the bathroom in the morning. He lifted up. Get it out of scan, I'd be like, oh my god.

36
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:22.350
Cynthia We: I would do on their faces and I put food day in the in the sink, like in the faucet so that when they turn it on and read and I'm a key put toothpaste in the Oreos, and

37
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.090
Cynthia We: carrots and celery instead of he took the cream out, you know, and carrots, celery in A Jury Knows bag.

38
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.810
Cynthia We: So we're just, we're having a blast and then

39
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:50.130
Cynthia We: Scott Oh, the best one is he changed teens phone so that when Tikkun was texting. It said anytime we type the word I

40
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.900
Cynthia We: It's it would change. I like to break dance in the news.

41
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:12.840
Cynthia We: And then if you type the law. It's a poop is odd, my shoes. So things that I'm but then he started looking to to text and and

42
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:25.410
Cynthia We: You know, I, we've done that, like maybe three times in the telephone and we've always been super pleasantly surprised that he's a really good friend to come home and

43
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.000
Cynthia We: So, um, this time.

44
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.870
Cynthia We: Scott found jokes that he was telling his friend Sam and there were like six of them.

45
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.330
Cynthia We: Three of them were racist a lot joking about the Holocaust and about every

46
00:05:49.890 --> 00:06:05.490
Cynthia We: One of them was about 911 thumpers and two of them were about like the kind of folks that child pornographers motel one another like above babies.

47
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.320
Cynthia We: Not being a virgin when they die like like dead. He's

48
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:31.620
Cynthia We: So he's on the chat app called this word. It's a gamer platform. And so as I searched racist. I'm texts are racist racist joke because Tim. This is not him. Like if

49
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.610
Cynthia We: We don't tell jokes like that and my family and

50
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:56.370
Cynthia We: He's super duper sensitive like this kid that stood up for the gay kid on the playground and the kid the Jewish kid that other people were like saying, Hitler to so so he knows what's right and wrong, and he's always were like, oh my god. Is he really an asshole. And we just didn't know

51
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:14.760
Cynthia We: And I'm apparently this platform. This gamer platform has a dark side. And it has porn that you can find as all these Nazis that hang out there and put these themes up these

52
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:24.750
Cynthia We: Things these terrible things so kids are stepping on this and it's not

53
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:35.400
Cynthia We: Um, I think getting desensitized to it. I understand. So I told taken steps I'm I don't know how to handle it. You know, we're like, do we rage.

54
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:48.360
Cynthia We: To be like freak out because this is acceptable. Do we take his phone away. Um, and I you know Greg's like he's 13 he's trying to figure out who he is and and if you find the sun.

55
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.640
Cynthia We: And we keep key. Okay, but like, why try that out.

56
00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.330
Cynthia We: So, um, is there a sick that Scott up to him.

57
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.070
Cynthia We: And

58
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.120
Cynthia We: Keep it cool but like

59
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.760
Cynthia We: What, what's the fog.

60
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:21.720
Cynthia We: He also suggested Scott was really, really, really worried that Sam's parents because Sam cities. He was sending them to Sam.

61
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.680
Cynthia We: And Sam. I've heard Sam tell some pretty

62
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:40.380
Cynthia We: Major off color remarks that his family wouldn't be cool with, um, and I'm sure he's hearing him at school, he goes to school Alamos, which is really super white and I'm

63
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:54.870
Cynthia We: So taken therapist pulled Scott to go and call Kim and I just got was so worried about like how how they're going to think about us. This is like a small phone and like people

64
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:05.880
Cynthia We: GET JUDGED ON that kind of stuff. So yeah, I think he was just trying to like ease Scott's feelings about his friends thinking us an answer.

65
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:18.720
Cynthia We: Because his kids time these jokes so I'm rather than calling the parents to like intervene in any way more like them because their friends and we should talk to them.

66
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:38.040
Cynthia We: And tell them you know because certainly they have read the text, they're much better at they're much better at policing than we are, and would know that Teagan is sent those tests and may even not wants to me, you know, a ticket, you know, that is important to say, hey, this doesn't

67
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.610
Cynthia We: Happen. This is a cool and

68
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.370
So Cindy, what is happening for you around this family event.

69
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.980
Cynthia We: I'm like really just I'm

70
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.960
Cynthia We: Confused about what to do.

71
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.680
Cynthia We: And

72
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.550
Cynthia We: I'm worried for Tikkun

73
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.530
Cynthia We: That

74
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.830
Cynthia We: I'm super glad we caught it.

75
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.560
Cynthia We: Because he goes to the cat school where if he told a joke like that at school, they

76
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.620
Cynthia We: wouldn't tolerate it and and he I'm imagining that people would like, Ooh, we had to stay away from him, he's bad, kid.

77
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.260
Cynthia We: I don't, I don't know, like why like

78
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:54.450
Cynthia We: Me wants to show him at the worst article I can find about kids being raped and like make him make him feel the the horror that I feel when that happens to kids.

79
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.400
Cynthia We: And I'm

80
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.040
Cynthia We: To shock him.

81
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:09.960
Cynthia We: Out of whatever he's doing. And then like we've been walking. We just watched lists and like to joke about the Holocaust, but

82
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:22.530
Cynthia We: I don't know what's happening with me. I'm just like, super duper confused. I'm glad that Scott kind of talk to them.

83
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:33.750
Cynthia We: God, I don't always agree about how to handle things, but I think we are on the same page.

84
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the page we had

85
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:48.030
Cynthia We: Um, that something has to be said to take in. Um, but that it should be done in a way that kind of

86
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.520
Cynthia We: Rather than yelling at him like my parents would have done.

87
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.850
Cynthia We: To not necessarily get angry.

88
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.070
Cynthia We: But to to crystal ball it for him. What can happen.

89
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.930
Cynthia We: If people think he's this kind of person.

90
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.930
Cynthia We: Maybe you won't be a lot of hang out with Sam anymore that maybe

91
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You and Scott are on the same page, there's a delay in our video just you know so tonight today may feel as if I'm not a great listener, but it there is huge chunks, where you're stalled out so I do apologize if

92
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:25.440
It.

93
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.470
Cynthia We: Wasn't stable so I

94
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to apologize that I will come across a little bit like not it as a tuned as maybe I am in the past.

95
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's because I don't always hear everything. There's this little lag. So let's let's create space after we share for it to catch up and it's nothing personal. It's just this tech the technology isn't perfect today.

96
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.200
Cynthia We: We're look

97
00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.810
Cynthia We: I was gonna say, should I tell them to turn things off, but I don't know if that matters.

98
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.970
Don't know.

99
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

100
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.630
Cynthia We: Well, yes, I don't know.

101
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.500
What do you want to do.

102
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.470
Cynthia We: About my video or about taking

103
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.360
Either one.

104
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.150
Cynthia We: Yeah, I would like to connect some things from the fly. I think that would help. Okay.

105
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.080
Cynthia We: So give me one sec.

106
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

107
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.300
Cynthia We: Nobody's using my five

108
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So the whole planet is using Wi Fi.

109
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.160
Yeah.

110
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I probably have

111
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple people that are on video conference, possibly in my own house. So I don't know if I'm contributing to the problem.

112
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.220
Cynthia We: It's my was unstable. Popping my screen.

113
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:09.780
Cynthia We: Okay.

114
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are you and Scott are on the same

115
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.600
Cynthia We: Page feel like we are on the same page. Yes.

116
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.140
And

117
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Who decided that Scott

118
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Has to be the one to discuss crystal ball aka the executive functioning part of the brain that can both pay attention to the here and now and project into the future cause and effect. So how is that decided that he has to be the one to do it.

119
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:53.460
Cynthia We: Well, the therapist suggested it and I think he suggested it because teen might be more open hearing it if parents aren't coming

120
00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:00.660
Cynthia We: He might be more open to hearing it if if they're just taking a walk in having a heart to heart.

121
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Did they go take a walk.

122
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.940
Cynthia We: Of course procrastinate.

123
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it hasn't happened yet.

124
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But why him. Why not you

125
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.770
Cynthia We: Take it has a better relationship with them. I think it's what I assume

126
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.090
Cynthia We: But, um,

127
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.890
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think Keegan looks up to him more.

128
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that you have said, I'm confused, I'm super duper confused. I'm confused. I write about what to do.

129
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.340
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

130
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm so glad that he's that Scott's doing it, hands up in the air like that.

131
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Where does that. Where does that count. Where's that

132
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.380
Like

133
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just how you want it to go.

134
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: deferring to his therapist differing not getting in their shared responsibility shared Sammy. Sammy.

135
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are on the same page.

136
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.050
Cynthia We: We are

137
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Who cares. With this therapist things. What about what 70 thinks you're the mom.

138
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.540
Cynthia We: The therapist. I think that there is no nice and better than I do.

139
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.520
Cynthia We: It was how he will react to things.

140
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:47.250
Cynthia We: Because you can tell him everything they have a great relationship. And, um,

141
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:59.400
Cynthia We: I just think he's got some insight that I don't have, you know, no conversation ever goes well with you, like, it's always dramatic.

142
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:00.960
Cynthia We: And

143
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.960
Cynthia We: This is so important.

144
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that graduation.

145
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.620
Cynthia We: What

146
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: No conversation goes

147
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.230
Cynthia We: Well, first, yes, it's an exaggeration.

148
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:23.460
Cynthia We: Of conversation conversations. There were telling him.

149
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:32.910
Cynthia We: I'm just, you know what, I'm not good at it. I get mad, I get mad at him and I lose my shit.

150
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:34.950
Cynthia We: I

151
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.810
Cynthia We: I'm

152
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.900
Cynthia We: I'm afraid that I'll fuck it up.

153
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.980
Cynthia We: And this all goes back to my confidence level like my my

154
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:08.580
Cynthia We: Feeling of lack of control and I keep thinking back to that one day when it worked when I did that when I did the consequences and I stuck to it and

155
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.300
Cynthia We: And it worked. I found out about it.

156
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Does look like you

157
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: See

158
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The. What's the verb.

159
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not allow

160
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: succumb not funded either

161
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You take the one down position to therapists to Scott to Gwen. I don't know where else you do that.

162
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But

163
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You do know we

164
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have some we don't have some magic stuff.

165
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have a magic. We don't. We got the same stuff you do

166
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

167
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.400
Cynthia We: I feel like

168
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.470
Cynthia We: I don't think I feel like you guys have been trained in communication.

169
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.600
Cynthia We: I am

170
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:26.220
Cynthia We: At communication. And I don't think that's completely my fault, but but the fact and um

171
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.720
Cynthia We: And the way I was parenting is

172
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.040
Cynthia We: Not the way I want to do it so

173
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But, Cindy.

174
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are. That's a great explanation. It is right, of course, duh, but

175
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If you keep allowing other people to do mom's job. How does mom get any better at the job.

176
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.230
Cynthia We: You very good point is

177
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That we're all enabling you to use your anger and I just throw my hands up. I can't manage right I'm exaggerating. So

178
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.430
Cynthia We: You know, I can't manage

179
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.980
Cynthia We: It is get off. Yeah.

180
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what happens, you've been doing it and but it reinforces

181
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not confident the rest of the world says, yeah, you sit down, little girl. You don't know what you're doing.

182
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to join them. I don't want to do that. And that's why I said, You've got it. Take the notes, go talk to your son, and you did it. You did just fine. I didn't say, Hold me next. You put me on the phone and I'll talk to him. I go to

183
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you did it. Yeah, if nobody takes the time to teach, then how are you, you think that Scott's not confused you think that therapist was

184
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.290
Cynthia We: Confused.

185
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If the therapist is so tight with him. How come he didn't talk to him about the implications of

186
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.810
Cynthia We: Picking up

187
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.040
Cynthia We: Speaking out

188
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No, because it is you because it is you and Scott that matters.

189
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: For the reference standard in that home about what is acceptable. You set the moral compass, you said it, not the therapist, not me, not mom nuts sister you

190
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, the page that you. So why on earth YouTube as United Front wouldn't come talk to him on that walk where no one's either I and you're just you know 100 different ways to go about it.

191
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, wrong no right just how is my client, Cindy.

192
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.300
Hi.

193
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How this is benefiting Cindy houses benefiting my client right now.

194
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:02.670
Right.

195
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.830
Cynthia We: Very good point.

196
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I see all of us, saying, Oh, they're there. Oh, it's just too much for you.

197
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.300
Cynthia We: This is her

198
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:25.530
Cynthia We: I told my sister. This and which made Scott cringe, because it feels like

199
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:38.250
Cynthia We: Feels like she Lords over a circlet. I don't know what he feels, but he was upset tone. And I'm like, I can remember her telling me.

200
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:59.040
Cynthia We: She looked at texts on her oldest son's phone and she needed to scrub. I bought my point saying anything to her that she has been there and she understands that kids do that, that you don't agree with. And I'd have some input and she had

201
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.520
Cynthia We: an inbuilt was don't do what I did.

202
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:18.990
Cynthia We: It's it's her input was how she has parenthood. These her older than her youngest completely differently. Uh huh. And, um, oh much it has worked with younger one, she said, I don't get mad at y'all.

203
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.850
Cynthia We: At look she's like I i crystal ball it for him.

204
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.990
Cynthia We: Could happen. And, um,

205
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:36.240
Cynthia We: I just love that, I love that she has the experience and that she knows she fucked up with her older

206
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:51.420
Cynthia We: And and that she can admit that and say, no, I didn't do such a great job there. And here's what's working for a younger one

207
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you go put that in motion yourself that

208
00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:58.710
Cynthia We: Sounds good.

209
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I never going to tell you, you should

210
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.980
Cynthia We: Especially these guys are doing.

211
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.500
Cynthia We: I don't know what he's doing. I don't know what am I go, did you talk to

212
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:27.450
Cynthia We: This is a whole day and a half now. Like we couldn't wait to talk to him. I couldn't wait to see woke up. Why are you letting he's scared. He's scared that he won't say the right thing. Probably. I know.

213
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.200
Cynthia We: That he won't get the point through

214
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:44.520
Cynthia We: This he's a good person, I think. And, um, I think he's 13 years old and he's trying things on and he just needs to know that this is not going to try

215
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:49.620
Why not

216
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.440
Cynthia We: Gross.

217
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gross.

218
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.660
Cynthia We: It's gross. And it's cruel and I'm

219
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Some all grossing crawl. That's all.

220
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.680
Cynthia We: Yeah, right.

221
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.970
Um,

222
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.670
Cynthia We: Because can

223
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.600
Cynthia We: Have a negative

224
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.320
Cynthia We: Effect on his

225
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.570
Cynthia We: And his friendships his reputation.

226
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.180
Cynthia We: I'm

227
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.640
Cynthia We: And then he might become known as that kind of person.

228
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:32.850
Cynthia We: And

229
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:50.610
Cynthia We: Especially not not being allowed to hang out with people that you really like you know Sam his best friend because he told jokes like this. I could see parents saying no getting out with that. Good.

230
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:59.520
Cynthia We: And Sam would have to tell people why he wasn't being updated anymore would further ruin his reputation. Okay.

231
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are 13 years old.

232
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember gossiping wearing something saying something not doing something or doing something with holding your true interest in something for the sake of having to fit in.

233
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.050
Cynthia We: With some peer group.

234
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.130
Be logging.

235
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.280
Cynthia We: 13 or when I was 23 or when I

236
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.510
Cynthia We: Yes, I do. Of course I do.

237
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't know. Of course I do.

238
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The pressure it. This is not a joke. And unfortunately, it gets minimize this concept of peer pressure because we've said it so many times it doesn't have any

239
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning anymore.

240
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to, I want to stop for a frickin second and talk about this is not some played out thing. This is

241
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I am developing

242
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Independence, the importance of my tribe. My adolescent tribe, the ones where they look like me talk like me is literally

243
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can feel as if

244
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It has more important than what

245
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.700
Cynthia We: His parents think, of course. Yes, I remember that. I mean,

246
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And when a parent comes to you and says, you know, don't buckle under your peer pressure. It's like, are you kidding me, this is insurmountable this pressure is is all that there is

247
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can also not only do you say right

248
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the family values. This is what what we represent. These are the crystal ball things you were doing that part. But it's also and I get it, and I want to talk about

249
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How hard it is to do what I just said.

250
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so hard. And here's what I did that failed ended up acting out in this really and I'm regretting it today, but here's a really cool thing that you could do. I'm still struggling with it myself. Here's what you could do to meet that pressure. It's huge.

251
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:31.110
Cynthia We: Yeah, and and and this is one aspect of it hugs will come and the pressure to have sex will come and those are the big

252
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.480
Cynthia We: We think those are the big things. But this is like this is a practice for all of that. It's just going to get worse.

253
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.880
Cynthia We: We're just going to have less control.

254
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

255
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.470
Cynthia We: Feel so important to get

256
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I know, but you're

257
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:51.870
Cynthia We: Not

258
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just put your hands up and you're saying, yeah, I'm confused you not you know exactly what you think.

259
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You have an opinion.

260
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You care very much about this. What do you mean you confuse you sound very clear to me.

261
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:30.600
Cynthia We: I remember, um, I remember I was probably like 25 and I decided one year, that it was the funniest Halloween do ever that I came up with this. It was so proud of it and going to dress as a Pan Am stewardess of the flight recent crap.

262
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.650
Cynthia We: And I saw my friend.

263
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.680
Cynthia We: And his reaction was like

264
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.700
Cynthia We: Ah,

265
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.710
Cynthia We: No, okay, Cindy.

266
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.970
Cynthia We: I was so surprised because I thought it was. Oh.

267
00:30:52.140 --> 00:31:03.780
Cynthia We: And, um, I can remember just that I have good memories of not standing the connection like not understanding what the line.

268
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:15.930
Cynthia We: Well, I was never. It was not race related but the taste is useless thing of making jokes about someone else.

269
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.930
Cynthia We: God is something I didn't get I was 25 i mean

270
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

271
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess you're not supposed to that's

272
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the frontal lobe stuff and I just read

273
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Some information that continues to make it even more surprising that that part that the executive functioning, we're talking about doesn't come online. Actually, I was thinking

274
00:31:42.660 --> 00:32:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For for folks. It would be like for gals, it'd be about 2526 for men 2728 but now they're pushing they're pushing it up to 30 so 25 to 30 years old and I'm just like, Oh my gosh, and we're saying go live your life at 18 but meanwhile

275
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not able to sit with this is my, this is what I want. Now, how would that play out.

276
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.400
Cynthia We: Yeah.

277
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And steps forward.

278
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.830
Backward.

279
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That part of the brain, you're imposing that expectation on a 13 year old.

280
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, literally has no idea what you're talking about.

281
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, he doesn't

282
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's not a bad way he

283
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't have that part of the brain. It is so I say it's an external executive functioning. That's you.

284
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do need to

285
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it out loud say calmly and say, while you're developing that part of the brain. I will continue to remind you until you develop your own. This is the reference standard in this home.

286
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can be so much pressure. And so um so confusing because, was there a little zap Teagan when you heard

287
00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Nazi

288
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And word gay or whatever the the trigger words were right, baby. Baba, Baba. Was there any little twinge in your gut. Was there any little moment where you caught it.

289
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you remembered I want to look the same. I want to look cool. I don't want to stand out at all. If this is the topic. Then I'm going to join them. Do you remember before you did that, that there was some register somewhere of haha oh shit.

290
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And I bet he will. I bet he had

291
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.670
Cynthia We: A tiny little income, and he just did a chicken.

292
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

293
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, no, no.

294
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa. Oh really. Tell me, what would you say to that, buddy. That was online Sandy, what would you do

295
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.940
Cynthia We: Oh, he wasn't. It wasn't mine. He was telling his friend and

296
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what would you, what would you do

297
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:51.900

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is. Yeah.

300
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.010
Cynthia We: This is not

Cynthia We: Yeah.

303
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:22.380
Cynthia We: He did. But this is another thing is he did start an account and did a couple of jokes online. So that is relevant, but this, in this case, where he was telling Sam the jokes. It was really separate and on

304
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.490
Cynthia We: And on

305
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You try taking yourself off video for a few minutes. I really want to hear what you're saying.

306
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:32.310
Cynthia We: Oh my gosh, really.

307
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want to hear what you're saying it's just, it's too delayed.

308
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

309
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:44.880
Cynthia We: Um,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.570
Cynthia We: He also posted. He started an account and he posted on that website.

311
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.430
Cynthia We: And

312
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.300
Cynthia We: I'm

313
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:09.000
Cynthia We: Sam, the city was telling Sam was completely separate like I was telling him jokes and Sam's response wasn't even positive like Sam was like oh dude like

314
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.880
Cynthia We: Wasn't egging them on.

315
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.090
Cynthia We: And then

316
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:24.960
Cynthia We: I feel like that's a whole nother conversation that we have to have like what you put online lives with you ever

317
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a separate conversations part of the Congress.

318
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:28.800
Cynthia We: Oh,

319
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's part of the conversation.

320
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be charming entertaining now.

321
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the possible consequence. That's the same conversation. It's just, just talking about the internet and then that lives there forever. It's the same thing.

322
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.670
Cynthia We: Yeah, you're right.

323
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's chicken. What did you think when you saw, Sam. Right. Oh dude Tegan would you think

324
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.670
Cynthia We: Oh,

325
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what I don't know I just kind of ignored it. Okay, well, what if he didn't ignore it. Now let's look at it. Now that we have some time and we can look at it.

326
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, Oh, dude. If you've ever said Oh dude, like how do you think it sounded like when he was typing it wasn't like oh day. High five. Oh dude, or was it like oh did

327
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.570
Cynthia We: Oh well, dude. Right.

328
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you think it sounded like because we're only typing. We can't get all of the

329
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:30.630
You know,

330
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds and

331
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Great prosody in there.

332
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to slow it down.

333
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.230
Cynthia We: Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't think of those things get away from bad boy.

335
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right away from Good boy.

336
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it like, oh boy, a learning opportunity.

337
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.310
Yes.

338
00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:03.090
Cynthia We: I'm my sister said, What a great way to bow from

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.520
Cynthia We: Um, to rebel.

340
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:12.330
Cynthia We: From a school that teaches tolerance and expense of everyone.

341
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, that's a really nice. That's a nice angle. I like that.

342
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know show again. So it's a different angle of the same phenomenon independence, I can have my own mind. I can do what I want to do if it's the same thing. It's just a different angle your sisters onto something there that's another angle.

343
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.080
Great.

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you bet. You should just let you should just let Scott Campbell. This one you, you're going to get overwhelmed.

348
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But

349
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.810
Cynthia We: Boy, I don't get. I can handle shit.

350
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.240

355
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.610
Cynthia We: It is

356
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be a part of it. You get to, you know, there are some families. There's no talking between them. The kids aren't even with their parents at all. This is a chance for you to share your personal you've got you've got literally books that you're writing about this stuff.

357
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you should share them with them.

358
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You still struggle with this concept today with how do I take what I want right now.

359
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Take the beat.

360
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it through.

361
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Does this match, who I want to be five years from now, a year from now 24 hours from now. Does it match. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do this thing.

362
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still going at aren't you

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.630
Cynthia We: part of speech.

366
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:21.510
Cynthia We: It's really for me not to have video because I'm a I noticed that I not a lot or or. Yeah, it's good to

367
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.370
Cynthia We: Not be able to for you to be able to see

368
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.520
Cynthia We: It's just different than

369
00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not improving the audio that much anyway you can put it

370
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right back

371
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You can put it back.

372
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.650
Cynthia We: So,

373
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.450
Cynthia We: I'm totally annoyed with Xfinity

374
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we can just take it in. Even in its clunky state.

375
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So why we're still here. We're doing you got you got stuff.

376
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's still getting over there to you. What if the other minute complete I was the screen goes all the way, but you're, you're still getting information you're still getting it.

377
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend some time and track through nice slow be

378
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: See what settling in for you, Cindy with what we did here today.

379
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.900
Cynthia We: I'm that I

380
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.930
Cynthia We: Have a habit of deferring to

381
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.750
Cynthia We: You for thank you for that. My mother.

382
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.640
Cynthia We: Me or if I if she

383
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.650
Cynthia We: If she realized how often do that.

384
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.380
Cynthia We: I'm

385
00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:02.070
Cynthia We: Because he raised my sister and I have to think of, you know, to be strong women to not

386
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:12.270
Cynthia We: To not delete. We needed a man to take your boss or any of that. And I come, the fact that I lose myself.

387
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.720
Cynthia We: I abandoned. Um, what I will leave it is

388
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.670
Cynthia We: Yeah differ.

389
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.230
Cynthia We: Now disappoint her, she would

390
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.900
Cynthia We: But it disappoints me

391
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.100
Cynthia We: So I'm going to do differently this time I'm

392
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:49.290
Cynthia We: I'd like to talk to him about peer pressure and how hard it is, and

393
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:51.840
Cynthia We: I'm

394
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How normal he's right on time.

395
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.360
Yeah.

396
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And so are you right on time. This is when I come in so nice and my parents kick the shit out of me emotionally right at this age, instead of

397
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking to me like this the way I am giving this love to you and this information. I didn't get it like this. I was shamed punished and discipline so harshly.

398
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to repeat that pattern. I love you taken your right on time.

399
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And whatever angle, whether it's your therapist or your auntie, or it's me. Let's Dad, I love you.

400
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Those words in text don't reflect the person I know.

401
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this you, are you testing something out. Is there some other piece, what's going on here. What's interesting to you, you can come at it from any old angle, you've got time.

402
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Matter from sisters angle your angle Michael his angle, years ago, whatever. We don't know. He's not a bad boy.

403
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.090
Cynthia We: No. Right.

404
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were not a bad girl.

405
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Give what you didn't get

406
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:23.550
Cynthia We: Shock

407
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:29.220
Cynthia We: shock value of saying things like that.

408
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.390
Cynthia We: Think that there's there's

409
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:49.920
Cynthia We: We all just want to fit in and maybe he feels like this helps. I guess he did say that I'm Scott talked to him a little bit today and to get accused of reading is text.

410
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Deflection don't get

411
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.430
Cynthia We: Distracted

412
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: By that don't literally don't even say a word.

413
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.570
Cynthia We: If you happy. OK.

414
00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I can son, I can apologize for that later. But can we just focus on the content of those tags for a minute. And yes, I will get into invasion of privacy in my role as a parent, we put a pin that

415
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you baby but just give me 10 minutes and let's just focus on content and see how it relates to your development and

416
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.790
Cynthia We: He said that he joy and joy, the chat room.

417
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That he Teagan

418
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:32.460
Cynthia We: Chat room, he was invited to join the chat room of these on this platform.

419
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.530
Cynthia We: And gains.

420
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.950
Cynthia We: And it was too upsetting for him. So he

421
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.630
Cynthia We: You know one way. He didn't join it again.

422
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:43.500
Okay.

423
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Good news.

424
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.070
Cynthia We: That is great news.

425
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.400
Cynthia We: At least it

426
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.240
Cynthia We: So Gary, that you can get into all this

427
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.030
Cynthia We: No man or no hair there.

428
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then need it. We go investigate. Maybe we need a little bit if they can't regulate if we're not busy sort of empowering them with their assertiveness, which your son has, has it.

429
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe we need some parental controls, although kids are so much smarter than us. They'll find a

430
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.260
Cynthia We: workaround. And this will app is a control, but it's it's the country.

431
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:40.770
Cynthia We: Right. Tina major right so you should its core discourse, the name of it and kids use it. Other instead of zoom interface. Uh huh.

432
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.150
Cynthia We: And

433
00:45:43.350 --> 00:46:00.090
Cynthia We: But then there's all this other stuff that you can get into. Try and porn just telling it you're 18 so the the controls that your parents computer or on your phone are irrelevant because you're in an app that allows you to get there. It's terrifying.

434
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:01.620
