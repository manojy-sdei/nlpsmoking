00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.560
Dr. Figg: You see, you know, all of our sessions we record, just so that we can take our nuts and otherwise they stay

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.550
Alex’s iPhone: Well, so I just joined this new insurance and

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.850
Alex’s iPhone: I instantly started looking for intensive outpatient programs to

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.250
Alex’s iPhone: Try and

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.240

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.690
Alex’s iPhone: Though I have been using pretty significantly. For the past, I'd say maybe two years.

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:26.130
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah, and it's been a huge obstruction for everything in my life and every relationship and everything. And I'm just trying to find a program. And, you know, some way to get through it.

17
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.980
Dr. Figg: Okay. All right.

18
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:39.390
Dr. Figg: You talked about that. It's getting in the way of stuff relationships. Is it bothering your ability to hold a job.

19
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:53.700
Alex’s iPhone: He. I mean, yeah. So essentially, I just, I, I had been holding down this job for about a year and I just had to resign from it pretty much because of this okay though. Yeah, kind of saying

20
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.490
Dr. Figg: Okay, so you talked about. It's been worse in the past two years. When did you start using opiates.

21
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.290
Alex’s iPhone: Or

22
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:13.110
Alex’s iPhone: Two years ago, when I got into a relationship with somebody and I was just so infatuated with them. I honestly didn't even think anything of

23
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.920
Alex’s iPhone: Any sort of usage, because I've never really like dealt with addiction before like addiction to like an actual substance like like that. So I don't think it, I kind of thought.

24
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.470
Alex’s iPhone: I think that I thought that I was like about that. I didn't have to worry about it. But it crept up on me pretty fucking hard and

25
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.700
Dr. Figg: What have you been using

26
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.530
Alex’s iPhone: Heroin

27
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.440

Dr. Figg: Okay. Okay. Any other ways.

30
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.340
Alex’s iPhone: No, no, I'm I'm I'm horrified of needles. So I would never, I would never do that. But

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.370
Alex’s iPhone: In smoking a lot though.

32
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.910
Dr. Figg: And did you visit heroin, you started with two years ago.

33
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080
Alex’s iPhone: It was actually oxy cotton but heroin was a lot cheaper.

34
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.230
Dr. Figg: Okay and. Were you smoking oxy cotton.

35
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.370

Dr. Figg: In the way or amount that you use.

39
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.390
Alex’s iPhone: It's only dying worse, honestly.

40
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.700
Alex’s iPhone: It my habit probably cost me around $1,000 a week now.

41
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.780
Dr. Figg: Wow, that's really expensive.

42
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.910

43
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.870
Dr. Figg: Okay, if

48
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.530
Dr. Figg: To cost you about $1,000 a week. How many hours do you spend in a day, either using or trying to get it.

49
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.330
Oh god.

50
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.080
Alex’s iPhone: Way more than I want to probably anywhere from like one to five, if I'm being honest, like some days it takes a long time. I gotta

51
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:20.940
Alex’s iPhone: Take Bart out an hour somewhere and then fucking walk somewhere else and then do all this shit and some days only takes an hour but way more of my time than I ever like to admit, honestly. All right.

52
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.550
Dr. Figg: Have you had any health problems related to use

53
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.080
Alex’s iPhone: No, I haven't.

54
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.230

Alex’s iPhone: Yeah, yep, there were times when I like couldn't get it and stuff. And yeah.

58
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.540
Dr. Figg: After. How about how long do you go into withdrawal.

59
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.640
Alex’s iPhone: How long does it take about 24 hours and then I can't even stand. Okay.

60
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.830
Dr. Figg: And tell me about your withdrawal. What kind of things do you feel what happens

65
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:53.490
Alex’s iPhone: It's just, it's it's horrible. I pretty much do anything to get out of it. And that's what I realized about my own mentality. Like if when I'm sitting here and I have no money, my brains to try to calculate ways to try and get something to like get through it and

66
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.330

75
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.210
Alex’s iPhone: And they're all every all of that is it's all fixed now.

76
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.400
Alex’s iPhone: Like I did all my court sessions party service all that shit I'm

77
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.170
Dr. Figg: Asking because I'm not the police, I'm not reporting anyone. I'm just trying to understand how this affects you.

Alex’s iPhone: In my immediate family, no. Okay. All right.

92
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.060
Dr. Figg: Are you still in that relationship that you talked about that you were you started

93
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.310
Alex’s iPhone: You know, okay, all right.

94
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.060
Dr. Figg: And

95
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.460
Let's see.

96
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.890
Dr. Figg: What kind of gone

97
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.840
Alex’s iPhone: Sorry.

98
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.310

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.700
Alex’s iPhone: I was server a business or for seven years.

100
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.280
Dr. Figg: Okay, all right, server at a restaurant. Okay. All right. And do you drink any alcohol.

101
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.390
Alex’s iPhone: Very minimal. I've never really been a drinker.

102
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.720
Alex’s iPhone: So no, not really. Okay.

103
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.940
Dr. Figg: Have you ever had problems with alcohol in the past.

104
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.630
No.

105
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:26.190
Dr. Figg: And by a by law. I'm required to pull a state prescription database and controlled substances, when we, when we do things like this. So I see back in last year early last year. All right, about a year ago, it looks like your tree with Adderall.

106
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.320
Alex’s iPhone: Oh yeah. Yep. I have a I was shooting with Adderall and Xanax

107
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.560
Alex’s iPhone: I have like

108
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.180
Dr. Figg: mixing that with the heroin.

109
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.070
Alex’s iPhone: Oh, no.

110
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.590
Dr. Figg: No I misunderstood you that I apologize.

111
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.330
Alex’s iPhone: No, no, I wasn't mixing those I did have prescriptions. I don't. Was it

112
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.350
Alex’s iPhone: Feels like it was more than a year ago, but um

113
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.920
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah, no, I never, I never really like

114
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.310
Alex’s iPhone: Mixed anything. Though honestly to me. Those are just like those are really just medicines, because

115
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.250
Alex’s iPhone: I mean, if I take something like Xanax, it just gets me to a place where I can like function.

116
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:23.070
Alex’s iPhone: As opposed to like a normal person who is already like leveled out if they take it and like kind of brings them down a little bit me. I'm like, I have such high anxiety that if I take Xanax, or if I like anything like that. It just, it just makes me functional

117
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.050
Alex’s iPhone: Sounds

118
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.610
Alex’s iPhone: Good, yeah. Sorry.

119
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.530
Dr. Figg: Are you still taking damage.

120
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.550
Alex’s iPhone: No. Nope.

121
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.180
Dr. Figg: So, and have you ever taken Suboxone or buprenorphine before

122
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.690
Alex’s iPhone: I have. I've taken Suboxone before. I've never had a prescription for it, but I've taken it before.

123
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.600
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah.

124
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.380
Dr. Figg: Tell me, tell me about in the past when you use Suboxone

125
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.640
Alex’s iPhone: Usually it's, you know, when I when I couldn't get my hands on something.

126
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.370
Alex’s iPhone: It.

127
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:18.960
Alex’s iPhone: It definitely definitely helped the whole situation like it definitely made the withdrawal symptoms like a little bit less intense and just kind of

128
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.600
Alex’s iPhone: Help through. I think maybe

129
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:35.190
Alex’s iPhone: Maybe like three or four times I've like really tried to kick this and get clean and I've like I've white knuckled it before and I think I've used Suboxone like three times trying to do it and just without that like

130
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.990
Alex’s iPhone: That's kind of why I was looking for, like, a group or something like that, that it was like a little more support than just

131
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.260
Alex’s iPhone: Being able to get some Suboxone

132
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.150
Alex’s iPhone: So it definitely helped

133
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.450
Alex’s iPhone: I mean, I can't really think of any other option is to how to get through this. So,

134
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.660
Dr. Figg: Um, have you ever been to, or thought of going to an A or a meetings.

135
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.880
Alex’s iPhone: Um,

136
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:15.870
Alex’s iPhone: I have never been, I've never been to an NA NA meeting and no I guess I've never really thought about it because I've never really

137
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.790
Alex’s iPhone: Tried sobriety. Like, if that makes any sense. Okay.

138
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.740
Dr. Figg: And you said in the past, a few times you've tried to stop and white knuckle

139
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.580
Alex’s iPhone: I take it that means right. I'm sorry.

140
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.920
Dr. Figg: That you quit cold turkey, you just start

141
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.940
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

142
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.140
Dr. Figg: Where you ran out and decided I'm going to use this as an opportunity to quit.

143
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.930
Dr. Figg: Pretty much. Okay. All right. But you haven't previously been in any kind of treatment or recovery programs.

144
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.710
Know,

145
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.130
Dr. Figg: Just making sure I understand. Okay, so

146
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.520
Dr. Figg: Let's talk about Suboxone because that's the primary medicine that we use to help people with this.

147
00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:04.140
Dr. Figg: When we think about opiates like heroin. We. Those are called full agonist opiates, which means the effects that they have on your brain. It's like flipping a switch all the way on

148
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.840
Dr. Figg: The things that they cause, the cause pleasure and a reinforcement of the desire to seek that pleasure. That's the higher the euphoria.

149
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:19.530
Dr. Figg: They decrease pain they decrease your wakefulness your consciousness. They can knock you out if you take enough and they can stop your breathing. If you take enough. Those are the four things that we care about.

150
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.630
Dr. Figg: And as you take more and more heroin that effect is more and more. It's terms that all the way on a one to one.

151
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:36.270
Dr. Figg: So bottom we use because it's a safer medication is a what we call a partial agonist, which means it flipped those switches partway instead of all the way

152
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:47.730
Dr. Figg: So because it doesn't flip that pleasure switch all the way it will stop the withdrawal, but it won't tend to have a high that people get with other things like heroin or morphine or something else.

153
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:57.150
Dr. Figg: It is a pain reliever. So we use it for pain sometimes, although it's not quite to the extent that morphine or something like that is a pain reliever.

154
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:08.730
Dr. Figg: It does not turn off your consciousness quite the way heroin or something like that does so it doesn't tend to not people out and it has a ceiling effect, beyond which more does not do anything.

155
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:17.370
Dr. Figg: So it's very, very difficult to overdose on which means it won't stop raining. So it's a safer medication that aspect, but the most important things

156
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.180
Alex’s iPhone: It will stop.

157
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:18.990
With all

158
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.730
Dr. Figg: The take buprenorphine when it attaches to the receptor in your brain. It holds on tighter than other things do.

159
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:34.500
Dr. Figg: And what that means is if you're already on Suboxone. I mean, you take something else like heroin, the heroin will come along and it won't be able to have the effect

160
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:47.370
Dr. Figg: Because the Suboxone is already there and the heroin will kick it out helps block the effect of the things that people have been using in the past, which helps decrease those addictive behaviors, because sometimes we see

161
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:58.230
Dr. Figg: Occidental College clean their room and find something and go, well, I'm going to go ahead and use that. And the nice thing about Suboxone is that even if they take that you won't have

162
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.870
Dr. Figg: To reinforce that behavior.

163
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.960
Alex’s iPhone: So yeah, honestly. So, so

164
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:10.890
Alex’s iPhone: The one big difference, I think, is the difference between Suboxone and sub sub you text or whatever.

165
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:24.540
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah, so I was definitely looking to get some boxing because like the strips, because I know that, again, like you just said that if I'm having a weak moment and I go and try to use it won't work.

166
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.040
Dr. Figg: Right, yes, which

167
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:36.000
Alex’s iPhone: Which is a huge plus for me because honestly, I mean so much so, my friends, whenever I've been able to get when I say Suboxone I mean step you text, pretty much.

168
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:44.460
Alex’s iPhone: Essentially it like if I have a weak moment and I go use it'll still work so

169
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.130
Alex’s iPhone: Kind of trying to like

170
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.790
Alex’s iPhone: play against that, if that makes any sense.

171
00:14:51.180 --> 00:15:01.920
Dr. Figg: So there's more than one. There's the physical dependence on opiates. There's also the social and the behavioral aspects of it. And so that's why we're going to talk about some workers as well but

172
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:11.400
Dr. Figg: Suboxone, it has to medications and buprenorphine which is the opiate that blocks the action of other things that stops a withdrawal.

173
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:19.920
Dr. Figg: And then it's also gotten a lot. So, in which is an abuse deterrent. So you've taken it before so they understand that these things have to be dissolved under your tongue. Yeah.

174
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:28.950
Dr. Figg: And you dissolve them under your tongue, you get to buprenorphine through the veins under your tongue, and it's well absorbed and you don't get the no locks on which would put you into withdrawal. If you've got it.

175
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:38.760
Dr. Figg: But if you melted crush it shoot it snorted smoke and take it some other way that you're not supposed to, you end up getting a whole bunch of the locks on which puts you into withdrawal.

176
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:48.540
Dr. Figg: So, it prevents people from misusing the medications and we use Suboxone the combination for people with a history of addiction, because it does help promote their recover.

177
00:15:51.330 --> 00:16:04.590
Dr. Figg: If you swallow the film or if you chew up the tablet and swallow it. You really either either medication, you don't get any of either medications. So it's like taking nothing. I just want you to understand the medication works.

178
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.810
So it doesn't fall under the tongue.

179
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.340
Dr. Figg: You're taking up to two grams of heroin. How much Suboxone did you use in the past when you took it.

180
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.740
Alex’s iPhone: Honestly, I mean whatever I could get my hands on.

181
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:26.550
Alex’s iPhone: Usually, that'd be like a strip a day, at the very least, with the amount that I use.

182
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.800
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, yeah. I mean, if

183
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.510
Alex’s iPhone: You're

184
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.980
Dr. Figg: Taking two and three scripts today.

185
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.450
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah, probably.

186
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:37.950
Dr. Figg: You were or no.

187
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.180
Alex’s iPhone: No, I mean, most likely, yeah. That mean that's probably what's going to help like to two strips. I mean,

188
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.100
Alex’s iPhone: Most likely

189
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:59.340
Dr. Figg: So it's not there because Suboxone works differently than other opiates. There's not a calculator. I can use to go, you are using this much. This is going to be the right dose. It's very in

190
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:06.870
Dr. Figg: The correct dose when we're trying to help promote your recovery is that it's high enough that you're not in withdrawal.

191
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:18.420
Dr. Figg: And you're not having cravings to use other things and it's low enough that you're not having side effects from the medication itself because it's a medication as they can have side effects, just like any other medication.

192
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:31.710
Dr. Figg: The main side effects that we see from Suboxone are the same side effects that we'd see with taking too much of other opiates, so it can cause abdominal pain, Niger drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, things like that.

193
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:40.320
Dr. Figg: Okay, we don't want you to the side effects, but we want the dose to be high enough that it helps prevent you from feeling like you need anything else.

194
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.510
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, yeah.

195
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:50.280
Dr. Figg: Let's talk about the way quite hard work. So we are recovery Promotion Program where recovery program, not just an addiction treatment program.

196
00:17:51.210 --> 00:18:03.660
Dr. Figg: We are centered around weekly support groups. So we put you into a group. It's kind of like an NA or a meeting with other people who have had similar issues and are at various stages in their recovery.

197
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:12.510
Dr. Figg: It's about an hour long meets the same time every week it's led by a therapist or counselor who has a history and addiction treatment.

198
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:23.190
Dr. Figg: And there's usually some kind of topic about relapse rule engine or stress management or coping skills or spirituality or something along those lines that help people.

199
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:30.120
Dr. Figg: In their recovery and every meeting starts with a check in with the doctor to make sure that

200
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:37.890
Dr. Figg: You are on the right dose, you're not having side effects, you're not having cravings. If your questions are answered that you have enough medication.

201
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:51.390
Dr. Figg: And some people are in various stages of tapering if they've been, you know, stable in recovery. And so, you know, checking in with the doctor to manage things like that. Does that all make sense. Yep. Cool.

202
00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:00.330
Dr. Figg: So that's the way Brian heart works. So we would we would find a time in the week for one of our support groups that works for you.

203
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.850
Dr. Figg: And

204
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:14.310
Dr. Figg: My schedule. I have openings in my Tuesday 3pm or Thursday 3pm groups with one of those times work well.

205
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.320
Alex’s iPhone: Are there any ones that are a little bit earlier, by any chance,

206
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.260
Dr. Figg: I don't, but other doctors mine.

207
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.110
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, alright. No worries. I mean, I'll

208
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.880
Alex’s iPhone: I'll deal with it. What would you say Tuesday and Thursday.

209
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.560
Dr. Figg: Tuesday or Thursday at 3pm.

210
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.570
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, apply do Tuesday.

211
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.490
Dr. Figg: Tuesday at 3pm work well for

212
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.620
Alex’s iPhone: Yeah okay well

213
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:52.650
Dr. Figg: Sometimes life circumstances change people change jobs or move or something like that. And if we, you know, if you in the future needs to change which group you're in because of life circumstances change. That's okay.

214
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.550
Alex’s iPhone: Well, that

215
00:19:53.730 --> 00:20:06.990
Dr. Figg: Nothing's permanent like that. Just, just say no. But let's start with the Tuesday 3pm. Okay. Um, you have then 24 hours since your last use and you're starting to go into withdrawal.

216
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:15.150
Dr. Figg: It's important to talk about when you take Suboxone you need to be in some level of withdrawal because like I said, it grabs hold of that.

217
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:27.450
Dr. Figg: Tighter, which means if there's anything in your system, it will kick it out and put you into a much worse withdrawal. It's called precipitated withdrawal and we don't want that to happen. We want you to feel better and not being which are all which takes a boxer

218
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.190
Dr. Figg: So I think we're in that situation where it's going to work well for you right now.

219
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.520
Dr. Figg: What we're going to do is let's make sure we have a current pharmacy for

220
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.370
Dr. Figg: I have a CVS on Bancroft road, is that correct for you.

221
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.930
Alex’s iPhone: Yep. Great.

222
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:55.170
Dr. Figg: So what we're gonna do is we're going to start you a low dose, you're going to, it's going to be an eight milligram film or tablet on both

223
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:02.550
Dr. Figg: Suboxone is the brand name. There's a generic of it becomes as a tablet. Which one gets dispense

224
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.600
Dr. Figg: Pretty much depends entirely on your insurance and what they'll pay for

225
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.860
Alex’s iPhone: About it.

226
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:14.940
Dr. Figg: So all right, I'll write the script. If you prefer the film's over the tablets. I'll write the script that way, but

227
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:22.890
Dr. Figg: We don't pay for the brand name. We only pay for the generic, you're going to want to let them for cost issues dispense the generic

228
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.230
Alex’s iPhone: About it, since it's very expensive medication, unfortunately. Okay. All right.

229
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.520
Dr. Figg: What you're going to do is you're going to start with half of the tablet or film.

230
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.350
Dr. Figg: To dissolve on your tongue, because like I said, there's not a perfect conversion from what you were taking to what you need. You're going to start half

231
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:49.650
Dr. Figg: You're going to take that let it dissolve it takes about 510 minutes to fully this all we don't eat, drink or smoke for 10 to 15 minutes afterwards. So make sure you absorb the medication.

232
00:21:51.270 --> 00:22:08.250
Dr. Figg: That wait at least an hour to evaluate. Do I feel better and my still having withdrawal symptoms. If you feel better and stop. That was the dose that you needed to get you out of withdrawal and maintain you out of the draw, if you still feel bad. Then you take another half

233
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.090
Okay.

234
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:19.830
Dr. Figg: And then you wait another hour use about read again you know in my soul. Draw or do I feel better, up to a maximum of one and a half tablets or strips.

235
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.820
On the first day.

236
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:37.080
Dr. Figg: You should have gotten an email from our care coordinator has an induction protocol that's very nice and has pictures to you know make things simple and straightforward. So there's no confusion about the way we slowly go up on us. Okay.

237
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.700
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, well,

238
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.830
Dr. Figg: But so I just want to make sure you understand. Start with a low dose, because just because you were taking more heroin differently.

239
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.340
Alex’s iPhone: Okay. Alright, cool.

240
00:22:51.210 --> 00:23:01.590
Dr. Figg: Alright, that I think is we have a group for you. We're going to send your prescription right now for your medication, so that we can get you out to start feeling better.

241
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.690
Dr. Figg: Prescription right now. I encourage you to wait at least an hour.

242
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:20.490
Dr. Figg: And then call the pharmacy and find out if they were able to fill it. Because sometimes they're going to go, Oh, no, we need a forum for the insurance or whatever or we don't have the medication or something like that. If you there was some issue.

243
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.600
Dr. Figg: Virtual clinic, which is who you talked to before me.

244
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:31.110
Dr. Figg: Okay, my desk, have a medical office right they're going to be able to solve the overwhelming majority of issues.

245
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:40.440
Dr. Figg: Anything that I have to take care of don't relate to me. But if you have issues getting the medication, please call them right away so that we can work on it. Oh.

246
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.100
Alex’s iPhone: Ok, ok. Okay.

247
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.890
Dr. Figg: Alright, cool. That's all I had. Alex What, what questions or concerns you have right now.

248
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:54.540
Alex’s iPhone: No, that's I'm just, I'm just looking to get started. That's it. Okay.

249
00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:08.400
Dr. Figg: I'm going to issue your prescription. We're going to look for you next Tuesday at 3pm. You're going to call the virtual clinic about 20 minutes before three okay and and they'll give you the number changes every week. So don't give you the numbers.

250
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.610
Alex’s iPhone: So the group is also virtual yes and

251
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.430
Dr. Figg: Yeah, we do all the, all of our stuff through zoom like this.

252
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.830
Alex’s iPhone: Okay, okay. Yeah.

253
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.440
Dr. Figg: Does that make sense will not work okay for you.

254
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.750
Alex’s iPhone: Yep. That makes perfect sense. Oh.

255
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:29.970
Dr. Figg: All right, good. All right, I'm an issue, your prescription. Let us know if you have any issues and we'll do our best to work with you will look for you at 3pm next Tuesday. Okay.

256
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.200
Alex’s iPhone: Thank you so much.

257
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.240
Dr. Figg: Alex, it was nice to meet you there. You take care

258
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.260
Alex’s iPhone: Bye bye.

259
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:46.530
Dr. Figg: All right, and I pulled his Jewish report during the visit and reviewed it with him and he had prescriptions for Xanax and

260
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:55.170
Dr. Figg: And condemning compound which is I probably Adderall or Ritalin know probably our last year, about a year ago.

261
00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:06.060
Dr. Figg: And then I reviewed his as am an Esper questionnaires and she has turned for addiction addictive behaviors, but not for alcohol or other things right now.

262
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:16.800
Dr. Figg: He's going to be in a 3pm of the abuse disorder on Tuesday group on Tuesday, and I'm going to issue him a prescription for Suboxone like now.

263
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:25.290
Dr. Figg: And he had a normal mental status exam. He was in a dark room and had his hood on

264
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:32.490
Dr. Figg: Which probably is because the lights are hurting us is because he's in the beginning stages of withdrawal.

265
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.900
And he was restless during the

266
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.220
Interview. He kept getting up in the morning here.

267
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.100
Dr. Figg: So the restlessness should be under Melanie honest mental status.
