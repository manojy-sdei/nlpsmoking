63
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.620
Ashley Martin: 29 because I'm 31 now.

64
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:14.040
Ashley Martin: And in that time frame. I had three kids and I just got tired of looking at them with not having nothing because of me.

65
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:23.490
Ashley Martin: So I changed. I changed everything. I went into treatment. I was never inpatient treatment because I couldn't leave them.

66
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.090
Ashley Martin: So I just went to outpatient treatment first started off, I started off with

67
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:47.760
Ashley Martin: Go in four times a week, down to three down to three times a week. I did at first it was 333 hour sessions of group counseling with other people.

Ashley Martin: And then I went down to just here recently to just me and my boyfriend and and counseling meeting together because we we got sober together, we met. I was 23 when I met him. And that's when he caught me at the worst time of my life.

69
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:20.310
Ashley Martin: Because that's where I started using heroin and I just, I kind of fed off him because he was a recovering heroin addict. So I kind of pushed him back into the lifestyle.

70
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:27.990
Ashley Martin: And when we finally got fed up. We had two kids together when we finally got fed up.

71
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.820
Ashley Martin: It was him first. And he's like, we need to do this and it's just been an on March. Since then, we've done
