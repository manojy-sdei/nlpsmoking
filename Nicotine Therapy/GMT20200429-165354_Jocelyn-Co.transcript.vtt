Cynthia We: And more art projects.

63
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.720

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.380
Cynthia We: While you're talking about what's working because

65
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.970

Cynthia We: taking classes online, but it's nothing.

69
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Compared to compared to the classroom.

70
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.010
Cynthia We: Yeah, it really feels. Um, and you really have to sit with the younger one to make sure she's doing it. So it's a lot more work.

71
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.940
Cynthia We: I'm used to having that block time where I just right.

72
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.580
Cynthia We: And and and work on this book. I'm trying to get out the door.

73
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.180
Jocelyn Corrales: I know you you right

74
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.680
Cynthia We: Or you read that.

75
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.140
Jocelyn Corrales: I right. Oh, that's good.

76
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.350
Cynthia We: I have a book. I have a book that I've been I'm done. I'm done with it. I'm editing it

77
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.790
Cynthia We: And I'm gonna my next step is to find an agent.

78
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Okay, you're right, the build. And you also write doing art.

79
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:26.670
Cynthia We: Um, yes, we're doing the kids and I do art together. Wow, are usually but it's our. It makes me feel good. Oh.

80
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.420
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine.

81
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.420
Jocelyn Corrales: So let me see some of your art maybe when we see next time probably in the next. Okay.

82
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, all right. I think

83
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.370
Cynthia We: Will be cute like that I did with them.

84
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, that's, that's how scary and regards to waking up. What time do you usually wake up.

85
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.480
Cynthia We: I'm not working right now because I feel like I have been getting up at a lot

86
00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:00.180
Cynthia We: Um, because I've been going to bed really late and a part of this is just

87
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.240
Cynthia We: It's just backwards.

88
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.620
Cynthia We: And and

89
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.920
Cynthia We: This like one of the things I really love when the kids are in school is that I have to go to bed early

90
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.020
Cynthia We: And I have to know. Yeah, once I'm up I stay up I don't go back to that so

91
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.200
Cynthia We: Uh huh. I'm really struggling right now.

92
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:27.180
Jocelyn Corrales: So you should right now. You should wake up since last March, you usually wake up at around 11am

93
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Man Yes, and something because you also sleep very late.

94
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe we can put that together in the plan leader that

95
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.720
Jocelyn Corrales: set the alarm. Yes.

96
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Because I think this the reason why you also wake up late because you also sleep late so let's schedule on a time that

97
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:57.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Sleep earlier and let's set an alarm clock for you to wake up a little in your usual routine when there's a school, it's usually early

98
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.230
Jocelyn Corrales: But right now, because of current pandemic, you're unable to

99
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.310
Jocelyn Corrales: wake up early, so why not try let's set it up and you know

100
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Because of the current Pandemic How old is your youngest

101
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.530
Cynthia We: She's a, she's nine

102
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.390
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

103
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.190
Cynthia We: We get all up it even 930 would be acceptable to me. Yes.

104
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

105
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:24.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

106
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.660
Jocelyn Corrales: It's already late. But I think yes, nine o'clock.

107
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.920
Or 930 so yeah

108
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:43.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. And maybe you could start at 930 because she told me that you're, you know, although they're meeting online for classes. There's also, you know, there's also a need for you to support or supplement their education, like homeschooling you know

109
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so do you have to also set up their time. So not only you, so also your kids.

110
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.160
Jocelyn Corrales: So that they also wake up.

111
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Early and give them some worksheets to work on in the morning.

112
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. So that you could help them.

113
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:08.460
Jocelyn Corrales: And so that your, you know, your day would also start early. You know, it's sometimes when you when you wake up early. It's like you feel like you're, you know,

114
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Tired already when you wake up early, or when you wake up late.

115
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.290
Cynthia We: Oh, when you wake up late.

116
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.220
Cynthia We: You feel tired.

117
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Already, yes.

118
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.980
Cynthia We: I totally agree with that. I know.

119
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.880
Jocelyn Corrales: You invited us. Yeah. Nobody feels have

120
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.920
Cynthia We: Like a

121
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:38.340
Cynthia We: It was a sick car psychiatrist. I saw, years and years ago and she really felt like that had a big, big hit a big role in people's mental health.

122
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.930
Cynthia We: Um, yeah, the time that they woke up.

123
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.510
Cynthia We: And I know is that time I was waking up at like one in the afternoon.

124
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:57.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, yeah, that's usually I don't know. I don't know what it probably it's you know something can in connection with the mental health or, you know,

125
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Our bodies when we try to wake up late.

126
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:10.500
Jocelyn Corrales: We feel tired, we feel lazy instead of working or instead of doing a lot of things for today, you're unable to do these things because you feel lazy.

127
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:25.830
Jocelyn Corrales: And you feel very tired your body feel so tired, something like that. So let's try to make it waking up early. Let's try to change your sleeping patterns. Try to wake up early in sleep, sleep early. So, what time do you usually sleep.

128
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.690
Cynthia We: Um, well, I try. I've been trying to go to bed with my husband, um,

129
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.670
Cynthia We: around midnight.

130
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:33.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Uh huh.

131
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.510
Cynthia We: Told me, but I cannot fall asleep until like four

132
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.910
Cynthia We: Oh, I'm laying there and bad part of that is

133
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:53.220
Cynthia We: Part of that I think is just, I don't know, part of it is like being stuck inside and maybe not getting enough exercise.

134
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.350
Cynthia We: Mm hmm. Um,

135
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.460
Cynthia We: But it's every night.

136
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Okay.

137
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.520
Cynthia We: Late every night, nobody else in the world is up Delhi.

138
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, is it usually because you think a lot

139
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah yeah

140
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:12.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

141
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.880
Cynthia We: Probably two months.

142
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe we could do some more meditation at night. Oh.

143
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.480
Cynthia We: Yeah.

144
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.690
Cynthia We: That's a good idea. And I i've been reading

145
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.430
Cynthia We: At night.

146
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:41.700
Jocelyn Corrales: And that there's nothing wrong with reading up tonight. But, you know, sometimes it's offense under reader, because sometimes instead of getting asleep when you are reading. It's actually, you know,

147
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.580
Cynthia We: I think if I started reading earlier like like I

148
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:56.730
Cynthia We: He likes to watch TV, but if I, I like to read before bed, and if I started reading earlier like when Lola knows

149
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.750
Cynthia We: That I think I would have an easier time

150
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.820
Jocelyn Corrales: That would be better instead of a reading late you can read earlier.

151
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.750
Yeah.

152
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.180
Cynthia We: Because she goes, she's going about it like nine

153
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:12.900
Mm hmm.

154
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.370
Cynthia We: Yeah, if you wake up at 11 you really feel like you don't accomplish very much if you go to bed at night.

155
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:24.690
Cynthia We: Yeah.

156
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.310
Jocelyn Corrales: That's true, maybe working out, we

157
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:43.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's try working out, we'd sweeping up early, so that you'll be able to wake up early, because you know that's true because you wake because you sleep very late. That's four o'clock and, you know,

158
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.100
Jocelyn Corrales: If you try to if you sleep at four o'clock, and you wake up at around nine you, you would still feel tired because you know you lack sleep.

159
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, maybe you start working on sleeping early so that

160
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.930
Jocelyn Corrales: After that,

161
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.880
Jocelyn Corrales: We could, you know,

162
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.900
Jocelyn Corrales: When you're able to do that. You could set an alarm, you know,

163
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Every morning to wake up early.

164
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:14.700
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe we could start with, you know, yeah that's good also reading earlier so that you'll be able to sleep at night or year or we could do some meditation or relaxation

165
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.400
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think both of those things would be

166
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:24.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and you know you have mentioned to me that you used to work out a lot, what have you. Do you have a yoga mat, who

167
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.590
Cynthia We: I do

168
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.660
Cynthia We: Not actually Santa Fe yoga is offering free yoga classes.

169
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:39.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, why not try doing yoga instead of working out, you know, instead of working out, you know, you're not able to go to gym. Why not start doing yoga.

170
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Yoga is another example.

171
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:43.650
Cynthia We: Of

172
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.010
Cynthia We: It and it's good to go anywhere.

173
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:59.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and it's actually sometimes after yoga. You know you even doing 30 minutes of yoga. It's already you know sometimes diary, you don't. Sometimes you don't realize you're already sleeping in a yoga mat.

174
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.480
Oh,

175
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.150
Cynthia We: Really

176
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Just around 15 to 30 minutes in a day.

177
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.970
Cynthia We: Oh, that's great.

178
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:19.770
Jocelyn Corrales: When I have time, but I usually try to do it every day. But there are times I miss around one or twice a week, but I try to know. He just started doing yoga, you know,

179
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:30.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh yeah, as well. Yeah. And you know what, I feel a lot better and I feel a lot, you know, active compared to not doing exercise at all.

180
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.460
Cynthia We: You know, um, I just

181
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.120
Cynthia We: Say, oh I just I order Yoga Journal

182
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.910
Cynthia We: Like I actually get the magazine Yoga Journal and I've never

183
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.290
Cynthia We: Ordered it and I thought well

184
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.150
Jocelyn Corrales: So you had that a long time already.

185
00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:58.680
Cynthia We: Yeah.

186
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.720
Jocelyn Corrales: I think now is the right time, you have

187
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.660
Jocelyn Corrales: To check it out. Yeah.

188
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.650
Cynthia We: You're out the just go for it. Okay.

189
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:20.250
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good, that's great. Okay, so you sleep late you wake up late. We because to how you eat. Are you able to eat on time.

190
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:27.690
Cynthia We: Um I this is like a thing I focus on because I

191
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:48.180
Cynthia We: I always forget about eating and then I'm cranky. And I know that this is something that leads to relapse and like a whole bunch of unhealthy behaviors that start to snowball so um I try really really focus on eating.

192
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.790
Cynthia We: lunch, dinner, and I have, I have a breakfast like

193
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.410
Cynthia We: A shake for breakfast.

194
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.890
Cynthia We: Hey, I'm a fruit shake with spinach.

195
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.960
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good, that's healthy

196
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:01.860
Yeah.

197
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.950
Jocelyn Corrales: And you try not to eat.

198
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.250
Jocelyn Corrales: junk foods or chips or crackers.

199
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, that's good.

200
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.780
Cynthia We: Like once a month I'll get

201
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.660
Cynthia We: Cravings and

202
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.060
Cynthia We: And then I will eat.

203
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Junk food.

204
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.570
Cynthia We: At night like you know the worst possible time I could do it just at night and like, I'm just a little bit.

205
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.670
Cynthia We: And then it never goes away. It's it lasts like maybe days, five days.

206
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:34.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

207
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.090
Jocelyn Corrales: It's fine if you're doing it.

208
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Rarely, but

209
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Not, not always, or occasionally but you know doing it.

210
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.100
Jocelyn Corrales: But not every day. Okay. So each time and make it a habit.

211
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.460
Jocelyn Corrales: To eat request to have shake

212
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.760
Cynthia We: For

213
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:00.420
Lunch.

214
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.140
Cynthia We: Lunch something little

215
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.760
Cynthia We: Dinner.

216
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.720
And dinner.

217
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, you're a vegetarian.

218
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.540
Jocelyn Corrales: And you cook.

219
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:17.970
Cynthia We: Yeah.

220
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.860
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

221
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.790
Jocelyn Corrales: So are you currently are you currently in pain or

222
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.770
Jocelyn Corrales: No pain at all. Okay.

223
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.890
Cynthia We: Yes, I did have a little bit of

224
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:35.340
Cynthia We: A little bit of a tumor in my hip that I've had since I was like 18

225
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.210
And

226
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:43.590
Cynthia We: I it every once in a while it feeling when I said everything my dog.

227
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.360
Cynthia We: I felt it and doctor said it was like it was a year ago. Exactly.

228
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.500
She said a blow.

229
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.410
Cynthia We: I, are you gardening.

230
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.000
Cynthia We: I was

231
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.850
Cynthia We: You know there are things that I do like gardening that that I that I've probably pretty rough on that.

232
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.500
Cynthia We: Huh uh

233
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:16.770
Cynthia We: I just don't realize that I did and that these things happen and you get to take, take a little, little easier.

234
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.550
Jocelyn Corrales: I think you're still doing gardening right now.

235
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.500
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, I just thought all my gardening stuff and I'm going to redo the whole you

236
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Can just know not too heavy about and

237
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.630
Jocelyn Corrales: I know, yeah.

238
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's why.

239
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.860
Cynthia We: I'm asking me, yeah.

240
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:46.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could do it on installment basis, you know, instead of doing it for a whole five hours or three hours doing it tried to eat, maybe an hour a day or two.

241
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.350
Jocelyn Corrales: One or two a day, not to not more than five hours. That's too much, maybe around and are they in

242
00:18:53.130 --> 00:19:08.220
Cynthia We: Your wise because I did realize a few times last year that like when I went to get up. If I was crouched down. I actually couldn't like my fears were frozen.

243
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.540
Jocelyn Corrales: In

244
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.290
Cynthia We: The old lady kind of stuff. It's weird.

245
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.340
Cynthia We: So, I take it, I asked for help. I asked me, and I'm

246
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, that's good.

247
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.300
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good that you're getting them involved.

248
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:35.820
Jocelyn Corrales: That's lovely. That's one. That's also one of a good activity for them to do in homeschooling they do that. I have a friend who homeschool sir children the spot on there, you know,

249
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:49.650
Jocelyn Corrales: doing chores. They. Yes, yes. They include the kids in doing the chores. So like for example, any in every choice that you do, you know, since their kids are not at school and they're just at home whole day probably

250
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.790
Jocelyn Corrales: If you do not have an online class, they're probably on their computers or

251
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Cell phones whole day.

252
00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:09.720
Jocelyn Corrales: So why not try you know it would be a, you know, it would be a meaningful experience, not only for you, but also for the kids, you know, try involving them in some, you know, some chores at home or gardening.

253
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it would you know it making try

254
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.010
Cynthia We: And help me plan because we got a bunch of seeds for friends and

255
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.970
Cynthia We: My oldest was really impressed with one of the one of the girls in class came up with a permaculture

256
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:30.540
Cynthia We: Exhibit I think was permaculture was how a different plants.

257
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.690
Cynthia We: Do one next to other planets.

258
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

259
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:44.430
Cynthia We: They each benefit from one another when they're planting next to each other. And so I was like oh well you could you could you could plan out. What we're going to plant with

260
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Yo, a map.

261
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.530
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, it's like planting different species on one

262
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.120
Jocelyn Corrales: One area and just checking out if they coexist with each other.

263
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

264
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.740
Jocelyn Corrales: It's just part of science.

265
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.090
Cynthia We: Yes.

266
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.710
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good because sometimes there are plants that do not you know when you try to plant them to each other. Sometimes, the other one is like grow.

267
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.590
Cynthia We: Yeah, totally takes all the

268
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.080
Cynthia We: Good stuff out of the soil or

269
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.120
Cynthia We: Yeah, as the rock.

270
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.920
Jocelyn Corrales: So yeah, sometimes there are some plants you know that the your ideal.

271
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Soil a CDT

272
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Or soil content. You know, it's

273
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Near very sensitive to that there's someplace where like that, so probably something like that so

274
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.020
Cynthia We: Some I think

275
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:39.870
Cynthia We: I planted grapes and strawberries over along the fence to die. And I think it's because don't get enough sun over there.

276
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.520
Jocelyn Corrales: It could be one. That's one of the recent probably sun.

277
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Or probably could be the

278
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.270
Jocelyn Corrales: It needs fertilizer.

279
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.400
Cynthia We: Yeah, that's a good point.

280
00:21:50.940 --> 00:22:06.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Or it could be the soil pH. Sometimes the acidity of the soil is not appropriate for a certain level, you could check out the CDC of the soil or the ideal SCD soil SCD before each for a particular plant that you try

281
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.310
Cynthia We: To do. Do you know

282
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:16.590
Cynthia We: Like how do you have to your soil to the office, get it tested or do they have home testing.

283
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.700
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm not sure if they have a home test kit.

284
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.370
Jocelyn Corrales: But they usually analyze it in a in a laboratory, you know,

285
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:38.520
Jocelyn Corrales: I have. Yeah, I have a cousin who is a plant pathologist and she's she studied agriculture. She's already a PhD in agriculture and that's, that's why I also learned a lot from her.

286
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:44.820
Jocelyn Corrales: We also learned a lot from her. Yeah, and you know it's something like, Why does it not go here. She would tell us maybe it's because

287
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.120
Jocelyn Corrales: It lacks we're probably it lacks fertilizer. Sometimes it's just that.

288
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.400
Jocelyn Corrales: It lacks nutrient nutrients.

289
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.840
Cynthia We: Sometimes it's never like

290
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.030
Cynthia We: The soil to and it makes it doesn't drain easily

291
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:05.490
Cynthia We: Yeah, and I didn't add a whole bunch last year when I when I added the grapes. So they hadn't, you know, add good stuff into it.

292
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.100
Cynthia We: I added a little bit, but probably not to not enough.

293
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:15.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Food could be could be. And I think grapes likes you know a lot of sun also

294
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.430
Cynthia We: Yes, yes.

295
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Why not try planting it on a sunny area.

296
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.230
Jocelyn Corrales: And Sunday, you're part of the garden.

297
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.830
Cynthia We: Fortunately, the trampoline in a way

298
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:28.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Take

299
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.970
Cynthia We: Sunny space so

300
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.640

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.360
Cynthia We: I'm in

336
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.830
Jocelyn Corrales: The kids have been God

337
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.620

339
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

340
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Not the only one I heard that from someone, someone else do

341
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.920
Jocelyn Corrales: It subset, you know,

342
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:27.840
Jocelyn Corrales: It's, you know, sometimes they would tell it's better to go at work than stay at home, you know, and there are times that they feel stressed because the keys are at home, you're not at school. So, you know, you get to see each other every day.

343
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.090
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know, you

344
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes

345
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:46.320
Jocelyn Corrales: It's, it's really, it's really stressful when you see each other every day because you know you're used to not see him every day and you know you got to adjust again. And it's, you know,

346
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:57.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Fighting each normal between husband and wife, as long as you pass it out after words in your good. Just make sure that you patch out things before you go to sleep.

347
00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, okay.

348
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:09.930
Jocelyn Corrales: And try to work out with each other, that's, you know, it's another adjustment and I know it's really crazy, especially the pandemic know that you get to see everyone every day 24 hours.

349
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.230
A day

350
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.160
Cynthia We: No one will ever complain about seeing

351
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Your family.

352
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.120
Good.

353
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:24.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and I think. Yeah, let's go through let's push through with that yoga and the meditation. Let's

354
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.650
Jocelyn Corrales: continue on with the meditation. Maybe that's the reason why you're unable to sleep early

355
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.210
Jocelyn Corrales: You're stressed out.

356
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.470
Maybe

357
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:39.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Key. So you mentioned that you're doing meditation. So, uh, do you consider yourself spiritual

358
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.510
Cynthia We: Uh, yeah, yeah.

359
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.520
Some

360
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you into any religious

361
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.440
Cynthia We: No, nothing in particular.

362
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.140
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not a Christian or something else.

363
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.770
Cynthia We: No, I think I when I was growing up.

364
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.680
Cynthia We: We went to

365
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.010
Cynthia We: The church.

366
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.690
Cynthia We: And then my babysitter.

367
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.270
Cynthia We: took us to the Congregational Church.

368
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.300
Cynthia We: And then my mom and dad started going when I was in high school. They started going to, um,

369
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.900
Cynthia We: Oh god, the hippie church. I can't remember the

370
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.320
Cynthia We: Name called the but they were really liberal

371
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Was really

372
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.870
Cynthia We: Saying that my mom and dad took us there.

373
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.950
Cynthia We: I can't remember. Anyway, so

374
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.960
Cynthia We: I never

375
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:38.970
Jocelyn Corrales: You never tried

376
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.170
Cynthia We: Yeah, I never

377
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.500
Cynthia We: Really thought about those we had, we had one of the hippie.

378
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:55.530
Cynthia We: Reverence come and do our wedding 20 years ago and I've thought about maybe going and taking the kids there but um I we know it's not a huge priority.

379
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.620
Cynthia We: organized religion is not a

380
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.030
Cynthia We: Priority I'd say

381
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.980
Jocelyn Corrales: That what you're thinking about it.

382
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.940
Cynthia We: Well, I think the difference, I think, spirituality is totally different than organized so

383
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.460
Cynthia We: Yes, I'm more spiritual than

384
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.230
Jocelyn Corrales: You could do some probably meditation and quiet reflection.

385
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Just like you're lucky are doing right now. Yeah.

386
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.390
Jocelyn Corrales: That's also getting in touch, you know, spiritually,

387
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:30.030
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, meditation and quiet reflection. But if you're a Christian or you're involved in a religious sect. You surely prayer.

388
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.340
Jocelyn Corrales: And yoga is also another

389
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Form of meditation. Right.

390
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:35.970
Cynthia We: Right.

391
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:47.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I'll put here your spiritual, but you're not religious, and you are practicing meditation.

392
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.960
Jocelyn Corrales: But are you are you doing meditation frequently

393
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.080
Cynthia We: I'm probably not as often as I should.

394
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.430
Cynthia We: I would like

395
00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:03.900
Cynthia We: I would like it to be an everyday saying, and I'd also like to yoga to be an everyday thing. So, um,

396
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.870
Cynthia We: I there, they kind of go together.

397
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:14.430
Cynthia We: So maybe I want. If I don't do yoga. One day I definitely be sure I meditate, so that I'm doing something every day.

398
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. I think

399
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.850
Cynthia We: That would be smart.

400
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:23.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I think that's good, too. Yeah, I think that's a good plan. Yeah.

401
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And it just for a

402
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.680
Cynthia We: Long time

403
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:34.530
Jocelyn Corrales: For a while, quite a while. Somebody chatting me because someone's looking for me at info and I'll tell them I'm with a patient

404
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.420
Jocelyn Corrales: I was calling you know a lot of patients yesterday.

405
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Meditation and you would like to do meditation and would mix in yoga every day.

406
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Every day. Yeah. Yes. I think that's a good idea. I like this plan.

407
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:34.200
Jocelyn Corrales: And with regards to social relationship, although you're fighting at times with your husband, probably, but you have a good relationship with your husband.

408
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:34.620
Cynthia We: Yeah.

409
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah okay that's good to hear.

410
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.550
Cynthia We: Yeah 20 years this July.

411
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.830
Cynthia We: Wow. Yeah.

412
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:43.800
Cynthia We: 20

413
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Why not, that's good.

414
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:58.230
Cynthia We: That I really like I can remember when my mom and dad were married 20 years and I don't feel like I'm that I don't ever think I'm as old as my mom and dad were but

415
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:09.360
Jocelyn Corrales: That's, that's a good. Do you notice a good thing, you know, some sometimes rarely see couples going, you know, reaching out

416
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.380
Cynthia We: A lot. Yeah.

417
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.340
Yeah.

418
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.430
Jocelyn Corrales: And a good thing is that you love each other.

419
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.980
Cynthia We: Most yeah

420
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And we get children. You also have a good relationship with your children.

421
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:29.790
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, well, we have a 13 year old, so I'm like I told you that before he's

422
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.270
Yeah.

423
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.740
Cynthia We: He's spunky and

424
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.140
Cynthia We: He's volatile and

425
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.390
Cynthia We: Angry a lot

426
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I think that's, you know, expected for a teeny

427
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.230
Jocelyn Corrales: teeny, you know, because of the

428
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Not only because of

429
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:56.760
Jocelyn Corrales: His attitude, but you know there's some physical changes.

430
00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:02.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so if there's physical changes. It also involves emotional changes. So, you know,

431
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:12.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Also some hormonal changes that could also affect his mood, you know, so he's awfully angry.

432
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:28.740
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, yeah. It could also be hormonal try to understand him and try to let him understand that what he's going through is normal, you know, try to try to read also some books regarding kids, you know, adolescent, you know,

433
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.180
Jocelyn Corrales: So here you're able to understand the stages that they're going through. And, you know, maybe you could learn something.

434
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.220
Jocelyn Corrales: And you could explain to him that, you know,

435
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.820
Cynthia We: This is the most recent one. I'm going to read

436

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.980

449
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:35.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, yeah, sometimes you have to be understanding to them, especially right now you know they're going through.

450
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.830
Jocelyn Corrales: A process, you know, they're growing up, physically and, you know,

451
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:55.350
Jocelyn Corrales: The hormonal changes. It's also affects them and try, try to understand them and try to explain to them that what they're going through each normal, but you know, you just have to keep them guidance through so that you know they grew up really well.

452
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and they

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:02.100
Jocelyn Corrales: First, it's difficult, you know, having to adjust it is technology, especially if you're an at an older generations and

487
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Very difficult to adjust. But, you know, once you get, you know,

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.130
Jocelyn Corrales: I started with 15 minutes then later on.

611
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:48.930
Jocelyn Corrales: 20 minutes then I'm able to tolerate 30 minutes and now I'm able to tolerate around 40 minutes or an hour.

612
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.310
Cynthia We: Oh, I think that's a good idea because 30 minutes sounds a little overwhelming to me.

613
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, starting to

614
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.460
Cynthia We: See me. I can do that.

615
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, you start with 15 minutes and if you feel so very tired.

616
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:08.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Just stop Jeanette, you know, do not push yourself to to, you know, it will stress you out. So

617
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.770
Jocelyn Corrales: If you think you can

618
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:14.310
Jocelyn Corrales: cannot manage their commit start with, you know, 15 minutes

619
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:14.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Then

620
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:20.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Once you're able to do 15 minutes and you're like, Oh, no, this is that challenging anymore. That's the 20 minutes

621
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.680
Jocelyn Corrales: 30 minutes

622
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, that's duties to gradually not, you know, not in the dance that it would that stress you out.

623
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:36.000
Jocelyn Corrales: And spiritual self you would like to. You mentioned that you want to try

624
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Although it's not priority, you would like to go on a church, something like that.

625
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:48.540
Cynthia We: Oh, um, I wanted to take the kids to a

626
00:46:49.860 --> 00:47:01.620
Cynthia We: Look, what the heck is a NEMA I can't think of the name. Oh, it's a combination of the hippie church. I've been thinking about it. Yeah, it's not gonna happen right now so

627
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, we should

628
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.040
Cynthia We: Make it a goal because we can't actually go

629
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:14.100
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, for a start, since you know you're not really familiar because you mentioned that you've been there when you were still very

630
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.720
Cynthia We: High School. Yeah, when I was

631
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.500
Jocelyn Corrales: And when you and when you got married 20 years ago, so that's

632
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Just too long already. Have you tried checking out online.

633
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:24.900
Cynthia We: I have not

Jocelyn Corrales: You know, just type on a specific denomination that you would like. Then if they have online services or online worship service, sometimes they go on live on Sundays already have

638
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:54.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Once they have life sometimes, it remains on their Facebook page or on their social account and you could actually view their previous slide, and watch it again on a later time. You could actually do that.

639
00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.580
Cynthia We: Okay, I'll check into that.

640
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Do some online.

641
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.240
Jocelyn Corrales: church services.

642
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:10.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, maybe you start with that first before you know before

643
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:23.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah okay because you might get shocked when you get there. So it's you know it's a start doing, you know, doing online for us. And when you think that already that yeah, maybe I'm ready to go there.

644
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, let's start with the online one

645
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:34.440
Cynthia We: I had to go to the bathroom really bad.

646
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.440
Cynthia We: Can you excuse me, I'm sorry.

647
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.240
Cynthia We: Okay.

648
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards to our plan waking up early.

649
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.930
Jocelyn Corrales: You're good with a 930. I think that's

650
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.760
Jocelyn Corrales: That's reasonable. Then

651
00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Then 11 in the morning.

652
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:36.390
Jocelyn Corrales: It's, you know, we'll just adjust it earlier, if we think if you're able to wake up at 930

653
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and usually at sleep. What time do you plan to sleep is

654
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.170
Jocelyn Corrales: 11 o'clock in the evening or it's just 11 o'clock. It's still early for you.

655
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:52.740
Cynthia We: I'm 11 o'clock is still early but 12 probably 12 would be good.

656
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:53.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Child midnight. Oh.

657
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.510
Cynthia We: Yeah.

658
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.220
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's enough.

659
00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.490
Cynthia We: I think nine nine and a half hours that should be

660
00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:00.030
Enough.

661
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.330
Jocelyn Corrales: And eat on time. Yes, I

662
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Think you'll be able to

663
00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.100
Jocelyn Corrales: I think you'll be able to eat on site when you wake up early already

664
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.210
Cynthia We: Yeah, I agree.

665
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.690
Cynthia We: Oh, and I know what else, um, I should drink more water.

666
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Okay.

667
00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:33.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried

668
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:39.540
Jocelyn Corrales: planning out your day because you know you have so many activities and you have kids.

669
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:49.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Like you make a schedule of your day. It's like a routine schedule that you should do every day. It's just a general electric couple

670
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:59.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Waking up. Then after waking up, make make breakfast for the keys and eat breakfast. Then afterwards do activities with the kids, like for example you wake up at 930

671
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:10.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Then after waking up, you know, you just do your basic like taking a bath taking a shower or you know whatever you do the morning routine then make breakfast and after breakfast eat breakfast and

672
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.770
Cynthia We: Then go for a walk or

673
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:23.610
Cynthia We: Will work, we just we actually just made a schedule yesterday. Oh, that's good, because we couldn't stand the, like, not knowing

674
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.600
Cynthia We: And Sam scooter every, every free minute so

675
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.400
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's good, that's good. We

676
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:31.290
Cynthia We: Are all going to stick to

677
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:41.160
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're going to include their to chores. Like, for example, daily chores at home and you also include their your plan, which is gardening.

678
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:56.040
Jocelyn Corrales: And doing some activities for the kids like the art activities or worksheets activities so included in your plan. So even though you have a general plan for the family. You could also make a specific plan for yourself.

679
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:05.490
Jocelyn Corrales: So the things you would do for the day and you know so that you will be able to plan out your day and you'll be able to fulfill more than you're able to do

680
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:22.140
Cynthia We: I have a really, really, really big problem with getting distracted and like like I'll be in the middle of doing something and then I'll notice like that the tree needs trimming and I'm off and trimming the damn

681
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:26.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Tree before I realized, before I realized what I'm doing and I

682
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:27.510
Think

683
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:39.030
Cynthia We: It's really ridiculous. So I think I'm reading a book right now organizing the creative person and it's all about. It's, it's just about that and about time management and about not

684
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.990
Cynthia We: Getting like pulled away with every single segment interest.

685
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe, maybe if you see the tree.

686
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.240
Cynthia We: Maybe if he's gonna look at the trees.

687
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:53.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Trimming maybe you could schedule out maybe the schedule that one out on the next data.

688
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Exactly the team that

689
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Team that now, not now.

690
00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Tomorrow I'll do you tomorrow, something like

691
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:17.310
Cynthia We: So, so yeah focus and and and sticking having a plan are really important. So I have made. We made the plan for the kids. And I think that's the next step is to add us to the plan because while

692
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:17.550
Cynthia We: There's

693
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:23.910
Cynthia We: Those things I can, I can work on my book, or I can work on taking the classes that I need. See

694
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Me. Yes.

695
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:33.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Because if you're very much distracted, you might forget about your, you know, writing your book, or you might forget your online classes.

696
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.880

Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes.

704
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.400
Jocelyn Corrales: I think they should do that because they just stay there.

705
00:55:55.410 --> 00:56:00.660
Jocelyn Corrales: I always tell my kids, why not try to sweep the floor, you know, mop the floors or something like that, but

706
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Not every day but

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.380
Jocelyn Corrales: But I try to tell them to do you know

708
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:07.980
Jocelyn Corrales: For them to be active. I don't want them looking at their cell phones, every time.

709
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:08.760
Yeah.

710
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:13.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

711
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.040
Anxious.

712
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.520
Cynthia We: Your brain is rotting

721
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:21.630

722
00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.230
Cynthia We: Oh,

723
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.190
Cynthia We: Which is funny.

724
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.960
Cynthia We: Yeah.

725
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:28.740
Cynthia We: Yeah, I have a few friends.

726
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:35.580
Cynthia We: And we're seeing, we're all staying in touch either texting and then and then actually talking on the phone.

727
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:36.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Uh huh.

728
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:37.530
Cynthia We: Which is weird.

729
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:38.520
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

730
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. You can also do a zoom meetings we BAM.

731
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:43.440
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, that's good.

732
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:51.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I'm sharing you my screen so that you'll be able to see

733
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.000
Jocelyn Corrales: Where is it for a while. Okay, there it is.

734
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:05.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I have written out stuff that we have this curse was working out for you. Actually, I have

735
00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:15.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Placed in everything here and I'll just, I'm just going to edit this later on. So that I'll get the the good points. You know, all here and

736
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:25.860
Jocelyn Corrales: You know all the things that we talked about. And I'm going to for with regards to not working well. I'm going to put it here later on. But I just want you to see the plan.

737
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Make sure that I don't forget anything.

738
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so your daily routine. You want to wake up at 9:30am and

739
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:46.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Included in the plan set up an alarm to be if once you're able to sleep early because it's it's not good to set up an alarm night at 9:30am and you're still unable to sleep early so

740
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.760
Cynthia We: Right, right.

741
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:54.600
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's, let's try to work on with your sleep first before you start working up early, so

742
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Once you're able to get to your, you know,

743
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:07.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Once you're able to do sleep or US you're able to get adjusted of sleeping early, maybe we can work on setting up an alarm.

744
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.630
Jocelyn Corrales: For us to be able to wake up early.

745
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.190
Cynthia We: Yes. That makes sense.

746
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:34.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I think you have no problems with you, able, you know, eating in a day because you mentioned to me, you rarely eat junk foods and you try to eat healthy meals, so

747
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:48.360
Jocelyn Corrales: I just placed in here, eat on time, you know, since you're able to wake up later usually eat eat lead. So when you wake up early, you'll be able to you earlier than the usual and on time.

748
00:59:48.960 --> 01:00:03.960
Jocelyn Corrales: And for to make a specific plan for it to be for your day and be able to do to be able to do more in a day exercise every day to include your yoga and meditation, maybe you should do yoga and meditation. When you are about to sleep.

749
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.320
Cynthia We: Oh, that's a good idea, like, yeah.

750
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so that you will be able to relax at night and be

751
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:23.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Able to sleep. Maybe if you want to read, try to read in the day, maybe at the midday, or when you're, you know, when you're doing activities with your child and you don't want to do anything. Just read while she's doing her activities.

752
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:23.790
There.

753
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:30.990

788
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, are you able to sign it.

789
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.820
Cynthia We: And click to start

790
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:23.130
Cynthia We: Oh,

791
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.350
Cynthia We: Really

792
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.560
Jocelyn Corrales: No worries. You can always change it later if it

793
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:45.120
Cynthia We: I have a laptop. So it's like super hard to push the button and sign it.

794
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:47.070
Cynthia We: Great.

795
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, that's great. Sometimes it's it's better if we, you know, I have patients having a hard time

796
01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:07.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing this. So what I do is that although it's not necessarily or it's not required to have the patient sign the plan, but it's better to have them sign that you know at least they agreed to that type of plan.

797
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:08.310
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

798
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:19.380
Jocelyn Corrales: But it's actually not required. It's okay if they're not able to sign because was there are some Hornet able to to do it remotely if they're under false. Yes.

799
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:32.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, there are some folks that are capable of signing, but there are some point that are not capable, although if I even if I am able to share them the screen or the mouse there they're still not able to do sign it.

800
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.930
Jocelyn Corrales: But there are some phones that

801
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:34.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Are able to

802
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:36.690
Cynthia We: Interesting.

803
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:38.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, OK.

804
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.780
Cynthia We: OK. OK.

805
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:45.090
Jocelyn Corrales: OK, so we're done for today. It was, you know, it was great, talking with you use and

806
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:46.500
Hopefully,

807
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:58.530
Jocelyn Corrales: We can maybe you want to talk something you know something, you know, something else, you get, we could still continue on talking but if there's, you know, no other concerns you could edit here.

808
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.920
Cynthia We: So we do this again in a month. Yes.

809
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:09.840
Jocelyn Corrales: In a month, but I'm gonna, I'm still going to schedule, you probably at least in a month, but maybe it could go longer than a month, probably 30

810
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:23.100
Jocelyn Corrales: At least 30 days or 245 days we'll see depends on the fly because I have to see a lot other patients also and I hope to see you next month. And I'm going to see, you know, show me your art activities.

811
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.130

814
01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:38.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I look forward to that. Maybe if I do my planting honor on my own.

815
01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.470
Jocelyn Corrales: And I'm actually planning.

816
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.120
Jocelyn Corrales: To do some gardening. But what I did is that I bought a

817
01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:55.650
Jocelyn Corrales: A what they call it. It's a rock rap something. It's actually a soil less soil less planting. Yeah.

818
01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.670
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah, yeah.

819
01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.700
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, so that you could go up in smoke laps.

820
01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.040
Cynthia We: So, oh, so you just take it and you planted into the ground and it's already good to

821
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:06.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Have a real, it's like

822
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:15.300
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like a soil less it's you're not going to use soil, but you're going to use something called a rah rah yarn or something like that. I don't know what the

823
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:19.740
Cynthia We: Call. I don't know. I'm just, I'm just going to try it. So, because I'm

824
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:30.510
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm you know I'm interested also in planting succulents although I didn't have succulents set seed seed, but that but that type of soil this you know

825
01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:32.670
Jocelyn Corrales: This

826
01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Is for it's good for is recommended for succulents so might, I might

827
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.520
Jocelyn Corrales: I might try it on small plants probably

828
01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:46.110
Cynthia We: succulents. I would recommend getting at Trader Joe's and

829
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:53.460
Cynthia We: And you know, you have to harden them off like you have to put him outside in the daytime for two weeks.

830
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.310
Cynthia We: They go outside of the data and bring them inside.

831
01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:59.040
Cynthia We: At nine and then put them back out during the day.

832
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.800
Cynthia We: For two weeks to do that. And then you can plant them outside

833
01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:06.180
Cynthia We: Oh, I have some succulents that I got at Trader Joe's that are amazing.

834
01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:09.450
Cynthia We: They're huge. Like, I can't believe how good. They're good.

835
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. So nice. You have a green thumb because you like

836
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.000
Cynthia We: It's funny because my mom used to say she had a black thumb.

837
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Nothing grows on her, something like that.

838
01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:24.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, they're

839
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:29.700
Cynthia We: Doing everything. I don't know, I just started practicing and I figured

840
01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:30.660
Cynthia We: Out a little yeah

841
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.710
Jocelyn Corrales: There are actually some people who are like that plants die on them.

842
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I didn't know why. Maybe because of, you know, how did he care of

843
01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.800
Cynthia We: Yeah, well I think Google Now you can figure out, like what every plant needs and if

844
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:48.300
Cynthia We: You don't care what the plants need and you just give it, whatever, then

845
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.260

846
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.550
