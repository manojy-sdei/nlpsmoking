33
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.660
Nadine Quintana: So I don't know what's going on there. But I always have to wait just like a day.

42
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I had a blackout. I think it was last week. The whole house just went flat. And I was like,

43
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this, this will not work for me any everything came right back on. But like, it's amazing how in a flash under a second like you can have like 100,000 thoughts.

44
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.690
Yeah.

45
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, okay, use my skills.

46
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there it was, everything was fine, but

47
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.580
Nadine Quintana: I do everything online.

48
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, on the weekends I have to completely like I have to turn everything off like because my eyes. Give me a hard time. So I've got a I've got a really use those skills that I talked to you guys about

49
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress

50
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then you know we have lots of room.

51
00:05:46.410 --> 00:06:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To do. Let's see. Let's get back into what we were sort of working around last time. Let's see. So I'll bring us up to speed on where we were last last week, I'm right at the end, you mentioned under a self reflection. You know how we say, you know, house today for you coming

52
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a lot calmer than I used to be. You don't get angry you become more relaxed and happy than I have been in a long time.

53
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I think my kids. Notice

54
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There are a lot different with me. They mess around me joke with me. That's something we never did before. I have gotten a lot better relationship is also better. I feel blessed. Yeah, yeah. That was a nice way to end.

55
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.950
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

56
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, but what we had started with that day was

57
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Addressing on braces threatening to spit and we started out as sort of a side distress level of at there was rage and hatred and then

58
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You found him ungrateful angry and something was going on with him, like you, you just weren't in the know. You know what I mean like something's going was going on and maybe he wasn't telling you

59
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, he was showing up angry.

60
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: See started fighting can't remember how we started it escalated got worse and then the negative the thinking that you have. I kind of get some paper that said of it today. The thoughts for that experience was I I don't deserve this.

61
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That was your positive cognition. I don't deserve this. You negative cognition was, I try my best.

62
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to give up. I felt like not caring about what he does not pay attention to him if he does something. I don't like it, no mind and let him go on with doing what he wanted. So he gets mad at me.

63
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

64
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There for you.

65
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Andres. He was not as bad. It's still disrespectful talk to his dad, I can do this a stress myself out with him. Okay, well, how are the dynamics between you two. You know how you're saying I can't do this and that.

66
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: equal signs stress myself out with him. I need to focus on me and make sure I'm okay.

67
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How have things been with

68
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone in your family, not, not just him, but are you doing with that.

69
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.300
Nadine Quintana: Actually we're doing. Oh, I'm

70
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.910
Nadine Quintana: Pretty good. I

71
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:57.330
Nadine Quintana: Kind of taught myself like when I don't agree with somebody they rather my mom or my sister or my kids or something. I just learn to not

72
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.030
Like

73
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:10.860
Nadine Quintana: You don't like just attack him away and start telling them off and get really defensive because I used to get really defensive before

74
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:30.420
Nadine Quintana: And now, like with my mom like my mom's already older she's never going to change. She's, she's her so like when she she has her little remarks or she says something I don't lie or

75
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.490
Nadine Quintana: You know,

76
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.850
Nadine Quintana: I just learned to just bite my tongue and just deal with it and let her go on.

77
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.250
Nadine Quintana: Because then eventually she stops and

78
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.560
Nadine Quintana: Then she passed. She moves on from that.

79
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.070
Nadine Quintana: Okay, so I'm just like, Let her do what she needs to do is get it off your chest and we'll be okay.

80
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:54.630
Nadine Quintana: I

81
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Love you get it off their chest

82
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.120
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, but I've also learned how to

83
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.690
Nadine Quintana: Like if she says something about me that I don't like I

84
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.240
Nadine Quintana: defend myself to a way where I'm not arguing with her.

85
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it sound in general.

86
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:30.570
Nadine Quintana: Okay, for instance. My mom has it in her mind that me and my sister when that we're better awful don't like we don't need a man in our life and

87
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:41.880
Nadine Quintana: You know, like when my sister got her boyfriend. My mom was like, oh, I don't like him. This is bad and really negative about him. She didn't even know him. He's a really awesome guy.

88
00:10:43.380 --> 00:11:02.790
Nadine Quintana: You know, and I'm like, when I started talking to my husband again. She's like, Why are you talking to him, you're doing so good and this and that. And I just said, you know, that's the father of my kids. I am not going to cut them out of my life. He's never treated and you've you bad

89
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:13.440
Nadine Quintana: You know he's and what happened, you know, what did I tell her I said something like, you know, he's never cheated. You guys bad and he's never he doesn't

90
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.600
Nadine Quintana: Like before when we were younger, he did these really bad.

91
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.540
Nadine Quintana: But I've learned to forgive him. And that's my business. Okay, I

92
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.210
Nadine Quintana: Might do

93
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.340
Nadine Quintana: Uh huh. And

94
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that I just

95
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: say to her that part. I don't think he said

96
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: No other of my kids.

97
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.260
Nadine Quintana: whitewater that part but

98
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.850
Nadine Quintana: I was

99
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:49.920
Nadine Quintana: I wasn't going to cut them out of my life. I told her that, whatever. What did I say something along the lines like I'm

100
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.850
Nadine Quintana: Like whatever happens, happens between us, like that's that's

101
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.210
Nadine Quintana: Just that you know I'm

102
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.330
Nadine Quintana: going on behind the kinda

103
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.540
Nadine Quintana: Back away step away and

104
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So well now that

105
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.760
Nadine Quintana: That's my wife said it but it was something

106
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So here's what it wasn't, it wasn't I'm

107
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: calling her names. It was making her change her mind what it sounded like because you gave me a little snapshot was you stayed what I would call sort of defiant inside of your beliefs you stayed in here. That's the father, my kids.

108
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It is what it is, this is, this is how it's going to be. I'm not going to lose contact with him, whatever happens between us happens. So what you did was, state your case. You just said sort of your, your perspective on it.

109
00:12:51.570 --> 00:13:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't sound like you were demanding and demanding can happen passively can be directly, like I insist that you see it my way. He didn't do that. But our demands can be subtle, too. But that isn't what I heard what I heard you doing is all you did was stay

110
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Firm in your position right

111
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe in the past, you really wanted her to understand

112
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And show you that she understands your point of view. And it looks like that's what you've let go of attachment to it looks like you're basically like I'm going to tell you how it is.

113
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it.

114
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a huge difference. And although you guys may not be able to describe what's different. What I see is you're stopping the expectation for change.

115
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you can do to you can do two things that on the outside, and especially when you're first starting this self growth stuff you can look like, how can these two things exist. I stand up for myself and

116
00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I can sit in the same room with someone who has a completely different opinion. How do I be in those two places at the same time I stay in my truth and I can witness someone else's experience.

117
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't. And that is an amazing skill to have because it means that you'll be able to right it's empathy, like we can have empathy for ourselves. Well, this is my truth this, I want to maintain this relationship with the Father. My children.

118
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: He's done this in the past I forgiven him. This is my truth and I can see I can see you mom you you clearly are trying to champion, this idea of, you don't need a man. You don't need a man, you don't. But that's her perspective. You're neither trying to change hers.

119
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, nor allowing her to change you. So we sort of sit in the presence of ourselves and in the presence of someone else's opinion and it is only an opinion.

120
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:49.650
Yeah.

121
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:57.060
Nadine Quintana: That's, yeah, that's what I told myself today she's, she's gonna think we should think

122
00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.910
Nadine Quintana: I can't change it so I'm not gonna

123
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.470
Nadine Quintana: Just myself our fight with her for something that she

124
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.210
Nadine Quintana: She wants to believe in, or she wants to

125
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.540
Nadine Quintana: You know, say, and stuff like that so

126
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.470
Nadine Quintana: I'm not gonna, it's just about something like that.

127
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.330
Nadine Quintana: Just

128
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's take that for a second. And let's see if we can apply it to this concept which is

129
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase understanding of self trust, just take a second and just, just imagine or you check in and say, see if what you did with your mom is evidence that you trust yourself.

130
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.120
Nadine Quintana: Yeah yeah

131
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, more than yes explain how that is true, kind of led me into how you put that together.

132
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.480
Nadine Quintana: Because I know what's good for me. I know myself.

133
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.870
Nadine Quintana: I know that

134
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.270
Nadine Quintana: I wouldn't

135
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.460
Nadine Quintana: Say like okay

136
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.460
Nadine Quintana: I know

137
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.330
Nadine Quintana: How I would want my life. Like, I mean,

138
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.790
Nadine Quintana: That sounds weird but

139
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:32.970
Nadine Quintana: Like, I know I want a good life. I know I don't, I don't need to depend on anybody I know. I could take care of myself. And if I allow somebody into my life that nobody else approves of I Know What To be careful for this time.

140
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:41.220
Nadine Quintana: I know to this time, I could stand my ground. I know I could say what it is that's on my mind without

141
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:49.710
Nadine Quintana: Being harsh about it or without starting a fight or without, you know,

142
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.510
Nadine Quintana: Like I i

143
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.350
Nadine Quintana: I know what's best for me. And what's I know what's best for me was not

144
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.180
Nadine Quintana: So if I want something in my life.

145
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.340
Nadine Quintana: And I, and I feel like it's good and it's not going to harm me, you know, of course I let it in. But if it, you know, even if it does

146
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.130
Nadine Quintana: It does just something that I

147
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:28.050
Nadine Quintana: I have it in my head, but it's like all jumbled up and I can't. It can't come out right. But I'm trying to see, um,

148
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:36.990
Nadine Quintana: Okay, like I just I know what's best for me and I know how to take care of myself and

149
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.650
Nadine Quintana: Whatever anybody else says

150
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:53.760
Nadine Quintana: Like you say their, their opinions and of course they're going to be worried they're going to think, okay, this and this and this happened in the past. How are you going to deal with that. Well, how are you going to handle it, but

151
00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:01.650
Nadine Quintana: I know myself now. And I know that if something better to happen.

152
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:25.230
Nadine Quintana: Like for instance, like me and my husband, you know, get into fighting or he does something that he doesn't like like I know how to communicate with him. Now before I did it. I would say quite a lot of the times, or I would fight with them really bad break audience like really backed by

153
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A bright, they're just really sit with that.

154
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to communicate when I had something I wanted to say or how to feeling I would either stay quiet.

155
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Quiet. Quiet, quiet and then or I would fly with them. So, is I wouldn't speak or I would fight when I think it is this right. I wouldn't speak, time after time after time and then I would fight.

156
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There was, it was there a buildup of unsaid feelings.

157
00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Years ago now, how do you describe your type of communication.

158
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:13.110
Nadine Quintana: If something bothers me right then and there, and I don't like something he said, or something that he's done, I'll let him know with out the yelling and the curse theme and the screen.

159
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: About that that's that's that energized or without the other, the other pattern that preceded that remember that's that other one which is I kept it to myself I I write the quiet.

160
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.840
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, no, I actually learned how to open up to him.

161
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.490
Nadine Quintana: And that's something that he's noticed too because um

162
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:47.100
Nadine Quintana: I actually told him, like for instance, like when he needed something he would tell me, like, oh, you always put me last I'm always

163
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:57.270
Nadine Quintana: You put everybody in front of me and I'm your husband. And so, and I would just say out yet. So now I told him look before

164
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:05.970
Nadine Quintana: When you would ask me for something and I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. I said, and I didn't like that. I didn't like the fact because

165
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.530
Nadine Quintana: Believe me, I want to help you. I wanted to do this for you. But there were times I couldn't because I didn't have the resources. I didn't have the money.

166
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:21.810
Nadine Quintana: You know and I explained everything to him and I said, and that really got me mad that really stressed me out when you would

167
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.930
Nadine Quintana: Tell me, stuff like that. Or when you would tell me to do this or do that and I told him it was really, really stressed me out.

168
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:39.660
Nadine Quintana: And I said, If you want something. Yeah, okay. You could ask me, and if I could get it for you. Or you could get it for you. If I can't, I can't. And that's just how it is. And he told me you know

169
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:48.000
Nadine Quintana: That he was sorry he did know that he was being like that and he noticed it to that you how he was being and that really

170
00:20:51.210 --> 00:21:08.970
Nadine Quintana: That really made me feel good because it made me see like okay well. He's noticing to what he's doing wrong, you know, so that, like maybe that you know I mean so happy that he noticed himself, you know. And then, so I would I like the fact that we were able to like talk to you about it.

171
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.550
Nadine Quintana: And

172
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:19.140
Nadine Quintana: I think those two years of us being apart from each other because we've never been apart from each other. We've been together so 16

173
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:36.930
Nadine Quintana: So this is the first time that we've been apart. No talking not together. And it's been for two years. And I really think that we needed that we say that all the time like we really needed this we needed to find ourselves.

174
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:48.090
Nadine Quintana: Yes. So, I mean, because I was so young, or he actually told me this and he told me that he was mad at me for leaving leaving him.

175
00:21:48.990 --> 00:22:02.100
Nadine Quintana: Two years ago that he was really hurt with me and he was depressed and he was sad and, you know, and then he said that he started going to like counseling and stuff like that.

176
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:23.730
Nadine Quintana: Um, he he start I guess a little after I mean him separated. He got, like, really, I'm not counseling for you record he would talk to like is caseworker okay and he would let out like what was going on and she would talk to him.

177
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: For the last year. Would you say

178
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.320
Nadine Quintana: I'm, I'm assuming I haven't asked him about that.

179
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.370
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, so he would go and talk to her, and

180
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:49.710
Nadine Quintana: He said, you know, when we, when we got together. You were 16 years old and then you had the kids, you know, at a very young age. So you never got a chance to like really live your life. He told me

181
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:59.340
Nadine Quintana: You never got a chance to really live your life and find yourself because you're always taking care of kids. You are always taking care of me. You're always

182
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:08.760
Nadine Quintana: cleaning the house cooking doing all this stuff for all of us. And he's like, and you never got to to really find yourself. He told me

183
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:19.650
Nadine Quintana: He said, so it sucked that that we were apart for these two years. He said, but it's good because we both got to find ourselves.

184
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.910
Nadine Quintana: So that made me feel really, really good when he said that because I see like you started to notice.

185
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.920
Nadine Quintana: He's trying to see like

186
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:43.020
Nadine Quintana: He's already thinking about me, me, me, me, me. He's starting to actually think about, oh, you know, her feelings. Oh, you know, she's feeling this way. Oh, you know, the kids really are stressed in her house and

187
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.750
Nadine Quintana: You know, it's

188
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:57.120
Nadine Quintana: It's just, it's different, different to see him like that because I've never seen him like that I you know I paint with them for so long. I've never seen him like that. So it's really nice.

189
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:07.710
Nadine Quintana: So it's a really nice thing and it's good because I'm like, Well, I'm glad I did it just divorced him. I'm glad I just didn't throw that away.

190
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.580
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, so I'm like, I'm, I'm happy that I could actually give him.

191
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:27.060
Nadine Quintana: Give this our relationship with try and not just be like, the hell with it and not know what it could have been, you know, so I'm really glad that I took those two years.

192
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:34.020
Nadine Quintana: And him to for his for his, you know, so he could work on himself too so

193
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:45.540
Nadine Quintana: And you know he's, he did like really good and I'm proud of him. And he tells me to like, like I'm proud of you. You know, I'm proud of you. And that, that feels like really

194
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.280
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, it's different. It's really different. The way.

195
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.040
Nadine Quintana: I really like it.

196
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.500
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

197
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.470
So,

198
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a really beautiful explanation for how

199
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You just put a statement of how do you trust yourself and then this expanded into this

200
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I trust that all I'll be able to tell him in the moment when something's upset or making me angry. I won't let it build. That's what I was hearing I trusted that

201
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Turns out, didn't you know dissolve the marriage trusted that here it is. Now it's feeling like a different relationship and you're trusting that right because these are not

202
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that anyone else can really see exactly you two are in the relationship you to get to decide is the value of it, is it feeling the friendship. The all the pieces that go into marriage. Is this what you want is this feeling good, you guys decide that we have the outside, we can

203
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Active but you're the one that has to

204
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

205
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And trust yourself and you've been doing that. So you just gave another piece of evidence that this is how I'm trusting myself on paying right it's not how you word it but it's what here I am.

206
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I pulled back I we weren't together. I did some self growth. I learned how to, you know, assert myself more practice skills working on recovery just that whole deal. And now I'm watching him and listening to him. He sounds different feels good.

207
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really as complicated as self trust is it means we're turning inward. We're not conforming to how it's supposed to be a woman just shuts up and listens to her, ma'am.

208
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's not

209
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That would conforming to some maybe we were raised that way or something. But no, but what self trust is it

210
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this working for me was something important happening. It's in the moment it's do I speak up. Now, is this worth

211
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of fighting for making my point around with mom nine out of 10 now just it's not worth it. Just chant gotta change. I'll just let her

212
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let it run its course. I'll just head nod, and I'll get through this. And then from another one. Maybe that's pretty common when you're in a relationship with you know romantic relationship. Those tend to be the ones that we speak up a little bit more around

213
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.230
Mm hmm.

214
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I see a lot of self trust in there and it sounds like you really enjoy having other people acknowledge it. Hey, my fit my kids see it. Hey, my husband sees it. Hey, other people see me changing. I think you like that.

215
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.030
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, that makes me feel, you know, good.

216
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:56.730
Nadine Quintana: Because then they see the change in me that they never looked at me like that, you know, before like it was just a whatever with me and now it's like

217
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.880
Nadine Quintana: Oh, you know, like I get a lot of a, you know, oh, I'm proud of you. You should be proud of yourself and

218
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:13.350
Nadine Quintana: Like my mom told me that there Dave I she was telling me she was moving to Albuquerque. And she's like, but I don't have to worry about you, she said, Because you have a good head on your shoulders.

219
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.180
Nadine Quintana: So I was like okay that's new.

220
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:30.600
Nadine Quintana: So yeah, you know, and it kind of made it made me feel like really good because usually, she's like always, like, really favoritism with my sister.

221
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:44.670
Nadine Quintana: And she was like, you know, I want to move with there and I need to be closer to her and this and that. And she's like, but you don't have to worry about you because you've got a good head on your shoulders and you know what you're doing. So, you know,

222
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.530
Nadine Quintana: Is there any kind of

223
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.060
Nadine Quintana: Oh, sorry.

224
00:28:49.020 --> 00:29:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any mixture of feelings, both it feeling good to be seen as having a good head on your shoulders, and is there a mixture of, well, but don't leave me alone. Like, I still. Is there any mixture or it's pure and that feels good. Yeah, just

225
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.650
Nadine Quintana: A simple yes

226
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.700
Nice.

227
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.100
Nadine Quintana: Oh, sorry. When

228
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.600
Nadine Quintana: I was just gonna say like the way I kind of see it is my

229
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:38.370
Nadine Quintana: I have a good life. I, I like my life and just having people in my life is like a kind of put it like it's a bonus

230
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.990
Nadine Quintana: You know, like, I'll be okay by myself.

231
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:55.380
Nadine Quintana: I'll do good by myself. And if I have people in in around me and you know i i take that as a bonus. That's how I kind of put it

232
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to close this poll and your goal. Sounds like my my way of writing it, which is

233
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So the goal was increased understanding of self trust. There was a real missing piece and now it sounds like you get what it is to trust the self.

234
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And interpersonal. So here's what I had, I had set as the objective client will increase frequency of self disclosures. That's how we would measure how is medians trust. Right. How do we measure trust this thing that no one, you can't get your hands on call it blue and call it, feel it.

235
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have to sort of be able to sort of have a way to measure. So this is how I how I had written it client will increase frequency

236
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A self disclosures around topic of intuition judgment trust and interpersonal connection.

237
00:30:50.670 --> 00:31:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: In our individual and group therapy. So just notice what you already did today did maybe disclose around her own intuition her own judgment trusting herself and around interpersonal connection.

238
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: For my assessment. You did. You talked about, hey, this is what I think, Mom. This is where I stand and and husband. This is how I feel. I feel angry and

239
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Stressed out when you ask you sort of asked me to do things. And I've already done everything I can. And you're thinking that I don't care about you, it's stressing me out. So that would be an interpersonal disclosure that would be you using self trust.

240
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In real time.

241
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

242
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it in order for you to do. That means you are relying on intuition, your own judgment, your own assessment of what is right and good for you.

243
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's rewind a little bit. I know that's all a bunch of fancy words but the basics are this

244
00:31:54.150 --> 00:32:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I was looking to see, can my client, maybe talk about those things in session. And I've watched over the last few months, a lot more flow where it's been easier for you to literally talk about

245
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own opinion and how you talk to other people. It has flowed easier. Notice how much, much of today you've been talking. Mm hmm.

246
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that's different, even though you felt probably uncertain about how to say it you persevere, if you kept going. Guess what that takes some trust.

247
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you know how it would have sounded. What do you mean what does

248
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That sound familiar

249
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we can

250
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.570
Nadine Quintana: See

251
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

252
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Need for nourishment. What it is, is it's a I just have one of those memories. That's what I do. Right.

253
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.160
Nadine Quintana: Now,

254
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I look at how does our language. How does our language because that's all I have on here.

255
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it reflect our internal experience. How can I take words and try and see into what mediums world is like, how do I do it. So I look at patterns and I look at you know maybe some types of missing words.

256
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I may not know how to describe that grammatically but I know when, like an object or a subject is missing, like something's missing or is it all us instead of first person like I'll just be kind of paying attention. Look at this change.

257
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't see it as one was bad. One is good. I look at it like that is what was adapted for needing at the time.

258
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks to me like you are trusting yourself more and more and more that you can sit with not knowing what to say. Now having these big

259
00:33:45.150 --> 00:34:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: psychological terms mean nobody has them right that's unless they're in the field. Yeah, yeah. So that's why I'll often say, can you give me a little story ever hear me say that and group. Hey, can you give me a little story like a personal story. Yeah, yeah.

260
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't expect people to be able to say, well, that's a introduction and that's projected identification, you know,

261
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: How to do that.

262
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I just I want to hear their world.

263
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.900
Nadine Quintana: I want to understand

264
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I can go home, is that adaptive. Are you happy with how that played out. Do you want a different feeling so so although you went to embarrassment. Let me find out more about that. Tell me, tell me about how come that seemed interesting

265
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.320
Nadine Quintana: Because I couldn't like

266
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.850
Nadine Quintana: I could I see the way I

267
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:42.000
Nadine Quintana: Was before. And I'm like,

268
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.460
Nadine Quintana: A quite

269
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:50.520
Nadine Quintana: Like why I had to question everything I was like so.

270
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.080
Nadine Quintana: Safe about it like I was being safe and cautious, I guess you could say.

271
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.790
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, sure. I

272
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the office that if I'm

273
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: being super, super careful. Is there more or less trust in myself, if I'm being super careful no see. So that's how

274
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the only reason why I mentioned those words was because that's that may or may reflect what's going on inside of you.

275
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's that's beginning to change. And as you start to disclose more fluidly and group right that's been the invitation. Just do you needing

276
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to be anything that isn't you you can talk about. I got an itchy back if we want to. When I say

277
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, he would like my hair isn't done and I'm focused on that. I don't care what it is for, right, wrong reason. I just want to know.

278
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you. And the more I think he started to even trust that everything we were saying after ever yell continue to show up just like she does, she does her way I do my way and thinking that maybe you started to trust that it would be okay for you to just do you

279
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.180
Nadine Quintana: I remember like this last group that we had arm.

280
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:14.400
Nadine Quintana: You came to mind because when you're like, well, when you're asking us like well what came up for you guys. And you know, I was just like,

281
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.000
Nadine Quintana: Just do what Glenn said and

282
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.540
Nadine Quintana: What was coming up for me. And then that's what i because I was because that's what I was really thinking after I had spoke up. I was like, wow, like

283
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:35.670
Nadine Quintana: I actually like just say, you know, I just said what I said and and I was like, and I remember when just seen just see what's on your mind first being don't overthink it.

284
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:45.900
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, so I've got the habit of doing that a lot, you know, before where I was just always questioning like oh and I was scared like

285
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.170
Nadine Quintana: Is this the right answer. Do I say that, and I would think about that a lot.

286
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.900
Nadine Quintana: And now I'm just say

287
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:06.330
Nadine Quintana: It. So I noticed that it feels a lot better. And there's not pressure because before it was a pressure, like I felt pressure like oh my god I gotta do this right

288
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:17.010
Nadine Quintana: And when you say just see what comes up first, because that's always the right answer. That's not the right answer. That's always the real answer, you know, and

289
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:27.510
Nadine Quintana: It's a lot better, because then you don't have to think about or what am I going to say, What am I gonna do, what am I going to whatever. And this way. It's just like, you know what, this is what I was thinking. And that's just that.

290
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.650
Nadine Quintana: So that kind of helps me. You know when you set out, see what you got to first

291
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.200
Nadine Quintana: Kind of how I'm

292
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.120
Nadine Quintana: Starting to do things.

293
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.620
Nadine Quintana: Right.

294
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's coming from you.

295
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.860
Nadine Quintana: That's your first reason

296
00:37:44.220 --> 00:38:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not preoccupied with how will I be perceived by that first response if we're not busy worrying about other people's perceptions of it or not worried about hurting people's feelings. You're not going to lose. I already know you well enough, at least, you know, I've seen you in here anyway.

297
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not. You're not going to be so inappropriate and the way you talk to people.

298
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you're, you shouldn't have gotten out of any fat slob isn't just gonna, you're not gonna say that to your mom.

299
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna, you still have a filter you still see that's the one I'm not worried that you just have this like

300
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: In like lock on just that flow which is kind of tired. Well, kind of bored kind of irritated kind of copy. Like there's nothing wrong with what you're going through. And that, I think you're starting to tap into that you don't have to censor who you are.

301
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.160
Something wrong.

302
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think you're feeling that and you're noticing. And I think with mom and I'm hearing it a lot with your husband and your kids are noticing it too. And look what it's done. You said there's not as much pressure right when like that.

303
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're playing or joking with the kids. It means that we have more room to be flawed to

304
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a weird thing. It's like if I start protecting against being flawed. Then there's actually more room for me to just do me. And so what if I make him okay I'll apologize if I've hurt someone's feelings. I'll just apologize.

305
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I don't I am sorry, you know, I mean,

306
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Only thing that changed that you're making is is probably having a profound impact in a lot of different relationships.

307
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So, nicely done. And it's, it is we can see it, you know, because like you said in group. You just, you just share

308
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:45.720
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

309
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.100
Nadine Quintana: It feels a lot better because it doesn't put as much stress on me face getting really stressed out.

310
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:59.460
Nadine Quintana: So that's like a really good things and I could just get it out and

311
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.560
Nadine Quintana: If no one likes what I say, you know,

312
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:12.600
Nadine Quintana: That's just how I feel. And I'm not going to apologize for how something

313
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:26.010
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I just need quit being scared and just keep working on this of letting everything out what I feel right then and then right there.

314
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to keep that goal. Open the one that says increasing understanding yourself trust and inner personal trust.

315
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Or close it and create something new, something that's more relevant.

316
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We might do.

317
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.600
Nadine Quintana: Um, you know what I want to quit kind of continue

318
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.140
Nadine Quintana: Okay, working on that.

319
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what if we kept the goal, meaning

320
00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Well, is

321
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the way I haven't word it is it's increased understanding of self trust.

322
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:05.850
Nadine Quintana: Oh, okay.

323
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we want to what we can do is you may have indeed I think you get it now. And the reason

324
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I went into because when I do ask for evidence of it. You give me really clear stories. I think your understanding.

325
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean to trust myself oh I know I'm trusting myself because I speak my truth. I also can sit with someone else's morale and not fall apart. Not get overwhelmed, not have to defend

326
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are. That means I think you have an understanding of self trust. But what makes you want to maybe keep this one still open. What was your hesitation.

327
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.570
Nadine Quintana: Because I still wanted like

328
00:41:49.380 --> 00:42:03.660
Nadine Quintana: I know I like I know that I've done this a few times where I've just opened up like. Now the other day and you know I've done a little bit more, but I would just like to make sure you know, it kind of stays like that. I don't go back to that.

329
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.810
Nadine Quintana: You know, closed off.

330
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.120
Nadine Quintana: Then press. They were. I'm like,

331
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.290
Nadine Quintana: overthinking stuff.

332
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And we write that. And we'll write it. Let's write what you want, let's redefine the goal because

333
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because as far as what you just said is I want to see myself consistently doing self trust over time. I want to get longer pattern in myself one. That's what I heard.

334
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

335
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We can write in, we can write a goal that reflects that. Because this isn't the one we have is about understanding. I don't think you're missing comprehension.

336
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think that's there. Now you're talking about. I want to see myself doing something for a longer period of time. So go inside. Let's see, because this will be our new goal and I'll get to put this one in quotes because this is going to come from you.

337
00:42:53.730 --> 00:43:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, probably only want maybe five seven words, not a lot of words. So it's going to start with probably either. I want to increase this or I want to decrease that to see if you can put in. I want and I'll write it down.

338
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

339
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.440
See

340
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.140
Nadine Quintana: I want to

341
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:24.270
Nadine Quintana: Be more open, more open with people, even a business stranger that I just met you know

342
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.320
Nadine Quintana: And just

343
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.000
Nadine Quintana: Say what I'm thinking at the time. Once it pops up.

344
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. I think we got it. I want to be more open with people by saying what comes up without overthinking it

345
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.820
Yeah.

346
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

347
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So now when we go to the objective. Now we got to take something that you can maybe work on over the next

348
00:43:55.470 --> 00:44:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 days, let's say. So how will we be measuring this, I want you to picture yourself you're with someone what at work or where do you picture even

349
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're going to be measuring that and then I'll say, hey, how you doing you been kind of telling me stories. So where you find what you know, I still struggle with this, there's this group of people or this this one.

350
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I still like, ah, I don't want to even talk to him. I kind of do kind of don't I do, but I don't like where does that show up that ambivalent

351
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: In group. Oh, okay.

352
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. You knew right away.

353
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I could have asked you and not carried on.

354
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Client will. So here we go, increase. Let's see if we can find what that behavior is you probably have it in here. So increase frequency of and maybe that's what this is, it's right here is

355
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: stating what I think.

356
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll

357
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And want I don't know that it

358
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.510
Nadine Quintana: Um, yeah.

359
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: They're more. Yeah.

360
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.740
Nadine Quintana: More like

361
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: A thought. Oftentimes, I'll distinguish what I think. But I believe what I feel is an

362
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.810
Nadine Quintana: Appeal. Yeah.

363
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I want. So notice how also trust in self is also Hey doc, can you change my pharmacy over to do to do or

364
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk about a topic next week. Ladies, want to be around and doctorate real hey

365
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I want to ask the group, a question. So notice how it's not a might also you might show up in noticing what you want and seeing if you give yourself permission to say, hey, I want to talk about something from last week.

366
00:45:54.870 --> 00:46:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you assert yourself and you say it. You watch oh maybe we've only got a few minutes. And what happens, I might say, Oh yeah, totally. But we have like so little time we had one person or what came up for you, you know. So look what I think.

367
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I believe what I feel when I want now I don't have to pull all those in there. I can just pick one of them. What, what would be evidence for you that you are starting to show increased trust and you are more open

368
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.500
Nadine Quintana: I would say just

369
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.100
Nadine Quintana: Be and where I feel

370
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Ingrid.

371
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.190
Nadine Quintana: Anchor

372
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Okay, and you want to do it.

373
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, how do I put this in a measurable way.

374
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're coming twice a month.

375
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:56.040
Nadine Quintana: To go

376
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

377
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.770
Nadine Quintana: Have you been coming every you can

378
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.970
Nadine Quintana: Know, I've been coming every week, except for when we have our

379
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

380
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.190
Nadine Quintana: So when somebody

381
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to see yourself. How do we measure it. You see it. I will do it.

382
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Two or three groups. I'll do it three out of three groups, what's your goal. How do you, what do you want

383
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.830
Nadine Quintana: I was saying, like, two out or two groups because

384
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.690
Nadine Quintana: That way I'm not just by

385
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.970
Nadine Quintana: Really putting like a lot of pressure on me.

386
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that would be that'd be 100%. So I'm actually going to do it differently as measured by

387
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase

388
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say

389
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're doing in about one so they can say once a group to

390
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Group one once a month.

391
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To twice a month.

392
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you have a chance, what will happen is, I'll probably say, okay, of the groups that you were in

393
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see you were into groups. Did you feel like you had that sense of self, trust and you spoke up in that really uncensored way that you feel solid about that you were open where you assess to rope. And do you think you did it.

394
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Twice or once and then you'll say, Man, I kind of chicken now on one of them.

395
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Are over thought it and I was like, they don't really want to hear this. I talked myself out of it, or you might say no. Both times since you're in. Remember I was like yeah well I don't, I, I am feeling Dita or I'm thinking about for

396
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you will have reached it which is two out of two

397
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Weeks. I gotta do something here as measured by increase from

398
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: On one

399
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: One out of

400
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Two groups.

401
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To to

402
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell

403
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So the whole the challenges that

404
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You just said you won't feel pressure for two out of two, but just puts it at having to do it every single time. Because if you're only going twice a month.

405
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Two months I've been a pressure. I'm and I'm hesitant to say your baseline is zero because I don't see it that way. I see you, is communicating. Don't you can grow more

406
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:30.870
Nadine Quintana: Here.

407
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:37.200
Nadine Quintana: Community that are you communicating a lot more than we're used to.

408
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:38.340
Yeah.

409
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.930
Nadine Quintana: So,

410
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we try it this way. See if you if you like this.

411
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't, we don't reach it out of the two groups that you attend over the next couple sessions.

412
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just maybe make a little note in your journal, the day that we had the group and whether you

413
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: felt you were open. And then we'll look at those two groups together. And we'll, we'll write a little note at this point, I'll just say to have to

414
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, to a month because that's basically what you're doing, unless you're going more than that. I mean, if you increase the frequency, you're going to have more of a chance to practice it. So it's up to you.

415
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'll just say one out of two. I know I'm confusing you or imagined I am but

416
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What it's a goal if we already had the goal if it was easy, we wouldn't need the goal. So if you're noticing some apprehension. It's because that goal is met yet.

417
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll get there. So that's my increase from

418
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:40.230
Nadine Quintana: And I usually go to group every, every week, unless mean you have

419
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.890
Nadine Quintana: A one on one on the Monday.

420
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: might end up that will have three opportunities and at least two of those. You'll find yourself open. Does that work.

421
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Twice. There we go.

422
00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, route we put our get the other one I can put achieved as she did it.

423
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Have quite an increase, and I really is true. Your, your understanding of what I was talking about. Because typically, right. It'd be like well what do you mean, right. What do you mean

424
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:16.980
Yeah.

425
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I asked, can you just, just give me examples of how I didn't trust myself. I know because I show him this way. So let me put this down under our achieved section.

426
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other things that you want to add a couple minutes here. Maybe we could

427
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something

428
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.210
Nadine Quintana: I can't think of any right now.

429
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this is beautiful.

430
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a new one. We've got set for I want to be more open with people by saying what comes up without overthinking

431
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you'll do in order to sort of reach your goal. This is one thing you can do. You will increase frequency of stating what I think and feel in group and you'll do your best to try to do it two out of the three groups.

432
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

433
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, awesome.

434
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. Okay. Um, let's schedule another

436
