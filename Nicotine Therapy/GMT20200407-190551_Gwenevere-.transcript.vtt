18
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:19.320
Saraniah Aston: She was like, I have something to tell you. And whenever she says that it freaks me out takes me back to her saying that many, many times in my life and me having to like grip for dear life waiting here. What that's going to be this. Yes, say I was your father.

19
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.240
Saraniah Aston: Showed up

20
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.970
Saraniah Aston: I haven't

21
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.490
Saraniah Aston: Seen my father in a very long time and

22
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.720
Saraniah Aston: He just showed up, apparently. Well, no, she said that he showed up at her place.

23
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.960
Saraniah Aston: And he was

24
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:48.750
Saraniah Aston: A look 10 years older than he was look very frail and

25
00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:02.520
Saraniah Aston: She's letting stay with her and she doesn't know her. I'm like, Well, what are your plans and she doesn't. She says, I don't know. And I asked. I spoke to my father.

26
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.300
Saraniah Aston: And I asked him, like how did you drive all the way out here. I didn't really know where he was staying. I was on the East Coast somewhere.

27
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.550
Saraniah Aston: And he said, Oh, well, your mom helped me with with motel rooms on the way here.

28
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.970
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, so

29
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.320
Saraniah Aston: I didn't even bring it up. My mom I just figured, you know what

30
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.810
Saraniah Aston: Screw it. What if

31
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.720
Saraniah Aston: Whatever. OK, so my father is here and I just

32
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.310
Saraniah Aston: And my brother is just so if for for some reason.

33
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.920
Saraniah Aston: He is so mean and it's like behind my mother's back

34
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.430
Saraniah Aston: So she doesn't see so she doesn't really understand what I'm talking about.

35
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:09.360
Saraniah Aston: And so it's really painful because we're like grown up now, you know, we're not kids anymore. And it's just ridiculous that for some reason he's me.

36
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:24.780
Saraniah Aston: So I went, I went to my mom that I stayed there because my dad was there and I haven't seen him in a very long time and I took a picture with him because the last time I took a picture with my dad. I was 12 you know

37
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.680
What

38
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. A lot of big feeling so many mixing around. I hear it. Right. I hear this wave of like confusion and what, like so many things coming at you all at once.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes.

40
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we can do this together. Okay. We can do this. How do you want to feel today.

41
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.100

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Better. Okay.

43
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

44
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, well maybe it means crying. First, maybe it means feeling the grief of not having a father. Maybe we got to do that first.

45
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.880
Saraniah Aston: This is

46
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.440
Saraniah Aston: So much

47
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.730
Saraniah Aston: Works through us and then let go of men.

48
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.040
Saraniah Aston: You know I never expected to see my father again or you speak to him again.

49
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.400
Saraniah Aston: And there he is. And he looks like this broken man.

50
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:41.310
Saraniah Aston: Like there is no room for anger. There is no room for anything except for

51
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.700
Saraniah Aston: Looking after kind of this man broken old

52
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, my client that's you is saying there's no room for her.

53
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or anger.

54
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know about that. Can I check in on that a little bit.

55
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.150
Saraniah Aston: He told me he's like you know you can yell at me as much as you want. I'm like, Dad, I don't have it in me anymore.

56
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different.

57
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Than there's no room.

58
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, right, that's a real different position to be in. If you're done.

59
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: With the anger and you want to meet him in his frailty. You don't see that same threat around him. Okay, then let's go for it. We can have a completely different new relationship, but I don't

60
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want my client to feel like there's no room for her.

61
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.650
Saraniah Aston: Right.

62
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yes I kick it words, yes I do my overanalyze words I do, but they're powerful, they're all I have over here in Florida to represent that's what's going on inside.

63
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.870
Saraniah Aston: I know, yeah.

64
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so no room for my anger. So let's just see. Can we sit with it and see how his

65
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Face was doing it looked despairing it looks like so much hurt.

66
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.370

67
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.780
Saraniah Aston: Yeah woman's been. I don't even know how to do it.

68
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:28.050
Saraniah Aston: Okay. It really hurts. It really, it's really confusing. It's like

69
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.450
Saraniah Aston: All these things just

70
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.240
Saraniah Aston: There's no end to it, my life.

71
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.460

72
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.470

Gwenevere Abriel: I do, I get it.

74
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And these unexpected intense chaotic relationships like your brother does

75
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad your mom. Just keep showing up and just

76
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Think I've got an action plan. Here's my next step here comes another one to throw you off the

77
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.940
Books.

78
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

79
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.400
Saraniah Aston: Sorry, I had to grab my coffee.

80
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand.

81
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

82
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:26.850
Saraniah Aston: I was just trying to talk to random friends that I barely know on like Instagram to calm me down.

83
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.260
Saraniah Aston: To help me calm down because i'm not i haven't you know freaked out this much, you know, while

84
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.390
Saraniah Aston: And I've been pretty much keeping my stuff together. I've been doing okay and

85
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.400
Saraniah Aston: When something comes in that threaten my stability.

86
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.100
Saraniah Aston: It really scares me.

87
00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see what you still put together. Let's just take a little check will step way back and look around your, your space, see if there happens to be already

88
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If you've ever done a collage or you started one that represents who you are. Just look around and see if there is a sketch. If there's you kind of already kind of put together. Is there anything in here in that space and some new one for you. So I don't know what's there.

89
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:30.690
Saraniah Aston: Right now all I have is a picture that of me and my mom that I afraid that's got it.

90
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, why don't we do kind of depart. Our from our usual right talk therapy. And what if, what if you and I do something a little different. I'm going to, I'm going to draw. And do you have a piece of paper handy.

91
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.640
Something you would like to do

92
00:10:46.260 --> 00:11:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yes. In fact, you might want to get. So here's the invitation. And you might decide on the color. So here's the invitation. So what I'm thinking is we're going to take this paper, and we're going to draw. And I'm going to give an instruction and if you know anything about me.

93
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter that you follow my rules is whatever comes up for you. So I'm just going to give an instruction and wherever you depart from there. Why, then, that comes from your creative spirit, and I welcome that. So the introduction is this, we're going to draw square here in the middle.

94
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And we're not going to make it big, which is going to make it kind of as big or small, but let's picture what's in it. It's going to be all of that uncertainty that hurt.

95
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That chaos and it's going to be made even squiggly squiggly Scrushy la chaos is where our right here in the middle and you decide what color you decide what's in there but it needs to have edges. Okay, it's going to be contained. That's one instruction. I will say, so here's mine.

96
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna do mine actually my do my little off to the side and I do mind like this.

97
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what my website.

98
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.580
Saraniah Aston: What up,

99
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.750
Saraniah Aston: Interesting. Here's

100
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.410
Mine.

101
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And add

102
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.060
Saraniah Aston: A little accident.

103
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I now write something about that x came up for me. It's almost like we have some parallel stuff going on. So my slightly. At first I was like to, I want it in the middle. And I was like, no, I really want off to the side.

104
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I really had this longing and sort of went with it and I movie. I didn't want it to be. I wanted to kind of small, but I didn't want it to say this doesn't matter.

105
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Really wanted it to still say this is still impacting me but I made sure it was self contained and I have edges I have it encased in here does yours have a self contained square

106
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.060
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, and I also made it slightly to the side to

107
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we think of that.

108
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.450
Saraniah Aston: Maybe it's just something that's maybe

109
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.150
Saraniah Aston: Maybe some real side.

110
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's take a look at it.

111
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just sort of go with it and say, if this is an encapsulation with boundaries and has boundaries. Notice

112
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice if you want to do something with those boundaries. Do you want to make them thicker. Do you want to have a little spikes coming out. Just take a look at them.

113
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this whole page is you and that square is the hurt is the wound that just showed up when you came in here today. It was that I'm hurting. I'm in so much pain.

114
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I saw it. I saw it in your effect. And we can put it right in here, and we can have it represented in there. See if you want to do something to the containment. See if there's something you want to draw in it.

115
00:13:42.030 --> 00:14:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's make sure really represents that hurt that anger that pain. It's all of it. It's from all of these abandonments rejections crazy, making it a mom than an abandonment from a Dan all of it gets right. What do they call it a zip, zip drive it gets smooth.

116
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: driver gets really condensed on my holiday do. It's amazing. Well, we're doing it now. We're going to do it we're gonna we're going to really jam it up and we're not getting rid of it.

117
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Today we're going to put it somewhere. Okay.

118
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see what comes up.

119
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just, I just got something so I'm adding to my image. And remember the whole pages you this box is all that wounding that hurt that anger, all those core emotions.

120
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just came up with.

121
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This whole page represents me. This is all of my identity. These are all of my sort of my truth. My experience. This is me. This is my my consciousness my consciousness is called the things I'm aware of. Right.

122
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I get this interesting thing I noticed right away that I wanted some arrows pointing to it. I noticed I was like, I didn't want to forget it. It was like, it's like I needed to point it out somehow.

123
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I noticed what came away from it. Were these little hearts, which is bizarre. Um, but I'm going

124
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know what I and as soon as I was doing it. I was thinking, you know, I wonder if this is more about my client.

125
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, you take something kind of you look and you see the beauty in it. And I wondered, well,

126
00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that a lot of what are wondering can do we can take that wounded place we can deeply connect with other people and have have that intimacy and that connection and we give well we didn't get I can give what I didn't get

127
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey look, here I got hurt. I know other people's hurt. And here I can give kindness unconditional love, I can be clear my communication.

128
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be loving and kind. I didn't get it. I can give it. That's kind of what this felt like for me. What do you when you look at yours. What are you seeing

129
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.160
Saraniah Aston: Oh, whoa. Mine is just a box.

130
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hate you. You don't see me. Look at that.

131
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:43.920
Yeah.

132
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.330
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

133
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.290
Yep.

134
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at it again make sure it's got all the right colors and sure it's got all the right shapes the intensity to it. Make sure the intensity shines clear

135
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.050
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I think with the just contrast. That's good.

136
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the black and white or dark and light colors the contract. Yeah. Okay. Is it just the right size like it's taking up just enough space. Not too much, not too little.

137
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.070
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it is.

138
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's let's look at the negative meaning the negative space negative, it actually can be a positive on this page, the negative space leaves room for all this other stuff.

139
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at all this room. It leaves leaves all this room. And if this is your consciousness and if we say, well, we're going to contain the wound and the hurt.

140
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, look at your page and see what comes up for what all could be going on in the rest of the space. The rest of your weakness, your consciousness. Your attention right our intention and our attention, our focus. What could be going on.

141
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.470
Saraniah Aston: Intention is a word that catches me

142
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A symbol of that intention.

143
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome.

144
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel when you gaze on the white that negative space out there.

145
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.570
Saraniah Aston: Little lonely.

146
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.820
Saraniah Aston: Scary.

147
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

148
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Scary.

149
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:44.580
Saraniah Aston: Well let's look a little bit of opportunity, perhaps for something that I don't know what it is.

150
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's play with that just playing. First let's play with

151
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you sit with consciousness of lovely that's in the negative space. It means you'll have to sit with a little bit

152
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right within a little longer. Look at your negative space kind of left that in

153
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And just see

154
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What's missing here.

155
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you like on this page.

156
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.790
Saraniah Aston: Flowers.

157
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get some farmers. Notice where you want to put them just notice where you're gravitating if it's hesitancy will it come from the edge.

158
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to keep it far away from the wound. Will it be far away, or do you want it nearby just pay attention to. You just see where you gravitate. All right, just tuning in to your

159
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.040
Saraniah Aston: Chain.

160
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.650
Saraniah Aston: Coming from the box, but I think I stole your idea kind of

161
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I didn't come up with these are none of mine. I don't know any of these ideas I get them from I just kind of taken in my own. I don't know. Like, they're not mine.

162
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I picked this up from somewhere else. Right. I might I'm even wondering if I hang up this

163
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.170
Saraniah Aston: Flowers.

164
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I like it when intention has its own special little thing. Let me see.

165
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

166
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.470
Saraniah Aston: Awesome hard

167
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Heart with a little cross

168
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.940
Saraniah Aston: Were hurt supposed to be in front of the cross. The cross means don't enter kind of

169
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.240
Saraniah Aston: Heart is overpowering the cross

170
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.670
Saraniah Aston: By standing in front

171
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we've got intention.

172
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

173
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were to just sit with dualism, which you sit with in this one image. What if we

174
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Made it even more dualistic which means we pulled these concepts further apart and we took what is in that symbol there. How would it change if we can take whatever fear ambivalence hesitation and put it

175
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: consolidated into the Zip drive and put it in there. So you take, take a look at your symbol with the heart and across. See if there's something, how it can transform. Let's get, let's get it in that box. See if there's a way to get that

176
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.230
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

177
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it. What would it take

178
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Other steps involved as it happened with magic.

179
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.090
Saraniah Aston: You know, just

180
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

181
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get right. And we've already had stuff in motion. For me, the arrows and for you. And then with these fines with the different

182
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get where you're working very hard right now. So let's see if we can get some symbolism what looks like.

183
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Going from this

184
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Conflicted

185
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.220
Intention

186
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting whatever negative about it and kind of Zip drive in it, getting it compacted down

187
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Through willpower and what does it look like, how do

188
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:55.500
Saraniah Aston: I put my symbol in there which is three small circles and it try

189
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.600
Saraniah Aston: Why it's always been a little simple

190
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: See

191
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.260
Ya.

192
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Three small circles. Okay. Yeah. And there's the heart and it's in there. I don't see what, where's the triangle is how

193
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.300
Saraniah Aston: Oh, the, the, they sit in a triangle.

194
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it now. Yeah, I had my know and i true another triangle. But now I see what you're saying.

195
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.660
Saraniah Aston: And sometimes they're just dots. But yeah, I love that. OK.

196
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So now.

197
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.410
Saraniah Aston: It just reminds me of me. That's all.

198
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.090
Yeah.

199
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So now that symbol of above for intention. Let's look at it looks gaze out it again.

200
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see what becomes available. See how it can transform

201
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: With what you just put inside that trauma box or negative

202
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Black box.

203
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that, because it records everything black box, kind of like in an airplane like that.

204
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

205
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that. That's the black box right of our conscience.

206
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But okay.

207
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can go to it when we want to. So how does our

208
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.750
Shadows.

209
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

210
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that transform up top tension.

211
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.080
Saraniah Aston: What do you mean how does it transform like what do you, what do you mean by that.

212
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So at first. So I draw this heart and I see this cross on it.

213
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And so somehow you know your your heart with the with the cross right through willpower gets to hear

214
00:24:49.800 --> 00:25:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't see how it got there. I'd love to see in symbol how he did it. Those dots just sort of BAM and was it magic is is willpower magic. What is it,

215
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is hard stuff.

216
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.770
Saraniah Aston: Willpower I think

217
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.180
Saraniah Aston: It's determination to live.

218
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.300
Saraniah Aston: Well, at least in my, in my

219
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.000
Saraniah Aston: For me, at least.

220
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, so I know willpower.

221
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.370
Saraniah Aston: determination to blast has everything else.

222
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.800
Saraniah Aston: Negative that tries to drag me down and live

223
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Why does it work on something like this before, which had to do, maybe with channeling that anger member we've used that before and now I've heard this word blast it makes me wonder if we can use it now.

224
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.090
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, because that is a there is anger there.

225
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh right, with blast.

226
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's see if we can do it. So I want you to sort of see what comes up for you and your imagery

227
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What can happen if transforming that heart with right with that sort of mixture of positive and negative and that imagery. See if you can blast it somehow.

228
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And they always need plans gravity in those little dots and then they land inside the box. How do we get this last experience with determination. How do we get that transformation. So, the intention is pure and simple. I'm conflicted.

229
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.720
Saraniah Aston: Though I feel like a very close to delete.

230
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

231
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so let's just, well we can we can go back to this imagery in a second for a noun little analytical for a second. I'm watching

232
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

233
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to fuel determination.

234
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it thrive on survive on what is determination fueled by to terminate live, what does it really feed on.

235
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.780
Saraniah Aston: What is Determination. Determination.

236
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, come on, come look at me try.

237
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To come outside of ourselves to recognize

238
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I look like a determined woman in general.

239
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:42.840
Saraniah Aston: Well,

240
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.010
Oh,

241
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.270
Saraniah Aston: You know, you seem kind of

242
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.400
Saraniah Aston: Chill.

243
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Chill. Okay. Do you think I used to be.

244
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.550
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

245
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what came up was it and he going to school, was it sitting friend Sam, what do you think just came up for you around. I used to probably be determined now and chill.

246
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.360
Saraniah Aston: Oh no, I'm talking more in

247
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:17.460
Saraniah Aston: Our own from when we've been like the beginning of our being able to reverse speaking and to. Now that's what I'm talking about.

248
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can use that. I'll go with wherever you are. So we can take that we can say the client therapist, the right that relationship we can say, I used to look determined right

249
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:38.490
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, with your not knowing me with your glasses on and with just a straight shooting questions. Yeah, that was determination.

250
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Great shooting and my glasses on and now until

251
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.460
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

252
00:28:50.010 --> 00:29:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: How does. Notice how I'm directing I'm still directing a lot of this color this black that are still coming at you with a bunch of invitations and questions.

253
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.350
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I guess you're yes

254
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how are they different. How do you feel different.

255
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: One feels like ooh this woman's determined versus something else going on in here.

256
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.690
Saraniah Aston: Actually know when you when you put it like that. No, I would say, you're definitely determine

257
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.030
Saraniah Aston: It's more dedicated and both dedicated and determined

258
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

259
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.400
Saraniah Aston: What but what determinations speeds up. That's what I'm trying to figure out

260
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And try and hypothesize on me. Why am I so determined. What's my agenda doing this.

261
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.840
Saraniah Aston: Because it's your passion.

262
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.720
Saraniah Aston: Because that's what probably keeps you going

263
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.250
My passion.

264
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.520
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, your permission.

265
00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it only to ask questions that people are gonna have a hard time answering

266
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.630
Saraniah Aston: Know it's the whole picture.

267
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

268
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:07.260
So,

269
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're almost there. You're almost there. So I'm fueled by what what keeps me asking these questions that give me the whole picture. What fuels that

270
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.720
Saraniah Aston: It's not an option.

271
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm asking, we're trying

272
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To take looking at me, though I know it's uncomfortable.

273
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but then we'll come back to you. I'm pretty good at grabbing hold of what looks like very loose ends and pulling it back together. So just look at me.

274
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at this lady right, she's still determined. She boy fueled by something, why she's so determined. Hi. How does she keep going. What does she motivates me and trying and

275
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying and guess what

276
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.010
Saraniah Aston: I would say perhaps that is a little bit of

277
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.840
Saraniah Aston: Willpower as well.

278
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:12.930
Saraniah Aston: I mean, you would have to keep going, dealing with difficult things but

279
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we sit with that let's let go of willpower. That's very good.

297
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, care, homeboy. And if this was outside of the therapeutic relationship, what would this look like

298
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.480
Saraniah Aston: I don't know, maybe some sort of a friendship.

299
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. And I would

300
00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.490
Saraniah Aston: Care.

301
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and care goes by a lot of different names. It's a range of what

302
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.290
Saraniah Aston: Will love

303
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's it. You found it.

304
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. Now, look at your paper.

305
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, here we go, here we go. What fuels your determination to live what fuels.

306
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.760
Saraniah Aston: My daughter.

307
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that love that solid pure perfect love on ambivalent perfection.

308
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we blast it with an axe. What about an exploding. Look at the heart. How do we explode without truth of what love is.

309
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And let go of any hesitation any mixed feelings about your intentions, your intentions are loving

310
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's your image I can looking at it right now and I've our

311
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Formula got something going on but yet the cup from you. How do we take a blast. How do we move from this energy of what a blast is and we use this perfect love

312
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This intention to lose the symbolism.

313
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That x on on the bars. How do we do it. Can you do it.

314
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:25.080
Saraniah Aston: Just by remembering

315
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.230
Saraniah Aston: Be aware

316
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.810
Saraniah Aston: By being clear headed

317
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:41.040
Saraniah Aston: So that you can come back what matters.

318
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking

319
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.400

320
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I haven't heard the last reading yet so I am determined that I persevere here working hard to help you get there.

321
00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I just so want you to feel the blast and you haven't said words that sound anything like it yet.

322
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:12.060
Saraniah Aston: Will I've decided to save up and I'm going to Israel, where the next three months.

323
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:12.900
I'm hoping

324
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.230
Saraniah Aston: And that's all I'm doing it all by myself.

325
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.330
Saraniah Aston: So,

326
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to, you're going to need determination and when you get the symbolism, because you've already taught me the front of the first time first time was all about those questions. The second time I met you I realized

327
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to need to use imagery. We're going to need to kind of pull in concepts of archetype and collage and drawings and we're going to need to leave those in. So I am determined right now that you get. Look at your little heart.

328
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing right up here. See this

Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm so corny but you said

334
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I may just say goodnight.

335

341
00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The woodwork comes father and ugliness from from me meant unconditional love and a brother that's so confusing and out of the woodworks they'll come and they will continue.

342
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.140
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

343
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:20.160
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I know. That's what I'm I'm realizing that to that it doesn't really end. So you have to see. I find some way to deal with it koeppen be just my own personal

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:21.780
Saraniah Aston: What

345
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.750

350
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back to me. What is it that I do, again, we do every time, even though I see someone who probably doesn't have a great first impression of me.

351
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Know when someone does not like me. I can tell. That's okay. But what did I do instead, what did I do, what did I

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your anger doesn't

Gwenevere Abriel: When your dad says something really

424
00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:22.680

Gwenevere Abriel: Can come here, right here.

427
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We decide

428
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We decide how we're going to feel about this moment. And if you say you want to feel good. Then you come here, you come to this love this simple intention over and over and over.

429
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.720
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

430
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.250
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I think that's where the journaling will really help you

431
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.690
Saraniah Aston: Because I need that. I need to come back.

432
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see how your I use this word seduce

433
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just so familiar to take on these accusations and these insults of other people. It's just so like

434
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mind. I get it. I'm the one that's right. A fan unwanted there it is again, there it is again. And there it is again and they hurt and they're so real.

435
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:35.910
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

436
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't feel good.

437
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:44.310
Saraniah Aston: Boy, we have to have a lot of control.

438
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can we can play all these all these fancy terms, you know, and my this and my dad and we can simplify. Right. We can just zero in tunnel vision.

439
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If my intent have this explosion of the

440
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: End to break free of fear right and anger that being sort of lost that containment is

441
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to stay there.

442
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's what these other things are

443
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You just stay there.

444
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember over and over, and it might take doing it 3040 times a day.

445
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then

446
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Then 20

447
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then 10 and then two

448
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And then once a week.

449
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, it becomes so habitual that this other way of doing you and it's just unpleasant and I don't wanna

450
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.340
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

451
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What these other habits, so

452
00:46:51.870 --> 00:47:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me just give you another chance to look at your page and remembering how we started. I invited you to put in that containment of all of this trauma and hurt and keep it contained and then to put in place.

453
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: In the negative space all the rest of your consciousness, all of your other awaken us all there.

454
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a step back and why don't you tell me what you see your created. Okay.

455
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: See

456
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.640
Saraniah Aston: I see timeline wasted.

457
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.450
Saraniah Aston: To focus

458
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.510
Saraniah Aston: I need to

459
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:54.090
Saraniah Aston: waste time on all this shit that happened and starts to destroy me.

460
00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:05.940
Saraniah Aston: Because if I don't focus on her and I let this these people in these things take over. I won't get anywhere.

461
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of take focus and

462
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what science will tell you about focus

463
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For some brains. It's more natural than others. Okay. And you've had a large barrage of demand from your limbic system that you attend to self preservation. It has demanded.

464
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That you see the US, the other people as dangerous and risky. And so it's a lot to ask you to turn that focus away from life threatening all it's a lot to ask of you.

465
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.020
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

466
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.060
Saraniah Aston: I guess there's a point where I'm gonna have to leave those

467
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.950
Saraniah Aston: Not leave them behind necessarily completely, but

468
00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.550
Saraniah Aston: Kind of leave, leave them to

469
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.320
Saraniah Aston: Live

470
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.430
We

471
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just leave them here.

472
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:05.880
Yeah.

473
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice that I have this little love bombs everywhere, right.

474
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.370
Saraniah Aston: Like protective barriers.

475
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So for me, what was coming up with. I really want this, this guy to just completely like expand into this blast. Now, you never get to that imagery, but boy, I sure had it when I'm starting

476
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:29.400
Saraniah Aston: To hear

477
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.360
Saraniah Aston: You kind of did for the both of us actually

478
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To

479
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.840
Saraniah Aston: Recognize, okay. I have a feeling it's gonna come anyways.

480
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.760
Saraniah Aston: Because when I'm done talking to you. I usually think for like a few hours.

481
00:49:49.980 --> 00:50:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, did in me. And when I place for me help care for that looks a lot like love when I have that it's pure and simple in my daughter. I need to focus when I'm focused here. The rest of it.

482
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Plus important

483
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:11.550
Saraniah Aston: Yep, this is

484
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: My focus up. You're trying to distract me again. Oh, and it's going to get intense

485
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.100
Yeah.

486
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm here will do this together, but you have you

487
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to add, I can't handle this. You don't even have to know how you're going to get there if you have enough faith that this focus on your daughter is enough.

488
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just come back to it. Come back to it. You can breed and come back to it and you redraw this you re collage it and you manifest this over and over and over and over until it's automatic. And, well, then she's back here.

489
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're there or whatever.

490
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.560
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I hear you.

491
00:50:53.670 --> 00:51:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some breathing. Let's see where we ended today you set your intention with. I want to feel better.

492
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You did to make that happen. You did some cool stuff in here. What did you do

493
00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:13.500
Saraniah Aston: You

494
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.650
Saraniah Aston: Do some symbolism.

495
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.690
Saraniah Aston: Little box to put things in

496
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.480
Saraniah Aston: And

497
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:38.220
Saraniah Aston: I feel a little bit more control and I feel so good and I feel a little bit. I feel definitely reminded of what's important.

498
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.370
Saraniah Aston: And that gives me strength.

499
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:43.230
Saraniah Aston: Oh,

500
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.820
Saraniah Aston: Right, okay.

501
00:51:47.190 --> 00:52:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep determination. Remember we said what kills and determination is is sort of like our little tasks. It's like, that's how I go get that water bill that's how I make sure that I really do know where my passport. That's how I make sure those

502
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the evidence of our determination and is fueled by that imagery

503
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intention. Your loving intention of your daughter, and you don't complicated with

504
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let that be the day and then do that again tomorrow as best as you can. And yes, it will start to fall away, but we'll come right back to it and that journaling, like you said,

505
00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe take what we didn't hear really fine tune it so it's nice and tight and clear post it somewhere. Come up with a mantra, something that really resonates with you and then you can remember it.

506
00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:44.160
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, well I got a whiteboard to who is markers. So I get to have that to daily

507
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:45.780
Saraniah Aston: That's right.

508
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And look where it was way up to the top going to get there. Okay.

509
00:52:52.950 --> 00:53:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's neat. You had some cool things with the stairs, you know, away from chaos. I don't know how I'm going to get this space, but I know the focus is my loving intention with my daughter and back to it again. And believe it or not, what we're talking about right now, when someone insults.

510
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This may seem like what does one half with the other it absolutely has something to do with it.

511
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You have you have no extra time to waste. You've got to love yourself, you've got to love your daughter to waste not in entertaining there insult.

512
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Entertaining a criticism.

513
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a distraction. If it really helps you focus then you listen and you read it. Okay. Well, alright, it's not going to help me. It is not helping. I need to stay focused and on you go

514
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: On

515
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And off you go.

516
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:52.380

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.230
Saraniah Aston: You just like you.

519
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Freedom. I have is hard earned. Once you get yours, then you can teach other people. And guess who you're going to get to teach it to your job.

520
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: She won't be a little badass.

521
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

522
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:17.850

529
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But if that doesn't work. We can play with different days and times while there's still a chance they're going to get booked up pretty quickly. Right now we've got some places.

530
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:54.480
