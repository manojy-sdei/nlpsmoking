00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.639
Richelle Direny: Okay.

2
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.059
Richelle Direny: So,

3
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:30.000
Richelle Direny: I said I looked at the arm to see if you show it, and I'm like, oh, it's 12 o'clock, he's not coming but. Then a minute later, I saw because I'm like, I know I sent him a message.

4
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.460
Richelle Direny: To remind him of his appointment and then I guess then they turn around and cancelled it

5
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.580
Richelle Direny: And I said, Okay, I'll put them on my calendar for Friday because I do you typically don't have sessions on Fridays. But I stopped putting them on my calendar for Friday. I'm like, oh, he and he was showing up.

6
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.940
Richelle Direny: One minute later, okay, okay.

7
00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:02.850
Richelle Direny: So hold on, let me get to what I need to use to do your assessment. So given that this is the first time because typically for new patients that I'll see them in group before I do the

8
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.360
Richelle Direny: The their intake. So this is kind of given that this is your first time outside of meeting with the provider. So typically, I'm going to be your counselor.

9
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:25.380
Richelle Direny: We have groups on Thursdays at 12 noon and at. So kind of going over like an overview of what is to come after this. So we have the intake. I mean,

10
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:38.070
Richelle Direny: Groups are in Thursdays at noon and at six o'clock, whichever is more convenient or is better for you. It was at 12 o'clock, but I opened it up because I know that noon is

11
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.340
Richelle Direny: I mean six o'clock, people are more available at noon, because in the evening, because of work.

12
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.670
Richelle Direny: So I had the first group yesterday at 12 and

13
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.440
Antonio: That's only on Thursdays.

14
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.670
Antonio: To job on Thursday.

15
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.920
Richelle Direny: What time do you get all four

16
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.690
I go

17
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.660
Antonio: I work from 5am basically to like 2530

18
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.080
Richelle Direny: I'm the one thing that I can recommend is that because it is only on Thursdays.

19
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.080
Richelle Direny: I run a group that is outside of Natalie on Tuesdays at 8pm

20
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.250
Antonio: I definitely do that work. My other job I'm using wednesday thursday Saturday.

21
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.310
Antonio: For like 930

22
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.090
Richelle Direny: So I will let them know

23
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.060
Richelle Direny: And I will let the doctor who I co host with on on the Tuesday night groups to let them know that you'll just come to that group.

24
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.550
Richelle Direny: Because it's very difficult for you to

25
00:02:48.450 --> 00:03:00.720
Richelle Direny: Attend the Thursday groups but yes right now this the only group that she does is on Thursdays and so like I said it's the two groups. So we'll just have to figure out how they'll do your Prescription refills because they're done on a weekly basis.

26
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.580
Richelle Direny: The other part of it is so outside of the group. So that's important. So with a Suboxone maintenance program.

27
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.980
Richelle Direny: You're doing. It's the maintenance. It's not just about them prescribing you giving you the prescription on a weekly basis. It's attending

28
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:32.040
Richelle Direny: Groups, as well as individual and at the end of our session today, we will, I will make a follow up appointment with you based on your availability date and time and then from there on, we will we will schedule accordingly. Okay.

29
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.330
Richelle Direny: Um,

30
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.230
Richelle Direny: We always ask if especially when we're doing in group is that you wear a headset.

31
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.920
Richelle Direny: depending on you know the setting that. My background, my setting, I will have like the earbuds

32
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.760
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes I don't really like it, so I'm not gonna sit here. Make it a hard and fast rule I know bright heart.

33
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:10.290
Richelle Direny: They really want you to wear it. Sometimes I feel like you're watering my head. If I have it in there. But in the group setting because there is multiple people on this platform and they are sharing you know something about themselves.

34
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.880
Richelle Direny: I don't, it's

35
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.990
Richelle Direny: Not going to be confidential. If everyone around you, your background is hearing what they're saying. So we really encourage that you wear your earbuds

36
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.630
Richelle Direny: For individuals, a little bit different. It's your information. But if you're in a room like I'm in a private room.

37
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:38.040
Richelle Direny: By myself. So that's why I don't wear it. So if you're in a private room by your side, I can understand it. But if you're around other people like you know you'll hear me stop the session that we have here. Jose Antonio the corner so

38
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:50.010
Richelle Direny: So that's, um, you know where it is. Just like you remember getting a reminder from me on. I think it was Wednesday. Did you remember getting a text saying reminding you of your appointment.

39
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.840
Antonio: No, I really did it out whether the email.

40
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.600
Richelle Direny: It was that they would have met a text message.

41
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.260
Richelle Direny: Hold on one second. Let me hold on.

42
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.160

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:06.750

Richelle Direny: Individual or what otherwise just send me a message, letting me know. Hey, Michelle. I'm not going to be able to make our individual appointments scheduled or

57
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:42.420
Richelle Direny: Media Utley of me sending you the text message that you're not going to be able to make it just say, Hey, I'm not going to maybe to make that appointment. Can you reschedule it, that's fine. I'll do it.

58
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:51.720
Richelle Direny: If the date of that's fine, I'll do it now. I mean, of course, I don't want every single time that we're supposed to meet. I'm getting it on the date of 10 minutes or an hour before

59
00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:01.800
Richelle Direny: But I do understand. But if you just let me know that you're if you if you know show and I see consecutive no shows to our individual appointments or even so group.

60
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:10.590
Richelle Direny: Then the Natalie will bridge the script rich means that you won't get your full week's worth of prescription how you're supposed to get it. Okay.

61
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.700
Richelle Direny: So those are kind of the things that I just kind of want to go over that's, you know, a requirement of the program.

62
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:27.630
Richelle Direny: I just want to go over some of those things. Today's session is what is called a bio psychosocial. It's kind of like an intake and it's just information. It's me, just getting your history.

63
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:40.590
Richelle Direny: Your history of your addiction, how long you've, you know, on this this road of addiction. Now you're on this new journey of being in recovery.

64
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:48.960
Richelle Direny: And just your history family history and everything. And then at the end, we'll make an appointment for your new your follow up session in a week or so. Okay.

65
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.950
Antonio: Okay.

66
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.960
Richelle Direny: Have any questions so far.

67
00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:09.600
Antonio: No, there's like, oh yeah, I do. Actually, I do. I'm, I'm actually of course not working right now. And neither one of my job. But I mean, of course, I think I could do Thursdays. Right now we're just trying to make it to the client.

68
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.190
Richelle Direny: I mean, if you ever come Thursday, you are not working then just come on

69
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.310
Antonio: I know I'm not working next

70
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:33.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, so if you're assigned group is on Thursday. If it's better for you at 12 or it's six just come to either one of them. So just do that consistently. The minute you're unable to come to your Thursday assigned group.

71
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.120
Richelle Direny: Due to work, then just let me know. So I can expect you in the next group.

72
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.930
Richelle Direny: Okay, um,

73
00:08:50.190 --> 00:09:01.200
Richelle Direny: Alright, so let's just get started. So in going over everything. Like I said, you know, everything is how confidential it we are on a recorded Pro. This is a recorded session so

74
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:10.140
Richelle Direny: It is, you know, everyone that is a part of the team would be privy but overall it is kept confidential.

75
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:21.990
Richelle Direny: All of our sessions groups individuals. Everything is recorded session and everything. If you do share something that is either

76
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:39.360
Richelle Direny: You, you're saying, or you're feeling that you want to hurt yourself or someone else and you have an active plan then that point you know confidentially kind of goes out the door. Now we have to lead other steps. Okay, so if you can just start by sharing um

77
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.890
Richelle Direny: What is what brought you to bright heart.

78
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.660
Antonio: By drinking

79
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.280
