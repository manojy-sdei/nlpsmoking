00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.720
Jessica Freeman: No, I don't have any and I get nothing. Man, like I don't I don't have an agenda. I mean, I got it to us.

44
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.260
Jessica Freeman: Let's see, I contacted all the people about my bank account.

45
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.780
Jessica Freeman: And the erroneous charges and I followed up on that.

46
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.180
Jessica Freeman: And all my employment stuff done.

47
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:21.330
Jessica Freeman: Like dun dun like I put in like seven weeks worth of certifications still waiting on that but I put I opened a new bank account at Bank of America and

48
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.880
Jessica Freeman: My mom won't have access to this one, which is nice.

49
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:39.450
Jessica Freeman: I'm, I'm surprised they let me open my own bank account. Honestly, like before, like when I first opened up my account under my mom. I'm like, I couldn't get a bank accounts, but now I can, which is cool.

50
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is cool.

51
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.910
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so I got the option of like opening a state like a savings account that's attached to it, which put that on my agenda.

52
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.680
Jessica Freeman: I want to do that because I put my $55,341 tax return.

53
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:09.570
Jessica Freeman: Into my new account because my old account is with Chase and they don't have Chase here and then they gave me like a limit of $5,000

54
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:23.490
Jessica Freeman: For like mobile Check Deposit and it was over that. So I called him. I'm like can you raise that limit. And they were like, no, sorry. So I had to open a new account because like it will let you do anything, like so. My mom was like, Simon.

55
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:34.080
Jessica Freeman: And he was just right, you two separate checks you can revise it. But I'm like, I don't think so, because they won't even let you deposit cash and somebody

56
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:48.480
Jessica Freeman: Somebody else's account like you have to have your ID, it has to be your account. So I'm like, I'm gonna wait on that. So Bob and I went to his bank and we're like, can, can she thought, you know, Can I sign it over to him and then he deposits it and they were like,

57
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.770
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I really have much choice, but I got it done. Yes.

58
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.640
Jessica Freeman: Lots of cleaning I ordered a Father's Day gift. It should be here any day so I can package it up and ship it to my dad and

59
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.120
Jessica Freeman: I got all the ophthalmologist and vet stuff done for Quito I

60
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.620
Jessica Freeman: Got all his medicine and all of that.

61
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:29.760
Jessica Freeman: Good. I still have some things to do I still need to pull my credit report, I still need to call about my student loans to make sure I can get myself out of default for that.

62
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, now's a good time to do that for sure.

63
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:44.550
Jessica Freeman: Well, I was already on that track. I was on like month one of three and then they just started pre funding stuff. And I'm like, okay, but I really want to be out of default because I may want to get another loan.

64
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.510
Right.

65
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

66
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because with everything that's going on there.

67
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that deferments our interest free. I know you know there's a lot of stuff that's coming up right now because of the corner virus for student loans.

68
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, I know now be a good time to

69
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Jump on it.

70
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.380
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, well, I really want is for them to be out of default. That's all I really want. I know.

71
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.490
Jessica Freeman: I had started that process and then all this happened so

72
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.000
Jessica Freeman: Let's see, what else

73
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.220

Jessica Freeman: Well, it's really good. I'll say that.

80
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.450
Jessica Freeman: I had to rewatch these and one just or like watch a podcast on it because it was like, What is happening.

86
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:55.800
Jessica Freeman: But when you do that, you're not really giving a show the chance, you know, like I recommended Ozark to my mom and and they watched like the first 10 minutes. They're like, Oh, we're not really interested in that. I was like, You down at the

87
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.820
Jessica Freeman: End of the first episode. For fuck sake, you know,

88

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's so funny. Isn't it crazy how we get in our own patterns of shopping and our expectations. And yeah, it's been tough, you know, not even being able to go to a store a regular store to buy a pair of flip flops.

141
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy to me.

142
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.130
Jessica Freeman: I agree, man.

143
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:19.080
Jessica Freeman: I've done some online shopping that you just never know what you're going to get. I got this really cute pair of boat shoes.

144
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:29.640
Jessica Freeman: But then it turned out that they were too small, even though I ordered them in my size. So now I have two pair of shoes, one of which I'm going to have to return. Eventually, you know,

145
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You better go sooner than later, because they give you like 10 most places. Give you time limits on her.

146
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.220
Jessica Freeman: Well, they've extended it because they don't have like in store stuff happening so

147
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay, good.

148
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.970
Jessica Freeman: So I have I have I have time

149
00:14:46.140 --> 00:15:00.990
Jessica Freeman: But, um, oh oh you're something awesome happen. So I was, you know, reading, like the, you know, scrolling through like the local headlines. I do this on Facebook and you know feeds me stuff from the local news because I don't like to watch like the actual news.

150
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:12.690
Jessica Freeman: I read like here's what I do I turn on the news and I keep it muted. And then I just read like the scrolling strip is going along the bottom, you know,

151
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.470
Jessica Freeman: Keep

152
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:24.510
Jessica Freeman: Keep up on. Oh, OK, we have you know 5.6 million coronavirus fires cases globally. Okay. Um, and I read that and then that's it.

153
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:39.840
Jessica Freeman: But then, anyway. So I got this in my news feed from Facebook locally here in Albuquerque. The Burke and it said the dare that the New Mexico public education department was conducting like a survey for like parents and

154
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.180
Jessica Freeman: People that have kids that are in school here in like the entire state.

155
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:52.560
Jessica Freeman: So I took that survey and I got to voice my opinion, like they had boxes where you could put stuff in and

156
00:15:52.890 --> 00:16:04.980
Jessica Freeman: You know, I said when I needed a tag. I said, you know, the little kids and the special needs kids need to be in person. So safety parameters, need to be put into place. Okay.

157
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:19.140
Jessica Freeman: You know, the middle and high school kids like the typical kids older ones, let them continue e learning. Okay, and then use it in the middle and high schools to be able to, you know, spread out and you know put these parameters in place.

158
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:28.440
Jessica Freeman: Those kids back in school, as soon as possible. Man, I can't even tell you like the behavioral regression. He needs his fucking therapies, Rebecca.

159
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.800
Jessica Freeman: I need him to have them.

160
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

161
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool. I love when you're able to voice, stuff like that, you know,

162
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.130
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. It made me feel like I actually had a little bit of a voice which was nice.

163
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.360
Yeah.

164
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got all kinds of stuff that's going on. Just keep him busy and, you know, completing list and meet neighbors and just living life to the fullest.

165
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:09.570
Jessica Freeman: As best I can right now. Yeah, as best I can I can I tell you something. Yeah, I know I've touched on this before, but I'm going to get into it.

166
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:28.260
Jessica Freeman: I hate group therapy. Okay, I have been through it for years. This. Can I switch. Can I be in a group with you because Dominic is all like, let's look at this picture of an angel and listen to Native American music and tell me how you feel.

167
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:38.790
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, oh, I'm saying, like, don't waste my time at the shed, like, okay, so she seriously last night she puts this picture on and she's like, just, you know, right.

168
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:50.940
Jessica Freeman: So I wrote this is what I'm writing while I listen, I didn't read this to her. I didn't read this, but I'll read it to you and said, oh, and she's like tied into your recovery.

169
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.580
Jessica Freeman: With your recovery all touchy feely bullshit crunchy granola, I

170
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:09.300
Jessica Freeman: Had to live in a recovery house for about four months during that time. A lot of things are Irritating. Annoying and unpleasant, like this. MUSIC

171
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:21.630
Jessica Freeman: I felt like a lot of the recovery stuff was nonsense. In the beginning, just like this. MUSIC I had to be uncomfortable like 99% of the time, just like with this news.

172
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:46.560
Jessica Freeman: So like when she's like Oh, share, you know, what did you write, you know, I said that, it reminded me of when I had to stay in the recovery house and how I learned to be more tolerant of people and things around me that it was important in recovery to just be uncomfortable. Sometimes

173
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what you told her you didn't tell her I don't like this music. I don't like no

174
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, that was very respectful.

175
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.880
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I wouldn't

176
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.570
Jessica Freeman: I wouldn't want to. I'm not trying to be like that.

177
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:13.440
Jessica Freeman: You know, back in early recovery. I totally would have like opened up a can and just but but dude. You should hear a really good story. Okay. But back when I was in early recovery.

178
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:21.240
Jessica Freeman: I was going to therapy and group therapy individual therapy and I grew up like three times a week and like intensive I. O. P.

179
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.160
Jessica Freeman: So,

180
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.640
Jessica Freeman: It was summertime and

181
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:38.370
Jessica Freeman: Kim was living with me or staying staying with me. I think at the time I didn't have him back yet. No, that was when I was living in Speedway. So, okay, I'll plug you in

182
00:19:45.960 --> 00:20:00.510
Jessica Freeman: Much better. So, all right. So you have to get to group on time, because if you don't get to group on time that close the doors and you can't come back. Now I know this and I'm a very conscientious person when it comes to these things. I'm always early. I don't know if you notice, but um

183
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:08.610
Jessica Freeman: So my mom was supposed to come and get kin, so that I could leave and get there on time and she was late.

184
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:15.840
Jessica Freeman: She made me late, so I am flying like a bat out of hell. I'm trying to get there because honestly it like my therapist at the time I was

185
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:26.430
Jessica Freeman: In Brittany's group and then Brittany was my actual therapist, and I work together for like three and a half years total and you know I have like mad love for it. We went through so much together.

186
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:37.530
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, um, so, Brittany, was the was the group leader and I'm driving, driving super fast and I get there and I'm waiting three minutes and they wouldn't let me back.

187
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.800
Jessica Freeman: Now, Jessica, without emotional regulation and Jessica without coping skills.

188
00:20:47.280 --> 00:21:00.840
Jessica Freeman: was hot. I was mad at me like I called her and I left her this long as rambling voicemail that how it was bullshit and like it wasn't my fault. And all these you know excuses bullshit crazy behavior.

189
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:19.740
Jessica Freeman: But that's not all the group room was like next to the parking lot and so I drove my car and parked it in front of the group room so that everybody could see me outside. I sat on top of my car and basically did like a say anything moment.

190
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:20.850
Mm hmm.

191
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.810
Jessica Freeman: I stayed there for like 45 minutes

192
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.120
Jessica Freeman: I was mad.

193
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your intended group anyway.

194
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but that was my statement, you know, I'm actually kind of famous around there.

195
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For emotion rugged unregulated

196
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not ready to mention

197
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.850
Jessica Freeman: Well I, I was alive wire. When I got there.

198
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now.

199
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.960
Jessica Freeman: You see my life.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So are you planning on ever heard from your work. I don't

205
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.660
Jessica Freeman: Why

206
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just wondering if they have reached out, you know, I have this other girl that I work with, and

207
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She started her job right before this all happened to and her new bosses. It's like they put everybody all of their employees on

208
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On a text chat and so they check in with them regularly every week, making sure that they're, you know, they don't need anything, and how can they support them and you know just really supportive, which is something that

209
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is unheard of really in a lot

210
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a lot of employment, these days, but

211
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was just wondering if they were doing, had they done any reaching out

212
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Man, you know,

213
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.150

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.140
Jessica Freeman: Oh, he just took his iPad outside, you should thinking around on patio furniture.

219
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.780
Jessica Freeman: Like

220
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:30.060
Jessica Freeman: What else you want to talk about, hey, have you had any success with that. Like I'm putting together a group of, you know, autism moms that are losing their damn minds like me.

221
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Actually, let's see. I had

222
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You and somebody else that was kind of lined up for it and then it kind of

223
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just dissipated, we can

224
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Combine a time where we can do a group with you and her

225
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.440
Jessica Freeman: Two of us. That's weird.

226
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A support, support group.

227
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have to ask her again.

228
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.290
Jessica Freeman: But just two people together. That's kind of weird rarely

229
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:04.860
Goes

230
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, two people make a meeting.

231
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.250
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

232
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:30.240
Jessica Freeman: But I get in my mind, and I could set this aside, I really could. But in my mind. It would be like, kind of like your guidance counselor like bringing you into her office and like there's another girl there and and the guidance counselor's like I think you guys should be friends, you know,

233
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's

234
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The third girl, I have to touch base with her again and see if it's something that she's willing to do

235
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I did ask her once, but that was a few weeks ago so

236
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.180
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

237
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's just gotten crazy, you know,

238
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's crazy life.

239
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.170
Jessica Freeman: What's your life crazy, we're

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, ma'am. No, no, no. So what are we gonna. What are you going to put on your list this week.

242
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.930
Jessica Freeman: Email Dr. Solomon and see if I can switch effing groups. I don't think I can handle Dominique anymore.

243
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're in

244
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:22.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wednesday night group. Dr. Coleman and I do Friday group at 130 it's a full group. I mean, there's a lot of people there, but um

245
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a cool group.

246
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

247
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:32.580
Jessica Freeman: Well, I would like, I would like to do that and the time of day would be better to because you know I can.

248
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:44.550
Jessica Freeman: There's definitely a better chance of getting childcare at that time of day and like the Wednesday night is like right before bed time we really went it lets out his bedtime. So when I'm you know

249
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:54.150
Jessica Freeman: Can we have a routine at that time. And I don't get to do that on Wednesdays and I think he suffers for it because you know he needs to cuddles and stuff.

250
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:54.690
Yeah.

251
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.060

Jessica Freeman: Laughter Now it's like that. And if it's a cool group. Awesome, my group looks like a bunch of fucking criminals. In fact, most of them are

255
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:18.510
Jessica Freeman: Which is fine. Okay, I'm a fucking criminal too but you know these like hardcore face tattooed guys that are like prison people like

256
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:21.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Prison.

257
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.120
Jessica Freeman: No judgment, but it would be nice to like have peers that early similar

258
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm trying to think.

259
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.460
Jessica Freeman: Did they all have face tattoos and your group.

260
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.880
Jessica Freeman: Why am I not in that group.

261
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even the females.

262
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.730
Jessica Freeman: Know the females are just kind of come and gone.

263
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:57.450
Jessica Freeman: There's one older lady that's been there forever and she's only on like half a milligram of fucking Suboxone. I'm like, it would be worth it to me to just quit entirely just to save myself that our

264
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:04.740
Jessica Freeman: Seriously, but I'm know the girls, there was this chick named Wendy and she was fucking nightmare.

265
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.100
Jessica Freeman: Sound like

266
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.980
Jessica Freeman: A combination of Jersey Shore and like la bimbo

267
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:14.730
Mm hmm.

268
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.450
Jessica Freeman: She taught like through a nose.

269
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:28.500
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, no judgment, but she was, you know, people get on like when it's their turn to speak and just talk about nothing like nonsense.

270
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:39.180
Jessica Freeman: And then there was a new girl there last night. Her name's Atlanta and she was she's I guess she's only there because she's got like rheumatoid arthritis and she needs the payments.

271
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:47.610
Jessica Freeman: So all she did was talk about the joys of rheumatoid arthritis, with which I can't really relate with that.

276
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.870
Jessica Freeman: I'm like, you know,

277
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:32.970
Jessica Freeman: I had this idea. I was thinking that, you know, to figure out the best educational course for myself, I would look at the jobs that I want and look at the requirements.

278
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.380
Jessica Freeman: Uh huh, but done that I took a few screenshots of

279
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:50.880
Jessica Freeman: Like certifications and like but but almost every, every job requires a bachelor's degree and I don't have that. And I don't want to get that I don't want to commit to a bachelor's degree.

280
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:52.260
Jessica Freeman: They're

281
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.690
Jessica Freeman: already overwhelmed at the idea

282
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.530
Jessica Freeman: I wanted to

283
00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:59.550
Jessica Freeman: Do I'm

284
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.410
Jessica Freeman: Continuing to look into the educational thing.

285
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.430
Jessica Freeman: And see

286
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.680
Jessica Freeman: What I can do.

287
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would you do it online, or would you do it.

288
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would do it online. Hmm.

289
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.710
Yeah.

290
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

291
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely it's a lot better. I think

292
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.640
Jessica Freeman: Safer and, you know, with my time with my obligations.

293
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:35.280
Jessica Freeman: Easier to do it online, but I will still I need him distracted. You know, I need him.

294
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:51.360
Jessica Freeman: cared for. But, you know, maybe I can call the babysitter. Vanessa. I haven't seen her since the whole thing started. So maybe I can get her over here and be like, hey, so this is my class time and that means that you need to keep him the fuck away.

295
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well online.

296
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:10.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're pretty. It's very self as self disciplined. You know what I mean, because there's no wall in the schools. I went to, there's no

297
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:27.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Chat meeting. There's no group meeting. There's no it's, you know, you go into this portal you you know get what the syllabus says that you got to do for the week and you pull out the information and you might have to respond to an email or a string you know about the subject.

298
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's really

299
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do your assignment you turned it in have it turned in by Sunday go about today.

300
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.540
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I've taken a couple online courses in the past.

301
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't

302
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.160
Jessica Freeman: I didn't have much self discipline, at the time, but I do feel like, you know, it could be

303
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:55.860
Jessica Freeman: I could do. I could do it. I could make that work. I could, but not for fucking bachelor's degree. I can't

304
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.000
Years.

305
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Online so i two years.

306
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.900
Jessica Freeman: What a bachelor's

307
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:02.760
Jessica Freeman: And

308
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:10.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, no way. Yeah. All right. Research to your bachelor's degree.

309
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Most of them are

310
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Most I have to keep

311
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: reframing it because most of the ones that I looked into, and that I engaged it because I went to three different different schools online.

312
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And University of Phoenix was for my A Ashford University was my bachelor's and then North Central University was my masters.

313
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And each one was to your senses.

314
00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.710
Jessica Freeman: Then I gotta look at the money aspect.

315
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.120
Jessica Freeman: You know,

316
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.430
Jessica Freeman: How I want to get a loan for all of that.

317
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.290
Jessica Freeman: I don't know.

318
00:32:53.550 --> 00:33:01.320
Jessica Freeman: I just don't. I just don't. I just don't know. I don't know. I don't know, but I will continue doing research I've done some I'll do more.

319
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gather your plaques.

320
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Figure out what direction you want to go in it.

321
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:14.160
Jessica Freeman: Well, I know what I want to do I want to do coding and web development.

322
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.960
Jessica Freeman: And I want to like eventually like

323
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.550
Jessica Freeman: Paying my own shingle and work for myself, but I want, I need the skills and I need the certification.

324
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:36.870
Jessica Freeman: I don't want to go to one of those schools where like you just learn how to code. But then you don't have anything to show for it.

325
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:37.710
Right.

326
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense, definitely.

327
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What else, what else could you put on your list.

328
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.830
Jessica Freeman: Well, let me run this by you.

329
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.330
Jessica Freeman: So Brendan stab

330
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:14.010
Jessica Freeman: You know hates me because I broke his heart. And I think we've been through all that hates me hates me hates me that I've made all the immense I can possibly make to him my side streets totally clean

331
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:23.820
Jessica Freeman: Okay. And then the other baby daddy because Scott's my ex ex husband so Keon baby daddy and Collin.

332
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.410
Jessica Freeman: Collin is in his 20s, he's

333
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:40.020
Jessica Freeman: In active alcoholism undiagnosed. He's hasn't hit bottom yet, I guess, I don't know. You know how we delude ourselves but

334
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.960
Jessica Freeman: He's broke. He's not smart. He's been

335
00:34:47.160 --> 00:35:00.780
Jessica Freeman: Out of work because he's a server slash bartender and like he just refuses to do anything else like his mom his grandma me every girlfriend, he's ever had has been up is asked to do something else. But he just won't

336
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:11.280
Jessica Freeman: And he says he's not getting unemployment and I'm like dude, if you're not working right now because of the pandemic, you are old.

337
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:21.900
Jessica Freeman: Unemployment, he's like, well, it just didn't work out and trying things which makes no sense. But that's how he is right. So I bring up the baby daddies and here's where I'm going with that.

338
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.870
Jessica Freeman: Neither of them ever does shift for me on Mother's Day ever

339
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.100
Jessica Freeman: I think Collin did when we were together, but that was four years ago.

340
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.050
Jessica Freeman: I'm

341
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:49.860
Jessica Freeman: Sure. We'll do something for my baby daddies for Father's Day, like I get no love, but should I like be the bigger person and do something.

342
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does the boys do something

343
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.510
Jessica Freeman: I know I mean can kiss me a Happy Mother's Day slobber you know

344
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:15.630
Jessica Freeman: Lots of hugs and kisses. But no, you know, D. It's not going to do anything and then Brendan, I get texts. Happy Mother's Day text. Happy Birthday tips.

345
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think you have anything to to there's no part in that that you know unless you're you're helping can do something to send you know, send his dad something that's about the only thing

346
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you don't play a part in that. That's not, no.

347
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:40.140
Jessica Freeman: No, and I know and like, I'm just, I'm saying. I'm saying what's in my head to you. I don't like I'm not like

348
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:50.850
Jessica Freeman: That's not good enough or, you know, me, me, me. I just like I just graciously accept what I get. And you know I don't expect anything

349
00:36:50.850 --> 00:37:01.110
Jessica Freeman: More I'm good. I don't need anything but I'm not even necessarily trying to be the bigger person, per se, but like, I don't know. It feels like the right thing to do to

350
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

351
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.200
Jessica Freeman: You know, say something to the fathers of your children.

352
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, I don't see anything any thing wrong with us, you know, Happy Father's Day, but

353
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really the extent of it. It's up to you. What do you want to do.

354
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.380
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. I bet this around in my head every year.

355
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:32.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you want to to send them something for Father's Day card something

356
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:33.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

357
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's your

358
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. The funny thing is, is, imagine what your older sons dad would say if he got something from you offset or Father's Day. You know what I mean, like, wow, what is this already hating on you.

359
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:59.400
Jessica Freeman: I'm sure you know fucking though because he's. I mean, he's, he's a small person. He's just a small person and

360
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.100
Jessica Freeman: He's done like

361
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:09.930
Jessica Freeman: Not all, but 95% of the parenting with Brendan since he was four years old.

362
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:19.470
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. So for Scott, you know, he's a father like he's actually doing the dad thing live in the dad life so

363
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.050
Jessica Freeman: I do think that it's like

364
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:31.230
Jessica Freeman: It's appropriate to be like, Hey, you know, I see that you've done this and you're you're doing this and Brennan's a great kid.

365
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I don't see anything wrong with that when you put it in that context with what

366
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know he has

367
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Been available been taking care of them. You know what I mean.

368
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now I don't that's

369
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A whole nother scenario.

370
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:45.450
Yeah.

371
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.070
Jessica Freeman: Well, I mean, I just told you what was in my head. I would never, like say or act.

372
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it.

373
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:52.680
Okay.

374
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just do it. Just

375
00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:02.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, if it's in your head and you're able to do it. There's nothing wrong with being kind you know

376
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially in this scenario.

377
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.660
Jessica Freeman: And I should do something for bad

378
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.640
Jessica Freeman: This is the first Father's Day. He's been around.

379
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you probably should do something for him.

380
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.150
Jessica Freeman: Father's Day.

381
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Father's Day.

382
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Father's Day stuff is June 12 know

383
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.260
Jessica Freeman: Later.

384
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

385
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.170
Jessica Freeman: It's later in the month.

386
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're still contact in contact with your sponsor on a regular basis.

387
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything's going really well.

388
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.900
Jessica Freeman: I haven't talked to my sponsor in a couple months.

389
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.700
Oh, why

390
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't you guys work on this.

391
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.260
Jessica Freeman: So we'll

392
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.690
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, it's my fault.

393
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:12.240
Jessica Freeman: I don't we all know each other very well. We just met like once or twice before this whole thing went down.

394
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.450
Jessica Freeman: It took me a minute when I moved here to like pick somebody that I wanted to be my sponsor.

395
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.310
Jessica Freeman: And then, you know, we met up

396
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:34.980
Jessica Freeman: In a few times and she's cool and then when all pandemic stuff came down. I was like, hey, you know, let's meet on zoom and she was like, Yeah, that's a great idea. I was like, Okay, I'll set it up and then I just never did. And I haven't talked to her.

397
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:45.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So maybe reconnecting in and making phone calls and getting to know the person that's your sponsor.

398
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.310
Jessica Freeman: I just haven't connected here.

399
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.780
Jessica Freeman: In Albuquerque.

400
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.310
Jessica Freeman: With a right

401
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you've got a strong connection. You know what I mean. Back where you're from and you have to develop

402
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Relationship.

403
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. That's how it works. So in order for you to get to know her, and to be able to even figure out if she's somebody that you even want to do any work with you know that's something else. If you've only matter twice. I'm sure that that trust levels, not even

404
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:47.580
Jessica Freeman: Well, we met more liable, more than twice enough for me to be like, Yeah, this is a good bit i mean i do i do like her. I like a program. And I think we both have same goals.

405
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.740
Jessica Freeman: In our programs.

406
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.490
Jessica Freeman: I mean i i definitely I like I want her to be my sponsor.

407
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'd probably be time to start contacting

408
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Reaching out

409
00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Begin I wanna

410
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.750
Jessica Freeman: I know you know it didn't even occur to me for like

411
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.930
Jessica Freeman: Weeks and then I mean it's not in my daily purview, you know,

412
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.900
Jessica Freeman: I don't even think about it. I need to

413
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:23.280
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Oh, I did want to. I did want to tell you that, um, you know, I think I mentioned that I got some new a literature.

414
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:35.460
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. So I have been trying to incorporate that into my morning like everyday read, you know, between two and four meditations.

415
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:43.350
Jessica Freeman: And spend some more time, like in the books. So I've been doing that. Okay.

416
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. Have you checked out any of the literature for women for sobriety.

417
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.120
Jessica Freeman: Not yet.

418
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.130
