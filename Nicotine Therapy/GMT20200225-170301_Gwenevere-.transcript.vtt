12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.710
Katrinas Ipad: Oh,

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay if I nibble, a little bit.

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.250
Katrinas Ipad: No, that's fine.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm kind of bring me up to speed. What's, what's up with you.

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.480
Katrinas Ipad: Um,

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610
Katrinas Ipad: What's up with me. I'm freaking awesome. That's what

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.530
Obviously,

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.600
Katrinas Ipad: No, I'm

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.340
Katrinas Ipad: Just

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.540
Katrinas Ipad: Trying to not lose my little sticker that has the numbers written on it because I always lose it.

22
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.860
Katrinas Ipad: Um, what I have been up to. You see me okay

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.120
Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.120
Katrinas Ipad: I'm in a different room today so

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.750
Katrinas Ipad: It's the music room.

26
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.330
Katrinas Ipad: Um,

27
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.420
Katrinas Ipad: So I have been

28
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.790
Katrinas Ipad: Like

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.180
Katrinas Ipad: In a different kind of vibe, I guess.

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of i was i mean

31
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.410
Katrinas Ipad: Like an adult life.

32
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.050
Katrinas Ipad: No. Yeah.

33
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.580
Katrinas Ipad: Angling my shit.

34
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.120
Katrinas Ipad: Oh day and it's not like

35
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.960
Katrinas Ipad: No, I just, I felt really good lately. Um, I haven't had like

36
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.980
Katrinas Ipad: It, we're, we're, like, if I get drained from having to deal with anything like stressful.

37
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.660
Katrinas Ipad: From

38
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.800
Katrinas Ipad: Hey,

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.270
Katrinas Ipad: Oh, I went to charge. I told you about that last week. No, not last week, the week before

40
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Me about it.

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.820
Katrinas Ipad: It was great. I had a moment.

42
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:42.990
Katrinas Ipad: I was used to, you know, this perception of like a Catholic Church. That's what I went to growing up. And so I pictured you know the the way Catholic churches, you know, where you don't understand how things are saying that the incense and that

43
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.550
Katrinas Ipad: You know where I always fell asleep. I don't go ahead. I hope that I'm not an adult that falls asleep in church and

44
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.390
So when

45
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to a question or Methodist or something. Would you go to recently.

46
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.730
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, it is Christian, but it's, I think, a non denominational

47
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.300
Katrinas Ipad: And I mean they did a little bit of singing I cried during the singing

48
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.470
Katrinas Ipad: I don't know why I just felt so

49
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
Katrinas Ipad: It was really a magical moment, um,

50
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.020
Katrinas Ipad: Then I did fall asleep for a little bit, but it was, I think, because during they got from like emotional

51
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.860
Katrinas Ipad: Place. Right. It was just emotionally

52
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:41.070
Katrinas Ipad: It was a lot, but it was a good one. But I ended up waking up very shortly after I hadn't slept very well that night though. So I think that was it because I wasn't like bored.

53
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.720
Katrinas Ipad: And it was just, I was amazed. Just how different it was, I mean,

54
00:03:46.800 --> 00:04:00.690
Katrinas Ipad: It was awesome. It was really awesome and I wanted to go last week and I thought it was on Thursday, but it's Wednesday and Thursday. I was like, was church yesterday athletes and she's like, Yeah, and I was like I missed it. I wanted to go and she was like eating go

55
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:11.310
Katrinas Ipad: Because they ended up having a funeral on the neighbor's son committed suicide. So they were dealing with that and it was real rough I'm

56
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.670
Katrinas Ipad: On everybody here. I didn't really know so

57
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.450
Katrinas Ipad: I just try to be supportive for everybody. Yeah, I'm Trinity Matthew this year.

58
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.150
Katrinas Ipad: But yeah, I'm going this week now.

59
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.710
Katrinas Ipad: It's just me and pat that goes, which is Lisa step dad. And it's actually made like a bond for us.

60
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.810
Katrinas Ipad: And

61
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:49.710
Katrinas Ipad: We're crazy because I'm like I'm alone. Nobody understands me. Nobody knows what I'm going through like spiritually wise but he he gets it. He's all trying to like convince me of things. I already have tried convincing everybody else.

62
00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:02.610
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah. And so that was cool. It's nice to have a bond with him, but it also is something because he goes all the time. He doesn't try to shove it down anybody's throat or make anybody go

63
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.040
Katrinas Ipad: And

64
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.470
Katrinas Ipad: He was just really happy that I went and I wanted to go

65
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.600
Katrinas Ipad: I forced myself because I was dreading it towards the like.

66
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:29.790
Katrinas Ipad: I say, like, an hour before I was like, maybe I don't want to go. I don't wanna fall asleep in church. I don't want to be in you know my brain is giving me myself excuses. And I was like, No, I want to go, I want to go and I got there and

67
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.910
Katrinas Ipad: I'm glad I went, because it wasn't nothing like

68
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.100
Katrinas Ipad: A CATHOLIC CHURCH.

69
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.980
Katrinas Ipad: It was just, it was really good in

70
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.980
Katrinas Ipad: A lot of things that I had

71
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.120
Katrinas Ipad: confusion about or questions that kind of just went away and just feel a lot more settled.

72
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Church that I'm trying to think of the name of out here. It's nondenominational

73
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wonder if would be a good fit for you.

74
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not hung up on it. Don't I won't be offended if you're like yeah, that's not for me. But I want to get the name of it out here and they may have that same thing. I don't know where the words escaping me

75
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll probably show up in my head as soon as I'm out of here. And then I'll have to send it to you.

76
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it. Let me try, let me try.

77
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In Western Florida, maybe it's in Western and it'll pop up.

78
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.930
Me.

79
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it sounds a lot like what you just described.

80
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.800
No, no.

81
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't mean to cut you off.

82
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.580
Katrinas Ipad: Oh, no, no, it was probably good because I probably would have jumped or kept going.

83
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.890
Katrinas Ipad: Which I've been working on.

84
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.390
Katrinas Ipad: Simple and trying not to jump off subject which I do a lot

85
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You do, but it's not it's not bad. It's just whether it's productive for you. And so what's the what's helping you catch when you're doing that.

86
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:38.430
Katrinas Ipad: It was when I was talking to the kids. I'd lose them after a while or get off subject and I would go back to my room and be like, I didn't even say what I'm saying, like, I didn't finish.

87
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But how do you catch it in the moment, so you know when you're drafting. How do you know when you're drifting

88
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.880
Katrinas Ipad: When they start to like yawn or wanted to pick up their phone and like the last you I didn't hear much about it again.

89
00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:03.600
Katrinas Ipad: Or they start to fiddle with their fingers or even just anybody in the house, really, when they start to go. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

90
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All the AHA

91
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.600
Katrinas Ipad: And I'm like, oh, I lost you. I yeah nice

92
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So the what's interesting about what you're doing is that the sign is from the outside, you're catching

93
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you're paying attention to this concept of reciprocity, you know, how is my audience responding to what I'm saying. Because it's not just me.

94
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of saying things I want to know whether it's being heard understood retained this is supposed to be a communication. So you're checking in and you can hear the author has whether they're yawning and their eye contact might drift.

95
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder, do you ever catch yourself, why am I talking like, what's my subject like you ever catch yourself self in that. Why did I what started this conversation.

96
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:09.480
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, that I learned so much new stuff and then somebody will say something that links to it. I'm like, Oh, you got to know about this, you know, crazy cool stuff and

97
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.770
Katrinas Ipad: Half the time people are not interested in it as much as I am.

98
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.110
Katrinas Ipad: And

99
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.150
Katrinas Ipad: They just don't get excited, like I do, and then that's what I'm like oh

100
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.540
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, I'm doing it you because I'm like why

101
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.320
Katrinas Ipad: Aren't you excited, why don't you know more. Some people just aren't interested in quantum physics and stuff.

102
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.520
Katrinas Ipad: So when I noticed that the most

103
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.200
Katrinas Ipad: But that's just recently that was I say probably only once knows like yesterday.

104
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you were you and grew up when I was showing you the

105
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The blocks to listening.

106
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:48.630
To

107
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This

108
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.920
Hold on.

109
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.420
Katrinas Ipad: Is the one I took the picture of the yeah

110
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the one where, let's see, identifying

111
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And this block you take every know everything in everything. A person tells you your first back to your experience tell about oh, if they tell you about a toothache.

112
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That reminds me about a time you had oral surgery. So this, this can happen. So you're talking about quantum physics we can end up happening is you end up telling your story you're excited you identify what what they're saying.

113
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you start sharing your stories.

114
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But this can get in the way of the person who is telling the story.

115
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling like you've heard them.

116
00:10:48.450 --> 00:11:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's exciting and it keeps the conversation going. These are all useful but not to be pitched just because they're on this page. It's just if it's always happening, then guess what happens, we never get

117
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay on the topic because if the topic is so and so tells you a story because they want you to understand something, and you're talking about your own story. They may not feel like you understand them.

118
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you're telling a similar story, and now it's off topic. And you may not even remember who started this

119
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And now they're bored with me. You know, it can really start to derail i'm not saying get rid of them. It's fun, it's like oh my gosh I had. Me too. Me too, me too. It's just a can drift.

120
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.700
Katrinas Ipad: Is just to be aware, and if there's thing.

121
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.370
Katrinas Ipad: You know, that was one thing I wasn't doing I wasn't paying attention to wait. They were responding

122
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.350
Katrinas Ipad: And I was making it yeah we make it about me.

123
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

124
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.560
Katrinas Ipad: Realize, I was doing that.

125
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.530
Katrinas Ipad: That pisses me off when people do that. So it was a reflection of myself. Yeah.

126
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The more we know, the more we we can certainly intervene and make some changes around it. Okay. Well, that's exciting. You're getting all kinds of new things coming your way. The, the word I was looking for, um, I think, was Calvary.

127
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.030
Yeah.

128
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.000
Katrinas Ipad: That's the one Calvary.

129
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:15.810
Yeah.

130
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.630
Katrinas Ipad: This one I'm going to

131
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it seems like that's kind of had a bit of an open platform for people to sort of find their own sort of language and sort of way of connecting spiritually. Okay.

132
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you sent me. Let's take some time today and really formalized you could send a text with goals and they let's take some time and actually put them in your treatment plan. I think, I think they're sitting in my clipboard, we

133
00:12:53.190 --> 00:13:01.290
Katrinas Ipad: Have I sent you the them written out on paper. My head jot them down. But I have bad handwriting. So I thought I'd better

134
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.230
Katrinas Ipad: You know, send it to

135
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Take the first one, here's number two. Number

136
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.020
Three.

137
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one.

138
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay if you can, in your own words, because I like to have the goal stated the way my clients, Sam. So they're not about me. They're about you. So if you can sort of make an I want to quit smoking or just make an if statement around the goal of quit smoking, and I'll put it in quotes.

139
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.900
Katrinas Ipad: I have quit smoking.

140
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It. What's the goal was smoking.

141
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.260
Katrinas Ipad: Too.

142
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.700
Katrinas Ipad: Well, like then or now now now is continue to not smoke.

143
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you still challenged with cravings.

144
00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:05.520
Katrinas Ipad: Little. Well, no, not when like there's not a smoker around me, but I'm in. I'm in a relationship with the smoker. So yeah, I still have them and

145
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to remain a non smoker.

146
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the goal.

147
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you want to say it in your own terms. I know and make everything sound so sterile and cold.

148
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.960
Katrinas Ipad: Just simple

149
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it. Okay, we'll leave it then. Okay, so

150
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we have to recognize that we have to put in some objectives in order to get there. So when you you're you're triggered when you're around it. Is it seeing her smelling

151
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or or sort of like, oh, I want to join her. Do you even know what the trigger is

152
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.090
Katrinas Ipad: It's like

153
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.480
Katrinas Ipad: It's not the smell because I really don't like the smell. That's one.

154
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Third of what is

155
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.780
Katrinas Ipad: I'm

156
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.280
Katrinas Ipad: Probably habit of

157
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.680
Katrinas Ipad: Reaching for it, like

158
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:18.900
Katrinas Ipad: I forget. It's like a muscle memory thing and just in the sense, I'll go to reach for and chill out of habit handed to me. And I'm like, Oh shit, you know. And at that point, it's already in my hand. Oh my god, you know, one drag them.

159
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.200
Katrinas Ipad: So I guess for getting

160
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.310
Katrinas Ipad: On let me find a way to put this in words. It's not like too much.

161
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's okay. We're at the objective. So what will come up with a brainstorm together.

162
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine, we'll reach for blankety, blank instead of joining

163
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, sweetheart, and smoking. So it's an action. We don't want to what we're not going to do we want to do.

164
00:15:52.050 --> 00:16:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you see when, when do you know the motion. She's reaching in her purse has received her pocket. She's reaching to the side is reaching the lighter you know it very fast. When's the first time you can picture. She's about to smoke.

165
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.420
Katrinas Ipad: It's like a annoyed. Exhale, in a sense.

166
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: She has an exhale

167
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

168
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

169
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Oh, that's so cool that you know that that's long before she's even reached for it. So it's client will reach for and we'll get to that in a minute. When client here.

170
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: At least via exhale has an annoyed. Exhale. Okay.

171
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. Yeah.

172
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a tough.

173
00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:04.470
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah. Yeah, but it's like something is annoyed her where she's like, I need a cigarette and that's for my which always shut up saying I needed.

174
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And so instead of joining in her so watch to show mirroring validation and emotional support instead of joining her in the smoking.

175
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at maybe we'll do some work right around that particular. I don't know how much time will have, but maybe we'll have to do it next time anyway. So as soon as you hear it. I want you to think about

176
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What you can do, so first thing that comes to mind. Watch. I'm going to do it right now, open your mind.

177
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to open your mind by real quick let's do some tactile put your hand, put your left. Wait a minute. Which hand do I want

178
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Put your left hand over on your

179
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: On your sweatshirt and describe the texture that you feel on that. Yeah, no, a little further over with a stripe is yeah feel feel that describe what you feel.

180
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.740
Katrinas Ipad: silky smooth.

181
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.000
Katrinas Ipad: Span Dixie

182
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, open your mind first thing that comes to mind. If I'm Alicia.

183
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion, do you feel when I just have

184
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what happens after the Huff. If something isn't done what happens after Elise, she is tough.

185
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.390
Katrinas Ipad: isn't done by her me

186
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Mm hmm.

187
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:58.440
Katrinas Ipad: Well, I know what she's gonna she's gonna grab a cigarette. I'm sitting there debating whether I should stay or go

188
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.100
Katrinas Ipad: Because I know she's about to say, great, and I know I'm going to want some

189
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So you actually can register, you actually can think that's great.

190
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're thinking about the cigarette or you're not thinking about the meaning. My girlfriend is annoyed.

191
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not that you're not about her annoyance.

192
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.740
Katrinas Ipad: It's not always annoyed. It's just like

193
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.410
Katrinas Ipad: It could just be

194
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.270
Katrinas Ipad: You know she is like, yes, who's doing on an alcohol serving test for her work and

195
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:51.810
Katrinas Ipad: She had finished like a course or Yeah, little assignment part of the course in afterwards shoot is like

196
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.340
Katrinas Ipad: In like did that and I knew it was time for secret.

197
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

198
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What I just heard was, it's a closure.

199
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the period of an event. It's right. It's the punctuation.

200
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Marks the closure of something

201
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: On one hand, it's an exhale

202
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a solution. Maybe if she's annoyed. It's also the marketing of the end of effort from doing some survey.

203
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something.

204
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see her doing that.

205
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to ask her.

206
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.940
Katrinas Ipad: Depending on what I'm getting

207
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:48.150
Katrinas Ipad: On her five wise it's are you okay or do you need help, okay.

208
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play with that a little bit.

209
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times have you actually follow through it that instead of smoking with her.

210
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.660
Katrinas Ipad: Since the beginning of the year. And that's what I've done.

211
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.710
Katrinas Ipad: Well, the first day I cheated and wasn't even intentional. I just

212
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.430
Katrinas Ipad: She had a tree. I didn't even snap. She didn't even know I'd stopped.

213
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.220
Katrinas Ipad: And I grabbed it and do the Dragon Ball Z cash if you know, but, um, after that day.

214
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:36.060
Katrinas Ipad: I because after I took that wonder, and I was like, I messed up today so I smoked that day. But the next day. Since then, I've just asked, like if she's irritated or, you know, like if

215
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it. Is it does it. Okay.

216
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.000
Katrinas Ipad: meditated Oscar, are you okay

217
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she

218
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.460
Do then

219
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she do, then

220
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.990
Katrinas Ipad: She'll tell me what's wrong, or she'll say nothing. I'm fine.

221
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.020
Katrinas Ipad: She'll. She'll always like the secret.

222
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.250
Katrinas Ipad: Michelle either tell me what's wrong, or she'll say nothing.

223
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine, or she'll tell you

224
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And when she says, I'm fine. To you believer

225
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:21.930
Katrinas Ipad: Oh, yeah.

226
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.290
Katrinas Ipad: One thing about her. She's very honest.

227
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Way, what do you do once she tells you, I'm fine. What do you do

228
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.760
Katrinas Ipad: Go back to what I was doing.

229
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.320
Katrinas Ipad: Try to occupy my mind from

230
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.610
Katrinas Ipad: Not wanting the cigarette.

231
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.580
Katrinas Ipad: It's interesting.

232
00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I ended up asking you what right you could ask her a question but it happens to coincidentally already be something that you are doing

233
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already doing this.

234
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing new. Is that right, you're already when you hear her huff or exhale in an annoying way.

235
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already checking in with her, Are you okay, and do you need help, you're already doing.

236
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the punctuation one when she has put effort into cooking exercising driving whatever and dank. There it is. What do you do then about it when it's the end of she was doing a task.

237
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:48.030
Katrinas Ipad: Is there anything I can help you with, or let me finish that or do this so you can take a minute to relax.

238
00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything I can help with. So again, it's a question. Basically, and you offer some support.

239
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.580
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, that's only if I don't know, something that could be done that they need help with because they always say no.

240
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:19.770
Katrinas Ipad: So I have to just jump in. So if I know she's up with something. I'll just jump in and then she tries to come back and like I got

241
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.270
Katrinas Ipad: Your life.

242
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you accept the nun and now

243
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.510
Katrinas Ipad: You know, I'd stopped doing that because that's all I would get from them. So I don't even ask. I just jump in.

244
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If she says no. Now, after you've jumped in. Do you stop being helpful. She doesn't want to help.

245
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.900
Katrinas Ipad: New they don't ever they haven't told me. No, no, no. Yeah.

246
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just had to know how to order, fine.

247
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're meeting.

248
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Elisa on an emotional level right you're able to sort of still be there with her without joining her and the activity of smoking.

249
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: any pushback from her. Does it seem like this systems working

250
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:16.950
Katrinas Ipad: It's working. I think it's, it's also making her see that half the time he really doesn't want one. She'll take a few drugs and she's like, I really don't want this. Okay.

251
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's

252
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's where our objective comes in client will so it isn't really reaching for something. Is it it's you have access to your voice anytime, which is even better than reaching for something

253
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we can talk anytime. So that's great. So your task is really to do in order to, I want to remain a non smoker.

254
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's basically when you observe something

255
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on an emotional level when you observe someone

256
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going through something either outside of you, or maybe in yourself that you ask, how can I help now. That happens to work intrinsically to, you could say.

257
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I help myself right now. What's my underlying need. Why am I wanting to be more than what I naturally am amplify distract escape.

258
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you can ask that same question of yourself so that one works on both sides. That's nice. So I thought that in here. So there's no actual physical reaching it's more like

259
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A psychological reaching it's reaching out for support to support reaching inward to check in. So it's really not a physical REACH is sort of that psychological one so client will ask

260
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Itself, or other, are you okay

261
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.010
Do you need help.

262
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.020
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah.

263
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your third one. Is there anything I can help with

264
00:26:54.330 --> 00:27:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The actual ad jump, are you. Do you need help.

265
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I will jump in and help. So those are your three tasks that this is what we'll be looking at. I want you to tell me

266
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of the instances that happened throughout the day the times that. She smokes or whatever that you're triggered.

267
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the baseline that you're at. Now, when you're remembering to do it. Are you doing it 10 out of 10 times 20 out of 20 a week. Let's look at it on a weekly basis. How many times is it happening.

268
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.780
In order to make it

269
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.100
Are you okay

270
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.720
Katrinas Ipad: Where is it, where the cravings happening or the me actually following through with those things.

271
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.540
Katrinas Ipad: I can answer both of them.

272
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking for a number, it's going to be baseline currently today about how many times a week. Are you effectively using this skill of asking an offering help

273
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.270
Katrinas Ipad: Oh 10 on 10

274
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.830
Katrinas Ipad: Okay.

275
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.060
So client.

276
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.820
Will continue

277
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing this

278
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Technique 10 out of 10 times

279
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait.

280
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now watch

281
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When I asked you about this goal next month.

282
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I say do

283
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The time so Alicia smoking.

284
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you ask outward anything going on for you and you might start to change the way you talk because it may impact her because it'll be repetitive.

285
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything go on for you. You feel on the right, you know, you might change it up a little bit here and there.

286
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say, Well, um,

287
00:28:53.460 --> 00:29:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How often, when you're triggered, are you continuing to ask these questions inward and outward. And you might say,

288
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing it about five times a week and I might say it's not because you're triggered less

289
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not noticing her smoking. So there'll be more inquiry about it, it'll be it'll be a little different, doesn't mean

290
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to stay at 10 I've got to always ask these questions, a minimum of times, not about 10 staying at 10 because something else might change. You might not be as triggered.

291
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What might become automatic is all of a sudden the meta communication is well someone smoking, they probably are trying to relieve

292
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A psychological distress by relieving their nicotine craving. Right. You remember reading seeing another thing so

293
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be that your interpretation of that that stimulus might change over time. And that's fine. Don't force yourself with this 10 out of 10 but I will be asking in a month how it's doing

294
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any

295
00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

296
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.850
Katrinas Ipad: Um,

297
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.100
Katrinas Ipad: No, I think.

298
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.930
Katrinas Ipad: I mean other than it's made me. Notice

299
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.600
Katrinas Ipad: That I check in with myself like okay she's going to light one

300
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:25.770
Katrinas Ipad: Why do I. Why do I want one, you know, time. This is like a okay she's obviously

301
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:36.480
Katrinas Ipad: Putting off like a agitated or stressed out vibe. So now I'm like super sensitive to her vibes. Yeah.

302
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.490
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, I'm

303
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.620
Katrinas Ipad: really sensitive to like energy and

304
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So Katrina. Alternatively, and later on we can play with this one, it may not always be the rescuer

305
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Someday, it might be a distraction.

306
00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.900
Katrinas Ipad: There's times I just like, I can't go outside.

307
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, perfect. Okay, so you've got some nice flexibility and it. Let's go to the next goal wake up being thankful and smile for no reason.

308
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how often so let's make sure it looks at a few of these. If you're already doing it and really doesn't need my behavior, realizing it. And, you know, measurable timeframes and right, all that sort of thing that I do.

309
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're already doing it, then we'll just assume that you've got a handle on it. Wake up being thankful and smile for no reason. That's April. What are you currently doing.

310
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.630
Katrinas Ipad: I'm

311
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:48.750
Katrinas Ipad: Not necessarily smiling. Like when I first wake up, but I had noticed I smile more during the day now. But what I'm currently doing is when I wake up I

312
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.520
Katrinas Ipad: I, I tell God. Thank you.

313
00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:03.720
Katrinas Ipad: And when I can remember because it's still not have it yet. Um, it's all the things that I'm thankful for, and

314
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.170
Katrinas Ipad: Try to have that relationship with Him without needing something

315
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.080
Katrinas Ipad: So,

316
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: On a daily basis when you're not busy saying solve my problems for me, help me. You want to have a daily gratitude sort of ritual and routine, just as soon as you become conscious

317
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm grateful. Right. Okay.

318
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And why is it that you want to

319
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, the, the, the, if you have this goal accomplished what will it bring you

320
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.400
Katrinas Ipad: Well, it'll keep my

321
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:57.330
Katrinas Ipad: It will keep my relationship with my higher power, you know, be something an actual relationship. In my opinion, it won't just be me talking when I need something because

322
00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:04.530
Katrinas Ipad: I don't like when people do that to me and I don't want to be

323
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:06.720
Katrinas Ipad: This

324
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.040
Katrinas Ipad: Right, I don't wanna

325
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:20.550
Katrinas Ipad: I don't want to be like that in life in general, I don't want to just being what I need something okay and so

326
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:33.120
Katrinas Ipad: And I am thankful for that. I woke up my eyes are open that people I love around me that I'm breathing that the world is still here that there's grass that there's flowers.

327
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:48.240
Katrinas Ipad: I stopped and smell the flowers, the other day, and there was little ladies sitting in a restaurant and they saw me through the window and they got the biggest smile and I was like that right there, that's cool, because I stopped to appreciate something that I forgot to do

328
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:55.710
Katrinas Ipad: And I did it in it. Somebody else saw it and it made them happy to

329
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.130
Katrinas Ipad: And it just, it was like a kind of a pay forward thing. It didn't even mean to, but it

330
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.250
Katrinas Ipad: Is like a domino effect in a sense.

331
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got on wake up being thankful and smile for no reason.

332
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The objective, we've got here is we've got client will increase.

333
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: From so in order to measure something we're going to use this one as something we measure where you're going to be assessing the progress. I don't know whether what you're thinking about in the morning. So what do you, how frequently every

334
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning. Let's take a week seven days. How many mornings, do you wake up right now where you run through a list of gratitude.

335
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.590
Katrinas Ipad: So like three days, three or four days.

336
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.670
Katrinas Ipad: It's not where I want to be, but it's

337
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.930
What made you want to be.

338
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:56.520
Katrinas Ipad: Every day.

339
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay to seven days a week.

340
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.750
Got it.

341
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one.

342
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Find

343
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is a big one. Now this one we can really get into that one's kind of on your own right.

344
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, find my calling.

345
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or purpose by following my passion and heart that's big. So when you stop focusing all your attention on what not to do. I DON'T WANT TO USE PILLS. I DON'T WANT TO DON'T WANT TO DON'T WANT TO

346
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The invitation in a big way is focus on the direction you want to go put energy towards the things that you want to draw in healthy, happy people and really getting in touch and honoring your own a unique strengths and talents, so

347
00:35:53.550 --> 00:36:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what it is. And you're just denying it, or you really do need more brainstorming and we need to do like a career inventory kind of thing what what he would tell me what was going on with that.

348
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:21.210
Katrinas Ipad: So I did that because I couldn't think of what it would be. And so I just started doing because I kept hearing it in in everything, you know, some of my spiritual videos.

349
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:33.720
Katrinas Ipad: My horoscope just kept saying to follow my passion. My even, even in the Bible. It was like okay I get it, I get it, follow my passion and it would lead me to my

350
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.850
Katrinas Ipad: Purpose in

351
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.020
Katrinas Ipad: I know what I want to do.

352
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.110
Katrinas Ipad: And I've been I

353
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't. Yeah.

354
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.820
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, and I actually already have a plan on

355
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:55.230
Katrinas Ipad: See with this shoe thing. It's not just issue. There's something different about issue.

356
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:06.210
Katrinas Ipad: And I'm doing the patent provisional right now to be able to tell people what it is because, you know, people

357
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.080
Katrinas Ipad: Just hear it.

358
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You completely get it.

359
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.830
Katrinas Ipad: But there's a special thing about the shoe where you can alter it right

360
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.090
Katrinas Ipad: Daily and stuff, you know, and

361
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:36.180
Katrinas Ipad: I have my sights set on Nike being the person. I mean, I already have their contact information and they're all their information. I just need to get this provisional done and I pitched it to them. It was cool is that the idea

362
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:43.980
Katrinas Ipad: And the name her just like a it's, you know, because how Nike has just do it.

363
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:52.140
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, well, this would be like a DUI thing or DIY is just, just do it yourself kind of

364
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.940
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, and the shoe that is used specifically the most with people that do this.

365
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.710
Katrinas Ipad: Well,

366
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:08.700
Katrinas Ipad: They, they alter their shoe is Nike Air Force One. So, it just happens to work.

367
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:17.190
Katrinas Ipad: And they've invested the fashion industry they've invested over $300 billion into social media advertisement.

368
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:29.070
Katrinas Ipad: And so they know what people are doing on like Instagram and stuff, what they're doing to these shoes. So they're going to know that there that their specific shoe is being altered in that way.

369
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.520
Katrinas Ipad: And it's such as like

370
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:39.450
Katrinas Ipad: Easy idea, but it's it's really not because I'm like, I didn't, nobody think of this yet, because

371
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: This is because

372
00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This specific timing universe. The need don't fight it.

373
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:59.130
Katrinas Ipad: Don't know. And that's the crazy thing is is everywhere, everywhere. I'm getting that

374
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:08.130
Katrinas Ipad: Don't doubt yourself, you know, continue on. Don't, don't feel like because I've always felt like, well, not always, but last couple weeks I've been like it's

375
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:15.210
Katrinas Ipad: I'm going to run out of time people it's not going to be in when I finally get it or people, somebody else is going to come up with it.

376
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

377
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.660
Katrinas Ipad: But it takes two different things to make it work. And one of them is from a toy in the 90s.

378
00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.390
Katrinas Ipad: That so

379
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Even I don't want to get too much into it. Let's go back for just a second. I really want to go the direction you're going. But in order to get an objective written, we have to stay quite precise here. So let's stay right here. I want you tell me what's going to get in the way of you.

380
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Making sure you do not get in your own way by

381
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It already being done.

382
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

383
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.060
Katrinas Ipad: Thinking it. Yeah.

384
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:55.830
Katrinas Ipad: Okay, so

385
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're thinking. So that's one of your obstacles.

386
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. Plenty of shoes blouses jeans dresses hats computers cars cups plays. Everything's been done, it can be done better.

387
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Two years.

388
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if someone beat you to it.

389
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is going to make all the difference.

390
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're overthinking it so I want to hear about what that thought is what's, what's the overthink thought

391
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:43.560
Katrinas Ipad: You're wasting too much time, you don't have enough time, you should have did this one you had the idea of course I was 13 but

392
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:50.880
Katrinas Ipad: I've had all that time and then then my that's like my inner voice that's

393
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:02.730
Katrinas Ipad: Then I'll have like my brain or my own conscious thought process will kick in and say no if it was a thing. It would already be done.

394
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.520
Katrinas Ipad: You don't think like everybody else.

395
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, let me see if I got this one. Well, if I thought of it. How good can it be

396
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:20.250
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, it's like the the old native you know put myself down is trying to be there, but then this positive like cheerleader.

397
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.260
Katrinas Ipad: Inner Voice kicks in. It's like, no, you got this. What are you doing,

398
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.840
Katrinas Ipad: Okay, fight between

399
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see it for someone to go the negative. I've got some negative one. So I want to do a decrease

400
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to decrease, you're wasting your time, you should have done it at 13 when you first thought of it. And if you thought it because you're different.

401
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how good. Could it be nobody's going to want it. So those are the negative ones we're going to decrease it how frequently are you are those sneaking in

402
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.930
Katrinas Ipad: Like maybe once a day because I'm working on it every day.

403
00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do you counter it with that gets you past those negative moments.

404
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.820
Katrinas Ipad: I'll put on one of my inspirational videos. The Motivator ones that

405
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.680
Katrinas Ipad: Um, it's called gold cast. I don't know if you've heard it.

406
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:19.890
Katrinas Ipad: So in YouTube. And then there's another one on I think gold hub or motivation hub that when I really like because they

407
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.290
Katrinas Ipad: It's not so much yelling at you and telling you do it, or you're

408
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.670
Katrinas Ipad: Not talking to you. It's motivating you in a positive uplifting way not giving you shit.

409
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.700
Katrinas Ipad: And so I'll go into that if

410
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I want to hear the self talk, you're going to decrease the frequency of

Katrinas Ipad: Yeah, like like once or twice a day if that um

413
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.940
Katrinas Ipad: So what I'll say to myself in my mind is something I heard often one of those videos is

414
00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:00.270
Katrinas Ipad: It's the right time, it's the right settings. The stages that the lights are on it's your time.

419
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.430
Katrinas Ipad: I'm determined. So this is my moment and then determine to live it.

420
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.930
Katrinas Ipad: Got it, or the

421
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it makes me think of how you're gonna laugh at me.

Gwenevere Abriel: Good Slim Shady song Eminem song.

423
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.990
Katrinas Ipad: I know it's funny you're talking about. I liked it so it's motivational in the beginning.

424
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't want to be insulting, but like it's kind of like, yeah.

425
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean like terrified, like, Dang, this is really happening among blah blah but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm terrified.

426
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:22.950
Katrinas Ipad: Yeah. And what I tell myself is this. Okay. It may not be for everybody. They may not like it, but that's okay because drew redirection

427
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.670
Katrinas Ipad: Or rejection is redirection

428
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.170
Katrinas Ipad: Not it's not. It doesn't mean not good enough.

429
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.680
Katrinas Ipad: It just means you weren't the right fit for

430
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:36.450
Katrinas Ipad: That company.

431
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I really like that redirection a rejection is redirection you should, that definitely is t shirt worthy right there. I really like them.

Katrinas Ipad: Yeah.

433
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.790
Katrinas Ipad: It was same that same

434
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:56.280
Katrinas Ipad: I think that one's cold cast. I mean, they get some good stuff. I'm like, that's right, yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Yes.

435
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what we will, we got

436
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know it when you're not achieving this because you'll be having those negative thoughts three

437
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And four times a day, you'll know when progress has happened because you'll be two days have passed them motivations continuing and now that creeped in

438
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and then another three or four days past with none of the Nick. So, you're good. We're going to be able to measure, it's going to be all based on self report.

439
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.950
Katrinas Ipad: Okay guys, fascism.

440
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:41.580
Katrinas Ipad: Course, alright, is my be my my magical thinking or my my resume restricted regular active racism working but

441
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:43.680
Katrinas Ipad: When I'm not

442
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:51.750
Katrinas Ipad: I think it's just more spiritual, I think, but some people may not. I'm still not okay so

443
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.670
Katrinas Ipad: Basically when I'm not on track. I'm seeing numbers.

444
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.240
Katrinas Ipad: I kept seeing the numbers 666

445
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:09.210
Katrinas Ipad: Okay. And I was scared to look up what the hell that meant because to me, that meant only one thing, but when I finally looked it up because I was seeing it everywhere like everywhere.

446
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:19.740
Katrinas Ipad: It's not an easy number to find just anywhere looked it up and it was talking about that you're not on path you're having negative thoughts you're not aligned with your

447
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.520
Katrinas Ipad: Your think you're not aligned with the universe.

448
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.320
Katrinas Ipad: And

449
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.220
Katrinas Ipad: So once I became aware of that and it kept saying, you know, remind remember your, your

450
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:43.920
Katrinas Ipad: Divine oneness and well so I was like okay, cool. I got it and started seeing it live. And then eventually, when I started getting really into like my creative

451
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:58.290
Katrinas Ipad: You know, is altering my jeans and stuff, doing what I enjoyed. I don't care if I'm 30 and I'm wearing pants with patches and things on it. It makes me happy. So I started doing that, I stopped seeing that number so much. And then I started seeing

452
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.850
Katrinas Ipad: A double 11 or 111

453
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:10.890
Katrinas Ipad: And that one. I always see the double 11 on like videos like you know it's the special number like

454
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.250
Katrinas Ipad: The, you know, the

455
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:24.900
Katrinas Ipad: The holy number or something. So I was like, Okay, let's see, when I looked up that one in it it resonated the exact opposite of what

456
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.550
Katrinas Ipad: The other number was saying. You're saying that I was on my path and that

457
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:37.440
Katrinas Ipad: It was all lining. I was like oh my god so crazy. I even showed ELISA and it was. Yeah.

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:38.790

524
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:31.890
Saraniah Aston: Not that long. It was like 20 minutes of crazy pasting

525
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it was. I mean, I

526
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:42.600

532
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.010

533
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.720
Saraniah Aston: For you to do that kind of thing.

534

536
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This maybe initially proceed just cold square linear women white bears turning out and pull out some creativity, who know and then it kept going and kept going. But when the session and you weren't able to keep it going, you know,

537
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.220
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, and

538
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: On your own you were able to get that done.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:44.730
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

540
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought that got it done was, do you know what the thought was, I'm going to get this done.

541
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.720
Saraniah Aston: Or the meeting, so she can see that I

542
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:02.370
Saraniah Aston: Can do it and then I don't know it's just so moved. Proud of me.

Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's fine. It was good.

546
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:22.650
Saraniah Aston: So now, now that I've started. That means, like, it's like safe to keep going. So I'm not like afraid of it, really.

547
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:32.310
Saraniah Aston: It's just starting it. That's the hard part. Man is that the truth. Mm hmm.

548
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's funny. It's kind of like when we think, Well, I want to go to this polities yoga class right I know when I'm there, I'm having a good time. I like feeling my body in motion. Right. I like it when I'm there, but I don't like getting there.

549
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:49.980
Saraniah Aston: I think

550
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.980
Saraniah Aston: Planning for it or yeah

551
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness, that's, that's the difficult part

552
00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.420
Is that getting it started.

553
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.010
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I'm a serious procrastinator.

554
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:09.150
Saraniah Aston: Very real.

555
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So can we just talk about that for two seconds. And this is a

556
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Very oversimplified theory on procrastination. But it's an interesting one, given what you just said that I wanted to get it done before the meeting.

557
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.210
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

558
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The watch if we both agree, we'll use the word constraint for this meeting. It was a set time. You and I are going to need today was it before the group.

559
00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Or today.

560
00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.220
Saraniah Aston: It was that I started doing this.

561
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That it got done

562
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.930
Saraniah Aston: It was before I went to bed.

563
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic. So this is such a great example. It's really cool.

564
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to call today's appointment of constraint.

565
00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:56.220
Saraniah Aston: Now, if

566
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I had called last night and I said,

567
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I'm terribly sorry I'm my

568
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Blah, blah, blah, blah. And I have some excuse that I need to reschedule.

569
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's meet this weekend.

570
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The constraint would have moved that timeline that deadline would move forward.

571
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.240
Saraniah Aston: And

572
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'd be left with just you.

573
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Should see it.

574
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.220
Saraniah Aston: And yeah.

575
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I have gotten score me and said, Yeah.

576
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:36.060
Saraniah Aston: I'm pretty sure I would have

577
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's so cool that you're getting this in real time. This is this phenomenon like everybody we all think, well, I'm the worst pronounced procrastinator. We all are. We're

578
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All terrible procrastinators but really

579
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:51.450
It's that

580
00:57:53.490 --> 00:58:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Have constraints we don't have deadlines. So for example, if you're, you know, an entrepreneur.

581
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm trying to put together a website will use an example. There's no deadline.

582
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.470
Saraniah Aston: It's taking your, your, your own. Yeah, no.

583
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no deadline. I keep pushing it like this, push, push, but it's not it's not even pushing it. It's not there.

584
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.120
Saraniah Aston: And stressing yourself out completely. I do that I so do that.

585
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but look how the reality of the constraint. You know, I didn't say or your bar nota or collage or you're not going to get your medicine.

586
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.630
Saraniah Aston: You know, like you

587
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Know is actually no negative repercussions for it. But you said it was all in your head.

588
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.950
Saraniah Aston: completely, totally, absolutely.

589
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that so powerful.

590
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.810
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. It is

591
00:58:55.770 --> 00:59:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it can work for us when we do our treatment planning and this is for a lot of people to. They're like,

592
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to hear about that silly goal one more month that whenever she brings up these darn goals every single month. I don't want to hear about it. I'm just going to do it so sorry to hear about it could work like that. Right.

593
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Like as a negative reinforcement. Like, I don't want to hear her remind me of this thing. I have I made a primary care physician appointment or something. I don't want to hear about it.

594
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.140
Saraniah Aston: Again,

595
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just going to go do it.

596
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice. Once you know that about yourself. I invite you. Let's write as many goals as you want, where I can be that nudge, nudge, nudge, and she's

597
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.360
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Yeah.

598
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, we can do all if therapeutically we can do all kinds of interventions, but on paper. Sometimes it's really neat to have very timeframe measurable objectives. So we can say okay

599
00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I taking these newly learned skills, am I applying them to my life so that I can accomplish my goals. And that's really what this is all about.

600
01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a neat thing you just shared we all do that by the way. And so there's this interesting video online. These call this master procrastinator. And he he makes a joke about people that are working on their PhD, you know, it's like

601
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: There's just too much time just not getting anything written. So ironically, it actually works and people usually fight. They're like, I don't want a deadline. Don't tell me walk walk walk. So notice how that might show up. Remember we were talking earlier about the tapering

602
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So initially, I think it's like, well, how, for some people it's how dare you right it's indignation and anger and fear really is behind it, like, don't take my medicine. I don't want my I don't want those withdrawals. They were catastrophic

603
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's

604
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.400
Saraniah Aston: It's a scary, scary thought really scary.

605
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But if that one. The 10 out of 10 withdrawal is also irrational. Hold on, because no one's asking for that we're asking for

606
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of sweaty just, Oh, I feel like you know like going through the, the change of life, you know, a little bit of hot

607
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Hot sweats, maybe you notice, maybe a runny nose, we have all had a cold. We can all live through that.

608
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's where being a constraint being consistent when we show up when we say, let's talk about your fear what what is, what are the actual symptoms how how intense, are they

609
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It can also be the same thing as the constraint about doing this collage. It's about let's set a deadline. Let's see how you do in there, not you're going to be good or bad at the end of it. But let's just see what happens if you like trying to meet it.

610
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so there's a lot going on. It's not just this sort of bombardment of rules and expectation

611
01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very individualized every person has their own. So I would invite you, as I do, everyone to you're going to hear

612
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe more intense leaning in with some person and maybe even Oh no. Stay right where you are. That's because each person their approach to whatever's going on with their medication is individualized everyone is not treated the same. So right

613
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.400
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Yeah.

614
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so

615
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me look at that again. Let me see.

616
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What percentage in satisfaction. Do you give this one. What do you give it

617
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.220
50

618
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay cuz we you jammed it together and 50 in 20 minutes because you're like, I'm gonna get this thing done.

619
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.140
For I see her. Yeah.

620
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you, when you look at it, what emotion, does it evoke

621
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.080
Saraniah Aston: I'm

622
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:07.830
Saraniah Aston: A little a, little a little bit to complete completely different things. One is calmness and one is chaos.

623
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.270
Saraniah Aston: It's it's a

624
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:23.340
Saraniah Aston: It's a chaotic collage. But when I look at it, it's, it's called me to to make it

625
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:31.050
Saraniah Aston: When I do when I was doing it. I had to go into the mode of being feeling kind of

626
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:36.120
Saraniah Aston: Crazy chaos and doing it really fast and

627
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.950
Saraniah Aston: I'm

628
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:45.750
Saraniah Aston: Making sure that it wasn't all like shiny happy peace signs. But what I

629
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.420
Saraniah Aston: M, which is not shiny happy all the time.

630
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:58.140
Saraniah Aston: But sometimes dark and yeah you know

631
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember probably inaccurately but to some degree. I think you shared an appreciation of yourself that you can

632
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You have access to this skill of being able to witness something and capture taking something chaotic and maybe dark, maybe even ugly and seeing the beauty in it.

633
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.190
Saraniah Aston: Yeah yeah like

634
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:34.560
Saraniah Aston: I really wanted to do a photoshoot with a model.

635
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.290
Saraniah Aston: And I've had this vision for a really long, long time.

636
01:04:41.820 --> 01:05:05.040
Saraniah Aston: Of the model like wearing a long white slowly dress or something like that really pretty and delicate and pretty and but she is sitting in the middle of like a ghetto with trash and graffiti and she's like this angel in the middle of dirt dirty chaos.

637
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.780
Saraniah Aston: Something I want to do.

638
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Have you ever done any self portrait work where

639
01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.110
Saraniah Aston: That's what I do. I do it every day. Okay.

640
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have that awareness, you have you're aware that

641
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe in a sense, you have the ability, is it to see your own beauty and light even

642
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: On the outside, you might be perceived in another way.

643
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:42.810
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Yeah.

644
01:05:44.010 --> 01:06:03.660
Saraniah Aston: But also, I'm only seeing it as very recently because of fear. I mean, like most of my life. I haven't seen it, and I haven't had that much self worth, or self appreciation self love self respect any of that and

645
01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.690
Saraniah Aston: And now it's like I said

646
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.180
Saraniah Aston: It's really intense.

647
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And the resources that become available to you. And I don't mean paper and pen and money, but maybe I do. I don't know.

648
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The resources that become available to you because you're worthy.

649
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The intense right and you have access

650
01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What became accessible to you because you're worthy what's available what richness and resources available to you now.

651
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:44.520
Saraniah Aston: I'm in gauging with other human beings.

652
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.090
Saraniah Aston: Other people

653
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:50.190
Saraniah Aston: Without being

654
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:54.270
Saraniah Aston: Fake and maybe

655
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.870
Saraniah Aston: I'm approachable.

656
01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:05.610
Saraniah Aston: I've been very like unapproachable, and

657
01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:13.740
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, for sure. And that's very, it's really changed a lot.

658
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like even

659
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I consider myself.

660
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensitive meaning. I think I pick up on subtle things I don't always get to announce them but

661
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To get is it convenient for other people. But in your work. It's it certainly has

662
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I might pick up on things quickly.

663
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And

664
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought

665
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I share feedback with you.

666
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.100
Yeah.

667
01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought

668
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

669
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I think Sarah Nia has made up her mind about what we're capable of. And I don't know if she's gonna she's gonna trust me.

670
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember thinking that

671
01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what

672
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my worth

673
01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to know my intention is really good.

674
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:29.670
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

675
01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting, right. There's nothing I can do about your interpretation. I have no right to try and change your perception, but I can come back to me. I can know deeply I have done the work that makes it possible for you, hopefully to feel safe around me.

676
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So I knew that I can't control these people sometimes people do have ill intentions, they're selfish.

677
01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They're insensitive.

678
01:08:58.230 --> 01:09:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Of them are straight up sociopath.

679
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But I still have me

680
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say, Oh, I just got in touch with my worthiness, and it was intense.

681
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The world opens up

682
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:16.740
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

683
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to feel for a moment, connecting with human beings and it's intense maybe also because it's risky.

684
01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: They can really let you down.

685
01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:44.550
Saraniah Aston: It's very risky but it's easier to like get rid of people who are not okay who are not what I want, or who are negative or whatever they whoever they are.

686
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:53.280
Saraniah Aston: If I'm not comfortable with. I don't feel like I have to prove anything to them to make them change their mind or whatever.

687
01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:03.720
Saraniah Aston: Or be different or better. Or I don't fight with them. I just move on without them.

688
01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:06.480
There we go.

689
01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So for today. I'm gonna I'm gonna see if you're open to this. There are a few activities, I would like to do with you.

690
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But because safety and preparation are so important in how I protect. I'm wondering if we could do some activities, really, to start to build

691
01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A lots of resources so that when we do these activities. If you decide to always inform you offer education around it and you have a choice to say no or yeah I'm interested

692
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But either way, the development of resources are useful in imagery. Regardless, so they serve a dual purpose. Can we do that a little today.

693
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.100
Saraniah Aston: Huh, yeah.

694
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It does tap into the right brain, the creative side so you might enjoy it. Let's see.

695
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: First one love this one.

696
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do the we developed the

697
01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We did the protective we did right we've been developing we started we did the nurturing and we did wise. Now I'd like to do a container.

698
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a bit like compartmentalization right that's a term we use sort of colloquially and its intention is to take what you perceive as unwanted distressing negative emotions images thoughts, beliefs,

699
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And put them in the container.

700
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the instruction. Once you just think of an emotional container that is big enough.

701
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong enough to hold all your stuff has a lid, some kind of locking system. If it's not a lock, then something in the container where that stuff will want to stay

702
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So just let your creativity mind go and it can be anything. There are no constraints, except those roles. I just threw out and even then we can break them.

703
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

704
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.170
Saraniah Aston: Now I'm just seeing a bunch of boxes.

705
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. That's beautiful. So in a sense, there might be multiple they might not all sit together maybe they'll be in different compartments or something, but a bunch of boxes.

706
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

707
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:52.560
Saraniah Aston: No, I totally saw a bunch of different kinds of boxes trong with a lock.

708
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:55.920
Saraniah Aston: A panic room.

709
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.430
Saraniah Aston: Like that, with a lot, obviously, like with the steel doors.

710
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.130
Saraniah Aston: And then just a cardboard box.

711
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's how we might use these I might say,

712
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is me telling you how I would use it always as transparent as I possibly can be. So let's say there were in at the end of a session. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, we only have three minutes left, right.

713
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I need to take care of you. Make sure you're not leaving in sort of a high distress, and I might say, okay,

714
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get in touch with our breath. Let's do that. Diabetic breathing breathing at the bottom of the long let's breathe into this and what I'd like you to do is I want you to take whatever sort of that distressing imagery is

715
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you. Sorry Nia to decide whether it goes into a cardboard box.

716
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the steel locked panic room.

717
01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.270
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

718
01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that work for you.

719
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.780
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

720
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you had choice. Did you like that choice.

721
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:07.800
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

722
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful clearly right the construction and what they can hold securely. It depends on the intense right you can picture one thing

723
01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to put. Okay, got it. So this might work really well because even in the moment you might get a sense of choice agency and power. So that might be kind of cool to have that available in the moment. That's beautiful.

724
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And another one. Let's do another one. This one is a distancing, same kind of idea a distancing metaphor.

725
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be right in the middle of an activity with me and you might go like this to me. Right. This will be the sign or you can come up with another one that's like this is too much.

726
01:14:56.790 --> 01:15:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I may accidentally bump into something right where an old thing comes in. Nowhere out of the gotchas. And if I don't notice a dissociative sign if I don't notice something because telemedicine is flawed. Right.

727
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you're not right here next to me so I can see everything. Um,

728
01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say, you know what, let's take a moment and let's take whatever that was in your mind and let's put it on a spaceship.

729
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's shoot it off after space or right. That was one example of a metaphor or it's on a leaf and you're on the shore right anchoring there.

730
01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In the qualities of protection and nurturing and wisdom.

731
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But that negativity. Right. It's so you can't you can't even see it anymore so small.

732
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Away.

733
01:15:53.430 --> 01:16:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Examples of distancing metaphors, but I want this one to be home, see what comes up for you around a distancing metaphor. It's got to be something a bit like in motion because this is a process, but also that it can go further and further away and

734
01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:35.190
Saraniah Aston: Like a high speed train stopping them my station.

735
01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

736
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.140
Saraniah Aston: Moving on to others, leaving me alone.

737
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then moving on to other stations.

738
01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:53.430
Saraniah Aston: And every door closing. I'm not in that

739
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:57.810
Saraniah Aston: In that on the on that. Right. So, yeah.

740
01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.910
Saraniah Aston: It moves on.

741
01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. I'm making a note of it.

742
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: high speed train stopping at my station when moving on to another station.

743
01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Close and I'm not on that ride.

744
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:15.630
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

745
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Beautiful.

746
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have

747
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside from the anchor room which is potentially, you know, three, four session. Very rarely is done in one session. Aside from that, I've done a great deal of the of the preparation pieces.

748
01:17:47.010 --> 01:18:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't mind checking in, just to see your comfort level and developing the anchor room, are you, it's like a safe space. Basically, the, the notion of this anchor room is you know how you mentioned the panic room. You know how you went there with that kind of like that.

749
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This uses imagery it taps into sort of some transactional analysis stuff it it really gets to

750
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting an unmet need

751
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Making sure your needs are met in this space in this anchor room you get everything you need.

752
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a sanctuary for a lot of people when they are in distress.

753
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They're at work. There was someone that is activating the threat response like big time.

754
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They want to run off the job.

755
01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: They, hopefully, remember to breathe.

756
01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: They go to the anchor room.

757
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They acknowledge what they really need

758
01:18:53.520 --> 01:19:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to value my own opinion this is to someone else's opinion, they're telling their story. Whether yakking at me. I need to. I need to take care of myself. And in this imagery. Right. And this is where we have all this imagery setup so that you can go there and get what you need.

759
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: and problem solve.

760
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe the skills need needed in that moment are

761
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Since this guy's problem. So my problem. I've been carrying too much about the outside world and opinion. That's the skill. Yeah, that's it, or the flip side, it's

762
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm not in my humility. I've been trying to be right. And instead, I need to choose curiosity over being right there's lots of things to do in there, but I wanted to be available to you. It's literally has been useful for people when they're trying to work out what to do next. And they

763
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are quick in order to feel okay

764
01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And safe.

765
01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where they go in their imagery and it's just yours. It's exactly what you need. So it does take a few sessions to get there. But along the way, you can run across some pretty interesting information.

766
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you game.

767
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:02.700
Yeah.

768
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's get started. Let's see how far we get today, so I will want to leave about five minutes right at the end, we'll do some dire dramatic thing.

769
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're already received instruction about what that is where you breathe to the bottom of along on the inhale yoga. Sometimes we'll teach that or through other counseling or therapy.

770
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:36.690
Saraniah Aston: Awesome. I just know breathing in through the nose and then slowly leasing out through the mouth.

771
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I typically teach box breathing on the very first appointment.

772
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I remember listening to in group. And you said it's a little difficulty. Get that that breath down there at the bottom.

773
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.630
Saraniah Aston: Right to carry

774
01:20:55.050 --> 01:21:00.480
Saraniah Aston: The full the full breath is something I need sometimes

775
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.010
Saraniah Aston: I don't

776
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:07.320
Saraniah Aston: I don't, I can't have it. Sometimes it's really weird. It's just a physical thing.

777
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:09.150
Saraniah Aston: Is a physical thing.

778
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.470
Saraniah Aston: And I'm really

779
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.050
Saraniah Aston: Being able to get the full breath. Hmm.

780
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm excited. So I next time. What I want to teach. If you're open to it. Of course, if something else comes up. We can shift gears. But I want to teach you what I call box breathing.

781
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's really dire from out of breathing. It just means that you're you're using sort of the mindfulness practices of feeling the air coming in going to the bottom of the long

782
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel got my chairs here. You feel the stomach pushing out on the in breath. You don't feel that when you're having a Shallow. SHALLOW breath because we forget and we

783
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We

784
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We keep our breath UP HERE TIGHT, which keeps reinforcing the body.

785
01:21:51.900 --> 01:22:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To believe we are in a threat response all day long. Cortisol runs. We were always in a threat response, always, always, always, we never give your body a break. And so what this does is it's it's the real shoot now and going into it. I'm not gonna be able to get

786
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:08.310
Saraniah Aston: The same

787
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.070
Saraniah Aston: And this is a trick of the mind or something kind of

788
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't you know how you said earlier it's it's science or biology or something like that.

789
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is actually biology.

790
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:21.510
Saraniah Aston: Oh,

791
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't actually have to believe it.

792
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:25.980
There's no trick.

793
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I love those. I was so excited about it. I was like, yeah, baby. I like those. This my biology working for me. So we're going to go into that next time. Okay.

794
01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, teach box breathing this we're going to do next time. If you want to jump on the internet. I think people call it something else. It comes from my belief Dialectical Behavioral Therapy thing is called square breathing or you could look up diaphragm breathing.

795
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.580
But the particular way I treat

796
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is for in breaths hold for four exhale for four seconds hold for for so it's a box.

797
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.430
Saraniah Aston: Okay, okay. See

798
01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll definitely that would be a task for the next time we need a minute. I'm going to teach that and do it with will take takes a while because it's actually difficult to do. It seems like, oh, I've been breathing all along wise, it's going to be hard. But yeah, it gets hard

799
01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.300
Saraniah Aston: Okay, you know, when you're doing it when it's done.

800
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:32.430
Saraniah Aston: when when when you actually reached it like you know you feel it.

801
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know when you

802
01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Know when you're breathing in the bottom of your lungs, because it's it's a really, it's almost uncomfortable because

803
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not used to doing it like and you know how you can take this big TV breath up here in the chest. You can't take a big deep breath when it's down below. It just feels different. It's

804
01:23:53.130 --> 01:24:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's more air but it's down pushing down on the diaphragm and then pushing down on these lower viscera. These organs down below so it does

805
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.010
Saraniah Aston: feel different.

806
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:02.580
Way.

807
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.650
Saraniah Aston: Good.

808
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time I'm, I'm excited.

809
01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go on this. This is more imagery, but I love when it's going to do for creating a resource for you.

810
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is how it starts, a couple, couple little key points. Number one, no way to do it wrong.

811
01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The way for you to do it wrong. I can bundle it

812
01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I will

813
01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: My point is so that you don't have to think. Am I doing this right. Well, she will. This is my thought, Am I Doing This Right.

814
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.820
Saraniah Aston: You're doing it right.

815
01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're wrong, because you know why whatever comes up for you.

816
01:24:49.170 --> 01:24:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If this is what comes up for you. I want to know. I can't read your mind. So I'm oh I noticed that my tea started chattering. I want to know.

817
01:24:58.890 --> 01:25:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I noticed my hands started sweating. Oh, I noticed my stomach tighten up. Oh, I just, I just had a thought forget this. I want to get out of here. I want to know.

818
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I just I just felt tier coming. I felt sad. Why so so angry, I feel a thought I care about the body. I care about the mind, the soul I care about the emotions. I'm interested in all of it. There's no way for you to do it wrong.

819
01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It will just be really hard for me if I don't if I don't hear about it because I only can rely on. You're telling me.

820
01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So the only other thing is this. It may be tempting to think, Oh, this one a bear. She wants me to go to the memories. That's not actually what I'm doing.

821
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not doing that you decide to go to memories. That's your business. But that's not what I'm up to. I'm telling you, I think it's three, three times, they go to memory. This where this is where

822
01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How old were you, what was your nickname, if you had one if not what you want to be called. And the third one is this

823
01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Question.

824
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you bloody blood

825
01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's it. I'm not going to be saying we'll go through and tell me the memory when you were such and such as that's not what we're doing. If you think that's what it is. Right. You might think, Oh my gosh, I don't want to tell her, and I don't want to relive this

826
01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to you self preservation. You get to modulate how much you share how much you bring into your awareness. Just know that those are the only three things that I haven't said with the third one is

827
01:26:32.610 --> 01:26:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want to do it in the moment, but it's the only it's a message that maybe someone said to you, that's all.

828
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But the rest of is not an invitation for this room to be a room when you were 14 it's not. It's your creative mind putting in that room what you needed

829
01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go.

830
01:26:58.740 --> 01:26:58.980
So,

831
01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Current life Sardinia, when you think about where you are most blocked the most stuck you think trying to solve this, whatever it is, for some time, but, doggone it, it just keeps showing up in your life and you want to make a change around it.

832
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you blocked around

833
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.470
Saraniah Aston: Definitely um

834
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:37.560
Saraniah Aston: I would

835
01:27:38.730 --> 01:27:44.280
Saraniah Aston: I automatically think of something like Facebook and deleting a bunch of people

836
01:27:45.390 --> 01:28:05.040
Saraniah Aston: And doing that over and over again and then coming back and me Julian and over and over again being offended or reading things the wrong way, not giving them a chance to explain, not caring just shoving them done gone over with by

837
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me lean into that a little bit so I can understand more. When you see on Facebook, time and again that you are. Let me see if this is right. I might be wrong misunderstood.

838
01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it

839
01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.780
Saraniah Aston: Yep. Yeah, yeah.

840
01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If somehow you can have a banner that just constantly running

841
01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I constantly right under here.

842
01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:39.870
Saraniah Aston: You're

843
01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Here are my intentions. What was your banner say

844
01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:51.030
Saraniah Aston: God, the same thing. It always says I'm

845
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:55.500
Saraniah Aston: I know that I seen

846
01:28:57.030 --> 01:29:00.960
Saraniah Aston: This way cold or crazy or

847
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.220
Saraniah Aston: I'm up and down.

848
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.260
But

849
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.930
Saraniah Aston: That's just the way

850
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.920
Saraniah Aston: I am now I

851
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:19.170
Saraniah Aston: Don't have time. Yeah. Okay.

852
01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:20.130
Go into that a little bit.

853
01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:29.730
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. That's what I would write. Usually it's like I i are at least I used to not very long. Actually, we just write

854
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:40.770
Saraniah Aston: The anger afterward, or what happened. The whole world doesn't use and understand what's going on. Except me and everybody else to understand it.

855
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that one right there. I understand. Just take. See, see what happens when you say try it out loud may seem goofy, but we'll just told you. We're going to do some goofy things in here.

856
01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always make funny to people, you're welcome to. But, see if you can say hear your own voice out loud. I understand what's going on. For me, it's my truth. See what happens when you say that out loud.

857
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.280
Saraniah Aston: With

858
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.930
Saraniah Aston: Another doesn't work.

859
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's beautiful. So we just found what it's not. Fantastic.

860
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try another one.

861
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tell what it wasn't sharply quick you knew so fast.

862
01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How about just the piece of I know who I am.

863
01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:47.910
Saraniah Aston: Um,

864
01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If you try and say that what happens

865
01:30:51.960 --> 01:31:06.570
Saraniah Aston: I know who I am, yeah, no. Yeah, I think it feels at that now it's scary. Still, but it's powerful, because it's true. I'm beginning to who I am.

866
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you're fighting for on Facebook, right, you're fighting for it.

867
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:26.010
Saraniah Aston: You're like, yeah, I really, really was like attention and approval. Yeah. And now I'm fairly on Facebook like

868
01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:37.080
Saraniah Aston: I don't, I don't feel like I need it every once in a while. I went back to my safe space. I get I had like 500 friends and said 49 now.

869
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So, for a moment, I want you to hold on to remember we're developing this anchor room. Let's see what happens when

870
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:43.770
Saraniah Aston: We do.

871
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember telling you, it just as beautiful beautifully can't do it wrong. My job is to keep us sort of corralled in here so we don't

872
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.990
Saraniah Aston: Know, that's good. Yeah.

873
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's try this.

874
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I said we would depend a memory. So just for a second. See how old

875
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The I need approval and attention.

876
01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:12.900
Hold is that

877
01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.390
Saraniah Aston: Really oh

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.470
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, yeah, see if you can

879
01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: trackback. The earliest age that's most effective in this anchor. So if we can capture the earliest age that you became sort of aware

880
01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I need approval, I need this approval.

881
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.270
Hold for you.

882
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:39.750
Saraniah Aston: Hopefully, around nine

883
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.550
There we go.

884
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:43.110
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

885
01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a nickname back then. And did you like the nickname.

886
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.160
Saraniah Aston: Um. Nope. Just well MIA mia

887
01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:03.630

Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to look around.

892
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Look around and realize this is your home now, doesn't mean it was back then, doesn't mean it's going to be the one in the future, but it's the one you have now.

893
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to imagine that you add a Rome.

894
01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's attached to this one in some way. It can be any size can be attached anywhere.

895
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And will have everything you want in it.

896
01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Start to share with me what you notice is in that room.

897
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to edit because I'm sure

898
01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a camera in there.

899
01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.370
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, okay.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:16.560
Saraniah Aston: No, a nice professional digital camera for taking pictures.

902
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How big is this room.

903
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:23.190
Saraniah Aston: Not big

904
01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.460
Saraniah Aston: It's white and there's a stool in the middle and on stools, the camera.

905
01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: School in middle with national camera on it.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you say was, I didn't quite hear. If it was a color are the size I couldn't hear one more.

907
01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:46.830
Saraniah Aston: White it's white and it's not very big. It's smaller than

908
01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Small white and look just in your imagination sort of scan the walls.

909
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Ceiling and floors, take your time and tell me what you notice

910
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:08.340
Saraniah Aston: Well,

Saraniah Aston: A cloud.

920
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:59.250
Saraniah Aston: Okay, standing on

921
01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel tactile to stand on the cloud.

922
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:11.130
Saraniah Aston: It feels like every like footstep is out is like completely supported

923
01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:15.210
Okay.

924
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the temperature of those feet as they make contact with the cloud.

925
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:28.230
Saraniah Aston: Cool, cool, cool.

926
01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And the walls. See what you notice

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.930
Saraniah Aston: Already did it was

928
01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:45.600
Saraniah Aston: There were stucco. They're really white stucco walls.

929
01:36:49.650 --> 01:36:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want them to be white stucco walls.

930
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:57.060
Saraniah Aston: Are really know if that's something from my childhood that are remember

931
01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:03.120
Saraniah Aston: It's Tracy my hand along the way, the way stucco was

932
01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.530
Yeah.

933
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:14.970
Saraniah Aston: Or scraping my knuckles on it or something. So no, I don't like that.

934
01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:18.810
Saraniah Aston: But I can't help it.

935
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. Right keeps pushing in there. So take a look at that camera that professional digital camera really look at it. Feel the support every step.

936
01:37:36.930 --> 01:37:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And check and see for a moment where a light source might be coming from, if there is one.

937
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.290
Saraniah Aston: Will be the whole room was

938
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.770

Saraniah Aston: I don't know why.

944
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.380
Saraniah Aston: But yeah, the room itself is like a very bright, sunny.

945
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:28.470
Saraniah Aston: And no, I didn't notice ceiling or anything like that.

946
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no window. Is that right,

947
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:34.680
Saraniah Aston: There's no one, no, no.

948
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And how bright is it, is it really bright, like what's the Brighton.

01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, really great.

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.930
Saraniah Aston: Endless beyond the clouds. I see clouds.

953
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What's beyond the clouds.

954
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.500
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. Probably the rest of

955
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:24.990
Saraniah Aston: Her. No, I don't know.

956
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But right so but you have a sense that there's no ceiling.

957
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.240
Saraniah Aston: Yeah yeah

958
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, just checking. And I'm for a moment. I want you to get a sense of the temperature of the room.

959
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.240
Saraniah Aston: I'm

960
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.130
Saraniah Aston: Cool.

961
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:55.860
Saraniah Aston: But like it could really easily get very hot and uncomfortable for some reason.

962
01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:57.240
Huh.

963
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's cool, but could get really hot.

964
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:04.020
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

965
01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:07.110
All right.

966
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want to get into all of the senses. It's not just what we see. It's not just tactile I'd like you to also get a sense of

967
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, I'm going to close my eyes because it's easier for me to tune one sensory input and turn on another I'm closing my eyes and if you want to, for a lot of people. It's an uncomfortable thing to do. So you do it if you want to see what you hear.

968
01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: In that room.

969
01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.850

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so where's the wind coming from

973
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.940
Saraniah Aston: All around everywhere.

01:41:18.810 --> 01:41:19.230
I go

975
01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: These are harder to get to

976
01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.240
Saraniah Aston: What it's like

977
01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.000
Saraniah Aston: If it's hard to might be really, really, really hard to get to

978
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And what, what about um

01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:21.450
Okay.

994
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the door closed.

995
01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:27.570
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's

996
01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're made of

997
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:34.950

Saraniah Aston: What

999
01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the handles, and if there's a lot of merit is things like that.

1000
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:47.850
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, there's

1001
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:56.700
Saraniah Aston: Old like an old, old handle all hard heavy weight hardware.

01:43:57.810 --> 01:43:58.590
Saraniah Aston: And the big

1003
01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:01.800
Saraniah Aston: A big lock.

1004
01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It lock on your side or the other side.

1005
01:44:08.970 --> 01:44:11.190
Saraniah Aston: I'm on my side.

1006
01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it locked now.

1007
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:17.280
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

1008
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to pay attention for a moment, to the degree that you're comfortable really be present. Maybe intermittently closing eyes if you can even for a half a second.

1009
01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And go to that space. If you feel safe enough in there because there's still a lot to do. But it's like you just see

1010
01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Rather be aware right of how your body feels in there. It's our messenger, it gets information from the outside world instantaneous long before we can even come up for you know a word for what's going on our bodies going to register right away.

1011
01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's safe or not.

1012
01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're in there. And I know this is imagination.

1013
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But just picturing being in that room. What you can do is if you're not used to doing it, but I can invite you to do is to just do a scan, as if like a Superman thing is going through her, you know,

1014
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How to even all the way into the viscera into the organs, the bones ligaments and tendons and muscles and skin.

1015
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And you pay attention to subtle shifts of relaxation attention or twisting and turning

1016
01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A release an activation

1017
01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You just pay attention.

1018
01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How the body feels in that room.

1019
01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's still a charge in any part of you in there.

1020
01:46:10.650 --> 01:46:14.070
Saraniah Aston: Well, it's kind of like, first I had to check and see if I am

Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe we come back, where before we go in, we in this room euro are here. I see.

1026
01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what part of your body knows whether you're saying, which means your reality.

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.320
Saraniah Aston: Really allowed

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:42.840
Saraniah Aston: But I'm the only one myself from going in really

1044
01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's go back to saying

1045
01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony

1046
01:47:59.460 --> 01:47:59.850
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

1047
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's the worst thing that can happen if you were insane and you were let in that room.

1048
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:19.680
Saraniah Aston: I would never, I would just go in and change it would never get out

1049
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

1050
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a moment.

1051
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathe together. I know I haven't taught this to you, but I'll do

1052
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of pull. If you can keep that pillar there. It's nice to have something sort of protecting that that belly right to kind of pull the shoulders back a little bit, because what we want to do is even hands under the legs are on sort of that wonder, wonder woman pose, or even

1053
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy Boy pose and really allow room for error to get in.

1054
01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to breathe in through the nose and I'd like you to see if you can expand the belly outward with your in breath, it's really different.

1055
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't feel a lot of movement in your shoulder. It's so different those shoulders will barely move

1056
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That pillow move. I see it moving that

1057
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.940
Saraniah Aston: Means something

1058
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time. That's a great way to see if Tommy's are moving so

1059
01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.580
Saraniah Aston: So, okay.

1060
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and then on your exhale. You want to prolong it and really push it out nice and slow. So you've got inhale.

1061
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

1062
01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.590
Saraniah Aston: Now it's hard to do not even know

1063
01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But worth it really worth it.

1064
01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow. Get that tell me all that air out.

1065
01:50:18.090 --> 01:50:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel the air coming out across the lips to right different temperature we can feel the sensation.

1066
01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'd like to hear from you what emotion, you're feeling right now. So I'd like to check in with you.

1067
01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.520
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

1068
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.280
Saraniah Aston: Maybe a little bit of insecurity.

1069
01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:47.010
Saraniah Aston: From insecurity around

1070
01:50:49.290 --> 01:50:55.140
Saraniah Aston: A little bit of insecurity and a child like insecurities. Yeah.

1071
01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:03.240
Saraniah Aston: I mean, it doesn't really scare me or anything to show that

1072
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.460
Saraniah Aston: I just feel it.

1073
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So is there a sense of wanting to continue to investigate it to take care of it or do you want to put it in the container or in the container and in the distancing sort of metaphor. What would feel good to

1074
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.240
Saraniah Aston: Putting it in the in the container temporarily

1075
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, do you want to put it in a cardboard box.

1076
01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:32.700
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

1077
01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1078
01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:35.790
So,

1079
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do that. Right.

1080
01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the childlike insecurity. This is maybe old and insecurity and we'll put it in the box and you and I can bring it out if you're ready.

1081
01:51:51.300 --> 01:52:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And we agree right that it's a good investment of time and your healing to bring it out we can bring out the childlike insecurity, but you don't have to analyze it. Think about it. If you don't want to. We can do it together.

1082
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:07.380
Is that okay

1083
01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Without the childlike and security.

01:52:14.490 --> 01:52:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you left with, what do you have available to work with today to play with today to enjoy today.

01:54:33.810 --> 01:54:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll be there in just a second. I don't want to eat in front of you have about three more fights.

1116
01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:44.370
Ray Casias: Oh, you're fine. Yeah, yeah, you go when, don't worry, don't worry.

1117
01:54:53.190 --> 01:54:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: My choke.

1118
01:54:58.860 --> 01:54:59.700
Ray Casias: Oh good here.

1119
01:55:01.050 --> 01:55:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, while you're doing that, I'm going to open up a note for you. Okay. Looks like two and a half bites. Here I've spread this salad, to the point that it's all weepy and pathetic over three sessions.

1120
01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

1121
01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.630
Ray Casias: Know when I know exactly what you need.

1122
01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So while I'm still kind of getting it together here. Dr. Gabriel informs me that you're able to

1123
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Start taking Lyrica. Is that correct, that's

1124
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct. How many days and how you feeling

1125
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:58.830
Ray Casias: I'm this this will be six days today.

1126
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:09.060
Ray Casias: Oh, I haven't noticed any difference yet, but I am aware that it takes a little time and I'm on the lowest, lowest possible dose so

1127
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:14.850
Ray Casias: But I'm just happy to get the ball rolling with it.

1128
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:25.290
Ray Casias: Because it really is. It's

1129
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.770
Ray Casias: It makes sense for me to take it.

1130
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:36.540
Ray Casias: It's almost like kind of low. I mean, I don't have unrealistic expectations for it, but it

1131
01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:43.110
Ray Casias: Is it is relevant to a bunch of different

1132
01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:50.760
Ray Casias: Things that I'm Dr message it is anti epileptic it is

1133
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:53.160
Ray Casias: Not will work on the

1134
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.610
Ray Casias: Should help with the phantom pain in my

1135
01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:03.720
Ray Casias: Arm with the amputation. That should help with the with the neuropathy game.

1136
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:11.040
Ray Casias: So bonus for me just, you know, the cabinet.

1137
01:57:15.150 --> 01:57:15.690
Ray Casias: And I'm

1138
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.420
Ray Casias: Hoping this season.

1139
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:26.070
Ray Casias: Good results out of the low dose, because then that would mean I can only get better from there.

1140
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I would not be great and all the people I think you'll register those incremental progresses, you know,

1141
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:35.850
Ray Casias: Yeah, I

1142
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:44.340
Ray Casias: Mean you know it, it's really helpful that I really learned how to meditate and how to just just

1143
01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:50.700
Ray Casias: Take inventory on everything and then into

1144
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.550
Ray Casias: Listen to how

1145
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:56.760
Ray Casias: Everything field.

1146
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:03.510
Ray Casias: Get feedback from all of my pain everywhere.

1147
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.680
Ray Casias: That might may want to recognize it.

1148
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:19.830
Ray Casias: For what it is. So I'll be able to. Yeah, I'll be able to register change any any minute change. I think we spend a lot of time.

1149
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.150
Ray Casias: Intention of that kind of stuff just to get a grip.

1150
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1151
01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just touch on other demands of your life. You've talked about medication sort of an awareness of the added skills that you have the meditation, the sort of changing the meaning of the pain you're leaning into it, investigating it more right you're you're starting to

1152
01:58:50.190 --> 01:58:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You've gained those skills over the months and years, and

1153
01:58:57.150 --> 01:59:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What about other domains, your life. I like to always check in.

1154
01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Residence financial you in a role of husband you enroll a father housemate etc. I would just like to touch how those are doing. Are they getting worse. Are they getting better. Just want to hear a little bit about your interpersonal environment.

1155
01:59:24.810 --> 01:59:32.130
Ray Casias: I'm going to turn off my video for a second if it improves this but I get the gist of what did that but it's kind of funny now.

1156
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:33.300
Yeah.

1157
01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:34.890
Ray Casias: Itself.

1158
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, test, test,

1159
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test.

1160
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:39.450
Ray Casias: Yeah, that's

1161
01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.650
Ray Casias: That seems better um okay so

1162
01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:50.730
Ray Casias: I'm

1163
01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:58.050
Ray Casias: With my daughters are going very well.

1164
02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:02.640
Ray Casias: Daughter

1165
02:00:03.690 --> 02:00:06.090
Ray Casias: That has my new grandchild is kind of

1166
02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:13.440
Ray Casias: I understand how outrageously busy things are with earth, so I don't we kind of

1167
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:20.280
Ray Casias: Doesn't have a whole lot of time for me right now and I get it, I get it.

1168
02:00:22.770 --> 02:00:27.810
Ray Casias: But that you make, make my way to see my grandson amazing

1169
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:34.680
Ray Casias: Everything's going good with my daughters my living situation is still crap.

1170
02:00:40.530 --> 02:00:43.260
Ray Casias: But I am working on it. I mean,

1171
02:00:47.190 --> 02:00:47.700
Ray Casias: So I

1172
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:54.480
Ray Casias: Mean

1173
02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:57.540
Ray Casias: described it properly.

1174
02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.110
Ray Casias: I you know I feel like I i

1175
02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:20.340
Ray Casias: My living situations and

1176
02:01:21.810 --> 02:01:24.450
Ray Casias: There are, I either

1177
02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:33.480
Ray Casias: Need there needs to be a compromise here where it gets a little bit better for me and livable, or I need, I need to

1178
02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:37.950
Ray Casias: Just get my own place and take care of my own needs.

1179
02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:44.580
Ray Casias: And so I in the past weeks.

1180
02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.480
Ray Casias: Through through all this. You know, I feel like

1181
02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:52.590
Ray Casias: It feels like I kind of

1182
02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.570
Ray Casias: Let me try to

1183
02:01:57.390 --> 02:02:11.400
Ray Casias: describe this to Glen, so like throughout the addiction and throughout and going through all of the pain and the amputation, and all that stuff all the major heavy hitters

1184
02:02:13.530 --> 02:02:14.370
Ray Casias: I feel like

1185
02:02:15.630 --> 02:02:19.080
Ray Casias: I was just condensed into this, this

1186
02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:32.820
Ray Casias: This tiny little mouse in the corner, without being, you know, I felt like I couldn't

1187
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:42.690
Ray Casias: Be assertive, I lost my sense of self worth, and I allowed a lot of people to exploit that.

1188
02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:57.240
Ray Casias: I just, I don't know how to explain it other than I feel like I've emerged from that I feel like I've gotten back a good great deal of my sense of self worth, and I feel like I can

1189
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:05.190
Ray Casias: Scratch that. I know I can be assertive, because I've demonstrated it here in the past week.

1190
02:03:06.690 --> 02:03:07.140
Ray Casias: Because

1191
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:08.850
Ray Casias: With that

1192
02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:16.890
Ray Casias: Realization realization of my own word, it's kind of, it's kind of been

1193
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.960
Ray Casias: It's not a

1194
02:03:25.650 --> 02:03:28.290
Ray Casias: I'm not walking on eggshells anymore.

1195
02:03:29.850 --> 02:03:31.530
Ray Casias: And I'm okay. Yeah.

1196
02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

1197
02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's huge.

1198
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:43.080
Yeah.

1199
02:03:44.130 --> 02:03:46.890
Ray Casias: It is it is huge and it feels huge and

1200
02:03:48.210 --> 02:03:49.680
Ray Casias: I'm you know i'm not

1201
02:03:54.300 --> 02:04:01.470
Ray Casias: Not only do the do the does there need to be boundaries. There needs to be some sort of compromise here.

1202
02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:04.740
Ray Casias: Or I need to do.

1203
02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:24.930
Ray Casias: You know, and I'm not speaking in a selfish way at all. I'm speaking just just practically to live the best I can with what I have left and make the best of what I have not an easy thing to do. And now I don't need things like this to make it harder.

1204
02:04:26.490 --> 02:04:35.100
Ray Casias: I need my wife to understand and compromise and not just be indifferent to my needs and

1205
02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:37.500
Ray Casias: And the things that are

1206
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:40.140
Ray Casias: getting in the way here.

1207
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:48.300
Ray Casias: I mean, apathy is one thing and you know I can't, I can't change that, if that's what she's feeling but

1208
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.500
Ray Casias: I can't be accepting of just

1209
02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.390
Ray Casias: Okay, well, that's, that's what I haven't. Okay then.

1210
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.140
Ray Casias: I don't feel like that's right

1211
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me us when were you assertive. Tell me something, you said maybe to your wife, where that sort of says, look at me, where normally, you know, a year ago, six months ago, I would not have said this, I can assert my needs. I can speak my truth. When did you, when did you do that. Tell me.

1212
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:29.100
Ray Casias: All oh well just just last week I had

1213
02:05:31.650 --> 02:05:32.670
Ray Casias: I had to

1214
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:37.170
Ray Casias: Know, whenever it comes to speaking about this kind of thing.

1215
02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:42.600
Ray Casias: My wife has been kind of stonewalling me all this time and

1216
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:46.710
Ray Casias: So,

1217
02:05:48.810 --> 02:05:50.730
Ray Casias: I will. I wanted to talk about

1218
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:55.500
Ray Casias: Moving moving now if we can't make it work out.

1219
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:09.480
Ray Casias: And that involves that's a huge discussion about it involves a lot of a lot of little we have to separate all these little

1220
02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:17.850
Ray Casias: My new. I mean, I need. I would need to know what bills on the spot. Before we have to

1221
02:06:19.170 --> 02:06:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Be interrupted.

1222
02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.040
Just

1223
02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you speak with your wife.

1224
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:35.430
Ray Casias: That you speak with her.

1225
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: About a contingency plan for your moving out.

1226
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.750
Ray Casias: Yes, I had to didn't want to but I I made this conversation happen.

1227
02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And was it how far back.

1228
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:55.470
Ray Casias: Last week okay now.

1229
02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it. You don't explain to me. I get it. What did she say what she said.

1230
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.970
Ray Casias: didn't handle it well.

1231
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:22.770
Ray Casias: For one thing,

1232
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:26.490
Ray Casias: And

1233
02:07:30.630 --> 02:07:31.440
Ray Casias: It was but

1234
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:40.260
Ray Casias: It was like I was speaking to her parents on the matter. I mean, she was mirroring how they would handle something it

1235
02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:44.070
Ray Casias: Was not good. She, she was not

1236
02:07:47.370 --> 02:07:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I get it, I get she made it about her.

1237
02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:51.300
Ray Casias: I mean,

1238
02:07:51.630 --> 02:08:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: She hated about her instead of about your express concern and your need to kind of get clear and do a lot of planning. She made it about her emotional reaction to what you were talking about. I'm assuming

1239
02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:07.170
Ray Casias: Exactly.

1240
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is off topic because

1241
02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Planning needs to be done her emotional reaction.

1242
02:08:20.130 --> 02:08:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But the whole point is is dear, you're not emotionally responding to me. That's my point. So there's there's a lot going on in this this exchange. She didn't handle it well. And where are you left with this now.

1243
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:39.270
Where's the volley.

1244
02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:41.430
Ray Casias: Well, he

1245
02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:45.480
Ray Casias: stayed on point and

1246
02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:49.110
Ray Casias: If nothing else, I made

1247
02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.080
Ray Casias: All of my thoughts on the matter and all of the

1248
02:08:56.700 --> 02:08:57.570
Ray Casias: You know, I made it.

1249
02:08:58.620 --> 02:09:01.050
Ray Casias: I just laid it all out. I mean, I

1250
02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.470
Ray Casias: I was going to be heard that day.

1251
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:08.700
Ray Casias: If it killed me so

1252
02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:12.960
Ray Casias: She knows where I stand on the matter.

1253
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:20.940
Ray Casias: And she knows that I'm I'm open to the discussion if she wants to

1254
02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.320
Ray Casias: I'm hoping she's thinking about it.

1255
02:09:26.850 --> 02:09:28.890
Ray Casias: And I hope she comes to me with

1256
02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:31.530
Ray Casias: Questions and better

1257
02:09:39.150 --> 02:09:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I lost connection for just a second.

1258
02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:46.290
Ray Casias: I have a really bad connection today, what

1259
02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is it winning someone had said the wind effects things I didn't know if that was the truth because I don't understand how that would work, but

1260
02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:59.670
Ray Casias: Maybe it's a little breezy, but it's not

1261
02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:01.800
Not

1262
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:06.330
Ray Casias: Not bad. I'm not sure what's going on here.

1263
02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:09.540
Ray Casias: I'm gonna try to switch to why

1264
02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test.

1265
02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Good for me. Can you hear me. Yes. Okay.

1266
02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are assertive. That's part of

1267
02:10:56.610 --> 02:11:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A goal that you and I have talked about being able to sort of assert sort of self in this way and and you did it and

1268
02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:06.360
The difference is when

1269
02:11:07.710 --> 02:11:08.490
Ray Casias: Because I've been

1270
02:11:09.690 --> 02:11:17.400
Ray Casias: Assertive to two different degrees. And one of the differences with this what I just did.

1271
02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:33.150
Ray Casias: Was I I went all the way and I didn't feel bad about it. Usually I feel bad, like, gosh. She has, she's dealing with all there. And then I'm laying this on and and and start feeling bad about stuff and you know

1272
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:45.780
Ray Casias: I just didn't feel bad about it. I felt like I was just completely right about what I was saying and I i I'm not Mike, I'm this guy who thinks he's always right about everything.

1273
02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:54.960
Ray Casias: If I can be proven wrong about something that's one of the coolest things that I love it. Prove me wrong. Tell me I'm wrong, or

1274
02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:11.400
Ray Casias: I could see things differently. I welcome that I'm, you know, so I hope she I just want her to think about things because I'm completely reasonable and any reservation. She has if its reasonable. Like, I don't want to hear this.

1275
02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:20.010
Ray Casias: You're leaving me crap because that's just crap, I'm not leaving her. I'm trying to live.

1276
02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:21.840
Ray Casias: And she's

1277
02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:32.340
Ray Casias: You know I want her more than I want anything else. And she has every opportunity to make it work with me. So in the past.

1278
02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:37.740
Ray Casias: I would feel bad about it and I don't right now.

1279
02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That is amazing. You re held on to yourself. And one of the reasons why I noticed in your language. You're saying this is true. I'm right. I'm right.

1280
02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I might choose a different language to to capture it, I might say,

1281
02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no debating that this is my truth.

1282
02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my reality. I need you to check on me a few times a day. This is part of what I need. I have an expectation for this partnership, sweetheart. Are you willing to do it.

1283
02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand you're having an emotional reaction to this, but you are a grown woman I've seen your strength, can you please tell me, are you able to give this it has come to this direct question.

1284
02:13:25.650 --> 02:13:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And it has come over years that I have fine tuned exactly right now what it is I have taken the time to ask and a much

1285
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you out of love for me and for us. Can you check on me a few times a day. Can I rely on you.

1286
02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now we're talking about me. We'll talk about your emotional experience of this word I'm moving out we can get into that later, but right now I'm the one bringing this topic up. Can you tell me

1287
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you need some time to think about it, sweetheart, but I have brought the for us a question that has taken a lot of time to come up with. You see it, it's your truth. That's why it's true. You feel it. You thought it you need it. That's not up for debate.

1288
02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no argument here. So it's not you see this not her proving it wrong. It's

1289
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you need to be heard. She needs to hear you later on an hour later, two hours later, then it's your turn to listen to her hi got really scared, you're going to leave me brings up all my router router childhood router Roz

1290
02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, fine, but Ray, you have been putting aside what you need in any given moment for way too long.

1291
02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I bet you felt really good standing your emotional ground.

1292
02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And speaking your truth.

1293
02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:06.540
Ray Casias: I did and I do and I still feel good about it.

1294
02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.520
Ray Casias: And and

1295
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:21.630
Ray Casias: When I speak of, like, yeah, yeah. My name is a little wrong on on that because what I'm, what I'm meeting. Is it that she sees

1296
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:30.540
Ray Casias: Somewhere where I because it is it's so I'm so confident in it because I've considered

1297
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:33.150
Ray Casias: So much

1298
02:15:34.650 --> 02:15:38.310
Ray Casias: And if she and it's to a point where if she sees

1299
02:15:39.570 --> 02:15:41.370
Ray Casias: Anything in in

1300
02:15:43.710 --> 02:15:53.850
Ray Casias: What I was saying that fails to consider her and I want to hear about it, but because I don't think that I did that in any in any of it because I

1301
02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.990
Ray Casias: I always consider everything

1302
02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you have and the differences

1303
02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that

1304
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The step I think for you has been you a light switch went on, you know, that true for you. You don't need

1305
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: to betray abandon yourself in the moment with someone accuses you you're being selfish, not thinking about me. If you know it's true. You are a conscientious, man.

1306
02:16:27.090 --> 02:16:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: No one can accuse you otherwise and get away with it, you will not be emotionally hijacked by anyone you know your truth so you can sit there with false accusations, the world can be just acting completely insane.

1307
02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And there you are. Still, this is still a reality would be convenient if you would stop spinning around and just see me.

1308
02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's holding on to you that's assertive. That's that I'm not on eggshells I'm here. This is real. I'm going to speak my truth.

1309
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish. Yes, of course. I wish she handled it better. Yes, I do.

1310
02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, it didn't, I'm really sorry, but I'm proud of you for holding on to your truth even though your environment, keep saying to you.

1311
02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the way you were raised your you had a very invalidating environment invalidation invalidation invalidation over and over and over and over again. It is familiar and comfortable may not comfortable familiar for you.

1312
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've had it. You're pressed up against.

1313
02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The big right but you've got a lot at stake here. So no more time to waste.

1314
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's taken that much of a push. You don't have to wait so long you have just as much right to your truth.

1315
02:17:54.240 --> 02:18:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: As someone who who's unburdened right with with the pains that you've had, who had those rights all along, and it saddens me that you didn't have someone to say, well, what's on your mind. Speak up. What is it,

1316
02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I wish you did, but it's never too late. You get to enjoy this moment. And really, really, really see

1317
02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's not about a fact finding miss it mission waiting for someone to tell me I'm wrong. That's the facts. That's knowledge. I've read this. There's a counter research evidence piece. There's okay. No, no, there won't be one, for I am sad. They'll just be you were sad now.

1318
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: In therapy right we might relive it, we might re experience it. We might re process it. But if you tell me this, whatever it is, it's coming up for you. I'm not going to say no, it's not.

1319
02:18:52.560 --> 02:19:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to ask you, do you want it to stay that way or do you want to remember it differently. And then we can do some some interventions just sort of shifted around and change it.

1320
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Re

1321
02:19:13.650 --> 02:19:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: With the time that you have here.

1322
02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: In therapy right now.

1323
02:19:19.650 --> 02:19:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel the best. Would it be learning something new about yourself, would it be a sense of relief. Would it be excitement about the future. Would it be

1324
02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what

1325
02:19:34.530 --> 02:19:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But think about what you want to leave with today. You want to come away with

1326
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: From our time together.

1327
02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.250
Ray Casias: Take a minute with that.

1328
02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, please do.

1329
02:20:27.450 --> 02:20:27.840
Ray Casias: So,

1330
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:30.210
Ray Casias: Even though I feel

1331
02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:34.200
Ray Casias: I'll just talk about it. So we can like Bill

1332
02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:43.110
Ray Casias: Even though I feel I

1333
02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:46.170
Ray Casias: Feel like

1334
02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:59.640
Ray Casias: I'm glad that I was able to find this ground where I could

1335
02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:02.340
Ray Casias: Be assertive and

1336
02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:05.970
Ray Casias: I feel strong with it.

1337
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:12.660
Ray Casias: I

1338
02:21:13.770 --> 02:21:19.200
Ray Casias: Don't want this situation to wear me down. I guess I deep down I feel like

1339
02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:21.780
Ray Casias: I don't want to

1340
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:33.720
Ray Casias: I want to lose 30 minutes. I don't want to resort back to

1341
02:21:35.010 --> 02:21:43.920
Ray Casias: Any of that other crap i mean i i feel like between her parents being the way they are and

1342
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:47.460
Ray Casias: Her just really trying to avoid

1343
02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:50.520
Ray Casias: Dealing with this.

1344
02:21:55.290 --> 02:21:58.140
Ray Casias: I guess I'm I don't know what I'm trying to say here.

1345
02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I heard you.

1346
02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to hold on to this confidence.

1347
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want it to.

1348
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Disappear.

1349
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: start seeing the risk in continuing to be assertive. Maybe I'll put other people first. And I'll lose myself again. And I might get depressed again because of it. Am I getting close.

1350
02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:26.220
Ray Casias: Yeah, you know, I

1351
02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:32.880
Ray Casias: Just, just thinking about middle

1352
02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:52.200
Ray Casias: Ways to that I tried to assert myself in the past year and try to put my foot down and about know all this time and I keep what she'll do is tell me what I want to hear and do what I wanted to do for a couple of days or a week or something and then it's just right back to

1353
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:54.690
Ray Casias: The the

1354
02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:00.450
Ray Casias: The indifference in that apathy and it just stuck because I feel like

1355
02:23:01.650 --> 02:23:03.000
Ray Casias: And I, I

1356
02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:10.350
Ray Casias: Spoke my mind about that as well. I mean, I let her know that I'm aware, because it's so

1357
02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:21.180
Ray Casias: Consistent me that way and do it and do it. Do it. And I made it. I let her know that I'm not interested in that, I want

1358
02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:27.690
Ray Casias: Us to move on from this and do so. Can you okay together, you know,

1359
02:23:31.410 --> 02:23:31.890
Ray Casias: So,

1360
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the thing you're in a pattern. Do you know that you participate in the pattern. I know. This one's really hard for people to swallow. But you're a participant.

1361
02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:50.040
Ray Casias: Yes, I know that. And I don't know exactly. I've been exploring know

1362
02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:54.030
Ray Casias: How am I contributing Oh my, keeping it

1363
02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So when someone says they're sorry

1364
02:23:59.550 --> 02:24:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of that actually mean sorry, as in I promise, God willing to never do it again, basically.

1365
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That means I'm sorry.

1366
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the same definition you have

1367
02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't do it again, God willing

1368
02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All my intention, God willing, right. I won't do it.

1369
02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:21.510
Ray Casias: Right.

1370
02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you mean leave her apology.

1371
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: does she keep her promises over these years and months know

1372
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You have enough history. Now, who's the crazy person you that keeps ignoring

1373
02:24:42.900 --> 02:24:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This or her

1374
02:24:46.410 --> 02:24:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Who's going crazy.

1375
02:24:50.820 --> 02:25:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I know these are hard to hear. They're really, really hard. But what I'm suggesting is this, you have a pattern set in place. And believe it or not, you're reinforcing

1376
02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that she only has to do it for a few days you'll get upset. You'll basically you'll disappear. You'll get depressed, then maybe you'll speak up. She's not accountable then she'll do a fluffy apology and rinse and repeat.

1377
02:25:21.390 --> 02:25:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I'm throwing this out because you did. But if you opt out of that particular game and you stop reinforcing it and you just move out the discussion is over. You don't talk anymore. You already laid it out. It's now.

1378
02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your credibility there. In other words, you spoke words.

1379
02:25:45.810 --> 02:25:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You made a promise you said if you continue along this line I'm moving out. Now I don't know if that's what you said, I'm making up a story here. You fill in the truth.

1380
02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You fill in the facts and then of course there's nothing more to say stroke promise I don't again go back and say, Tell me you're going to make her promise you an empty promise. Again, it's you can't keep

1381
02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:15.030
Ray Casias: right on the mark that is right where I was.

1382
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:19.920
Ray Casias: I was right on the edge of that.

1383
02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where we participate

1384
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:27.240
Ray Casias: Okay, yeah.

1385
02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in your this this gift that you give ray and you give it so generously of forgiveness. It's beautiful, spiritual and enviable

1386
02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean that it's needed all the time for all the people

1387
02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: She needs.

1388
02:26:47.850 --> 02:26:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountability to her own life.

1389
02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reality is, she's about to lose the best man she's ever had.

1390
02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't mean forever. I just mean nearby. Yeah.

1391
02:27:01.410 --> 02:27:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real you. You're either going to do it or you're not. You see what I'm saying. It's like, that's real. Or you can keep this game up I'm going to tell you you're gonna pretend that it's fine. And then all

1392
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay, go ahead.

1393
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.890
Ray Casias: Another thing.

1394
02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:19.410
Ray Casias: Oh, no.

1395
02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:41.610
Ray Casias: When I think of moving away. I mean, I don't think, oh, I'm not thinking, well, okay, well that's it with you. I want us to can be I want us to work on things. I want us to try to get what we had back and I don't see it happening here with this gigantic wedge between us.

1396
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:48.990
Ray Casias: Um, but, but in to her. It's like if you okay well if you move out, then we're done.

1397
02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:51.210
Ray Casias: I'll ferry back

1398
02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is this is hard. I know this is really hard.

1399
02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, well I'll share. I remember

1400
02:28:01.530 --> 02:28:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were applying some new things that you learned in our discussions and you were applying it and it was working

1401
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You were addressing some projection that was going on and communication, you're using more I feel statements, your relationship with her was good. And then she went back to her family of origin, she regressed to the behaviors that she developed when she was younger.

1402
02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Unattractive, true.

1403
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I know you just said, we're done. From there, but

1404
02:28:33.930 --> 02:28:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

1405
02:28:36.450 --> 02:28:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It was also possible that she doesn't know her own strength.

1406
02:28:43.350 --> 02:28:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you go

1407
02:28:45.810 --> 02:28:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You go, you get your own place. And she sees you there and misses you.

1408
02:28:52.950 --> 02:29:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And sees the frickin insanity. That's in her home the sickness, for which she grew up in and Mrs you and you keep along the lines I miss you. I want to see you come over

1409
02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That other stuff was fear, you're afraid of what that meant. I'm not leaving you, it's we are marriage is unrecognizable. And I'm fighting for it. Please come over here. I remember how we were you seem to have forgotten I miss you. I miss you. I miss you.

1410
02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if this last piece of courage.

1411
02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: She sees your courage and what if she comes and joins you and leaves the insanity and comes to you.

1412
02:29:37.530 --> 02:29:40.260
Ray Casias: Hoping for and all of it. Yeah.

1413
02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't make it a contingency. It's just remember your life. What I hear over here, of course, right, is that your life is on the line for me when you're getting to suicidal ideation, it's time for a change.

1414
02:29:56.730 --> 02:30:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you have now butted up against life threatening dis ease and now volitional taking your own life, like it is time to do right by you.

1415
02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And the world can catch up to your pace.

1416
02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:15.240
Ray Casias: Really build that

1417
02:30:21.570 --> 02:30:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know how earlier several I don't want it to be over in the back somewhere of hope for mystery or love or something. Is there any

1418
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory of

1419
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that happening before where she would get drawn into this sort of toxic way of being.

1420
02:30:45.210 --> 02:30:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then would make her way back to you.

1421
02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And that maybe that's possible. Again, much like maybe she did when she was younger. Is there a way to say maybe that's possible again.

1422
02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:02.610
Ray Casias: Yeah, because, I mean,

1423
02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:13.380
Ray Casias: We've, we've had. We've had our time just like any anybody else in a relationship.

1424
02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:17.610
Ray Casias: That just fit. I mean 21 years

1425
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:20.430
And

1426
02:31:25.470 --> 02:31:28.170
Ray Casias: No matter what happened. I mean, we've always been about

1427
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Her family. How did she leave that house.

1428
02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When she left her family of origin. How did she get out

1429
02:31:39.870 --> 02:31:40.320
Ray Casias: Of

1430
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:41.850
Ray Casias: Me.

1431
02:31:43.770 --> 02:31:47.850
Ray Casias: I took. I took her from it. Um, I mean, because I

1432
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: married her or something. Would you do to get her out of that.

1433
02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:54.150
Ray Casias: Yes, yes, we got married and and I

1434
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:59.790
Ray Casias: I worked on a down payment for a house.

1435
02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:03.750
Ray Casias: On once I could cure everything

1436
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:09.960
Ray Casias: We had been engaged and once I secured everything and I knew

1437
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.200
Ray Casias: It was happening then we got married.

1438
02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The 22nd year you're redoing it look you're going in securing a house.

1439
02:32:22.650 --> 02:32:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And that might be what's happening.

1440
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then she can leave again and you'll be there. What if that's it instead of that thing she's acting out

1441
02:32:33.930 --> 02:32:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This hopelessness that was her environment. She has completely merged and identified with her family, which is this our rational stuff here, leaving me. It leaves no rational thinking it's just no

1442
02:32:49.830 --> 02:33:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But it sounds very. That's why I was asking you those questions because it could be the same way you did it before you'll go you'll go get yourself a residence. She has a real clear. This is where I'm going to land.

1443
02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm going to land with him. I'm going to land here. It's going to be okay.

1444
02:33:08.280 --> 02:33:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what's possible. You know, as far as

1445
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're thinking of but

1446
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, What if this was possible. Isn't that a little bit more exciting than

1447
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to revert back. What if you continue along with your passion. What if you continued along with faith that she will remember what you guys have. She just can't do it right now.

1448
02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:41.490
Ray Casias: I I hold on to that, like, that is my hope.

1449
02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:44.220
Ray Casias: Of course,

1450
02:33:45.810 --> 02:33:51.660
Ray Casias: I have to have to keep reminding myself that even if that doesn't happen.

1451
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:54.120
Ray Casias: I'm do I'm doing what I

1452
02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:58.290
Ray Casias: What I feel like

1453
02:33:59.310 --> 02:34:00.360
Ray Casias: I have to do.

1454
02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:04.980
Ray Casias: In doing something because

1455
02:34:07.980 --> 02:34:08.460
Ray Casias: I mean, it's

1456
02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:18.000
Ray Casias: It hyperbolic, but I'm just wasting away rotten away here.

1457
02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something in this place that you're thinking of, will you have like

1458
02:34:23.850 --> 02:34:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Some kind of nurse or someone that can kind of keep an eye on you, like, how will it work as an assistant, you'll have someone paid that can keep an eye on. Yeah.

1459
02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:34.410
Ray Casias: Yes, yes. For for like a few hours a day.

1460
02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.490
Ray Casias: And then I think I'm just gonna

1461
02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:47.700
Ray Casias: I am going to move move really near my daughter so I can do my grandbaby boy he's made me

1462
02:34:49.410 --> 02:34:50.580
Ray Casias: And you

1463
02:34:51.690 --> 02:34:53.970
Ray Casias: Can pop in on the few

1464
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: She will

1465
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.420
Ray Casias: Oh, yeah.

1466
02:34:58.410 --> 02:35:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to get away from that she's gonna go visit you. She's gonna see the baby, she's gonna feel good and love and she's gonna recognize that sucks. This feels good. I like when I'm here, I'm not going freaking crazy. I'm guessing should recognize yourself again with you.

1467
02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:20.160
Ray Casias: That is the hope that I'm holding on to

1468
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's secondary. First one is taking care of you. Because we gotta let go of too much anticipation of the outcome of their but I'm just throwing it out that it doesn't have to be the We're over. I don't want you like I mean like grieving into the relationship

1469
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It could turn out great but somebody has to make a change. Somebody has to change the game. Yeah.

1470
02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:44.910
Ray Casias: She, she's the one with the with the

1471
02:35:46.650 --> 02:35:57.510
Ray Casias: You know it it being over stuff i i don't i don't mean it to be over in any way by moving away from here, I just need. I need to do it. I need it.

1472
02:35:59.970 --> 02:36:05.130
Ray Casias: It's not even like if I could, if my neat could be met here with her, then I wouldn't even

1473
02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:16.260
Ray Casias: And I was living. Okay, then I wouldn't consider it wouldn't even come up, but it's her that they're saying, well, okay, well if you moved in. We're done. That's it.

1474
02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:17.850
Ray Casias: And

1475
02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.120
Ray Casias: I don't, I don't believe that. I mean, yeah. Well, I think there's a part of you that's

1476
02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Allowing her what she's saying out loud to be true, yet you know this other scenario I just threw out is another future alternative. We don't know what it's going to be, but you also have

1477
02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: History where crazy, crazy parents you like the woman you get her out and things worked out, you might be doing it again. It might turn out great.

1478
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.380
I

1479
02:36:54.930 --> 02:36:57.210
Ray Casias: I feel that I see that I think

1480
02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:01.470
Ray Casias: That's the way I picture it happening. I mean,

1481
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.830
Ray Casias: I don't know.

1482
02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:12.300
Ray Casias: I don't know how it will turn out. I just want to keep in my mind that

1483
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:17.070
Ray Casias: Doing what I have to do good.

1484
02:37:18.330 --> 02:37:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to reinforce it. I haven't heard one thing from you. That sounded irrational. I haven't heard one thing that sounded selfish. I haven't heard one thing that was

1485
02:37:30.450 --> 02:37:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, without investment in the relationship in the things that you really care about. I haven't heard anything irrational and when I did. I called it out I named it

1486
02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So just as one other human being. Anyway, I'm not hearing anything that's outside of the norm. You have to take care of yourself. You have to. You can't do it there. You're not going to be any good to anybody, you just won't be now that's know that that can't be an alternative but just right.

1487
02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We need blogging.

1488
02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.740
Ray Casias: Um okay so

1489
02:38:10.410 --> 02:38:11.610
Ray Casias: Advice on

1490
02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:18.390
Ray Casias: Know you already. Okay.

1491
02:38:23.550 --> 02:38:25.890
Ray Casias: Now you already covered it so

1492
02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever need anything for me as a in the marriage piece now 20 this year ago or so, more than happy for you to meet together.

1493
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:39.270
Ray Casias: I wish I could give you that.

1494
02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're saying Wait let's throw it out there just play with it, you're walking around, or however you kind of right you're in there and you're on the screen you have me on there and you say, sweetie. Look, this is her say hi to my therapist high and that's it.

1495
02:38:56.610 --> 02:39:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: She's See I'm real what she might like. Oh, that wasn't as bad as I thought. And you didn't make her talk. Just remember she's the lady said hi to you can't picture that random thing happening.

1496
02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.370
Ray Casias: I can try. I mean, I'm not

1497
02:39:15.390 --> 02:39:18.540
Ray Casias: I wouldn't rule it out without trying it. I don't know.

1498
02:39:21.810 --> 02:39:26.970
Ray Casias: I mean, because that if we, if I can get to a point where we could both

1499
02:39:29.130 --> 02:39:30.570
Ray Casias: talk this out this way.

1500
02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the

1501
02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's, here's where some your skill of self sacrifice could be used conveniently right now.

1502
02:39:44.130 --> 02:39:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can compartmentalize and just really feel heard and validated from me, like in here and you say okay this is how I'm gonna see if I can get her into these, these can joint sessions. I'll say, sweetheart.

1503
02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That those feelings you have when you said if I will have out. We're over.

1504
02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be able to come in here and tell me how you feel in therapy. I won't talk about why I think it's a good idea. It'll all be anything you want. I will literally just listen and my therapist will make sure I only listen to you.

1505
02:40:27.210 --> 02:40:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be, you know, there was right at it'd be you. I have to take care of you sort of ahead of time and make sure you are resilient and ready to take in.

1506
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Some nonsense. Maybe not. Maybe she'll say something that's really cool. Are you really like hearing what's going on. Maybe she'll be able to describe the term level what it's like to be her. Maybe he'll like

1507
02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. But in order to get her in. You might sell it with this idea. I won't say anything. My therapist really wants to you to have the space to be able to share with this has been like for you.

1508
02:41:01.470 --> 02:41:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll just listen. Sweetheart, to feel heard by me, she'll say no.

1509
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's how you get her in. I will shut up and I will just listen now between you and Andre. That's not the issue. I already know you listen

1510
02:41:17.970 --> 02:41:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, this is this is a little conniving, but we get if it works, we get to say

1511
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What transparently, we were thinking maybe

1512
02:41:29.250 --> 02:41:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This once we got in, we would sort of say this and this. This is our, kind of like the plan. Once she's in

1513
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This is certainly I bring it up. I say, Yeah, we were kind of that's how it works for everybody. Everybody wants to feel heard and so we kind of hoped that maybe by, you know, phrasing it that way and creating this safe space for you that you might want to come by.

1514
02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't get advice from going to bear.

1515
02:41:53.610 --> 02:42:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing she's going to do is make sure that you get to share. She might be teaching the I feel so that there's some structure to it.

1516
02:42:02.610 --> 02:42:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Some I feel statements and maybe if we have time, the mirroring because I love that structure. I really love that people

1517
02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right can use that to communicate instead of name calling and kitchens thinking bringing up past things and shaming people guilt tripping a lot of damage can be done in a in an argument.

1518
02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can come up with an idea that you think would work for her. And here's the way you might look at it, you look at her and you go

1519
02:42:33.390 --> 02:42:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's her unmet need

1520
02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How can therapy, be that for her. Right. And that's how you kind of find your way in

1521
02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not about you not about you. She's not in a place to choose so wrapped up in self preservation. She just can't.

1522
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She's merged with her family.

1523
02:42:59.220 --> 02:42:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I

1524
02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

1525
02:43:01.470 --> 02:43:02.310
Ray Casias: I think you're right.

1526
02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:03.990
Ray Casias: I get it.

1527
02:43:06.210 --> 02:43:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's schedule another time to meet

1528
02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What about

1529
02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to wait two weeks or meet next week, but which you prefer.

1530
02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: More than that, it's up to you, you can meet whenever you want to. You've been here long enough. It's up to you.

1531
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:31.920
Ray Casias: Longer than two weeks.

1532
02:43:34.170 --> 02:43:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So it won't be week of March six, we'll move it up to

1533
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's move it to march 11 which is a Wednesday.

1534
02:43:54.930 --> 02:43:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1535
02:43:56.430 --> 02:43:56.670
Yeah.

1536
02:44:01.050 --> 02:44:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: March 11 at 12pm

1537
02:44:06.810 --> 02:44:11.910
Ray Casias: I go through higher teams like in in between our meetings.

1538
02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:20.670
Ray Casias: Such a roller coaster I there's times I'm such a train wreck and I picked myself up.

1539
02:44:22.050 --> 02:44:29.280
Ray Casias: And then I think, Man, I got a lot to say to Glenn, but then by the time we see each other again. I kind of get myself together. I'm in

1540
02:44:30.330 --> 02:44:32.190
Ray Casias: But you're invaluable though.

1541
02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:36.630
Ray Casias: Keep me grounded and

1542
02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:44.070
Ray Casias: I you know in this environment. I do need that reinforcement.

1543
02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:51.630
Ray Casias: I don't like to feel like I'm losing it, and I and I'm

1544
02:44:52.770 --> 02:44:56.640
Ray Casias: Not making sensor or unfair or

1545
02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:00.150
Ray Casias: Or anything like that are selfish or anything like

1546
02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You've never you've never come across irrational to me. You never have i mean the the the suicide part was was hard was hard. It may come again but

1547
02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I still get the logic, right, because you you put yourself in such a if I can't assert myself and these people won't help me if I can assert myself. These people won't help me.

1548
02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It can feel hopeless and I get that, but stay in your truth right in that momentum forward. What's the next right thing for you. The next right thing will happen just stay in it, keep it really simple.

1549
02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I feeling. What do I need, it's okay give myself permission. It's okay. It's okay if it's coming from me. It's got to be okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1550
02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it is. I know your decisions are an investment in self healing and in the marriage and family values. I'm not worried those choices will come from the heart.

1551
02:46:00.690 --> 02:46:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I get to see you on Monday. I hope I do

1552
02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:04.230
Ray Casias: Yeah yeah

1553
02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:07.350
Ray Casias: Yesterday was I had a

1554
02:46:08.490 --> 02:46:15.660
Ray Casias: It was a cancellation and gastro I needed to see him sooner. They called me what the cancellation. So I went in.

1555
02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:19.050
Ray Casias: But I'll be there be there Monday.

1556
02:46:19.650 --> 02:46:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm gonna write it down just a little name here just to kind of say we're thinking we're going to see Ray I have one o'clock.

1557
02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Be good to you.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so let me open up a note for us.

1571
02:47:36.750 --> 02:47:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Remind me which group you're in

Gwenevere Abriel: nobody's home but just the baby. Are there other folks that are around

1578
02:48:17.610 --> 02:48:18.840
Bianca Garcia: No, just me and the baby.

1579
02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:24.240
Bianca Garcia: What's he doing she's in her swing watching Sesame Street.

1580
02:48:28.530 --> 02:48:30.570
Bianca Garcia: Possibly going to take a nap. I don't know.

1581
02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We can only hope.

1582
02:48:33.930 --> 02:48:34.320
Yeah.

1583
02:48:36.930 --> 02:48:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay, so today.

1584
02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to just sort of generally get an idea of kind of what you already have in your, sort of, this is how what I learned. Maybe in a in a particular

1585
02:48:54.600 --> 02:49:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy or in treatment or elsewhere, kind of get a sense of what coping skills you already have. So I don't go over something you already know. Okay, okay.

1586
02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so when you were going to therapy in the past. I think there was a history of you did a residential setting or you only did outpatient, I can't remember.

1587
02:49:17.550 --> 02:49:20.580
Bianca Garcia: Oh yeah, patient outpatient only yes

1588
02:49:21.390 --> 02:49:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you were meeting with this therapist, did they teach you any emotional regulation skills.

1589
02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:31.830
Bianca Garcia: I believe so, yes.

1590
02:49:33.570 --> 02:49:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what

1591
02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:49.890
Bianca Garcia: Well, I don't really remember it's been like four years that I haven't been there. Well, actually. Yeah, little know actually like over two and a half years or something. But I was there for a while but um

1592
02:49:50.520 --> 02:50:06.510
Bianca Garcia: It was also like a parenting class. Do we were able to take our children with us. So I had small child and i don't i don't really know, but I'm sure if you would tell me some stuff I would remember I just not a top of my head right now.

1593
02:50:07.410 --> 02:50:07.800
Bianca Garcia: So,

1594
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But then important because it would need to be on the top of your head.

1595
02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:13.770
Bianca Garcia: Right.

1596
02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Use it. So regardless of whether you're like, oh yeah. Either way, it ain't remembered

1597
02:50:20.490 --> 02:50:22.560
Bianca Garcia: Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1598
02:50:24.030 --> 02:50:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's just fine. So if there's nothing that sort of comes

1599
02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just go over some of that I like, just as we're kind of getting to know each other. I'll go over some of the ones that

1600
02:50:35.850 --> 02:50:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The one people after there right at the end.

1601
02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you'll start to hear it throughout treatment. You'll hear them say, You know what, I still do. The, the, what I remember is the because it's so useful.

1602
02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:55.080
Bianca Garcia: Okay. Thank you, sir.

1603
02:50:59.010 --> 02:51:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So first thing I want to teach you

1604
02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

1605
02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes by a lot of different names, but it's box breathing is what I call it also Daya for matic breathing. Now you may say, I don't believe in that.

1606
02:51:22.350 --> 02:51:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to believe in it for it to work, because this is based on your biology.

1607
02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you have the sympathetic nervous system, the one that if someone jumps around the corner, you have a startle response, you're scared, right, or maybe even notice your hands pop up in front of you.

1608
02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have to think I need to jump back. I need to pull my little paws up ready to protect myself now.

1609
02:51:47.670 --> 02:52:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the sympathetic nervous system automatically there for you to preserve you. Its job is to say, danger, danger, danger, danger, basically. That's all it does. It's scanning all the time.

1610
02:52:05.610 --> 02:52:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Bianca in trouble. Is she in danger.

1611
02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Only problem is

1612
02:52:13.380 --> 02:52:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be overused.

1613
02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much of the time overreacting. Yes, it was adaptive maybe at one point in a, in a low grade anxiety setting for self preservation is overused. So people will come in here and they'll say I have this anxiety disorder.

1614
02:52:31.410 --> 02:52:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just, I'm just always like, my heart is racing after these short shallow breaths and I'm sweating and I just feel like I i just can't, you know, I'm just so I'm so anxious so stressed. Yeah. Is that something you can relate to.

1615
02:52:46.050 --> 02:52:47.820
Yeah. Yeah, right.

1616
02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the sympathetic nervous system. And did you know that the body has a counter acting system.

1617
02:52:58.020 --> 02:52:58.590
Bianca Garcia: No, I didn't.

1618
02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, our body so smart.

1619
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:03.060
Bianca Garcia: I'm here. Yeah.

1620
02:53:03.330 --> 02:53:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing. It's a miracle. It's the parasympathetic nervous system. And that's what we're going to talk about today.

1621
02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to believe in it. It's been there all along. It's not cicala here it's it's physiology, which of course also is psychology. But for now, we'll just sort of say, let's just say it's biological

1622
02:53:24.450 --> 02:53:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what actually is happening when we do the box breathing and I'll teach it in a minute after I stop yapping about them what it is.

1623
02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I promise we'll do it unless we get disconnected. But, um, so basically, I'll be teaching you this box breathing and the mechanism of influence or change is the fact that when you freeze the way I'm going to go over it with you the bottom of your long because air.

1624
02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Not up here.

1625
02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, look how

1626
02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not how we breathe when we're scared.

1627
02:53:59.610 --> 02:54:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep. So, what will be really different is the bottom of our long will get air our diaphragm that thing that's right in the middle of our body that separates the top viscera from the bottom, the one that gives us the hiccups. You know that one.

1628
02:54:13.950 --> 02:54:14.370
Mm hmm.

1629
02:54:17.220 --> 02:54:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be pushing it down with a full lung and then we're going to be smoking all those organs on the bottom.

1630
02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not what's actually activating the parasympathetic nervous system there a nerve that runs brain ears, eyes, face larynx bearings heart, lungs, stomach. Oh, most of our organs. It's wrapped around and it's called the Vegas nerve.

1631
02:54:48.420 --> 02:55:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All the wandering there for a reason and waters all over the place. And because it's all kind of wrapped around the organs right below that diaphragm. When we breathe deep. We go reach motion.

1632
02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That sends a message a fair. Currently, which means down here, up to the brain.

1633
02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It sends a message up to the brain, which is busy thinking, Oh my gosh, we're going to die right the brains physically go, oh, this is awful. This is catastrophic home. I can't stand it. So, the mind is busy thinking horrible this this awful.

1634
02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We do when we breathe. We have a contradictory message coming from the

1635
02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:30.660
Bianca Garcia: Nerve

1636
02:55:30.750 --> 02:55:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: To the brain in contradiction to a threat response.

1637
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:36.930
And

1638
02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what can you have a belly breath when you're here.

1639
02:55:47.310 --> 02:55:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're up here.

1640
02:55:52.110 --> 02:56:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have a nice big breasts. You know what message that sense. Oh, we're fine. If this lady can have a big belly breath there can't be a lion tiger bear are summit about to reject us criticize us abandoned us yell at us hit us.

1641
02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: molest Nope. There is

1642
02:56:11.370 --> 02:56:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No danger. That is the message that you're sending in contradiction to the OH MY GOSH thought, Oh, oh no, then up comes this thought

1643
02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And the body down regulates

1644
02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's called the Vegas break right because it's the Vegas nerve. So we call it the big break and it puts the brakes on all of that sympathetic nervous system that activation. So it's really exciting. So remember how I started and I said, you don't have to believe it for it to work.

1645
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I like about it. This is science.

1646
02:56:46.050 --> 02:56:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body knows how to heal itself and it's beautiful.

1647
02:56:49.470 --> 02:56:50.370
Bianca Garcia: Right, yeah.

1648
02:56:51.390 --> 02:56:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, any questions about just the the biology of it before I teach it to you.

1649
02:56:58.740 --> 02:56:59.220
Bianca Garcia: Know,

1650
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: familia. Remember I said I wanted to check in on things you already know.

1651
02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to check in, you know, this word mind fullness.

1652
02:57:20.490 --> 02:57:21.840
Bianca Garcia: Yes, I've heard it. Yes.

1653
02:57:23.610 --> 02:57:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So in this field of behavioral health psychology and all that, it's used a lot and I like to use it in terms of

1654
02:57:34.230 --> 02:57:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness. So I don't really focus on things you here and we might have a little debates about the meaning of words or beliefs about yourself, or how you're feeling

1655
02:57:45.900 --> 02:58:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll also be interested in how things feel tact tactically like your skin. How things feel on your hands, your arms, your legs, your viscera your lungs your throat. I'm going to be getting into what I call the soma, the somatic awareness.

1656
02:58:02.430 --> 02:58:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're breathing, you're going to pay attention to the air coming in through your nose, you'll feel a little hairs wiggling maybe it comes in and you're going to have that air come down into your belly.

1657
02:58:15.690 --> 02:58:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And the difference is is that you're going to have your hands here on your belly and they will push out on the inhale.

1658
02:58:22.650 --> 02:58:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your stomach will go out on the inhale and it can be a pretty foreign experience. If you've never done it before. But what you'll notice is, instead of watch my shoulders. I'm going to do the breathing the way most people freeze, which is this

1659
02:58:35.610 --> 02:58:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You see my shoulders.

1660
02:58:39.270 --> 02:58:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm going to do a belly breath and watch my shoulders.

1661
02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not the big

1662
02:58:53.790 --> 02:58:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, you're being

1663
02:58:56.730 --> 02:58:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're being

1664
02:58:59.730 --> 02:59:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Tommy. Why is it a she, or or a boy. What we're talking about here. Yeah, so she you see her land on on the changing better in her little bed right she has a little belly. That goes up and down, and she reads from her belly and it's so cute. And we forgot how to do that.

1665
02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we can do it again.

1666
02:59:23.010 --> 02:59:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

1667
02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'll be I'll go over it a few times a model it for you. I'll do it for you. And then we'll do it together. Okay, so I'm going to just describe the box part. So it's inhaling

1668
02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just enter this little ringer off.

1669
02:59:41.580 --> 02:59:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be inhaling being mindful of how things feel tactful tactile in through the nose for four seconds. It'll be

1670
02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the belly. Right. It'll be the skin Hale for four seconds in nearly

1671
02:59:55.560 --> 02:59:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll hold your breath.

1672
02:59:58.590 --> 03:00:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't find that this is a natural thing. This is a really

1673
03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Takes a lot of concentration. To do this, breathing.

1674
03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Who asked him to if a breath, we can hold the breath. So we're going to hold it, you can do it for for a second semi brace that creates this perfect box and then we hold the breath for 4321 then we're going to exhale it feeling the air out of our mouth.

1675
03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole

1676
03:00:28.680 --> 03:00:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that was shoulders. Right. I needed it.

1677
03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But I was just sort of teaching it. And I kind of blow it there, but you're going to want to inhale, with the belly.

1678
03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Or four seconds. Hold that air for four seconds. Exhale.

1679
03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Four seconds hold for for most people don't like those last four. We don't have to pull for, for we can just do it for a couple seconds.

1680
03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So then as far do you have all the exhale out. That's fine. Doesn't matter. But for teaching. I like to keep it simple for for for for for

1681
03:00:56.310 --> 03:01:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: See that failed and you're holding that breath out your concentrated way push all that air out. I gotta hold that breath out. And then the inhale through the nose. Remember the mechanism that gets that Vegas nerve is what do you remember

1682
03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:16.260
Bianca Garcia: I'm the no

1683
03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Air

1684
03:01:19.950 --> 03:01:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The air going in the bottom of your lung we. That's it. It's that belly breath.

1685
03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we if box is too hard. Remember will call it belly breath. That way we can have that word in their hands, push out because the air went down low. It won't be. You won't, it won't feel like you're

1686
03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: As big actually because it's actually a hard feeling to do just kind of put your hands. They're just play with it a little bit. See if you can even do it.

1687
03:01:46.140 --> 03:01:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just watch your hands. Don't look at me, look at your own hands on your tummy. Inhale and see me go out on the inhale. See if you can even do it.

1688
03:01:56.910 --> 03:02:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you just moved so I can't see your hands. Unfortunately, you may want to

1689
03:02:00.750 --> 03:02:02.370
Bianca Garcia: Oh, should I put him or down.

1690
03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you may want to turn the camera so I can be of service, see, okay. Beautiful. OK, so now put your hands on your belly. And now, inhale.

1691
03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Up when you went in the top. Try it again and this time just free push those hands out so you get a big Cuccinelli on the inhale.

1692
03:02:24.390 --> 03:02:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo, but it feels really different. When you send it to

1693
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:30.060
The

1694
03:02:31.170 --> 03:02:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Art. Moving. Does it feel different.

1695
03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:36.510
Bianca Garcia: When you try that again.

1696
03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not be doing it right. So watch those hands get a nice

1697
03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and flat. Okay, so push against the belly. And now I want you to watch them and I'm inhale those hands are going to go out because you're filling in the bottom of the one imagine you're filling in the top of the long and then pushing those hands out

1698
03:02:54.570 --> 03:02:56.160
Bianca Garcia: So when I'm inhaling

1699
03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am, not up there on the top of your lungs. You got to have it. You gotta send it all the way down because I'm still watching the shoulders move a little bit

1700
03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's hard to do. I told you.

1701
03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:08.160
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

1702
03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody knows how to break but

1703
03:03:11.970 --> 03:03:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can

1704
03:03:14.130 --> 03:03:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Self up here.

1705
03:03:16.590 --> 03:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody thinks this is so easy. I know.

1706
03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:20.640
Bianca Garcia: I say this not actually. Yeah.

1707
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I try to tell people know once you really get this, but it'll make a huge difference when you're in distress. It'll calm you down. Just like that.

1708
03:03:29.370 --> 03:03:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see. Can you see. Can you see my my tummy here.

1709
03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:36.210
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1710
03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm pushing on it now. Just try, don't even worry about breath. I want you to see if you can just push it out with your belly.

1711
03:03:45.330 --> 03:03:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch your hand push them out, push out your belly. Just push it out.

1712
03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can take any isn't moving out.

1713
03:03:53.430 --> 03:03:54.030
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1714
03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now I want you to

1715
03:03:56.070 --> 03:04:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to expand. You're going to bring the area in the top of the lung, and then it's going to go all the way to the bottom and then those hands are going to move out. So here we go. I'm exhaling. Now I'm inhaling

1716
03:04:10.770 --> 03:04:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, move much I gotta tell you they don't move much

1717
03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:18.090
Bianca Garcia: Okay, I felt that a little bit.

1718
03:04:19.050 --> 03:04:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw that one. Do it again.

1719
03:04:25.350 --> 03:04:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1720
03:04:25.740 --> 03:04:26.610
Bianca Garcia: See, you don't know

1721
03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a breath right versus when you were breathing at the top.

1722
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:31.050
There was like

1723
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:39.240
Bianca Garcia: I think when you said exhale. And then inhale, or or one or the other. First, that's when I checked it the most, I believe.

1724
03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:43.200
Bianca Garcia: I did the exhale first and then

1725
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:47.100
Bianca Garcia: I don't know. I felt it though.

1726
03:04:47.520 --> 03:05:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do this one together. So what I'm going to do is I'll say, inhale will inhale for for for count. That's the belly breath, that's the one you just learned. You got to push out that belly and then you'll see me do this for 321 exhale

1727
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:05.790
And then it'll be very

1728
03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:09.930
Bianca Garcia: Good I stand for this I

1729
03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, but I remember I was saying earlier, I think in group that you're going to want to have that phone propped up somewhere. This is why a lot of our activities are going to be. Yeah, we're going to need to be moving around and doing different things together.

1730
03:05:22.830 --> 03:05:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not just talk therapy. So maybe put me on a bookshelf, or somewhere in the kitchen. I don't care where you put me. But let's have me propped up so that you can really experienced this. Once you get this, you're going to be able to use it anytime you want. So

1731
03:05:38.940 --> 03:05:47.010
Bianca Garcia: Let me see where I could go cuz I in my room. I just have a TV Dan and it's too low. So, uh, let's see. Maybe the

1732
03:05:50.910 --> 03:05:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: medicine cabinet. There's shelving maybe

1733
03:05:56.280 --> 03:05:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then in the

1734
03:05:58.320 --> 03:05:59.370
Bianca Garcia: Net that

1735
03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Dish dish so stand back a little bit, you will be able to breathe that way. There we go. Gorgeous. Don't move. Okay, so here we go. So I'm going to just going to teach it again. You catch up. You catch up to me with the breathing okay on your own time. So I'm going to

1736
03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

1737
03:06:22.680 --> 03:06:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold

1738
03:06:24.690 --> 03:06:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To one exhale

1739
03:06:30.090 --> 03:06:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole

1740
03:06:32.130 --> 03:06:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Mess. The whole. Yeah, right. I know.

1741
03:06:35.970 --> 03:06:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's intuitive. So let's watch this is what it'll be it'll be in hell for four seconds holding our breath for source four seconds.

1742
03:06:44.310 --> 03:06:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling for four seconds and then, believe it or not holding our breath out for four seconds. Inhaling, can't wait to get to that in. Look at your back so exciting. We don't have to wait for a second. So we're gonna do it again.

1743
03:06:58.080 --> 03:06:58.410
So,

1744
03:06:59.550 --> 03:07:00.810

Bianca Garcia: Let's see where I could put you higher up.

1782
03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Little, little soap dish a little something in front of me. So I don't fall. Whatever it takes, but have any

1783
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:12.240
Bianca Garcia: Okay, let me see. Maybe I'll sit right here.

1784
03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:20.940
Bianca Garcia: That's one thing about the phone and computer. It just makes it a little bit more difficult. Alrighty.

1785
03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

1786
03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Two things I taught you all about the Vegas nerve that's biology. Did you also notice that this breathing know Joe takes all your concentration

1787
03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagine that you're having a perceived threat which means probably you are worried about something, right.

1788
03:10:45.750 --> 03:10:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Worried, that's a common one for people that identify as anxious or I have an anxiety or panic. History

1789
03:10:52.440 --> 03:11:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: There worrying and projecting into the future. That's what the minds job is to do it worries. No worries. No worries. No worries for you to kind of project in well this this hypothesis might be true. Let's think about that for a while, it tends to go to the negative

1790
03:11:07.290 --> 03:11:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But this breath, if you can remember to do the belly breathing. We'll call it belly breathing, because that might be an easier way for you to remember the belly.

1791
03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can remember to do the belly breathing. It takes your mind off of whatever you were thinking about because it takes so much concentration. The mind actually does want to do one thing at a time. Well, we're not actually that great at multitasking.

1792
03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, we're not, we can do a bunch of things really poorly. A few things moderately but we can do one thing pretty well.

1793
03:11:40.980 --> 03:11:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind wants to focus on one thing. So when you do this, difficulty breathing, which is not a natural breath and nobody's going to ask you to do it all the time you do it for a few cycles five cycles 10 cycles, something like that.

1794
03:11:52.440 --> 03:12:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Until you kind of feel that heart rate has gone down that breath right oh goodness. Yeah, that's really different, more sweating in your mind has a break. It was concentrated on feeling and I bet you didn't even remember to feel the era that knows I bet you were so worried about that.

1795
03:12:12.210 --> 03:12:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, holding the breath. And how many count. Where is she at so it takes all of your mind. And not only that you are learning something new. Oh, that's your brains favorite thing to do to concentrate on learning something new. It loves it, it'll put all it's a

1796
03:12:29.130 --> 03:12:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Learning the new thing. So today, you had the experience of the parasympathetic nervous system working for you.

1797
03:12:36.570 --> 03:12:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In late, the biggest break the Vega break you also had information on something.

1798
03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And learning something you did three things to emotionally regulate and all it was was something you already know how to do, which is great. And I find that amazing

1799
03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:57.720
Yeah yeah so

1800
03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is so hard. Well, good, because it'll get you concentrating and off of the worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry

1801
03:13:10.260 --> 03:13:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you picture you might actually find this useful when what's a scenario. Let me add a little bit into your life. Like, when would this be useful for you.

1802
03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:33.540
Bianca Garcia: Definitely before I like have a panic attack or an anxiety tech and I usually always do the breathing, but this one I'm obviously I've never done this before and I i feel like this might help better

1803
03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:41.370
Bianca Garcia: Than you know because I tried to just, like, you know, calming down breathing one yeah just regular so maybe it's my work better.

1804
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, cuz look at the science behind that you've probably been doing your breathing a little bit gets down to the bottom.

1805
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've been doing the breathing up here. And that's, that's pretty good. That's part you take a break and you focus on breath. That's smart. But when it's also very difficult

1806
03:13:58.020 --> 03:14:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To you getting your mind off of this threat response, whatever it is, it's going on, you've got some perceived threat. When you are in a relaxed body, the messages. We're okay. We want that contradiction.

1807
03:14:12.690 --> 03:14:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Contradicts whatever rational thought or maybe it's a memory that just kind of intruded into your life or you have this worst case scenario. Just heard some bad news. Okay, we want

1808
03:14:25.350 --> 03:14:25.560
Bianca Garcia: To

1809
03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:27.210
A relaxed.

1810
03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We want relaxed vigilance, we still want to be around aware of our surroundings. Right. Still have really vigilance, but in a relaxed body that's sort of the ideal some awakened.

1811
03:14:44.190 --> 03:14:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But we're in folders are relaxed or back is relaxed, we're just kind of chill in our body row right but we're awake and work taken in new information.

1812
03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The second that you can get that body to relax it sends a message will be okay.

1813
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:01.470
Bianca Garcia: All right, great.

1814
03:15:03.450 --> 03:15:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. Well, I'm excited for you. I hope you remember it. I'll probably be reminding you of it here and there, you'll hear about it in group because people use it to go to. It's typically

1815
03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:15.090
For people that

1816
03:15:16.890 --> 03:15:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to create

1817
03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Space and time between stimulus and response from people if they have like let's say they get irritable really quickly, they'll do the breath.

1818
03:15:31.830 --> 03:15:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There's time to think of other things to do besides yelling at someone throwing something getting mad right we create time with her.

1819
03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Blood then go to the brain.

1820
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it wasn't before when you're in a stress response.

1821
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the muscles.

1822
03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Are where they muscle groups and our

1823
03:15:54.840 --> 03:15:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hands get cold, cold.

1824
03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We're in a stress response. But when you do this, breathing blood goes to the frontal cortex. It's not just in those big muscles ready to fight or run

1825
03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exciting.

1826
03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We need all of our brain medicating with itself, all the different parts communicating

1827
03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:20.040
Bianca Garcia: Oh,

1828
03:16:20.940 --> 03:16:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So a lot goes on with that. I mean, it's just like what it just is so important.

1829
03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:28.320
Bianca Garcia: It's awesome. Yeah.

1830
03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't be shy. If you forget it. Don't give yourself a hard time you have a busy, busy.

1831
03:16:33.540 --> 03:16:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll probably go back and I'll say, hey,

1832
03:16:37.260 --> 03:16:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you do the belly breathing. If you didn't. That's okay. I'll read. I'll go over, they may consider putting sticky notes different places. If you want to help yourself. Remember, like if you tend to get kind of panicked in the kitchen or in your car, you might want to put a sticky note.

1833
03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Box freeze or belly. Breathe in the four count in Hell for for whole for myself or for

1834
03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:06.540
Bianca Garcia: Okay, that's a good idea.

1835
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:09.150
Bianca Garcia: Yes, so

1836
03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, just so you can get to know you a little bit. Tell me some stories about when you've kind of had some panic attacks when it's been kind of rough on you.

1837
03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:39.870
Bianca Garcia: I was like, possibly among a half to go. Um, I really don't know how it comes about, like, I don't like you know i mean obviously they're like you said, we just worry but like I could feel myself. Like if it's coming down and I have learned techniques are coping.

1838
03:17:41.970 --> 03:18:01.440
Bianca Garcia: Mechanisms to help me like I'll try to like walk around, or I'll do the breathing, but not this breathing. So like I said, I think it's pretty wild me a lot, and I just tried to calm myself down, and if not, then obviously like I tried to calm myself down to avoid to take my

1839
03:18:02.580 --> 03:18:14.310
Bianca Garcia: My as needed medication and I tried to do that. But if it doesn't get to that point. And I'm like, already in the process. Then I take my medication.

1840
03:18:16.980 --> 03:18:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything cognitive So cognitive a synonym for cognitive is thought

1841
03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you done any typically therapists will give you a positive thought to think an affirmation or something. Um,

1842
03:18:32.040 --> 03:18:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check in on the negative one.

1843
03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:35.610
Bianca Garcia: When you're having a panic.

1844
03:18:35.610 --> 03:18:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Attack. What do you believe

1845
03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:42.300
Bianca Garcia: Honestly, the worst. Yeah.

1846
03:18:43.290 --> 03:18:43.890
Bianca Garcia: Whatever that's

1847
03:18:44.490 --> 03:18:55.800
Bianca Garcia: What's up, I don't know, just like what can happen or, you know, what's next, or I don't know it's just sometimes it's just it seems crazy to me, Mike.

1848
03:18:56.400 --> 03:19:07.680
Bianca Garcia: Worry about that. But yeah, it could be anything. Little to anything big like any could just be anything like just, I don't know if any little thing.

1849
03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:19.290
Bianca Garcia: That the mind thinks, and you're like wait, like if something's going on like the kids are sick or something. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, and it just escalates, I guess from there.

1850
03:19:20.010 --> 03:19:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So when you have multiple maybe competing priorities, like I need to attend to the kids. But I was also really need to put this dinner together. I also really need to drive to an appointment when there's competing needs at the same time.

1851
03:19:35.130 --> 03:19:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what it feels like it's overwhelming. Is that one of them.

1852
03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:43.170
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, could be. It could be general things as well. Yes.

1853
03:19:43.350 --> 03:19:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All things. So let's say the moment that you become conscious in the morning you right you know before you even open your eyes. Oh, I'm awake.

1854
03:19:55.140 --> 03:19:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: My eyes are no but I know I'm awake. Right.

1855
03:19:58.380 --> 03:19:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm conscious

1856
03:20:01.470 --> 03:20:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you experience distress early in the day is that

1857
03:20:05.970 --> 03:20:20.880
Bianca Garcia: Sometimes, yeah. It just depends. Let's like let's say our brakes are giving out and I'm like, Oh, man. We need to get this die or like our cars broken down, you know, just certain stuff or we're going to be laying

1858
03:20:22.050 --> 03:20:24.900
Bianca Garcia: Just, you know, just everything and everything.

1859
03:20:29.010 --> 03:20:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's important to have brakes.

1860
03:20:33.090 --> 03:20:38.280
Bianca Garcia: Well, they were like they were already like he could hear them. So I was like, oh my gosh.

1861
03:20:38.910 --> 03:20:44.610
Bianca Garcia: It, but they're done. We already got that done, but when it was sounding like when you start for set hearing them.

1862
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:58.500
Bianca Garcia: And I know we still have time to get them, but it's still worries me because it's, you know, I'm like, we have to do it like right right now, even though we don't get the money till tomorrow. So it's just, it's just like, things like that.

1863
03:21:00.780 --> 03:21:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So you ended up getting it done right, you got the brakes fixed

1864
03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many days in between. Oh my god. I remember that one. Oh my gosh, we knew those bricks and how many days went by before they actually got fixed

1865
03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:26.340
Bianca Garcia: It was like a day. A day and a half, you gotta fix to following day in the morning. So yeah, wasn't much

1866
03:21:26.940 --> 03:21:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do to make sure that everybody was safe during that day and a half.

1867
03:21:32.730 --> 03:21:38.340
Bianca Garcia: Oh, well I didn't drive. I just took him to school and came back and that's it. I mean go anywhere.

1868
03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:48.330
Bianca Garcia: But I just like China, like in my mind, I'm like, I'll be saving them. And so I can pick them up and drop them off to school because we're so close to school. There's no bus.

1869
03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:55.560
Bianca Garcia: So we have to pick them up and drop them off. So I said, Okay, just drop them off and come right back home. So that's what I did and ID.

1870
03:21:56.730 --> 03:21:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were driving

1871
03:21:59.430 --> 03:21:59.940
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1872
03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you have just curious manual transmission

1873
03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:05.850
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1874
03:22:06.420 --> 03:22:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to use the downshift to to break

1875
03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:13.200
Bianca Garcia: Oh no, it's not manual. Sorry, it's automatic.

1876
03:22:13.350 --> 03:22:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1877
03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:15.300
Bianca Garcia: But yes, I do.

1878
03:22:16.020 --> 03:22:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, even on an automatic you can pull it back to second, you're not. I mean,

1879
03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:21.120
Bianca Garcia: Typically

1880
03:22:21.180 --> 03:22:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of a break.

1881
03:22:22.890 --> 03:22:33.840
Bianca Garcia: Mm hmm. Yeah. I would coast day. I wouldn't really I wasn't going like, you know, where you could go and then stop. No, I was like coasting or I didn't really have to press the gas as a break as much

1882
03:22:34.230 --> 03:22:43.200
Bianca Garcia: And it's really, it's a really slow lane from here to the school. I mean, obviously you have to go school speed limit. So yeah, that helped out a lot as well. Okay.

1883
03:22:44.130 --> 03:22:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So ultimately you. Was this your idea, your solution. I'll still drive them, but I'll do it in this way, you just described. Was this your idea.

1884
03:22:55.710 --> 03:23:03.570
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I didn't want to keep pressing a break or, you know, I don't know, I, that's what I thought. Yeah, but yes.

1885
03:23:04.050 --> 03:23:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you ended up coming up with a solution and then the break. Scott fixed

1886
03:23:11.010 --> 03:23:11.550
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1887
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This might seem like an odd question, but what do you think the worrying did for you for that day and a half.

1888
03:23:20.460 --> 03:23:25.290
Bianca Garcia: Law didn't help at all. I mean, I was so worried is

1889
03:23:26.250 --> 03:23:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Finance. I know, I know I'm testing the waters here.

1890
03:23:28.860 --> 03:23:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1891
03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Play with me. What did the worrying, who for you.

1892
03:23:35.430 --> 03:23:46.320
Bianca Garcia: Oh I stressed me out more overwhelmed me put it made me think about safety. I was just, it was a mess. I didn't like it at all.

1893
03:23:47.940 --> 03:23:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't do any

1894
03:23:50.820 --> 03:23:51.720
Bianca Garcia: Good, yeah.

1895
03:23:51.900 --> 03:23:53.940
Bianca Garcia: Right. What, what could it do, I don't know.

1896
03:23:54.600 --> 03:23:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sometimes the answer is different. So we're finding out

1897
03:23:58.980 --> 03:24:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Look again didn't do anything that helped you with the solution.

1898
03:24:07.050 --> 03:24:09.960
Bianca Garcia: Did it do anything to help me with the solution.

1899
03:24:12.990 --> 03:24:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's a weird question, hang on to yourself there.

1900
03:24:16.170 --> 03:24:16.680
Bianca Garcia: I'm like,

1901
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:18.000
I know

1902
03:24:19.020 --> 03:24:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This is only the beginning. I asked a really weird question.

1903
03:24:23.970 --> 03:24:25.200
Bianca Garcia: Thank you for the heads up.

1904
03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:28.020
Bianca Garcia: Well,

1905
03:24:29.790 --> 03:24:33.600
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I mean, it obviously helped me come up with a solution.

1906
03:24:33.660 --> 03:24:34.440
What did

1907
03:24:35.730 --> 03:24:38.640
Bianca Garcia: Well, in my brain. I think it was until we got

1908
03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:41.220
Bianca Garcia: Through that

1909
03:24:41.790 --> 03:24:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great. That's what THERAPY DOES right it pushes sort of was familiar to going into a space of uncertainty and like, Oh, wow.

1910
03:24:51.930 --> 03:25:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll be doing that quite a bit. I wanted to see how you would handle sort of this kind of question. So let's let's visit it one more time. You're doing great.

1911
03:25:01.410 --> 03:25:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way you can fail at this as a client.

1912
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No way to fail.

1913
03:25:07.230 --> 03:25:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1914
03:25:10.740 --> 03:25:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at it one more time.

1915
03:25:13.650 --> 03:25:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's flip it around.

1916
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What would have happened if the stress wasn't there for that day and a half, don't answer right away. Just sit with it with that question in the absence of that worry

1917
03:25:29.250 --> 03:25:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And my brakes need fixing what would it have gone on.

1918
03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:35.010
During that day and a half.

1919
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you have maybe done the same thing driven them.

1920
03:25:50.490 --> 03:25:51.840
Bianca Garcia: without the worry. Yeah.

1921
03:25:53.010 --> 03:25:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The solution may have been the same, you would have come up with the solution.

1922
03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:12.060
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody else would drive recklessly would be like going and stopping pressing. You know, I don't think anybody would with the brakes like that. So yeah, I think it would be the same.

1923
03:26:12.690 --> 03:26:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now go in or personally. Now we're going to expand this this question a little bit broader. This one was just around you're coming up with a solution. We've played with it may not have been unnecessary recipe for the solution.

1924
03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're familiar with how to get around, but it may not be necessary necessary recipe. Now let's try it on. Same question.

1925
03:26:34.710 --> 03:26:34.980
With

1926
03:26:37.530 --> 03:26:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Without this, this anxiety this stress, what would have happened for the day and a half.

1927
03:26:44.370 --> 03:26:44.790
Bianca Garcia: With

1928
03:26:45.480 --> 03:26:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling your husband with your husband without the stress.

1929
03:26:53.580 --> 03:26:57.450
Bianca Garcia: What would it have been the day and a half without him. No.

1930
03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me try again. Okay.

1931
03:26:59.820 --> 03:27:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I want you to think interpersonal you're in a relationship with the common law husband. I'm going to call him husband, you're in a relationship with your husband, but this day, you did today a little differently. I'm not going to do the stress thing today. I've already got a plan.

1932
03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How might the relationship with your husband have changed. If you weren't stressed.

1933
03:27:23.430 --> 03:27:24.300
And anxious

1934
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:35.010
Bianca Garcia: Well, I would think it made it a little bit more easier on either ones emotionally mental

1935
03:27:36.180 --> 03:27:41.850
Bianca Garcia: Mental mentally dealing with stuff on the on that day. I guess it would have been

1936
03:27:42.210 --> 03:27:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Idea how is it typically when you're stressed with him. What's it. How's it usually turn out when you're in an anxiety response with your husband, what ends up happening.

1937
03:27:52.230 --> 03:27:56.580
Bianca Garcia: Oh, nothing, just, I just need some space. I just

1938
03:27:57.900 --> 03:28:07.740
Bianca Garcia: We usually it I become a little better at handling stress and he is like I come up with a solution gave me So Gary, but like I could

1939
03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:17.070
Bianca Garcia: I just tried to know. I feel like I take it better. Like I could be caught more calm about it. I don't know.

1940
03:28:17.850 --> 03:28:18.210
Yeah.

1941
03:28:20.220 --> 03:28:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's, I have a lot to learn. I have a lot to learn about him. I don't know if he's in recovery to if he's got what's going on with him. I have no idea. So lots and lots to learn, but we're starting. We got to start from somewhere.

1942
03:28:33.270 --> 03:28:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you remember, and then we'll kind of bring this session to a close with this. Do you remember me telling you about that when you have a relaxed body.

1943
03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, actually, this is probably new information that the oxygen demand from your heart goes down so you don't have to

1944
03:28:52.350 --> 03:29:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to breathe fast. The heart is like, oh, I don't need as much oxygen. We're not going to be running three miles to get away from the tiger. So I don't need you all to be brave and so deep and we're all right we're right we're right so

1945
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That blood doesn't have to just go to the large muscles. It can now make its way to the different parts of the brain where it leaves. Typically when you're in anxiety is it leaves prefrontal cortex part of your brain, the one that comes up with solutions.

1946
03:29:26.640 --> 03:29:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you know how you just said, my husband doesn't do some good when he's in a stress response and you to me to everyone. The blood doesn't get here. And so all it's offline.

1947
03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: He can't think is clearly so you know I need to go chill to come up with a solution. You already know that that's fantastic.

1948
03:29:49.080 --> 03:30:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: With this new breathing, you'll be able to have a relaxed body that blood will get up here to the prefrontal cortex and you will be able to come up with even more ideas brainstorming, you're going to have access to now reasoning.

1949
03:30:04.800 --> 03:30:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Logical planning part of your brain that you need to come up with a solution, it creates morose telling you about time that breath creates time that if you stayed in an anxious body and anxious, mind you won't have access to, because of course

1950
03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, all the blood is going to stay in these large muscle groups and you'll be in the stress response. So there's so many good reasons to chill.

1951
03:30:29.010 --> 03:30:36.930
Bianca Garcia: Yeah. Awesome. That's, that's the thing that that's something you learned something every day and I'm glad you taught me that today because

1952
03:30:37.410 --> 03:30:50.610
Bianca Garcia: That is a good thing. That's, that's obviously makes sense because you know when people are, you know, like not chill. They, they don't really, they're not thinking rational and I always say them like you need to chill out.

1953
03:30:52.050 --> 03:30:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

1954
03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:56.220
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I know, I probably get more mad right

1955
03:30:56.670 --> 03:31:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. Yeah. Okay. So we covered a lot of stuff. And I also had a chance. And thank you for kind of working with me a little bit on this, um,

1956
03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I got to see a little bit of flexibility you tried on a new way of thinking for a moment. And that's sort of playing a little bit with analysis. It's playing with reasoning and self reflection.

1957
03:31:23.250 --> 03:31:24.420
Bianca Garcia: Do you do that.

1958
03:31:24.600 --> 03:31:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On your own sometimes do you reflect on your own personal growth and

1959
03:31:30.480 --> 03:31:31.110
Bianca Garcia: Definitely

1960
03:31:31.500 --> 03:31:31.800
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1961
03:31:32.490 --> 03:31:34.110
Bianca Garcia: So we'll be doing will be doing that.

1962
03:31:36.600 --> 03:31:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing that we might do if if it seems like it's a good fit is we might be doing things like image might be exploring some imagery

1963
03:31:47.400 --> 03:32:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to have a resource and grounding for you. We might also do imagery as a sense of safety, so that we can do some analysis, maybe have some work in your past. Okay.

1964
03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to create safety. So I'm all about that. I'm all about emotion regulation. Absolutely. And we want to create safety before

1965
03:32:12.510 --> 03:32:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And start mucking around with the psychological history. First, I want you to feel like, Okay, I know where to go. If I get in distress in your mind. I want to create that for you. And a lot of that is imagery

1966
03:32:25.620 --> 03:32:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, yes, it will be tapping into the right brain, which is, imagine this, I'll say, or, you know, imagine this person or this quality or this safe space for example, so that we will be your imagination.

1967
03:32:42.450 --> 03:32:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing that we might be doing is, if you're open to it. I found over the last two months that I'm able

1968
03:32:51.630 --> 03:32:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To em dr in here. I didn't know that I could do it, but it still works, which is really cool.

1969
03:32:59.100 --> 03:33:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Em dr is an eye movement.

1970
03:33:00.840 --> 03:33:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: desensitization reprocessing technique that accesses the left and right hemisphere of the brain.

1971
03:33:09.720 --> 03:33:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It may be relevant for us, it may not always talk about it. Educate you've seen kind of the way I did the belly breathing. I'll tell you, whatever it is, I know I want you to have it. I don't keep anything for myself. Whenever I got yours.

1972
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm we may do that, there also might be times when we do

1973
03:33:28.140 --> 03:33:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: In our file work.

1974
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be

1975
03:33:35.640 --> 03:33:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking to an empty chair.

1976
03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I know and remember you can always laugh at.

1977
03:33:42.720 --> 03:33:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

1978
03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Always make fun of me. I don't take it personally. I have a lot of tread marks from being put under the bus don't care used to it.

1979
03:33:50.220 --> 03:33:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the truth of the matter is, these techniques work.

1980
03:33:54.810 --> 03:34:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: People kind of resolve the trauma history developmental trauma and work through anxiety conditions.

1981
03:34:03.300 --> 03:34:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it works. I want to make it available through you, you can always laugh at me. Giggling is a great way to get through something until I get sort of comfortable. I don't, I don't get offended.

1982
03:34:14.250 --> 03:34:15.270
Bianca Garcia: Ready to know

1983
03:34:16.350 --> 03:34:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put

1984
03:34:19.080 --> 03:34:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put this box or belly breathing to use. See if you can remember to do it when you wake up. See if you can remember, at least once a day. And right before you go to bed, those three times. Then we we have some more neural connections and maybe it will be remembered.

1985
03:34:37.890 --> 03:34:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning. As soon as consciousness hits you. You like how do I do that building thing stick my moon. How do we get that belly going so right practice it in the middle of the day, baby.

1986
03:34:50.100 --> 03:34:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Crying is making me cookie dough.

1987
03:34:53.940 --> 03:35:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing and love that thing, but that crying. So, and then again right before you go to sleep. So that would be sort of an invitation, sort of, kind of like homework.

1988
03:35:03.690 --> 03:35:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's pick another time to meet. Would you be comfortable with. I'm Same time next Tuesday at

1989
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: 1pm

1990
03:35:17.940 --> 03:35:18.900
Bianca Garcia: Yes, that's fine.

1991
03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:22.770
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

1992
03:35:23.280 --> 03:35:23.670
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

1993
03:35:24.210 --> 03:35:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have medication bridge to today. Should I be sending a message to your doctor.

1994
03:35:30.540 --> 03:35:31.560
Bianca Garcia: Um,

1995
03:35:32.010 --> 03:35:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me rephrase that. Are you going to have a medication to get to group.

1996
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:41.130
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't know. Let me see what he gave me I know he gave that to me.

1997
03:35:44.130 --> 03:35:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are brand new.

1998
03:35:46.650 --> 03:36:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Occasion is bridge between group and individual than group than individual and I tend to send a message to this program slack saying, hey, Bianca showed up and he takes it from there. I don't say much else. He works it out. I just kind of covered the tendencies.

1999
03:36:03.210 --> 03:36:11.850
Bianca Garcia: Okay, I believe I got it. The 21st. So, so, and he only gave me a four days, I believe.

2000
03:36:12.540 --> 03:36:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So look at your medication.

2001
03:36:15.210 --> 03:36:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you get your

2002
03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:23.490
Bianca Garcia: One second. Let me see something

2003
03:36:28.500 --> 03:36:33.570
Bianca Garcia: No. Yeah, no, I only have two days, two nights.

2004
03:36:35.220 --> 03:36:38.250
Bianca Garcia: So that covers. I think the four days since he gave you

2005
03:36:39.060 --> 03:36:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Some notice Bianca number of my my original question is medication bridged to today, I think it was

2006
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So in other words, in early phase of treatment. Most people are motivated to make sure they don't run out of their medication until you like really dig this psychotherapy thing.

2007
03:36:59.820 --> 03:37:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this sort of part of a positive reinforcement with the medication. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to message is it is a doctor all women are all brielle that you have Doctor isn't a woman or a man

2008
03:37:10.530 --> 03:37:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Man. Okay, so I've got it right here. So, Bianca attended her individual counseling.

2009
03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And

2010
03:37:21.780 --> 03:37:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When's your next group.

2011
03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:24.240
Bianca Garcia: Friday.

2012
03:37:24.750 --> 03:37:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, cool. And that's what he'll do will probably give you enough to get to their Bianca, when you have consistent attendance and you show up for individual therapy. Keep that appointment don't know dentist appointment no little login

2013
03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Will check your other appointments. Don't say yes in here unless you really are. Sure, you can keep them.

2014
03:37:44.130 --> 03:37:44.430
Bianca Garcia: Group.

2015
03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If you put together a few weeks of it. We're going to change it.

2016
03:37:48.300 --> 03:38:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Every week, it'll be group to group and then it'll be every two weeks, it will get easier. It's not going to stay this difficult all the time. Okay, it will get better, but all we have is this medication. I don't have free movie tickets to give you. That's all I got.

2017
03:38:02.970 --> 03:38:03.690
Bianca Garcia: NO WORRY.

2018
03:38:04.080 --> 03:38:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: See you on Friday. I just sent the message will see and group you keep your eye out for a little message from right. I think it's a coupon or the pharmacy or something comes through.

Bianca Garcia: If he's

2020
03:38:17.250 --> 03:38:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting messages. Sometimes he's busy but call your pharmacy and see if it's in, and I'll see on Friday.

2021
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:26.280
Bianca Garcia: Thank you will see you then. Bye bye.
