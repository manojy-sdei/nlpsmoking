69
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.850
Ensure

70
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.880
Jennífer castro: You see, sometimes obsessive about it and I love that the kids would be here.

71
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.840
Yeah.

72
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.520
Serenna Beers: That's true.

73
00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:01.950
Serenna Beers: So when you're getting up in the morning and you're thinking about getting getting dressed and stuff. What are the kinds of messages that you tell that you tell yourself that keep you from wanting to feel like you want to get up.

74
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.960
Jennífer castro: That I want to get up, I get up. I just love and go back to sleep.

75
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.330
Jennífer castro: Very well. A lot of times I see a lot of times there's nobody listening to our conversation. And I'll just

76
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.090
Jennífer castro: Intervene, I guess.

77
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.550
Jennífer castro: Okay, so

78
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.270
Jennífer castro: Today, I just got out.

79
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.020
Jennífer castro: Sorry, my power went off here. So,

80
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.860
Oh,

81
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.740
Serenna Beers: It went off on purpose.

82
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.580
Jennífer castro: Yeah, no, no, no, I don't know, I haven't been out of a room. Yes.

83
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.090
Oh,

84
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.140
Serenna Beers: Okay. Is it rainy there or something.

85
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.010
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

86
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:50.580
Serenna Beers: It's right now. It could be that when whenever it storms, as you know, I mean, there's an increased risk, especially if it's windy. Now, where are you from,

87
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.320
Jennífer castro: I'm and but so

88
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.910
Serenna Beers: Okay.

89
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.850
Serenna Beers: Well, it is rainy, I am in sac.

90
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.480
Jennífer castro: So it's

91
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.450
Serenna Beers: Rainy here today. So that would make sense.

92
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.170
Yeah.

93
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:15.900
Serenna Beers: So what is your biggest reason or I mean if I were to ask you why you have no motivation. What's the first thought that comes to you.

94
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.710
Jennífer castro: At blank right now. Like, I don't know.

95
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.160
Jennífer castro: I used to be my kid.

96
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.690
Jennífer castro: You know,

97
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.370
Jennífer castro: And then they moved out.

98
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.960
Jennífer castro: They're all adults with kids.

99
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.940
Serenna Beers: How often do you see them.

100
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:46.770
Jennífer castro: My oldest son, I very rarely like once every two or three months and then my youngest son I see like every other week.

101
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.370
Jennífer castro: My adopted son.

102
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.130
Jennífer castro: Gone.

103
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.000
Serenna Beers: You um I hang on a second. I don't know if you're going to be able to see me when I do this. Can you still see my face.

104
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:20.280
Serenna Beers: Okay, what I want to do is I'm trying to find out. Do you have a therapist because I'm not sure if I'm here, assigned one and I just want to check now.

105
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.290
Jennífer castro: On Monday.

106
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.690
Jennífer castro: Appointment every step will be for next Monday. I think it is.

107
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.040
Serenna Beers: Okay, hang on.

108
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:40.140
Serenna Beers: I just want to see who your therapist is so I can make sure to your last name is what

109
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.190
Serenna Beers: I thought that's what

110
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.660
Serenna Beers: There we go. I just want to see who your therapist is

111
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.530
Serenna Beers: Oh,

112
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.430
Serenna Beers: It is Rebecca

113
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.230
Serenna Beers: She's a good

114
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.120
Serenna Beers: Therapist. She's awesome.

115
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.590
Jennífer castro: Okay.

116
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:19.740
Serenna Beers: I actually have worked with her over the years. So you're in really good good hands there. So I'll make sure that I pass on a note to her that I met with with you and

117
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:38.040
Serenna Beers: Just kind of just what you're going, just so that you don't have to repeat yourself. You know, I don't know about a about you, but boy. A boy I I used to very much dislike having to say the same thing to five different folks. It just gets tiresome right very

118
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:54.210
Serenna Beers: True. Yeah, so I will do you the pleasure of kind of just giving her. Just a little, a little bit of a heads up of of kind of what she's in for as far as like the types of things that you're going through and just where you're at.

119
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.740
Serenna Beers: Now,

120
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.210
Serenna Beers: Do you struggle with.

121
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.470
Serenna Beers: So mental health you setting society. What else

122
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.530
Jennífer castro: I'm starving writing all the time.

123
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:18.420
Serenna Beers: About how long do you think that you've been or when did you start to like, notice that you just had no motivation.

124
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:19.770
Serenna Beers: Right.

125
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.660
Serenna Beers: Okay.

126
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.830
Jennífer castro: I mean, I guess I'm not an

127
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.290
Jennífer castro: Action about it.

128
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.100
Yeah.

129
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:43.320
Serenna Beers: You ever have times through throughout the day where you experience, even if it's a little bit of joy. Like, for example, for a example, what makes you happy.

130
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.560
Serenna Beers: Is there anything that makes you smile.

131
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.000
Jennífer castro: Like it anymore.

132
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.710
Jennífer castro: Very often anymore. Yeah.

133
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.050
Serenna Beers: What used to make you smile.

134
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.530
Jennífer castro: I don't know. I guess my kids, maybe

135
00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.430
Okay, I don't

136
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.130
Serenna Beers: Know,

137
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.520
Jennífer castro: It just makes me angry.

138
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.190
Serenna Beers: Have you ever dealt with that at all. Have you ever worked

139
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.120
Serenna Beers: At that

140
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.030
Jennífer castro: Won't work with me.

141
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.830
Jennífer castro: To get over it.

142
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.930
Jennífer castro: You know she moved on with her life. I said to her, whatever, but

143
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.600
Jennífer castro: Whatever.

144
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.380
Serenna Beers: You, you still have to go through whatever process that you need to, with or without her.

145
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:50.490
Serenna Beers: willingness to participate in strengthening that relationship because it's really not about her at this point it's really about getting you to a place where you feel healthy with or without her willingness to participate. Does that make sense. Yeah.

146
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.590
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

147
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:04.710
Serenna Beers: Do you ever do anything like do you leave the house much will obviously not now, but let's say take away our Korean team.

148
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:16.020
Serenna Beers: And is there any places that you would go, do you ever go, do you ever go on walks or do anything like like that just kind of get out of the house and stuff.

149
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.850
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

150
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.510
Serenna Beers: What do you do

151
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.730
Jennífer castro: Just go for a walk. I don't know.

152
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.430
Jennífer castro: I went bowling. A couple weeks ago.

153
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.900
Serenna Beers: Oh,

154
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.540
Serenna Beers: Are you doing are you any good at it.

155
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.440
Jennífer castro: Not really, but I made a attitude. My

156
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.940
Jennífer castro: Whatever kind of

157
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.000
Jennífer castro: Nobody really had fun.

158
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.140
No.

159
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:59.760

Jennífer castro: Okay, thank you.

216
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.050
Jennífer castro: Okay, sorry about that.

217
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.540
Serenna Beers: Oh, that's okay I sounded like a drill

218
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.180
Jennífer castro: Oh yes, leading in the rain.

219
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.900

Jennífer castro: Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.

222
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.670
Jennífer castro: I think

223
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.650
Jennífer castro: Okay, yeah. You hear that,

224
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.230
Serenna Beers: Yeah, but, but, I mean, it's not bothering me if it's, if it's not bothering you.

225
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:15.990
Serenna Beers: I have these nice little headphones that aren't very comfortable, but it's noise cancelling so I don't hear anything around me.

226
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.190
Jennífer castro: And then

227
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.380
Jennífer castro: I can find make dinner. I did put them every night. Okay.

228
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.580
Jennífer castro: And then we sit there and bullshit.

229
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.130
Serenna Beers: And then you go to bed. Do you, do you have difficulties.

230
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.250
Serenna Beers: Turning your mind off.

231
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.750
Jennífer castro: Yes, yes.

232
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.840
Jennífer castro: I'm filming in my mind all the time.

233
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:46.770
Okay.

234
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.570
Jennífer castro: And I beat myself up a lot, and I don't think it's for the wrong reason or whatever.

235
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:12.420
Serenna Beers: What's the biggest thing that you say to yourself, like, you know, whether it's, I mean, there's all kinds of different messages mine. I used to constantly say, I'm so dumb. And when you say those self messages all the time. It actually starts to kind of affect you. Right.

236
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.910
Serenna Beers: So what are the type, type of

237
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.000
Serenna Beers: Messages. When you say that you'd beat yourself up a lot.

238
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.160
Jennífer castro: Like

239
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.290
Jennífer castro: Like nobody needs me again, what am I here for

240
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:46.710
Serenna Beers: What about, I don't know if you've ever tried this, but one of us suggestions that I actually do myself. I don't have to do it every night, but I did have to a couple of weeks ago when this whole thing.

241
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:58.260
Serenna Beers: Started and I was one of those ones that watch the news, probably more than I should. And I could not quiet my mind for anything. I was worried about my, my kid. I have a

242
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.630
Serenna Beers: 10 year old kid. I thought how am I going to get our food if everybody's buying it. I mean, on and on and on. Right.

243
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:13.470
Serenna Beers: I will put on at nighttime. And it's an eight hour or 10 hour but they're ocean waves and and and there's more than just that now.

244
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.940
Jennífer castro: That, well, not at all.

245
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.330
Jennífer castro: I don't like that. Well, not at all.

246
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.650
Well,

247
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.700
Serenna Beers: I didn't either. And so I started to just

248
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:35.910
Serenna Beers: Put on these meditative sounds. My favorite one is ocean waves. But another one was like, it's called camping camping camping ground and you hear like the sound of the creek. It almost sounds like running

249
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.800
Serenna Beers: Water you hear

250
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:47.070
Serenna Beers: Crickets. And when you're in a dark room and you just hear the sound you can kind of just close your eyes and just kind of imagine yourself there.

251
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.260
Serenna Beers: And and that really does help, help me. I don't know if you would be willing to

252
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.100
Serenna Beers: Try it, try

253
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:54.540
Serenna Beers: That

254
00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.820
Serenna Beers: Okay, yeah.

255
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.330
Jennífer castro: I tried it noisy.

256
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:04.890
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

257
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.740
Jennífer castro: I don't know. I

258
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.430
Jennífer castro: Don't have my imagination, you might

259
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.300
Jennífer castro: Have a person so

260
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.410
Jennífer castro: What it could be or what might be one.

261
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.140
Serenna Beers: Well, that's not necessarily necessarily a bad thing, but as long as you're

262
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.700
Serenna Beers: Always try to keep an open mind to different things that might

263
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.140
Serenna Beers: Potentially work or be of help. If you've never ever tried them.

264
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:53.310
Serenna Beers: If that's not anything that you think would work. You know, I mean, how do you get yourself to fall asleep when you're

265
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.740
Serenna Beers: Struggling

266
00:20:59.010 --> 00:20:59.460
Serenna Beers: Okay.

267
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.930
Jennífer castro: Like I said, my mom gets the Herald.

268
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.800
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

269
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.630
Jennífer castro: Last night, three hours sleep.

270
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.980
Yeah.

271
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.430
Jennífer castro: I walk around when I

272
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:13.710
Jennífer castro: Walk around like

273
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.360
Serenna Beers: Okay.

274
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:30.750
Serenna Beers: So what is your, what is your overall goal. I mean, as far as what do you, what do you hope to work on while while you're here with us. And the reason that I ask is because

275
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:47.850
Serenna Beers: These are the types of things that I'm going to share with Rebecca so that she has an idea and can start kind of looking at different things to share with with you in regards to what you voice about what you want to work on.

276
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.240
Jennífer castro: Myself for that I want more fun. Okay, and

277
00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:03.450
Jennífer castro: Like my anxiety like question I'm going to press forever. Smells like 13 years old.

278
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:10.710
Jennífer castro: Up and down, I haven't had I haven't been manic in a long time. But my mom is coming

279
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.450
Jennífer castro: Now she killed

280
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:20.430
Jennífer castro: That's my real mom. So that's the type of mom, she is wait for the bombshell it's really quite, not quite.

281
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.780
Sure.

282
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:32.760
Serenna Beers: That's got a really tough because, you know, who's to say that that has to come, you know, and if you're in it. Those are the kinds of messages that you're being told.

283
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:41.190
Serenna Beers: How is it it's makes it kind of difficult to think any other way. Oh, well, gosh, then I guess I should wait for the magic part to to come and notes.

284
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:51.690
Serenna Beers: It works the same way with ourselves, not only what others messages that they feed us, but the message that we give ourselves if you wake up and say,

285
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:59.160
Serenna Beers: I don't want to get up. I'm not motivated, this sucks, then you're not going to want to get up, you're not going to be

286
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:08.490
Serenna Beers: Motivated and it is going to suck. Now, I'm not saying, saying, oh, if you do these three specific things one on your fix. That's not what I'm

287
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:22.710
Serenna Beers: Saying I mean, as you know, it is really is a process and it really does take work from you as well as with the help of your, you know, team, which is your therapist, your doctor that you work with, but

288
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:41.730
Serenna Beers: You know it has to start with, or it has started. I should say with your willingness to be here right right now. So I just I want to validate the fact that i mean you obviously have a will to want to do better, or you wouldn't be here with me right now. Right.

289
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.470
Jennífer castro: Yes.

290
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:52.620
Serenna Beers: So that is something to send yourself a message of, well, I obviously I'm worth saving. Because I'm here trying to save myself right

291
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.320
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

292
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.660
Serenna Beers: So that's positive thing for today.

293
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.820
Serenna Beers: I can hear that.

294
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.230
Serenna Beers: Oh, that's okay. It just sounds like

295
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.900
Serenna Beers: Someone's really gonna gonna have your yard looking looking awesome

296
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.970
Jennífer castro: It's important for me to give my counsel. He does weedy

297
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:31.020
Serenna Beers: Okay. Hmm. Is that who is that that is out there right right now.

298
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.200
Jennífer castro: My friend, okay.

299
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.450
Jennífer castro: But she's here to do it. So we done

Serenna Beers: Well, she must have went to the other side now because I'm not able to even here.

302
00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.870
Jennífer castro: Like she, I mean what irritated right now. Yeah.

303
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.650
Serenna Beers: What are you most mostly

Serenna Beers: Up upset about.

305
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.190
Jennífer castro: Well, because I asked her to go to the other side of that.

306
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.170
Jennífer castro: Trailer, I mean,

307
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.340
Jennífer castro: There's yard all the way and other side. She's still right here.

308
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.490
Jennífer castro: Like it's not important.

309
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:36.120
Serenna Beers: What if you were to step outside step away from your phone and put your head outside and say, hey, I can still hear you. So can you move to the other side, because I can't hear well

310
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.060
Serenna Beers: Maybe she thinks that she's gone.

311
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.200
Serenna Beers: Far enough. No.

312
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.790
Jennífer castro: No, I know I can hear her. Then she hasn't gone far now.

313
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:45.870
Right.

314
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.120
Serenna Beers: Do you feel like she does this a lot.

315
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.750
Jennífer castro: No, I feel like she did it right now.

316
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:12.000
Serenna Beers: So, on a scale of 00 to 10 with obviously 10 being the most high zero being not at all a how, how much is it are you

317
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.040
Feeling right right now.

318
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.500
Jennífer castro: Should I cut my meeting.

319
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.580
Jennífer castro: Know what

320
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.910
Serenna Beers: Did you want to schedule it for a different time.

321
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.550
Serenna Beers: Hmm.

322
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.670
Jennífer castro: Maybe like 20 or 30 minutes

323
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.450
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

324
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.380
Serenna Beers: I'm not sure where we're at our. Are we at that point.

325
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.390
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay.

326
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.770
Jennífer castro: Well, I

327
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:34.410
Serenna Beers: I definitely don't want to leave this meeting with you being upset, more than you started, but of course these are things that are outside of my control.

328
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:43.080
Serenna Beers: So I just want you to know that we remember that folks can't read our mind. So maybe she genuinely

329
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.370
Jennífer castro: Wiser

330
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.090
Uh huh.

Serenna Beers: Let them know and they will get a hold of me. Okay.

334
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.400
Jennífer castro: All right.

335
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.950
Serenna Beers: Sorry about this. Okay, thanks.
