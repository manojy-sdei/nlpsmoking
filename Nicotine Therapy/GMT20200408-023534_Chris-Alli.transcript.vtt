172
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.590

173
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.400
Ryan Robertson: Okay.

174
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.400
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so what we need to do is get you a prescription

175
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:50.700
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so a prescription to kind of get started on things right now, if you remember, if you take Suboxone too early.

176
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.110
it'll kick into rolling

177
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:53.790
Ryan Robertson: Yeah.

178
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.750
Chris Alliman MD: How long does it take you to get into like moderate

179
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.410
Withdrawals

180
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.260
Ryan Robertson: Let's see, I fix it all. Yesterday I fixed it.

181
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.310
Chris Alliman MD: Um, I'm losing it here, Ryan.

182
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.380
Chris Alliman MD: I can't hear you anymore.

183
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.270
Ryan Robertson: Actually I fixed. Okay.

184
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.790
Chris Alliman MD: I can't hear you. Anymore, Ryan.

185
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.110
Ryan Robertson: Can you hear me.

186
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.300
Chris Alliman MD: Now I can. I miss pretty much everything that you said, Can you go back to the house where the connection was

187
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.970
Ryan Robertson: Better. Well, yeah, I got my Xfinity account on

188
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:05.760
Ryan Robertson: On so like I say 24 hours because I didn't fix. I think Sunday morning. I didn't fix this morning till like 11 o'clock.

189
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.140
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so generally takes about 24 hours to get into moderate withdrawals.

190
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.040
Ryan Robertson: Oh, no, no, no, moderate, I'm gonna say 1212 to 14

191
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:31.500
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, we don't. So generally, the understanding is, it takes about 72 hours on average for people, some people, it's certainly sooner than that some people it's longer, right. But remember, if you take it too early. It's going to kick into really bad withdrawals.

192
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.270
Chris Alliman MD: So we're talking stomach. Stomach cramping. We're talking sweaty.

193
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.710
Ryan Robertson: People

194
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.990
Chris Alliman MD: But not not horribly bad right

195
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.850
Ryan Robertson: My thing sweating and like I like to take showers do that out.

196
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.980
Ryan Robertson: Yeah I shower.

197
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:54.990
Chris Alliman MD: Absolutely. So we want you to hold off on using the Suboxone until you're in moderate withdrawals not early withdrawals.

198
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.750
Ryan Robertson: Okay, what do you think 12 to 15 hours.

199
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.120
Chris Alliman MD: I would put it more towards the

200
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:08.700
Chris Alliman MD: You know, it's different for each person. I can't tell you specifically for you. What I can tell you is on general in the average
