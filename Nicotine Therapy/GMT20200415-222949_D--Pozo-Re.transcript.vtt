7
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.840

8
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.620
Erika Romero: But otherwise I'm doing good. Daniel can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.090
Create

10
00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:07.020
Dominique Pozo: Well, what would you like to work on. We've got our individual time. Now we got through all the assessments and intakes and everything. So what would be some some main focuses that you'd like to work on.

11
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
Erika Romero: Oh, you know, I kind of wanted to talk to you about yesterday's session.

12
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
Erika Romero: Because I really got to thinking a lot about, um, I believe was

13
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.740
Erika Romero: What was her Phyllis, I believe I was talking to fill us right before we all disconnected. Well, that's, that's what I was talking to you right. Do you remember

14
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.050
Dominique Pozo: WELL, PHYLLIS lost. She, she's the one who kind of started, I think you were talking to Leticia what

15
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.410
Erika Romero: Leticia. Okay. Yeah. So yeah.

16
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.630
Erika Romero: I'll get everybody's names.

17
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.730
Erika Romero: Yeah, but

18
00:01:45.810 --> 00:02:04.950
Erika Romero: I so I kind of wanted to talk to you about that because I really was thinking a lot about that overnight and let me see if I can just split screen. Hold on. There we go. I was tucked away off in the corner. So I wouldn't be able to see him know that I was that you could see me.

19
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.330
Dominique Pozo: But anyway, um,

20
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.920
Erika Romero: So,

21
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.380
Erika Romero: I got to thinking about her a lot. Let us know because her situation is a lot like and not in some a lot like mine in some ways.

22
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.020
Erika Romero: As far as

23
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:36.840
Erika Romero: You know Lawson and and giving of yourself, you know, to the point where you know you you give so much of yourself and

24
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.470
Erika Romero: And you still end up losing what you you know what you fought so hard for.

25
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:56.670
Erika Romero: And it really is. And so I sat, but I sat last night and I was thinking a lot about it because you know I told you I have a daughter.

26
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.620
Erika Romero: Daughter, I have custody of her of her one of her daughters. So I have three other granddaughters

27
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.260
Dominique Pozo: She has four children.

28
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.580
Erika Romero: She has or

29
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.510
Wow.

30
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.540
Erika Romero: The first two were taken by this date. So my daughter and I have a very tumultuous relationship.

31
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.160
Erika Romero: We I'm

32
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:32.550
Erika Romero: When my daughters getting high because she's a an addict badly when she's getting high. She doesn't think straight and logic doesn't come out of my daughter's bring

33
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.120
Yeah.

34
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:52.020
Erika Romero: So I've my two oldest granddaughters I ended up losing because of her and, you know, I've tried so hard. Over the years, and she's 25 now. And over the years, I've tried really hard to

35
00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.440
Erika Romero: To be there for her and and to take care of her. And, um, and to help her get sober.

36
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.020
Erika Romero: And my husband and I actually had her second daughter, which she ended up

37
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.070
Erika Romero: Having the state takeaway from us.

38
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.690
Erika Romero: Um,

39
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.480
Erika Romero: Yeah, it was very. It was a very devastating thing she was only three months old, and I haven't seen her since.

40
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.000
Dominique Pozo: And how long ago I saw

41
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.750
I saw her.

42
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.710
Erika Romero: I'm let me let me backtrack. I did see her, but through the state. I was only allowed to see her.

43
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.220
Erika Romero: Once a month. And so I

44
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.520
Erika Romero: For the and i think

45
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.670
Erika Romero: Until she was about nine or 10 months old, and then they adopted her out. And so once the adoption was final

46
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.720
Erika Romero: I was no longer allowed to see her and

47
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.460
Erika Romero: My daughter had her taken away from us, because she started getting high again. And so she started causing a lot of problems for me.

48
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.740
Erika Romero: And the same thing with my oldest granddaughter my haven't seen her since she was a baby and

49
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.610
Erika Romero: She daughter, cut, cut me out of her life of my granddaughter's life.

50
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.260
Erika Romero: Whenever it didn't suit her you know she

51
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.300
Erika Romero: He uses her kids against me and and that's why we have this that we actually have custody of her

52
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.140
Dominique Pozo: Because

53
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:39.930
Erika Romero: We weren't willing to go through that again, you know, it was very emotionally devastating for my husband and I to go through that with let's alanna

54
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.890
Um,

55
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.360
Erika Romero: So, you know, I got to really thinking about it and it really

56
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.050
Erika Romero: It really touched me a lot.

57
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.580
Erika Romero: Take her

58
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.940
Erika Romero: Think that she could give

59
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.380
Erika Romero: And give and give and that it would have made a difference in her son and her father's life because

60
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.340
Dominique Pozo: You know,

61
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.560
Erika Romero: We've given and given and given so much. I mean, even a financial Thanksgiving. I haven't spoken to her since Thanksgiving, and I don't plan on it.

62
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.990
Erika Romero: Because she's, she's devastating to me.

63
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:33.210
Erika Romero: Is that devastating TO ME, SHE SHE SHOULD DO WHATEVER SHE CAN TO TO DESTROY, DESTROY me to destroy my life and to take away what's what's important, what's valuable to me and which is my family and I have very little of it.

64
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.360
Erika Romero: And so we got to really thinking about her last night and

65
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.090
Erika Romero: It brought up a lot of that for me.

66
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.630
Erika Romero: I realized that

67
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.530
Erika Romero: You know there's there. There isn't much that you can do.

68
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:59.520
Erika Romero: For an addict, unless they want to do for themselves and they've learned because like I said yesterday, you know, we've taken in a lot of addicts and we've gotten them.

69
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.520
Erika Romero: Some of them we've we've helped get sober and some of them we have it, you know, some of them. We haven't been successful with

70
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:16.410
Erika Romero: But that's a choice that they've that they've made. You know, we provide in every opportunity for them evenness going as far as supporting every aspect of their lives, you know,

71
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.880
Erika Romero: All we ask is for them to work on their sobriety, you know, and

72
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.330
Erika Romero: And so it was it brought up a lot for me last night.

73
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:38.250
Dominique Pozo: A lot though. So I'm I just want to get clear I I definitely am understanding that it resurrected a lot in your own personal story and then

74
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:49.470
Dominique Pozo: Regarding Leticia what what got brought up related to her because I'm hearing that it really start a lot up for you around your story. But I'm wondering when you say you know you

75
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.560
Erika Romero: Know I just fell for her because she just

76
00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:03.060
Erika Romero: She was just so broken about that and and it took me a long time to stop being broken to, you know, to, to accept the fact that

77
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.610
Erika Romero: That there wasn't anything I could do to change that anymore. You know what I mean that I had put in everything that I could for for my daughter.

78
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.550
Erika Romero: And it just affected me to see her.

79
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.130
Erika Romero: Feel like she could just

80
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.750
Erika Romero: knew she could have given everything of herself, including her own

81
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.280
Erika Romero: Her own life. You know what I mean, for her brother, you know, that maybe she would have maybe she wouldn't have but

82
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:43.260
Erika Romero: In her mind. She, you know, that's how far she feels like she could have gone and you know I've done the same thing. You know, I put myself out on the line. So many times for my daughter.

83
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.630
Erika Romero: So many times

84
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.390
Erika Romero: Yeah, my emotions and my

85
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:58.050
Erika Romero: Friends are you know even wait for my sanity. I put it on the line for email and but she had another another daughter.

86
00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.520
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

87
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.200
Erika Romero: Last year, and so

88
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.230
Erika Romero: She we brought her up here again brought her to her house again.

89
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.240
Erika Romero: And

90
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:24.090
Erika Romero: She was in a in a rehab program and she just she didn't want to be there anymore because they weren't able to to work with her after she had the baby.

91
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.980
Erika Romero: And the capacity that she needed them to you because

92
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:45.000
Erika Romero: They did it. They do accept women who are pregnant there and that have babies, but they don't really have a program set up to accommodate a mother and their newborn baby you know they

93
00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:00.450
Erika Romero: expect him to work and do the same follow the same program after even after they've had a brand new baby. Oh, my daughter was breastfeeding and having they wanted her to breastfeed in group and all that other stuff that were there was men there.

94
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:13.530
Erika Romero: And she didn't feel comfortable so you know just just she was very unhappy there. And so we brought her backup. When the baby was a newborn and it really took me a while to get connected with that baby because she had

95
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:26.100
Erika Romero: Done so much, you know, and I already knew that she was going to do it again. You know, and so it took me a while to become attached to that baby to

96
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.700
Erika Romero: Which was hard for me because I didn't

97
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:44.520
Erika Romero: Want to be like that, you know, because it's my granddaughter, but the one, behold, she did it to me again. And, you know, no I'm not allowed to see my granddaughter again and she's trying to take this one away from me, you know,

98
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:54.720
Erika Romero: She, she called see why a fee on top. Protective Services on me. Um, she caused a big old thing for Thanksgiving.

99
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:10.860
Erika Romero: And caused a big uproar here at my house and I'm mainly it was because I couldn't take her to Walmart and that's what it stirred all that up but it again. I think she was getting high. So

100
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.560
Erika Romero: You know, rational side of her

101
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:32.130
Erika Romero: And the only way that she knows to get even with me is through the kids you know and and so, you know, here I am again without another granddaughter. And so I kind of just felt so it felt so heavy in my heart for for Leticia

102
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.100
Erika Romero: Because I know what I've gone through what I what I

103
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.230
Erika Romero: What I've given and what I've lost in

104
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.340
Erika Romero: For any addict and somebody that you love somebody that you know the only

105
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.670
Erika Romero: That's the other another ru you know

106
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.810
Erika Romero: It just, it just brought up a lot for me yesterday.

107
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:12.060
Dominique Pozo: Huh, yeah, I really see that and I see the heartbreak that it brought up of, you know, opening and reopening and allowing yourself to get attached and then have kind of, you know, the line cut

108
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.890
Erika Romero: Yeah.

109
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.410
Erika Romero: So I don't know, I just I just felt so bad for her. It really just my heart just really went to her.

110
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:40.740
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm gonna reflect because I actually was thinking about you all after group, especially the interaction between YouTube and I'm curious what how do you think she responded to what you were sharing and your questions to her, how, how do you think that landed for her.

111
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:42.690
I think

112
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:54.300
Erika Romero: I can't, I don't know how she took it i don't i don't know how she felt about it. I don't know her well enough. I just to make an assumption.

113
00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:10.020
Erika Romero: I'm. All I know is that, um, what I really wanted to get across to her was that you can only give so much, you know, to people before it's in the balls in their court you know you you can't

114
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.810
Erika Romero: You can't expect to, you know, expire your own life to

115
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.370
Dominique Pozo: Somebody's

116
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:24.030
Erika Romero: Body, you know, even if you love them that much. You know, I understand what she said about that being her soulmate.

117
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:37.020
Erika Romero: You know, my daughter, my daughter is actually the only child that I raised I have for myself, you know, and when I was an attic. The first time I lost my two oldest boys.

118
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:46.620
Erika Romero: And my daughter's twin brother. He grew up with his aunt and uncle. So my daughter's. The only one that I that I raised and so it was

119
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.940
Erika Romero: I understood that, you know, my daughter and I have a very good relationship when she's in a good frame of mind.

120
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.620
You know,

121
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.800
Dominique Pozo: So I'm going to reflect something because what I picked up on was Leticia getting a bit defensive

122
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.540
Erika Romero: That's what I picked up on.

123
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:14.610
Dominique Pozo: And I, I totally validate everything you're saying that you experienced and like you just said you don't really know her. And so I'm and I'm not. I didn't want to do it in group because I didn't want to

124
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:27.570
Dominique Pozo: You know, shame, shame you or your expression, but I want agreement, which I'm going to go over in the group meeting next week is that we don't give other group members advice because I watched you know i i watched

125
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.180
Dominique Pozo: You were sharing very genuinely your experience and I saw Leticia get defensive

126
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:33.720
Erika Romero: Because

127
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.450
Dominique Pozo: She has her own ideas, they may they may not

128
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.160
Dominique Pozo: You may not agree with them, you know, and you may think you may want to help her and save her from going through the hardship that you have

129
00:14:44.490 --> 00:15:00.870
Dominique Pozo: But I just watched that. So the request. I'm going to make in group is that everybody just speak from their own experience unless someone asks, hey, can someone give me some feedback. I'm struggling here because I watched. I watched it happen and I thought about you too, and

130
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:10.080
Dominique Pozo: And that may be true for Leticia until her last breath that she would still give everything you know

131
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:18.420
Erika Romero: When I wasn't trying to give her advice that was by no means all I wanted to know was all I was asking her was, if

132
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:34.920
Erika Romero: If, if she's if she felt that if she, you know, no matter how much she gave would, would it have made a difference. That's all I wanted to know. I wasn't trying to give her advice. By no means. I was trying to express to her what I had gone through in my life.

133
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:44.100
Erika Romero: Yeah, you know, and what I've been through with other other people. And so, by no means was I was trying to give her advice at all and I

134
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:55.770
Erika Romero: Wasn't even expecting that it would would have come off that way. All I was trying to do is trying to ask her what you know if she thought that it would it would have made a difference, you know,

135
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.160
Erika Romero: And

136
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:07.290
Erika Romero: If she would have gone that extreme really to and and to let her know that, you know, I've been there. And for me, you know, for me personally.

137
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.030
Erika Romero: I've had to learn how to back off and that allow people to do their own thing.

138
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:25.440
Erika Romero: So, by no means was like I said, trying to give her advice I'm not in any call to give anybody advice, you know, because I have my own struggles I have my own thoughts and my own situations that I go through so

139
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:33.720
Erika Romero: Really, all I was trying to do is just ask her, because it struck me it just when she said that it just

140
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.200
Erika Romero: It just struck me really hard year

141
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.150
Dominique Pozo: I know I

142
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:49.020
Erika Romero: I was trying to figure out how to turn out or not do it. Did she think that it and i and i will apologize to her if she you know

143
00:16:49.590 --> 00:17:10.230
Erika Romero: If that if I offended her I that by no means that I need to a vendor or a lead her any firm that device. Oh, and what I wanted to know was that, you know, what did she think that does she feel that if she went to that extreme is would wouldn't have made a difference.

144
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:18.030
Dominique Pozo: I think it would be really worth checking it out. I haven't talked to her. I don't know, I, the only thing I picked up on. And I

145
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:29.880
Dominique Pozo: I really believe that you didn't do this with the intention of it yet. The way that it came through it. What I perceived was that part of her maybe heard. Oh, I, I'm doing this wrong, or I did it wrong.

146
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.740
Dominique Pozo: You know, so that's

147
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.790
Dominique Pozo: That's just what I believe and it'd be I think it would be worth checking out. And this

148
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.400
Dominique Pozo: Is so I think this is great, you know, this is the power of group dynamics is

149
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:54.900
Dominique Pozo: You know, somebody share something it touches and light something up in other group members and then they respond and sometimes the tensions build and it's good because in the group setting. I know that the doctor and I are going to do our best to keep it.

150
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:04.470
Dominique Pozo: Contained having a rupture in a group or tension and then being able to talk through it. It is the most healing, so I

151
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:15.360
Dominique Pozo: I really encourage you to check it out. We, we don't know. I don't know how Leticia had the rest. You know how the rest of her night when what she thought about, but I am hearing that it really impacted you

152
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.760
Erika Romero: Yeah it and it did. Yeah.

153
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.940
Erika Romero: I just thought for her. I just

154
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:21.990
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

155
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:31.860
Erika Romero: I really did. I just thought for I'm like I said I wasn't by no means trying to give her advice. I just wanted to know if she really felt within her art.

156
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.980
Erika Romero: Yeah, you know that if she had

157
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.800
Erika Romero: In there and I given everything

158
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.750
Erika Romero: I have. I've got it you know almost that extreme and

159
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.520
Erika Romero: I almost lost myself with a loss when they came in, he asked my granddaughter out

160
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.970
Erika Romero: I could could manage anymore because she had taken

161
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.720
Erika Romero: It felt like very hard out of my chest, you know,

162
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:16.050
Erika Romero: I just wanted to know somebody else's perspective, it's, it, it, honestly, I would have hated it, because I don't, I don't know what to give anymore. I don't know.

163
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:26.310
Erika Romero: You know, I don't know what to do anymore. I know that I'm at that point, my life where I just wrote my hands that I can't do it anymore for my own

164
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.010
Erika Romero: For my my own stability. I couldn't do it anymore, you know,

165
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.470
Dominique Pozo: See this kind of sharing. I think this

166
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:44.400
Dominique Pozo: Would would keep a dialogue going because I'm really hearing your struggle. I'm hearing that you want to have hope you're at a loss of how how

167
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:55.290
Dominique Pozo: How to love someone that is addicted. That's what I hear that that you know you're at a loss of how to do that and not not have your own heartbreak in the process.

168
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.460
Erika Romero: I just my heart broke for her.

169
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:06.450
Erika Romero: Yeah, I just, you know, I felt so bad for her because I heard that I heard that same her

170
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.090
Dominique Pozo: In

171
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.550
Erika Romero: Her in her voice. And when she said that

172
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.550
Erika Romero: I felt it. I felt

173
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.000
Erika Romero: What she was feeling I felt what she's been through.

174
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.510
Erika Romero: Because even though my daughter's not dead.

175
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:30.060
Erika Romero: She's still here on this earth it's pushed me to the extreme, where I can't see it in

176
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.990
Erika Romero: You know she she has to be, you know,

177
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.310
Erika Romero: That

178
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.110
Erika Romero: That separation between her and I that that kills me.

179
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.020
Erika Romero: She is my daughter.

180
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.150
Erika Romero: But I just

181
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.590
Erika Romero: I don't know, I just thought for her so bad.

182
00:20:51.150 --> 00:21:10.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I'm really witnessing how much grief. It stirred it has stirred up for you around the losses from your granddaughters to the connection with your daughter and the capacity to just give and to keep it. I mean that's that's a huge loss to, you know, to have to hold back.

183
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.900
Dominique Pozo: You know of a person's genuine desire to be generous.

184
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:34.800
Erika Romero: I'm her mother and I just, I've just always thought that that was my responsibility to take care of her, you know, try to make her the best person that she can be and just let me down over and over. And it's not that she's led me down. She's

185
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.950
Erika Romero: She's hurt me so much.

186
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.480
Erika Romero: You know, at all and

187
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.660
Erika Romero: Would you just. Will you excuse me for just a second. I'm just gonna grab some tissue. Oh.

188
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.040
Dominique Pozo: Sure, sure.

189
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.350
Erika Romero: I'm sorry about that.

190
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.190
Erika Romero: So yeah, I just, I will

191
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:21.240
Erika Romero: I'll apologize didn't by no means mean to, I don't have any place to give anybody advice about anything. I'm just here just to

192
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:29.340
Erika Romero: Learn just like everybody else. You know, I just wanted her perspective on it. Will you know and to let her know or I had been

193
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:45.090
Erika Romero: Where I've been in and what I've done in, you know, and how much I've given in it hasn't just been to my daughter I raised my niece also and Rishi to as an addict, you know, and she she puts me through all kinds of crap to and

194
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.650
Erika Romero: You know,

195
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:55.260
Erika Romero: Like I said, I just wanted somebody else's perspective from, you know, because you kind of feel

196
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:07.770
Erika Romero: When, when that kind of because my husband's gone through with me, but I think because he's a man you know he handles it differently. And maybe it's because there might blood that I

197
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.220
Erika Romero: Feel you know that extra connection to

198
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.360
Erika Romero: I don't know, but I know that I feel

199
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.050
Erika Romero: Very much more deeply about it that he does, you know,

200
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:32.640
Erika Romero: I know that it did hurt him. When my granddaughter was taken from us. So, um, but, I mean, as far as struggling with all the other stuff. But you know, that's something that I enjoy

201
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.480
Erika Romero: Very much in my life that I that I've gone through

202
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.100
Erika Romero: That

203
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:47.610
Erika Romero: affects me like this because I've learned how to get through a lot of stuff, but

204
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:59.760
Erika Romero: With my daughter, it's more recent. And so these are kind of things that I really haven't had an opportunity to kind of tackle yet. You know what I mean.

205
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:01.620
Erika Romero: And

206
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.200
Erika Romero: I've learned certain things. But I mean, as a mom as a woman as a human being.

207
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:23.580
Erika Romero: I feel feel differently about it. You know what I mean with this this situation. And so I kind of just like I said, I just wanted to know, because I understand what she said that her father was herself, because my daughter is the love of my life, you know, she's

208
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.480
Erika Romero: She is she's my daughter and

209
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.850
Erika Romero: And so I understood that when she said that. Yeah.

210
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.650
Erika Romero: And so I kind of just wanted somebody else's

211
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.160
Erika Romero: You know,

212
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:49.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean, I'm really, I'm really hearing the desire for that, that you have for connection around to this and this topic and

213
00:24:49.980 --> 00:25:01.950
Dominique Pozo: Just, you know, exploring it with someone, I don't even know if an apology is necessary. I think just checking it out and seeing, you know, how was that for you. You know, I imagine that if you started

214
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.580
Dominique Pozo: Sharing

215
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:11.640
Dominique Pozo: You know, you could share that a lot came up for you and and this is a very important topic to bring into group to, you know, because I think

216
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:27.870
Dominique Pozo: What it's touching on is the tendency to care. Take the codependent dynamics between family members. And this is something that, you know, most everyone who has either dealt with addiction or has someone who's addicted in their life deals with

217
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.740
Erika Romero: Yeah, yeah. I suppose you're right.

218
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:32.730
Yeah.

219
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:48.810
Dominique Pozo: It's very real and I was, I was very touched by the group, you know, it went. It went really deep really quick with a lot of new group members, you know, that didn't know each other, but we're willing to share pretty deeply. Yeah.

220
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:49.860
Yeah.

221
00:25:52.890 --> 00:26:03.090
Dominique Pozo: Well, what it sounds like so much got started, how have you been doing any sort of self care ways to be gentle with yourself.

222
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.010
Erika Romero: I just read

223
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:17.070
Erika Romero: Just trying to breathe. And you know what, take one day at a time and get some days it's just one minute at a time that's best I can do. You know, because

224
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.480
Erika Romero: Even though I haven't spoken to her since.

225
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.640
Erika Romero: Since November.

226
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:34.080
Erika Romero: You know, it's still, it still affects me it does hurt me, you know, and then you know she she has it not once

227
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.840
Erika Romero: I'm asked to see her daughter.

228
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.460
Erika Romero: You know, and

229
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:44.640
Erika Romero: I don't know, even if right now if for me, I would even allow that.

230
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.030
Erika Romero: Because she stirs up so much

231
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.100
Erika Romero: But, you know, just

232
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.490
Erika Romero: Just to put forth that effort, you know,

233
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.260
Erika Romero: And

234
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.840
Erika Romero: You know my granddaughter.

235
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.170
Erika Romero: My husband and I are the only ones that she knows you know we've had her sensitive issues board so

236
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:10.770
Erika Romero: You know, my daughter being here, she was here for about six months as last time.

237
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.650
Erika Romero: And, um,

238
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.060
Erika Romero: You know, my, my granddaughter got to know her a little bit and

239
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.770
Erika Romero: I mean, it did it, she doesn't really understand what

240
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:33.540
Erika Romero: A mom is, you know, except for what she sees on on TV or on her videos you know I am her mom, you know, she doesn't call me mom but

241
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:42.990
Erika Romero: In every aspect of the game. I am her mom, you know, my husband is her dad. And even though she she knows us as not on grandpa's

242
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.400
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

243
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:50.550
Erika Romero: We are in every aspect, her, her parents and so it didn't really affect her when my daughter left

244
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:58.290
Erika Romero: Oh, did I didn't factor at all. She never showed a single tier. She didn't ask for her. She did you know

245
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.350
Erika Romero: But my daughter. On the other hand,

246
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.080
Erika Romero: She has an S for her either

247
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.580
Erika Romero: My daughter has enough for her for my granddaughter. She hasn't

248
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:18.360
Erika Romero: She hasn't made put forth any effort to be a part of her life, or even allow my husband and I to be a part of the baby's life you know

249
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.260
Dominique Pozo: Well, there was absolutely no

250
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:33.150
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds to me that there was absolutely no bonding. I mean, if the if the baby was taken away right after birth. There was no chance for them to bond at all.

251
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.220
Erika Romero: Mm hmm.

252
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:36.720
Erika Romero: When

253
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:56.490
Erika Romero: My daughters never put forth any effort to bond with her, even when she was here, staying with us. She, she didn't bond with the baby very much at all, or my grant my granddaughter. So, you know, there's, there isn't a love lost between the two of them, but

254
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.320
Erika Romero: You know, with my daughter. You would think that

255
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:08.460
Erika Romero: Having her and her daughter a part of her life for that six months if she was here that

256
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:20.700
Erika Romero: That would have touched something in her and maybe my daughter just doesn't have that in in her heart. You know what I mean, I don't know. I don't know where the short circuit is in her but

257
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:29.430
Erika Romero: You know having that opportunity. We allowed her to have that opportunity to be a part of her daughter's life.

258
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.790
Erika Romero: That it was kind of like

259
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:47.400
Erika Romero: Gone with the Wind, you know, and soon as she left, so did every, every effort to be a part of a Leah's life went out the door with her, you know,

260
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.210
Erika Romero: So,

261
00:29:48.990 --> 00:30:04.680
Erika Romero: I feel like the only the only reason why she had anything to do with her daughter at all. It's only because we we put that in place. You know what I mean, she hasn't done anything since she's left here to

262
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:13.650
Erika Romero: To see her daughter to talk to her daughter to nothing, not check up on her daughter. Nothing, nothing at all, at all.

263
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:23.190
Erika Romero: So, you know, for me, I just, I just think that there's some sort of a short in my daughter. You know where she

264
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:32.520
Erika Romero: There's no connection to her emotional side. I don't know. Maybe it's the drugs, you know that that put

265
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.890
Dominique Pozo: Her for sure. Yeah.

266
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:44.670
Erika Romero: You know, and for her. It's easier to just use drugs than can then to deal with any sort of emotions, but I know when I lost my two oldest son.

267
00:30:45.480 --> 00:31:05.250
Erika Romero: That was the most devastating thing that I couldn't have ever gone through because they were my life. I didn't know how to eat without them. So when I lost them my immediate thought was, I need to figure out what I gotta do to get them back, you know,

268
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.420
Erika Romero: My daughter just

269
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.790
Erika Romero: Think that same way. You know, she had the opportunity to get her oldest daughter back

270
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.010
Erika Romero: On was very close to getting her back, and then she went back on drugs.

271
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:18.900
Erika Romero: And

272
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.420
Erika Romero: And lost that

273
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:28.770
Erika Romero: They, they took away her parental rights and then a year later, she had a Lada and

274
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:42.000
Erika Romero: We were going to take her but we didn't have any custody papers in place. So she started a bunch of crap for us and then come on top. Protective Services and had her yanked from us.

275
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:51.000
Erika Romero: And they told us really there wasn't anything that we could do, because we didn't have any any any custody papers in place.

276
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:58.020
Erika Romero: And because she still had custody of the baby and she could do and say whatever she wanted

277
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.330
Erika Romero: And so we lost her

278
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:21.720
Erika Romero: But there's, you know, there is, there's some sort of a block for my daughter that doesn't allow her to connect to connect people's feelings. You know what I mean, or to think about how did she she hurts people, you know, and what she takes away from them.

279
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:35.370
Dominique Pozo: I'm curious how how young and I don't want to make this session about your daughter, because it's really more about you, although just to help understand what may be going on for her how young she when she started to use substances.

280
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.610
Erika Romero: She was

281
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.190
Erika Romero: Maybe about

282
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.070
Dominique Pozo: Because she kept running away from a little bit

283
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.310
Erika Romero: And so you know that she got involved with, you know, the wrong type people and

284
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.080
Erika Romero: So, yeah.

285
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.310
Dominique Pozo: Well,

286
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.750
Erika Romero: The one thing that

287
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:16.710
Dominique Pozo: 15 or 16 what's coming to my mind is that when anyone starts to use substances heavily and they become addicted at a certain age, and it goes on through their 20s, 30s.

288
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:27.270
Dominique Pozo: Their emotional intelligence, it stops at that age. So, you know, this capacity to have empathy and start, you know, being able to who

289
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:39.480
Dominique Pozo: Self, you know, teenagers are so self centered. I mean everything's about them. And so when I think about okay, when did

290
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.390
Dominique Pozo: Did she start using and why

291
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:51.690
Dominique Pozo: Does she not have this part of her brain fully developed yet. It's because those things get stunted. So it helps me to understand a little bit. Hopefully. Maybe. It helps you to understand a bit too that

292
00:33:52.410 --> 00:34:10.260
Dominique Pozo: You know her brain got stunted at 1516 years old, where the capacity for for empathy isn't fully developed yet so until she stops using drugs, if she ever does and really is on the road to recovery and starts to develop these

293
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:21.450
Dominique Pozo: Skills, she's not going to have them you know it's sad and and everyone has their own character structure and some people are more they have more of an inclination towards

294
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:33.900
Dominique Pozo: And, you know, maybe. So these are some of the things that I'm just wondering, but I don't know your daughter. I don't you know I don't know I do.

295
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.030
Erika Romero: Very well and not

296
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:43.200
Erika Romero: That does give me some sort of, you know, enlightenment as to what what my, you know,

297
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:43.920
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

298
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.120
Erika Romero: Well, I might get her to

299
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.350
Erika Romero: To be this way. You know, because it it is

300
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.420
Erika Romero: Because I'm stumped. You know, I don't understand. And so

301
00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.000
Erika Romero: You know, and that's that's what I was trying to figure out yesterday was that, you know,

302
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.640
Erika Romero: If, if you just keep giving and giving and giving it What point is

303
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:11.070
Erika Romero: Is that a, you know, where do you stop this.

304
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:20.400
Dominique Pozo: Is what I'm trying to that it doesn't serve someone at a certain point to keep giving because it's enabling them to keep up the behavior and and they don't

305
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:30.630
Dominique Pozo: Even get the opportunity to make a change, because why would they, you know, if someone keeps giving them the things that they're not doing on their own. Why would they stop.

306
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:42.600
Dominique Pozo: You know, so I think it's actually, it really does. People that are dealing with addiction, a disservice to keep showing up and helping them because it's not empowering them to do it themselves.

307
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:43.620
Erika Romero: Yeah.

308
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.220
I mean,

309
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.020
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

310
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.270
Erika Romero: That's where I

311
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.170
Erika Romero: Kind of

312
00:35:50.880 --> 00:36:04.920
Erika Romero: I finally had to realize that myself because I just, I couldn't. You know, for my own mental stability. I just couldn't keep giving anymore, you know, and I've taken, taken your in and it's been just so devastating for me.

313
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.440
Erika Romero: You know, at every turn, it's been

314
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.180
Erika Romero: really devastating for me so

315
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:28.890
Dominique Pozo: And I don't want to skip over the grief of it. You know, I don't have children. I haven't dealt with a child who's been addicted. So I can't come from a place of saying, Oh my gosh, I, I really relate to how hard this is so I just want to acknowledge to that.

316
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:36.330
Dominique Pozo: It must be them, you know, one of the deepest pains to have to just step back from one's child. Yeah.

317
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.750
Erika Romero: It hasn't been easy, but um

318
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.780
Erika Romero: I have

319
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.600
Erika Romero: I've done everything that I can know, and she's a grown up now, you know,

320
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:56.910
Erika Romero: For now, she has she has a baby. And so, you know, hopefully that that grounds her at some point, you know,

321
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.690
Erika Romero: And maybe at some point, she'll

322
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.400
Erika Romero: She'll realize what she's done

323
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.600
Dominique Pozo: It's gonna be devastating to it's not going to be easy.

324
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:15.180
Erika Romero: Yeah.

325
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:24.660
Dominique Pozo: And maybe, who knows, you know, maybe at that point if she really chooses recovery. You all may connect. Again, you know,

326
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.670
Dominique Pozo: Who knows.

327
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.560
Erika Romero: Yeah, baby.

328
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:45.090
Dominique Pozo: I think what I'm, I just want to acknowledge how much grief is in the room right now. You know, it's

329
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.100
Dominique Pozo: It's a lot

330
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:57.330
Dominique Pozo: And it's not only yours, it's hers. I mean, I can even feel into deep down when she lets herself feel how painful it must be

331
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:12.360
Dominique Pozo: And I wonder if that's just why she keeps using because to have four children have to be taken away and given for adoption and then one is, you know, she can't see or she can. But, you know, she's not saying because

332
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.850
Dominique Pozo: What's up,

333
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.000
Erika Romero: Is that she chooses not to and I

334
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.600
Won't

335
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:26.580
Erika Romero: I won't subject the baby to her addiction. I won't you know she deserves a better life. She's been

336
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.550
Erika Romero: She was subjected to my daughter's addiction, the entire time. My daughter was pregnant with her.

337
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.390
Erika Romero: And so you know that that's enough for her.

338
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:52.020
Erika Romero: That's enough. You know, at some point, I gotta put put my foot down and, you know, draw a line right you know it's for me. It's important that she doesn't. She doesn't get subjected to that they do more and

339
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.020
Erika Romero: And I will let my daughter take her for me. There's no way

340
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:11.010
Erika Romero: I made sure I made sure that was in place before she was even born. That was hurt. Hurt devastate me the same way that she did with with the second second little girl.

341
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.330
Erika Romero: Yeah, it is, it is very hard for me. I

342
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:23.430
Erika Romero: Know, I just don't know how to how to deal with it. Sometimes

343
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:25.260
Dominique Pozo: Well, I

344
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:37.380
Erika Romero: Know it no matter how how angry I get with her. It's still painful to have to hear that, you know, to know that I have to be this way because I'm not this way.

345
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.760
Dominique Pozo: Right, right.

346
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.030
Erika Romero: I've always tried to beat her and and and love her through everything.

347
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:57.030
Erika Romero: She's been through, you know, I have gotten up in the middle of the night, God rescued her from the streets and

348
00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.100
Dominique Pozo: You know,

349
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.980
Erika Romero: Where she's called me and told me that she's been beat up and

350
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.290
Erika Romero: Everything drop everything to go get her. You know, bring her home, but

351
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:15.270
Erika Romero: Generally, the only time I hear from her after she's you know she's gone out is that when she's pregnant.

352
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.100
Erika Romero: And I know that's what

353
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.710
Erika Romero: And I know that's that's the reason why she's called me, you know, is because she's pregnant.

354
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.620
Erika Romero: You know,

355
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.100
Erika Romero: I've tried so much and it's just been so hard.

356
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.590
Erika Romero: So like I said, I just wanted to know how how somebody else felt about that because

357
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.730
Dominique Pozo: I have a question for you.

358
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.860
Dominique Pozo: What would love say to you, the big love whatever that voice of big love

359
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.760
Dominique Pozo: You know, whatever. You can imagine it. What would love say to you, how do you do you know if you asked that question.

360
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:05.940
Erika Romero: I don't know.

361
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.360
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

362
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:23.100
Dominique Pozo: Do you have some crayons or markers around. I know you have a little girl. Do you have any art supplies around. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be willing to do a little art.

363
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:30.360
Dominique Pozo: Sure. So I'm I'm also a trained art therapist. In addition to, you know, doing the counseling.

364
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:49.350
Dominique Pozo: Work and I, when we make art. It comes from a different part of the brain, the part that same I don't know is the rational, logical problem solving part of the brain and art comes from a different part that you know sometimes has responses and that we can't even think up logically

365
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.420
Dominique Pozo: Right, so

366
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.820
Dominique Pozo: You could get a paper and something crayons markers watercolors, whatever you feel comfortable using

367
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.040
Erika Romero: Right now.

368
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:02.760
Yeah.

369
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.150
Erika Romero: Okay, can you give me just a minute.

370
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.180
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

371
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.350
Erika Romero: Just a second open up the box.

372
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:26.610
Great.

373
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:38.340
Dominique Pozo: So without thinking. Don't even I'm going to invite you to not even think but just

374
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:54.840
Dominique Pozo: Allow love to give you a message if you tap into whatever big love could look like. And it's giving you a message right now, what would it look like maybe some words come through anything sometimes symbols just colors.

375
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.100
Dominique Pozo: It doesn't need to make

376
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.550
Erika Romero: Sense.

377
00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:57.660
Erika Romero: What we'll look at it.

378
00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:06.120
Dominique Pozo: Together and do what we can to make sense of it. But as you're making it. Don't even worry about what you're making just let whatever wants to come through. Come through.

379
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.330
Erika Romero: Okay, I think I got a few things.

380
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.770
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's see, we are you willing to share with me and show me.

381
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.300
Erika Romero: Sure.

382
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.260
Erika Romero: Let's see, can you see it, I

383
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.720
Erika Romero: See. Okay, so I have

384
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.060
Erika Romero: A strong arm here.

385
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.960
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

386
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.560
Erika Romero: piece of candy.

387
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.030
Erika Romero: Okay, sweet.

388
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.340
Erika Romero: It would be strong.

389
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.220
Erika Romero: Huh, it would be warm like this.

390
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.320
Dominique Pozo: Free

391
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.440
Dominique Pozo: No strong sweet warm and free

392
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:26.220
Dominique Pozo: And what comes up, it looks like or it sounds like I didn't see you. But it sounds like some emotion came up when you were sharing what what was that

393
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.380
Erika Romero: I think more than anything the freedom of like

394
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.750
Erika Romero: Feel free and love your daughter be

395
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:53.040
Dominique Pozo: The sound is a little difficult. I don't know what happened there, difficult to hear you.

396
00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.990
Dominique Pozo: It's a little it's a little strange. Mmm hmm. I

397
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.030
Dominique Pozo: Don't know what happened.

398
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.030
Dominique Pozo: Can you say something

399
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.170
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that's better, that's better.

400
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:14.760
Dominique Pozo: Now, I hear you. Yep.

401
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:17.910
Dominique Pozo: What were you starting to say

402
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.360
Erika Romero: I think like the

403
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.570
Erika Romero: Freedom. You know, like

404
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:32.160
Erika Romero: Freedom and love for me it's always been hard even in my marriage today.

405
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.910
Erika Romero: I've been married three times my third marriage and

406
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.380
Erika Romero: So I'm

407
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.670
Erika Romero: Always feel like there's a restriction. Like there's

408
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.670
Erika Romero: Like there's

409
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:58.380
Erika Romero: Like there's a bondage on me that they can't break like that. I don't, I don't even know how to do find out

410
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.530
Erika Romero: Where to clean it. I just

411
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:13.800
Erika Romero: Like it's an everyday thing, it just something that you just kind of go through every day you live your life the way that you live it, you do the things that you do and

412
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:16.980
Erika Romero: But I always feel like there's

413
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:26.010
Erika Romero: Like there's something missing there and there's always been something missing. And I don't know. I don't know what it is. I don't know.

414
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:27.600
Erika Romero: How to

415
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.590
Erika Romero: How to pinpoint it like there's a

416
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.750
Erika Romero: I really don't even understand it myself. I don't know how to explain it.

417
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.700
Erika Romero: I think he does kind of get caught up in in

418
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.630
Erika Romero: Do you know what do you

419
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.080
Erika Romero: When you first have a

420
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.960
Erika Romero: Brand new love

421
00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:01.740
Erika Romero: And you everything feels free about it, you know, you're, you're just on cloud nine

422
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:07.980
Erika Romero: Um, you know that for me. I've been

423
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:21.810
Erika Romero: I don't know how how to do that. You know, I don't guess I have that euphoric feeling, but there's something that that doesn't give me that freedom to

424
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:36.600
Erika Romero: To feel like I can be me or to feel the way that I do or or the way that I should. There's like a bondage there somewhere.

425
00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:45.390
Erika Romero: I can really think that that probably stems back through my childhood and with my first husband and all that. But, um,

426
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.510
Erika Romero: There's something that it just doesn't allow me to have that freedom.

427
00:50:53.070 --> 00:51:05.010
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm wondering, two things done that for me, when you say this one is the bondage. I'm very curious. And I think it's something we can keep exploring over time. But the second thing that that I think would be useful to

428
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:10.170
Dominique Pozo: To address today is when you say I you know I don't

429
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:16.860
Dominique Pozo: What I heard was, you know, you can't just be you. What would that look like what would be new look like completely

430
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.240
Erika Romero: I don't know.

431
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:29.040
Erika Romero: I don't know because there's to me. There's always an expectation of myself to do and feel and think and be

432
00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.390
Erika Romero: The strong one. You know what I mean. And to to

433
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:41.850
Erika Romero: To just go about my day. The way that I go through go about my day, you know, and

434
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.320
Erika Romero: And so I really don't know what that would be like, you know,

435
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:51.510
Erika Romero: I guess you just, I just have gotten used to being

436
00:51:52.800 --> 00:52:00.090
Erika Romero: In the routine that I mean that's carried over from relationship to relationship, you know, it's always been the same.

437
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.720
Erika Romero: Where I just

438
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:11.070
Erika Romero: Do my duties and responsibilities and so

439
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:27.060
Dominique Pozo: I hear I'm hearing that somehow you you created a belief about the role you need to fulfill when you're in relationship and you've carried that from one relationship to the next and you continue kind of fulfilling this role and that there's more

440
00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:30.510
Erika Romero: Yeah.

441
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:34.560
Erika Romero: Yeah, yeah. So this is something I'm gonna let you know my

442
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:45.570
Erika Romero: my granddaughter's to my kids two husbands, you know that it's always a duty and I fulfill my duties to the best of my ability, you know,

443
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:47.130
But

444
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:52.800
Erika Romero: I always feel like there's something missing for me. You know what I mean, like,

445
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.990
Erika Romero: There's some days I just, I feel like I just need to scream.

446
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:04.650
Erika Romero: Or I get anxiety, a lot, you know, because

447
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:14.040
Erika Romero: There's something that I'm trying to grasp on to that I'm trying to feel that I've tried to experience that I know that it's missing.

448
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.380
Erika Romero: It is, I don't even know.

449
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.820
Erika Romero: How to address it. I don't even know what the hell it is. You know,

450
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:34.650
Dominique Pozo: Everything you're saying makes very much sense to me. I'm just going to say the, the, what I'm hearing is that there's some expression that to happen. And you're not clear of what it is yet, but you're feeling that you're feeling the call for this expression.

451
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.530
Erika Romero: It's just an expression, but it

452
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.000
Erika Romero: Gets

453
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.440
Erika Romero: There's some there's a loss there and I don't know what it is. I don't know where to find it. I don't know.

454
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.660
Erika Romero: I don't know.

455
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:57.180
Erika Romero: I just go from day to day doing what I got it. You

456
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:05.850
Erika Romero: To the best of my ability in there. But there's something that's always been missing it. I don't know what it is. I don't know where to find it. I just

457
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:12.060
Erika Romero: Accept the fact that, you know, I am who I am and I do what I do and

458
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:20.550
Erika Romero: And that's who I am, you know, but there's always been something missing girls. I just don't know what it is.

459
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.290
Dominique Pozo: Well, I imagine that if you're even having

460
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:38.790
Dominique Pozo: That the sensation that something's missing eventually it's going to become clear and I have you, have you ever done any journaling. Has that been a practice of yours ever

461
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.980
Dominique Pozo: Oh, well, I'm going to invite you to get a journal. If you don't already have one.

462
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:52.290
Dominique Pozo: And make it your very special journal that you get up in the mornings and you just take five minutes. If you can find that time and it sounds like it's a lot, having

463
00:54:52.560 --> 00:55:03.060
Dominique Pozo: YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER with you. But if you can find time to just devote five minutes. It's not a long time, but maybe set your timer and just right just free right whatever comes through, just thinking made the art.

464
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:18.270
Dominique Pozo: Some something really powerful happened with the freedom you know that image of those wings and that freedom, it really it touched something deeply. So I really trust that through just free writing something's going to start to come through.

465
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.270
Erika Romero: Okay, I will do that.

466
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.180
Erika Romero: Yeah.

467
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:40.770
Dominique Pozo: And I think that image is really powerful. You know that warmth and the sweetness and the strength and the freedom. These are really, those are powerful symbols, you know, to keep if you can maybe put it in a special place that you can keep

468
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.180
Dominique Pozo: Working at it. I think that will help stimulate something in YouTube.

469
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.460
Erika Romero: Okay. Yeah, well,

470
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.590
Dominique Pozo: Okay, do you want

471
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:58.380

472
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.780
