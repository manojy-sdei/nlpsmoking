4
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480

5
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.890
iPhone: Yeah, mentally,

6
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentally, I'm good. Okay, so tell me about

7
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The thoughts that you're having that you assess I'm doing good. Tell me more about that.

8
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.620
iPhone: I'm just content. I've never remember how to tell you. Whenever I don't work. I don't really know what to do. And I give real anxious and that's

9
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:16.050
iPhone: Gold. I've been. I haven't been able to work the last two weeks, and I've been just content at home and just, I guess the relaxed kind of opened my eyes and it just kind of made me grateful that I wasn't doing that anymore. And regardless what I was doing working or not.

10
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the relapse itself is not the negative consequence that helped you realize what really helped you realize

11
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.420
iPhone: Maybe change my mom, you know, the way she just haven't heard in her again, all of that.

12
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.700
iPhone: Just basically all the pain. I watched my family go through again.

13
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Any chance you happen to have the discharge.

14
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Diagnosis from your last admission.

15
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.580
iPhone: Yeah.

16
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.420
iPhone: I don't think I do.

17
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.880
iPhone: My mom, I think.

18
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So today, looks like the last time we reviewed your goals.

19
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometime maybe January, maybe 10th or something. So let's take a peek at how you're doing.

20
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: With your goals here. So one of them is I want to find something that will make me feel like I enjoy my life and not constantly working

21
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Really listened to your goal you set that. Do you know that

22
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you hear how you open. Today I'm noticing.

23
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm not working, but there's a real like this tastes focus

24
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this, this has got all your attention. Like, look at me, I'm not working. I'm okay. I'm gonna be, I'm not working. I think it's

25
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It needs attention.

26
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, but catch that last part, right.

27
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And not constantly working

28
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why you set that for yourself. I wonder why deep down inside you know that's the right thing for you. Why do you think that is

29
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.400
iPhone: I think the main thing is because I watched my dad for all those years do and

30
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.480
iPhone: I saw how detrimental that was to him and my family. I just know that it'll do the same thing to me.

31
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.810
iPhone: Even in just my own life, my, you know, whenever the past couple years. Whenever I just work. I am miserable.

32
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.970
iPhone: Is no I can't be the only thing because it won't always be there.

33
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see the irony that that's the one thing that you've identified is your best relapse prevention plan. The very thing that makes you miserable.

34
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.000
Yeah.

35
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.750
iPhone: Talk to my mom about living in Clovis, I just

36
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.440
iPhone: There's just no way to get out of clear right now. That's what I really feel like I need to do is leave here but

37
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.980
iPhone: I just don't have the opportunity to right now.

38
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We did talk about it. What happened to that type of conversation where you

39
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sell truck move on now, all of a sudden, I'm hearing something about Texas. Now, I don't know the distance between where you are in Texas and maybe it's a short little drive

40
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I had in my head. I was thinking maybe he's relocating or something. I didn't know what was going on. So what's that about

41
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.460
iPhone: Oh, I work and I've been working well. This last

42
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.900
iPhone: Let's see this last week, but the week before that.

43
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:41.820
iPhone: I had when I was supposed to be working all of that week in Amarillo, and I got stuck there and was, I will. We were like a bad snowstorm in the middle of

44
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.950
iPhone: Like the past two weeks. There's been bad snowstorm. So we got stuck there and

45
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:57.600
iPhone: Then I got real sick with the flu last week. And so, but that's where we're building a hospital in Amarillo, so I drive there on Sunday night and come home on Thursdays. Usually, but

46
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:09.150
iPhone: The weather. I mean, I was in Amarillo, but I wasn't working because of the weather. And then I was sick and just having to sit in the hotel room, but that's what I was saying I was just, I felt content. I wasn't

47
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.550
iPhone: I wasn't freaking out that I was, you know, not moving or that I wasn't

48
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:29.280
iPhone: being busy all day, I was literally just had to sit there all day. But I was I just remember a and content. I don't know if it's because it was just fresh on my mind how horrible that relapse was but

49
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.540
iPhone: I just, I'm just in a state of mind where I'm just kind of real grateful for everything right now.

50
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.610
Okay.

51
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All content. Sounds like kind of unfamiliar space for you. That's not normal for you just want to check and see how many milligrams of Suboxone we prescribed from the hospital.

52
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.030
iPhone: What do you mean the hospital.

53
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought you went for your flu were admitted into the hospital.

54
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.440
iPhone: They didn't prescribe me in the box. And I was just taking them.

55
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.790
iPhone: For the flow. Yeah, they didn't prescribe me Suboxone okay

56
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What they do for you, how they help

57
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.540
iPhone: I just gave me

58
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.460
iPhone: This stuff right on to said during its XO friend for

59
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Us for nasza

60
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:39.030
iPhone: Larger and then I was the only reason that I was there is really because I couldn't drink water so they just got me rehydrate and then let me go.

61
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you attribute. Tell me what you have, you've got something wrong with one of your organs. What is that again.

62
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.720
iPhone: I don't have a spleen. So my body doesn't fight off infection.

63
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:57.480
iPhone: And so whenever I get sick. It's really hard for me to get better and I get sick really because of that.

64
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:05.310
iPhone: That's what started the my whole pain pill addiction, back in the day was that having my spleen removed.

65
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened, what happened to that Oregon. Do you know how it originated with the problem with this.

66
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.800
iPhone: Bad dirt bike rack and it actually broken to

67
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:27.750
iPhone: That's it. I lost a lot of blood internally. And so I was on bed rest for six months afterwards and

68
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.020
iPhone: That's kind of where it all started.

69
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.730
iPhone: That was in 2014 in August.

70
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What else is gonna

71
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.860
iPhone: I'm so sorry. When my head is just

72
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.620
iPhone: Out of it right now. Well,

73
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll stay focused on these goals, then because it's going to keep us organized

74
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just look at the piece of I want to find something that will make me feel like I enjoy my life. Let's say that we take out the like I want to find something that I enjoy in my life. How about that one.

75
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. If you don't do that.

76
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nobody's going to. So when do you start that journey check in with yourself. See if you're making excuses. Just check in and see

77
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.690
iPhone: Oh yeah I'm I've been making excuses. I just

78
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:58.170
iPhone: I in for and I don't know if it's I really just feel like I don't know what it can be, or I'm just scared to find out, or go look or I don't know I just feel like on my brain tells me, like, you'll never find it so why even go try looking for it.

79
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.450
Okay.

80
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so for some people.

81
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's I've always known what I'm drawn to. And you have liked the maybe the adrenaline. The excitement of dirt bike racing that's off the table.

82
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.180
iPhone: Really ever quit doing that.

83
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.750
iPhone: There's been that whole kind of

84
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Well, why don't we just look at the attributes of it. Why don't we just look at pieces of it and see if you can check the landscape for other opportunities.

85
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk me through a typical

86
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece of this. Now, I'm not forgetting, in my mind, I'm thinking

87
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad liked it. So I'm not forgetting that part. And so it's really hard to ignore that piece.

88
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. This was like something he could get behind you would actually go to the races. Right.

89
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, isn't that you didn't get much positive attention, but this one that was gave you that

90
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.110
iPhone: Yeah.

91
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of hard for me to ignore that part. But I did say it out loud and maybe it'll come up when it comes up, but

92
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we take

93
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything from the day before the week before the preparation for a race. Just tell me about what that was like. What was your life like preparing for a race we just hear a little bit about it.

94
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.470
iPhone: Well, at the time I

95
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:38.520
iPhone: I mean the weeks and days before I would be writing day you know practice and and then

96
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.260
Like

97
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:53.280
iPhone: Like, like maybe day and Dave two days before the actual race, we would be at the house cleaning all the dirt bikes and servicing and whatever and loading the trailer and then we would go

98
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.210
iPhone: Practice.

99
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.170
iPhone: But it was always kind of like a family thing, you know.

100
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I am see your mom, your sibling, your brother was involved in this.

101
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.250
iPhone: Yeah, my brother race tell he was

102
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:21.450
iPhone: He was younger than me when he quit. He didn't do it like I was he, he liked it but he stopped racing way before I did.

103
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well with your mom.

104
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:41.190
iPhone: She was just she was actually more supportive of it, then my, my dad was she would because in the beginning, my dad. He really didn't care about it. He hated going, he didn't want to come in. Whenever I started racing professionally is kind of whenever he

105
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:56.700
iPhone: started coming around. So before that. My mom is always the one taking me in the truck and she would be the only mom out there with their kids, you know, everyone else's dad would be there, but my mom was always the one that kind of took me and my brother.

106
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What about food preparation and how would your mom kind of help with that.

107
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.940
iPhone: That's what I'm saying. I mean, like she would do all that my dad didn't ever want no part in any of that. It was all my mom and

108
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:27.420
iPhone: Then, me and my brother would load the trailer and get all the bikes ready and stuff like that. My dad, he really just didn't want nothing to do with it till you know the last like three years. Okay.

109
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was only when it was

110
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're making money on it.

111
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.290
Okay.

112
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And and aside from mom, taking you there was there other things, you're really aware of. Now as you really are in a space of gratitude. Is there anything else that maybe you could name that she was doing

113
00:13:50.910 --> 00:14:04.530
iPhone: I mean everything she was paying for it all, she was driving after like the races and I really been tired and good in and she would drive us to two hours back to her home, whatever blade, not one in the morning after the races. I mean,

114
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.440
iPhone: She did a lot. Yeah.

115
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she really appreciate your

116
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.550
iPhone: Gratitude. She

117
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Has she heard it and understand how grateful because I can hear it in your voice.

118
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.400
iPhone: I mean, I'm sure she does. I just, I don't do it enough, though I know that

119
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:34.800
iPhone: I've rarely ever felt like this, except I mean I have, I have my moments, but these last two weeks have been kind of overwhelming that feeling.

120
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Of you cried it all these last two weeks.

121
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.640
iPhone: Yeah, I was crying right before the appointment, you are crying.

122
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then at the race itself kind of let me into what goes on there.

123
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.480
iPhone: Oh, there was just

124
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:12.480
iPhone: It kind of had that feel like a like a barbecue like whenever all your friends would come over, you know, and it was just kind of like a party.

125
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:31.770
iPhone: I mean all my friends from. I mean, that's where all my friends were back then, you know, that's where my life was so all my mom's our parents, friends, all my friends. That's where they were all that that was just kind of our life back then.

126
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.060
iPhone: There was something he kind of looked forward to

127
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And your friends to

128
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The socialization revolves around that, too.

129
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:49.350
iPhone: Yeah, like it was. I mean, I was all I was going every weekend, like we were driving all across the country. So that was pretty much everything we were

130
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.270
iPhone: They put a lot into it, trying to get me.

131
00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:01.680
iPhone: To where I could go pro, but whenever I got heard it just kind of all went out the window and

132
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.070
iPhone: I just, I don't think I've ever really found anything since then.

133
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's why we're having this discussion. Yeah, sounds like it. Okay.

134
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So involved. Again, we're back to it be this bigger than just I'm in an office doing my own thing, there was also this socialization part you're with your mom driving, sometimes your with your brother also driving and mom.

135
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on was everybody together.

136
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:47.460
iPhone: Yeah, my dad would come later on, like, once you finally got it with the last three or four years of it. He went

137
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.840
iPhone: And started buying trade shows, and all kinds of shit active I you know he was all for it. But

138
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.520
iPhone: My mom was there from the very beginning. And my dad just kind of out of nowhere. The last three or four years. I don't know what changed. And I said, I don't know.

139
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:11.850
Okay.

140
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what were you thinking about when you were crying before you came on and that was me.

141
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:34.740
iPhone: And throwing up on one. I was just frustrated that I was still throwing I threw up like literally five minutes before I came into the thing and I was thinking I was gonna have to miss it again and

142
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.200
iPhone: I've just had a rough 24 hours. Okay.

143
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.400
Okay.

144
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, know there's a lot of loss, you know, the more I delve into this more. I hear this is not this is this was everything.

145
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds more and more like that was a huge loss.

146
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if sort of diving right away into this chemical dependence means that you didn't get to grieve it. I'm sure other counselors have brought that up with you.

147
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

148
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This this men.

149
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Love. I mean, this is massive. I don't know many people were the whole family rallied

150
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that's a lot of pressure on you also did a good. I mean, finally, you've got your dad's frickin attention, you know, an office time, energy, and money that your mom has given. I mean, yes, it's exciting for you, but was there ever times when it felt like I have to win.

151
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.110
iPhone: That's how it always felt it was always a lot of pressure, like that. And my dad was

152
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:11.100
iPhone: Always really hard on me whether I did good or not, even if I when he's telling me I did something wrong. Still, so it was always rough

153
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:25.470
iPhone: But I genuinely thought that's the only way I was gonna, you know, make a living for myself by growing up and I didn't think there was another option.

154
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine, it'd be kind of scary to not know what you want to do.

155
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:49.470
iPhone: Yeah. And then my whole. I mean, growing up, my dad and grandpa never wanted me to work for the company and pushed me away and away and away from it and

156
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.680
iPhone: Then whenever I finally

157
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.500
iPhone: You know, I, that was my only option. I just felt like I

158
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.050
iPhone: Like I was just so close to getting out of Clovis and being good. And then I just fell right back in.

159
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.540
iPhone: Like everybody else did.

160
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I do think it would be a good

161
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.790
iPhone: Idea.

162
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To find new passions, but it's an easy thing for me to say you had one and now it's time to look for this second career, you had one, right, much like many athletes when they enter their knee, like do something

163
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got a shift.

164
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.660
iPhone: Yeah.

165
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: They thought it would be this, and I know I gotta have to shift.

166
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Your much like that in that kind of you know you're an athlete and you got hurt.

167
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's keep finding some some characteristics or this

168
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It might not be

169
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Where everyone rally together, you don't have your father alive.

170
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It might not be where your mom drives me somewhere, I'd be different now. Right. But you can still get excited and you can be proud of it. And you can share it with your family.

171
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.170
iPhone: Yeah, I just don't know. But at the moment, what that would be. I just

172
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:37.170
iPhone: I don't know. I honestly don't find joy and nothing else like that's what I I still watch it all the time on TV. I mean, on the TV right now. Like I just because that's what I

173
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.990
iPhone: Still kind of revolves around it. You know, like I still go to races and watch and

174
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:57.690
iPhone: I, I mean, like all over social media that's like what the famous people I followed. That's what you know they are. I don't. It's still my life kind of revolves around. I'm just not racing and so

175
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a role that is on the outside that coaches that is there another role that you're not directly writing. I have no idea. I'm just

176
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:17.670
iPhone: Curious, I mean there is just not in a town like this in a smaller town like this. I mean, I'd be somewhere.

177
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.970
iPhone: Where like it kind of falls like the bigger city mostly like California is where it all.

178
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.540
iPhone: Kind of

179
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.640
iPhone: Arizona.

180
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.110
iPhone: Okay.

181
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So try this on. Close your eyes with me. If you're comfortable on clotheslines you don't feel like I'm staring at you.

182
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And just picture that you have resources that all of that just wasn't an issue you

183
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.810

189
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But that we're going to use our creative imagination.

246
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.970

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.400
iPhone: Might be missing that yeah i don't know i don't know just blank. Um,

248
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.030
iPhone: I don't know. Okay, yeah.

249
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't surprise me. I mean, you've had a pretty hostile history right we've got this whole, like, that's what's missing you needed

250
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't surprise me that one's hard to come up with. Right.

251
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So what about going to, let's go to the Oculus. Let's go superheroes. For some people it's like an Iron Man.

252
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be from a novel TV show one. There's no ambivalence. It's just like, yeah, he

253
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely protect me some people, it's a

254
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Mama Bear protecting its cup or it's a lion, something like that, that it's absolutely

255
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:39.600
iPhone: I don't know, I just think of myself. I got feel like I'm the one that's always last few years had to do it. I don't know.

256
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:49.410
iPhone: Okay. I mean, I've been through, but in my head just I feel like I've been don't want to tend to look out for me. Okay.

257
00:28:49.770 --> 00:29:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So, right. All right. I think that's just fine. So there's a big part of it. That's your adult self that you know how to protect the self.

258
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you. So we're going to call it the adult

259
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: adulterer. I think that's smart. You came up with that. I think it's great.

260
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it have been nice right if you didn't have to. And that's where this other piece will come in. But I think over time will it'll, it'll change and we can we can find a modify it. So now let's do just a little bit of work here.

261
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Go inside your imagination. I want you to picture your adult self.

262
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That ability to register a boundary ability to register an emotional and physical boundary. When someone is threatening you when you perceive threat when there's actual danger. You know what to do and you do it.

263
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the quality of a protective figure

264
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so go there, hold on to it. We're not done yet. We got two more critters to get around.

265
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got that and then kind of bring in

266
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This resource of your mom as a nurturing figure just be president that you get to register boundaries, emotional and physical as a protective figure and then you're interacting with your mom wants the best for you and your

267
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.390
development and growth.

268
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring in Grandpa.

269
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.600

270
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.030

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All three of these

272
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.570
Directing with each other.

273
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you see them interacting in a really

274
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice bow and harmoniously

275
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I see their faces.

276

277
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.240
iPhone: Last year has been so hard.

278
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.020
iPhone: Because I don't whenever my dad died.

279
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.450
iPhone: Me, My mom kind of helped me together.

280
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.190
iPhone: And then

281
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.910
iPhone: It's just like that. I mean, my mom still here, but

282
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.670
iPhone: I still feel like I'm alone now.

283
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell you seem like that.

284
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not and that's what this, this does. I know it may seem simple, but when you let us in. These are actually true experiences for you. Your mom was and is that got in the way with the addiction stuff. Okay. But that's real.

285
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She really does want the best for you showed you with that resource and remember how grateful you were earlier. She really showed you. That's real.

286
00:31:53.190 --> 00:32:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You denying yourself access to it because maybe you're mad at yourself, calling itself names. I don't know what. But that's real. She loves you.

287
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And your grandpa, although he wasn't perfect right he had a gift, getting you out of whatever negative thought you can he can turn it and you could see the other side of something

288
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that because you were able to see it if

289
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You

290
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't understand something. This you really kind of kicked it around and really know

291
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how

292
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.980
To change your perspective to

293
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.140
You do.

294
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:48.630
And it's

295
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Into what's going to feel like growth and development. It's in there.

296
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hear you. It's felt lonely.

297
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What else you thinking about

298
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.080
iPhone: My mind just kind of blank right now.

299
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay to

300
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.030
iPhone: Just having a bad migraines.

301
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So definitely don't want to do

302
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.100
The

303
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Eye Movement stimulation stuff when you

304
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Go on to these microphones usually my

305
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.870
iPhone: Not sometimes they'll be for a whole day. Sometimes it's been our sometimes

306
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:51.120
iPhone: It's a couple hours sometimes it's 20 minutes out of it just

307
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.280
iPhone: Haven't had them in a long time, but just last week I've had a

308
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.320
iPhone: Few of them.

309
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you even in your own family listen closely to your own family organized. Now, do you even know how to be

310
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A son.

311
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.930
iPhone: Oh no, that's what I'm saying it doesn't feel like

312
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:26.340
iPhone: My life doesn't even feel like real life anymore. It's so foreign to me. I don't. That's how only way I know how to explain it really yeah

313
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of looks like that out here like it's so different. Right. I was taking all these notes and this was everything.

314
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Was family. This was friendship. This was driving and sleeping and eating hearing and cleaning and organizing it.

315
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.080
It's gone.

316
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:54.420
iPhone: And then I kind of built my new life in Midland and how this whole new community that I

317
00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.780
iPhone: I had countless numbers of people I could call from a just a community in

318
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:07.530
iPhone: Then I kind of had to get, you know, leave that whole life behind to just out of nowhere.

319
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This this thing earlier when we were talking because we got far we went all the way into I actually could see how my recoveries on the line, I might need to sell my truck. We got that far. Now maybe you play hitting me but you got that bear with me, at least, out loud.

320
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe got scared, whatever, but

321
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know your worst out right to get back to that sense of community. This alone feeling

322
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be in tough.

323
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Be heading towards

324
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Going back to using I'm scared.

325
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:55.050
iPhone: I bought I feel the same way and I, I've told my mom and try to figure out something we just haven't been able to yet. Yeah.

326
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear that word. I got it. Like, even

327
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of community. I've heard it before. And guess what that family was this. I'm not alone. And I just, I think it's not something to ignore.

328
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean what, what exactly is more important than connection to people that care about you. I

329
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that's where you're going to get your answers. I think once

330
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense of love and community. And I think that creativity and

331
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I really want

332
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Your culture tour.

333
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Confidence may may come on man, Arizona, California.

334
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I mean.

335
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:57.120
iPhone: Well, I've experienced that. That's how it was when I was in Midland and it talks about it in a book that that's the only thing I'll keep a job. So Grace, that the a community.

336
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.380
iPhone: I know that I felt that I've experienced it. I just

337
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.250
iPhone: Got that here.

338
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to actually do it. Are you waiting for you to make you

339
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.830
iPhone: Know I'm just i i

340
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:25.530
iPhone: I just don't have the financial resources to go anywhere. Like, I don't, I can't afford to pay rent somewhere right now that's why

341
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.420
iPhone: I haven't

342
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's

343
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your grandfather tell you about that you don't have work right now, what would he tell you

344
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:44.940
iPhone: Well, back then it was never an issue. He was just like if you feel like you need to go and live over there. I'll support you and we'll get you

345
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:46.650
iPhone: Know,

346
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You've had people

347
00:37:52.860 --> 00:38:02.340
iPhone: Well, yeah, I've just i mean i i i didn't grow up like extremely wealthy or anything, but my grandparents were on both sides of the family and so

348
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:13.980
iPhone: My whenever my grandpa died and my dad died. My mom doesn't I make more money than my mom does. So I've been kind of having to help her, and my brother with stuff and

349
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:21.840
iPhone: I also feel obligated to stay here and help them because I'm paying for a lot of stuff you know

350
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you hear you.

351
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.360
Oh, man.

352
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to get back into this community. I can tell you your mom wants you to be

353
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's scary.

354
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But it alone. Unless you're feeling supported and connected and and this is not something, your mom is

355
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: People in those friends.

356
00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.490
iPhone: Yeah.

357
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You put you first. It's not selfish. It's not me tell you something. Once you get your back grounded.

358
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can start to see. Oh my gosh. I can't believe I didn't think I

359
00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.410
Was completely incorrect.

360
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, you can get

361
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.680
Of course, you can't

362
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, you don't know that right now.

363
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.130
Okay, of course.

364
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's scary, but you don't have to already know what job. It is

365
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That this thing of having to help your mom, you can help her from somewhere else later on when you're more

366
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Risky

367
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:56.430
iPhone: Thing. Like, I don't have. I have to either work to pay these bills that I have every month or I don't have that.

368
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:12.510
iPhone: I don't know how to I don't have money to pay rent somewhere where I'm staying right now I don't pay rent. And so if I leave and go try to find a new job somewhere in this new city I gotta find a place to stay. TO PAY RENT. AND THEN I GOT TO FIND THE JOB AND

369
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:19.890
iPhone: I don't have money to live off of in between that, like, I'm just living paycheck to paycheck right now I don't have anything

370
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And we already talked about where that money's going right now you have this image. I think it's a little. I don't want to say it's materialistic. But is it possible

371
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.300
iPhone: Even to sell my car. Like, I can't sell it without

372
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.360
iPhone: I can't even sell it, because I'm

373
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:53.370
iPhone: I can't make enough for it to pay it off. Like, I don't have enough money to even sell the car like I'm stuck in the car. I can't sell it, if I wanted to.

374
00:40:53.880 --> 00:41:01.470
iPhone: Unless I got money to pay off that extra four or 5000 whatever it was that we check. I've already checked about trying to sell the car, but

375
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.690
iPhone: Under like five grand, so that I don't have. Okay.

376
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's So mom doesn't understand this isn't brainstorming with you, like, for example, could you could shoot. All right, this kind of conversation. Could she is it or is she still so resentful. And I don't know first

377
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.760
iPhone: One out me try to figure out how to sell the car and we just, there's just not a way to do it at the moment, like where

378
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.560
iPhone: There's just not other than giving it back to the bank, which would run her credit and I have just

379
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:43.590
iPhone: Her credit. Well, yeah, she's my name is on it, but she co sign for me.

380
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: He said there's more pressure, you mentioned

381
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.750
iPhone: And so I just

382
00:41:52.950 --> 00:42:02.490
iPhone: She's been trying to help me find it a way out and somewhere to go. We both been looking at just we just haven't found it yet. She agrees. I need to be out of Clovis, she just

383
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:09.000
iPhone: She doesn't and she's even the one. Tell me, like, I don't know how to do it without your dad.

384
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so she's too.

385
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.090
Okay.

386
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and your grandfather's passed away and your dad has passed away. So these people that normally you'd be able to

387
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.000
Kind of continue to grow with

388
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:31.980
Okay.

389
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And mom needs to stay there.

390
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.080
Assuming

391
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is that

392
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.220
iPhone: She just has like, a year and a half left so she retires from her job.

393
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And she'll be able

394
00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To take off. I'm retirement.

395
00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:06.990
iPhone: I don't know. I don't know anything about any of that. I just invite growing up. I just know that like I make the same money. My dad did growing up right now. And so

396
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:18.540
iPhone: He was kind of paying for all of me and my brother stuff. And most of the bills, good my mom doesn't make very much money. And so now I kind of stepped into that. So that's where all

397
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.010
iPhone: I don't know, it's just hard.

398
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It is hard. It is hard. It's gonna be okay. You guys are eating, you're on cell phones. You're driving around you're okay, you're okay.

399
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And things aren't going to be all

400
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:37.710
Right.

401
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But it will all fall apart.

402
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if you start

403
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:44.430
iPhone: To this

404
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Future and dumped just

405
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In the moment

406
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're, you're saying that you're over there.

407
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Content.

408
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious about how your how you're doing that is completely

409
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Off some thoughts. How are you pulling it off, you know,

410
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:19.320
iPhone: I don't even know. Honestly, it's just that that feeling that I usually get whenever I'm not at work. That tells me that

411
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:30.090
iPhone: This would be a lot easier to get through this time. If I could just use while I'm not working. And then whenever I have to go back to work off stop that just not there. I don't have

412
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.280
iPhone: All right. No.

413
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to ask it to show up.

414
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:52.170
iPhone: And it's usually a lot different. It just feels like the Suboxone isn't doing its job. Whenever I'm not working and I feel like I'm real jittery and like I just need something more is what I feel like okay oh like that. The last two weeks.

415
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me make sure I heard it, because I think I just heard the opposite of that. So let me just make sure

416
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Last two weeks. The Suboxone doesn't seem to be pushing the cravings.

417
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:11.400
iPhone: Know it this last two weeks, it has been in the past when I'm not working. That's kind of what it feels like it like it's not working.

418
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have gone to taking it.

419
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

420
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're taking it once or a couple times a day. Yeah.

421
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.500
iPhone: Twice a day.

422
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, that's something to be grateful for grateful.

423
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.610
iPhone: For it. Great.

424
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a medicine that you didn't have to kind of cold turkey it. It does. It does sit on the opiate receptors. Well, and then that craving is my

425
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is something else to be grateful for. It's getting you some time to maybe think what

426
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do about that.

427
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can still be okay. Today you what

428
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to do for the latter today, are you

429
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of live this moment at a time.

430
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:19.440
iPhone: I'm about to go take a shower after this. But then I was supposed to go clean my aunt and my grandma's card just

431
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.680
iPhone: And then come home and I'm going to church tonight at six, and that's it.

432
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Online fellowship

433
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

434
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:39.840
iPhone: Not, I just can't find. I mean, there's some and there's a few in fatalis but there's only like two times a week and

435
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:47.130
iPhone: I just honestly haven't gave it any chance I just haven't got up and went over there and done it.

436
00:46:48.390 --> 00:47:10.170
iPhone: And then there's not there's one in a meeting on Thursday at 1pm that I can't go to, because I'm not in town. And then there's Celebrate Recovery here on Sunday nights, but I, me and my mom went to it. On Sunday, but usually I'm out of town for work and miss it well.

437
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What I just asked you was online.

438
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.350
iPhone: Oh no, I haven't looked online like

439
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: you're robbing yourself. You can go online and join meetings dissipate find community through the Internet, same when you join

440
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: These groups and I'm going to tell you something. You can write this down to you can come in here, you have to pay for it, right. That's right. Lee was going to say we know you can join some of our other groups, you just drop in

441
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

442
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I would get online. I don't have it right in front of me, but I did some research myself.

443
00:47:53.070 --> 00:48:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason why you can't find it. Just online so report online. A Na, you're going to see it, you'll run into two or three of them really he

444
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: can sign up for stuff participate in, in, in, I think they have the teleconference or maybe it's just something that will find out could be spending time researching

445
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.430
iPhone: Oh well.

446
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're going to be okay. It's the thought, I'm not going to be okay.

447
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:26.940
That will probably

448
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.460
