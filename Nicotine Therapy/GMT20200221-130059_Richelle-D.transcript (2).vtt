Richelle Direny: OK, so

36
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.560
Richelle Direny: The processing between each thing here is so small.

37
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.410
Jasie Crotinger: I bet I use our words here that my one job and as

38
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.470
Jasie Crotinger: Soon as it kicked me out of emails and stuff like that. You gotta go back a hope that it saves a lot

39
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.870
Jasie Crotinger: Of annoying.

40
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.300
Richelle Direny: I mean, when I pull up your treatment plan, how, how has everything been going. I mean, like I said, it's been

41
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.250
Richelle Direny: Some time since I've met with you. How is, you know, things being

42
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.320
Jasie Crotinger: Gay.

43
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.010
Jasie Crotinger: Nothing's really been a different

44
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:51.840
Jasie Crotinger: Things that I think going to have the same routine every day. I mean, I didn't have some drama in their little bit here and there with my dad being around a little bit with her mom. Not like necessarily like

45
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.380
Jasie Crotinger: Like drama in that way, but it's more like

46
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.960
Jasie Crotinger: A kid with mom just one lens of them. So whenever you'd be around here with you know my kids or whatever been in time to be had. Be really spend time with them like that.

47
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.320
Jasie Crotinger: It'd be a problem. He made a big deal about it.

48
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.300
Jasie Crotinger: So just, I don't know. That's like one thing I just, I had a like kind of pushed out because it was just too much drama.

49
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.700
Jasie Crotinger: So,

50
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.000
Richelle Direny: Your children you and your children's father lives together.

51
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.290
Jasie Crotinger: No, he didn't really come around when he got out of prison like

52
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.500
Jasie Crotinger: I think it was April or March.

53
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.250
Jasie Crotinger: Or they

54
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.740
Jasie Crotinger: May be march a brighter. Now one of the two. But anyways, we got a prison his birthday mom when God well

55
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.550
Jasie Crotinger: He was also method away with other its current baby mama. You just had a baby with now.

56
00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:00.030
Jasie Crotinger: So what happened was, is he was in a relationship with its birth babies mom and she didn't hurt with that girl. Well, whenever he was transitioning into her house.

57
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.650
Jasie Crotinger: Like get ready to move with the one that you just got pregnant and I just had a baby, and he was coming over here alive to spend time with this kid was

58
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.270
Jasie Crotinger: Because he wasn't able to go spend time with the other good at her house because there's just too much, and she didn't have

59
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:24.570
Jasie Crotinger: She I guess she had a victim around that time. So she didn't have anywhere to say much. So anyways, when he would come over here and I would be

60
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:33.360
Jasie Crotinger: A problem with both of them. There's a lot of drama and you know for me to deal with that had two females that were just being weird about the situation.

61
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.790
Jasie Crotinger: We just didn't give you know give a crap what they thought. So we never really tried to relieve the situation.

62
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.880
Jasie Crotinger: So there was there for a minute with a lot of drama and stress. But, I mean, I just thought I'd that were dead. I mean I got over it.

63
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.890
Jasie Crotinger: Now,

64
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.720
Richelle Direny: This was, this was so it's almost a year now since he's been out of prison.

65
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.860
Yeah.

66
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, cuz you said that it was in April.

67
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.180
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, April or March or April, which everyone

68
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.830
Jasie Crotinger: Well,

69
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's almost a year.

70
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:31.500
Richelle Direny: I see in one of your goals that you are working on. It's not to explore like some of your personal goals was to explore struggles with avoiding confrontation and setting boundaries.

71
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.910
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, well that laughing I talked to my carefully about which is my last individual

72
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.580
Jasie Crotinger: Because I didn't have a job with

73
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.660
Jasie Crotinger: With my kids. And then my youngest son. Oh my god.

74
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.880
Jasie Crotinger: Well, buddy. You're closer upstairs on the bed or. Yep. Um, anyways, around the time I was doing individuals with her, I was going through a lot with him.

75
00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:04.020
Jasie Crotinger: And he was living with me. This one was live with me totally different kids, Dad. But he didn't want me and he like had cheated on me with the girl from work.

76
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:19.560
Jasie Crotinger: And he started like kind of like, you know, seeing the girl and the girl had no clue about me. So it kind of had to do some disrespectful stuff to kind of make it look like he was in a relationship, you know, I mean, so

77
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.430
Jasie Crotinger: And then stop. Yeah.

78
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.860
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, no, I don't think that go, you go get your coat off the bat. It's right up there, then

79
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.950
Jasie Crotinger: I'm on the same stop.

80
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.860
Jasie Crotinger: I'm sorry.

81
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:48.600
Jasie Crotinger: Um, anyways. So that was the issue like setting setting boundaries and avoiding confrontation within your I mean just letting things

82
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:57.780
Jasie Crotinger: Because otherwise arguing with them on point with them. I was always like guarantee you're always arguing about something he goes on to place blame.

83
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.210
Jasie Crotinger: And all that. And so I think that was my one the burger and

84
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.350
Jasie Crotinger: avoid confrontation, which I'm actually did avoid it.

85
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:20.310
Jasie Crotinger: Is let it go. Honestly, now he's trying to come back in and tell me, sorry, and you stop stop with your mouth. I'm on the same thing, go upstairs and get your coat

86
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.730
Jasie Crotinger: You're still I'm saying

87
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.480
Richelle Direny: No, you're fine there for

88
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.660
Richelle Direny: Us and we all people with young children. We all have these conversations, getting ready in the morning.

89
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:54.390
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, it is not cooperate. But yeah, a lot of my issues. And if they're not understanding why during the night knowing why he did this stuff, but I mean ended everything for him. So he now for the day he admits that he was wrong. He never did it.

90
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:07.560
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, his justification that was that he was living in that and and all that it is. Yeah. I mean, that is on find out as a justification for why you do that here. I mean,

91
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:17.130
Richelle Direny: But then you said that you, is it that you just kind of forgot about it and got over it because then the

92
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.750
Richelle Direny: The thing would be if you never really addressed it and really set those clear boundaries with him.

93
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:40.320
Richelle Direny: In terms of confrontation. It just really depends. I mean confrontation is not always a bad thing confrontation meaning me could mean that you're confronting the issues that real cause a problem with the relationship in the sense that

94
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:51.420
Richelle Direny: When it comes on to the children if it's is it that you guys are just working on having a civil relationship where you're just co parenting only

95
00:09:51.690 --> 00:10:04.410
Richelle Direny: And nothing more. And it's setting those boundaries or is it that you're setting boundaries in the sense that if you are having more than just a cool parenting relationship. And you guys are engaged in a relationship.

96
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:10.350
Richelle Direny: Is setting goals like what does that look like. So it's setting those boundaries. So that's what I'm trying to

97
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.630
Richelle Direny: Understand, like in terms of moving forward, what are, what are your expectations, where that's concerned with him.

98
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.910
Jasie Crotinger: And

99
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:39.120
Jasie Crotinger: When we dig within boundaries because you can get them every two weeks, I need him summer with the girl his lead now. Yeah. I mean, it takes a night and he takes them and then brings them back that Sunday. So we did set boundaries as far as profanity. Yeah, we don't want you to do that.

100
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.280
Jasie Crotinger: So, I mean,

101
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:48.540
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, the boundaries Vegas, I don't know, as far as like, you know, dressing the issue on think we ever really did.

102
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.340
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah.

103
00:10:51.150 --> 00:11:01.710
Richelle Direny: But do you feel in your opinion, where it's concerned, it is imperative for you to address it because I mean I can see you addressing it. If it is a situation where

104
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:11.340
Richelle Direny: You both are working on getting back into a relationship, then yes, those issues need to be addressed. But if it's that he's living his life he has his own relationship.

105
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:21.600
Richelle Direny: And this is just a matter of the co parenting piece, then that's more important to to address them to them in an argument about

106
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.550
Jasie Crotinger: Right He's married now. So the girl.

107
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.080
But he's trying

108
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:49.620
Jasie Crotinger: And he's trying now like contact me and talk to me all day because I was our routine like we would talk all day. And why does that work. I gotta call my brakes and as before I got married right upon my braids in the morning about climate and you talked all the time so we

109
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.890
Jasie Crotinger: Were on the phone wisely. But then he got married.

110
00:11:53.370 --> 00:12:01.650
Jasie Crotinger: And I put it off. Once I realize that's what he was doing, you know, lied to me about. He never he never admitted to it. You know, I mean, I think that's because he didn't want to lose contact with me.

111
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:11.790
Jasie Crotinger: But he never admitted it. So him now. I feel like he is trying to get that relationship back and you can't do that when you're married, that's my thing.

112
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.470
Jasie Crotinger: And I know what time

113
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.130
Richelle Direny: What being

114
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.310
Richelle Direny: What kind of relationship. Is it a

115
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.810
Jasie Crotinger: Night talking to

116
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.010
Jasie Crotinger: Your bank.

117
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.870
Jasie Crotinger: No, no, no.

118
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.770
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, well, like talking to me behind her back type stuff or

119
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:32.790
Jasie Crotinger: Like having me come see him my weird stuff that I wouldn't do and I'm in the clear wasn't going to, you know, I mean, I don't know.

120
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:43.470
Jasie Crotinger: If you are the voice to be different story. If you were to get into divorce, I would take you seriously. Could you talk about how he's not happy. And some of that. Well, if you're not happy, then go get a divorce and then we'll talk. Yeah, I mean,

121
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.070
Jasie Crotinger: In the meantime, we're not doing that. We're not going to keep that that contact where you're

122
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:57.690
Jasie Crotinger: Where you're telling me, Oh, I'm not happy. But I'm still gonna sit in the same situation here I need to just repeat the whole purpose.

123
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:06.660
Jasie Crotinger: Like it's not fair to her, just like I said, even though she came in on my relationship is different. You're very like that.

124
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.530
Jasie Crotinger: Not so he got married to his

125
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.440
Richelle Direny: He got married to your ex coworkers. What's your thing.

126
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.450
Jasie Crotinger: Now he got married to his coworker.

127
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.700
Jasie Crotinger: The girl need to know anyway.

128
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:25.710
Jasie Crotinger: Okay. Yeah, because he died. He died a lie. Right. So I felt like this. What he what he needed to feel better.

129
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.720
Jasie Crotinger: And

130
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.900
Jasie Crotinger: I relationship, you never really gave us a fair shot because he had a day mom in the mix of it.

131
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.260
Jasie Crotinger: It was always having to deal with her and make excuses rowing had to go say that my dad doesn't. It was weird stuff. Yeah, I mean,

132
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:49.050
Jasie Crotinger: Like it may know about. Are you talking about like we're in a relationship. Why do you need to go over there and spend the night with your daughter. You know, I mean, like, stuff like that, just

133
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:56.940
Jasie Crotinger: Didn't make no sense. But then you go with this female and she don't want to deal with that stuff yeah i mean by that is, I'm

134
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:12.480
Jasie Crotinger: Like I never had a fair shot with it. I told him I said I dealt with the same shit and just like you're learning about it and you just want to benefit from our relationship and united your fucking way and I just don't think that's fair.

135
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.820
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I mean,

136
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.480
Richelle Direny: So, yes.

137
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So yeah, so then definitely it will be setting those boundaries with him, where

138
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.380
Richelle Direny: If you have like those clear boundaries. One is

139
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.690
Richelle Direny: If you're just going to be co parenting.

140
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:43.410
Richelle Direny: Then it's co parenting were like whatever plans that you guys have when it comes on to the children than the conversation and it's related to the children and nothing more.

141
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.880
Jasie Crotinger: Like I see says

142
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.800
Richelle Direny: If you're you're married. If you don't want to have and setting those boundaries straining and

143
00:14:49.800 --> 00:15:01.410
Richelle Direny: making it very clear confronting the fact if you don't want to have respect for your marriage. Well, I'm not going to help you break those vows and I'm not going to be a part of that.

144
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:17.640
Richelle Direny: So, you know, it's just making it very clear that you're in a marriage that's that's what you chose and like you said, if you're unhappy then seek help, but I'm not going to infiltrate that whole marriage.

145
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.860
Jasie Crotinger: That falling back on me.

146
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.180
Jasie Crotinger: The Bible. Why would you do that.

147
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.430
Jasie Crotinger: Why would you set it down on the floor. That's not where was it. Why would you do that.

148
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.610
Jasie Crotinger: I'm sorry.

149
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.940
Jasie Crotinger: My kids are doing stupid stuff right now.

150
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.190
Jasie Crotinger: told him that you can get out of my thing. Now get away

151
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.800
Jasie Crotinger: Anyways, I told them.

152
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.510
Jasie Crotinger: Hey, I mean you're married, you're married, he got aggravated with an equal you know my

153
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:56.430
Jasie Crotinger: One baby bad being around you. But when you're there with them. But you're telling me you wonder as as different he's not in a relationship, you've already committed to these females, obviously.

154
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:12.420
Jasie Crotinger: You know, I mean, that's not my fault and your are you actually committed to her. So that's a different story. And then he finally was like, you're right. You know, I'm sorry. You just reminded me that I am married and you know whatever boba. Yeah. Like, I don't

155
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.100
Know if he's married

156
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.470
Jasie Crotinger: He said, You're right. You remind you are trying to sort of remind me that I'm married. That's what he said to me.

157
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.080
Richelle Direny: Oh, wow.

158
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.610
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

159
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.050
Richelle Direny: He needs to go to me. Yeah, he's to go get help for his situation, but

160
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:37.440
Jasie Crotinger: Because he was on a locker and now it's like because she was like, you know, she kept on saying we're doing like talking to people, not in her back and

161
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:49.230
Jasie Crotinger: I felt I felt like personally like she was getting ready to leave them in here like Alicia. Screw it. Let's get married, I'm married right now I want to gamble, but

162
00:16:49.800 --> 00:17:04.260
Jasie Crotinger: You know, I mean, I felt like he wanted to trap her it was all about trapping her in that marriage that he's having a flag with a piece of paper in the answer to hear you had a previous marriage he got he got another girl of hugging me

163
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.370

174
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.180
Jasie Crotinger: Two of them are with the one that's not married. That's not even committed

175
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.510
Jasie Crotinger: And and one of them is with the one that's made that was just

176
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.950
Jasie Crotinger: Like I don't want

177
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.540
Richelle Direny: This is our youngest child.

178
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:55.620
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, this is my youngest child that and I've been. I haven't worked with him for off and on, like 10 years like it's been a long time to meet him or offline.

179
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:03.570
Jasie Crotinger: As I told him, I said, why would you marry her more sure that you were over me. You are. I mean, good. He was in. He was always trying to reach out to. I was in a relationship with her.

180
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:12.450
Jasie Crotinger: He was always trying to come back here and so by that and I told him no, you know, I mean, I was like block them to my urine, you're in a relationship, very good luck on united mean

181
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:21.450
Jasie Crotinger: Like, leave me alone. Let me, let me move on, you know, I mean, so it was always something. But, you know, in the beginning, my person mess around like

182
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:33.690
Jasie Crotinger: For actually this went on for years. He would always like beg me to be with him or get mad if I if I wouldn't you, I mean, if I were to talk to her mess with them or anything like that. So it's like I just like

183
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.270
Jasie Crotinger: You shouldn't have gotten married because he should have expected that he was going to want to talk to me or I mean

184
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.100
Jasie Crotinger: This has been my head is

185
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.950
Jasie Crotinger: What I say is routine or what

186
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.900
Jasie Crotinger: Has been something he's always done it. I mean, everybody knows that.

187
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So yeah, so that is definitely something

188
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.520
Jasie Crotinger: That yeah and I

189
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:09.150
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah. For other effects and for their marriage and I mean there's different. Yeah, I mean, I hate that series of just sending a Bible. I'm still not committed

190
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.650
Jasie Crotinger: BY THEN I DON'T KNOW WHY WOULD YOU HAVE MADE IT TODAY, what do you should have got married to begin with.

191
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:30.090
Richelle Direny: I mean, and I think and i think it's it's one of the other things that I can look at with you in terms of working on, it's you know for you to

192
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:39.570
Richelle Direny: Maybe saying, you know, what are your expectations are. What are your personal goals for your life as it's related to your three children and raising them.

193
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:57.330
Richelle Direny: And just like staying focused on you because as you said that he's married. He's doing his own thing. You kind of need to move on with your life and you need to, you know, figure out what is it that you want to do so with your life and pretty much get over that whole situation with him.

194
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:05.790
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, well, this is a ridiculous ridiculous situation I really did.

195
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.960
Jasie Crotinger: I don't like it. Honestly, because he reaches out to me here. I mean, it's like, I can't, I can't block of hiding under

196
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.180
Jasie Crotinger: Your i mean i can block his numbers is can block the private number and I left alone for a long time for

197
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:26.550
Jasie Crotinger: Like, I thought I would. I would. You know, I'm really more and I said keep my my line and you don't have to worry about me because I hadn't really been hitting them up. You guys want to reach out to me.

198
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:39.780
Jasie Crotinger: And I told her that. And she was like, okay, I respect that. Yeah. You know, I'm thank you for agreeing to not entertain him is what she said to me, and then does happen.

199
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.030
Richelle Direny: What do you think so, you told the wife about it.

200
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.780
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, listen before they got married, I told her, because she had caught him up trying to get mad at me because he said

201
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:57.600
Jasie Crotinger: I didn't talk to you in a couple of days and she's seen the message, right. So I said, it goes both ways. But why would I read that to you. You know, I mean, and then

202
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:04.590
Jasie Crotinger: To see that I wasn't entertaining the show you I mean she's seen that he was one reached out to me once again this is always what happened.

203
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.270
Jasie Crotinger: No girl.

204
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.190
Jasie Crotinger: CC night he was one reach out to me and I'm like, Well, I don't know what to tell you.

205
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.390
Jasie Crotinger: You know, I can't stop them from

206
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:22.260
Jasie Crotinger: Reaching out through email and shit. Yeah, I mean I just I can't stop them from doing anything I can ignore it. I can, you know, tell them it is what it is. I can do all that I can't stop them from it. So,

207
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:34.680
Jasie Crotinger: You know Jim as my comment. I said, Look, I said, I'm not going to argue with you about a man that obviously isn't going to do right that's on here that for for wanting to be with that, man. You're not going to change them. So it's up to you when

208
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.870
Jasie Crotinger: Exactly what you're going to do about it, you know, I mean,

209
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.550
Richelle Direny: But you're not gonna thinking I'm trying to

210
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:44.100
Jasie Crotinger: Place blame on me when I'm not the one and you clearly see, I'm not the one that reached out to him, you know, I mean,

211
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:53.460
Jasie Crotinger: So you need to blame him when that man for time to constantly and it likes entertained. Another female or reached out to another female because

212
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:01.830
Jasie Crotinger: Shimon texted me. That's where it started. She texted me and said, hey, Leslie mad that that he has a hurts me your days, you might want to

213
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:12.720
Jasie Crotinger: Might want to reach out to them and said this is a concern, friends, and I'm like, wait a minute. I'll do they going to say that you're going to do. Someone text me saying was that your I mean like

214
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:23.100
Jasie Crotinger: I just know Wesley when he went to had been through fit in part one of his friends at work about that when he was anything so I knew it was her offer it sound like

215
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:32.550
Jasie Crotinger: Who is this. And you know why you talk about it. But then I ended up with him either pronunciation. It was her number. I said, Listen, I said, girl. You've seen that he reached out to me.

216
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:43.920
Jasie Crotinger: I said, if you go back into his other messages. You can see he's already sounds to me. He's the one giving me his number when you change it. Okay, you guys didn't get your socks and shoes on your. I mean, it was like

217
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.800
Richelle Direny: Before this is before they got married.

218
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:58.740
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, before they got married, I just explained to her, like, look, you can see he's going to tell me he missed me any messed up, and he wants to come home, you're seeing all these messages and you're seeing that I'm not entertaining it but then you're going to get mad at me though.

219
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.650
Jasie Crotinger: Get mad at him.

220
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.130
Yeah.

221
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:03.870
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

222
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.770
Richelle Direny: confronting her insecurities.

223
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:16.350
Jasie Crotinger: Right. And I told her, I said, girl. He was with me and living with me and in a horse RELATIONSHIP WITH ME. THAT'S WHAT AM I said you should have done your homework, honey.

224
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:26.280
Jasie Crotinger: You can do your homework because you will easily figure it out. In the beginning you want to go through all this. I said, I tried to tell you what you don't want to listen.

225
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.670
Jasie Crotinger: You want to keep thinking some always bitter. How does look like

226
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:38.250
Jasie Crotinger: If I was bitter. I think I would have been the one reached out to him. Don't you think, you know, I mean, I told her that I said it monitors be her if that was what it really was.

227
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:48.810
Jasie Crotinger: If that's what you really thought then, don't you think I would have been one reaching out to him. Do you think I would have his number I grew by the hell out of you with that so

228
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.040
Richelle Direny: She finally realized with

229
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.330
Jasie Crotinger: Him, but

230
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.910
Jasie Crotinger: She still kind of mad about situation because she's probably mad at yourself for looking very targeted like that. But I thought you

231
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.410
Richelle Direny: Sounds like you're pretty much, but that was before they got married, but now it's like I said, now it seems like

232
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:14.310
Richelle Direny: The

233
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.500
Jasie Crotinger: The primary heading. Now it's

234
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.050
Jasie Crotinger: It's really more

235
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:34.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And for him to understand that you need to work on your relationship with your wife, not to sit here and call me when you you're if it's not related to the kids. Then I don't really need to be entertaining our conversation with you.

236
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.430
Richelle Direny: Are giving an inkling that it's okay for you to call me.

237
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.960
Richelle Direny: Just to have

238
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.970
Jasie Crotinger: A conversation and

239
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.690
Richelle Direny: Buy a car.

240
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.210
Jasie Crotinger: My life. Yeah, it kind of come into my life.

241
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.740
Jasie Crotinger: Exactly how to my house.

242
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.550
Jasie Crotinger: And you have the audacity to tell me I can have my other big data, my house.

243
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.680
Jasie Crotinger: I said,

244
00:24:54.750 --> 00:25:02.730
Jasie Crotinger: Exactly. So this is my house I pay my bill just like I tell his girls I pay my bills. Don't worry about who's in my house and it's not your business. You can't tell me who I can have my house.

245
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:14.910
Jasie Crotinger: near one of y'all can tell me I pay my bills you don't pay nothing. Y'all know nothing for me. I know him. I know that do not tell me who I can have in my house. Don't do that.

246
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.500
Jasie Crotinger: And that's, I told him like

247
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.800
Jasie Crotinger: Chocolate weird shit for him to do.

248
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:34.470
Jasie Crotinger: On your own self respect right and you're trying to bring him and he can use it because we went through a lot with like I left hand for divine. That was my first year. I mean, my first day I was

249
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.300
Jasie Crotinger: Good with computers and know roughly when it got picked up and I left. So we're gonna get

250
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.240
Jasie Crotinger: Back to the lesson.

251
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.370
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah. Anyways, I left them.

252
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.620
Jasie Crotinger: Because he was

253
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.830
Jasie Crotinger: VERY NAUGHTY towards it doesn't like

254
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.120
Richelle Direny: He said he doesn't. But that those are your first, your, your, that's your

255
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.820
Richelle Direny: Folder children's father

256
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:26.760
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I had a Mari the under on like I was pregnant and thought it was you know my first baby died down and turns out with Leslie, so I had a baby on him. You know, I mean, so that you know it makes me mad about situations TV.

257
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.610
Jasie Crotinger: Drama, the law, you know, sucking on why he does it.

258
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.260
Jasie Crotinger: For you to my good job. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't do none of that.

259
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:42.630
Jasie Crotinger: So it's kind of like it's a division where I'm just like, why are you so angry at him when he don't through your son, my son. He is his

260
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:54.570
Jasie Crotinger: His lifestyle and stuff isn't the best year. I mean, but in the same thing you treat them very good. He doesn't treat a mess. It doesn't like here. I mean, exposing the things we serve you. So true.

261
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.460
Jasie Crotinger: And

262
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.220
Richelle Direny: So it's his own insecurities that he's trying to

Richelle Direny: Instill upon you and have you feel

264
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.260

267
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.580
Richelle Direny: Well that's good that you are able to put those boundaries in there.

268
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.810

328
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:55.290
Richelle Direny: So you

329
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.830
Jasie Crotinger: Know not

330
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.090
Jasie Crotinger: Of course, of course.

331
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.480
Richelle Direny: Yes, I'd you're not not cosmetology school yet.

332
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.070
Jasie Crotinger: Not yet.

333
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.130
Richelle Direny: Now, what is your goal in terms of getting into cosmetology school

334
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.300
Jasie Crotinger: Figured out you get that situated where I can

335
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.140
Jasie Crotinger: Get you there and be that bad.

336
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.080
Jasie Crotinger: What is it

337
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.690
Jasie Crotinger: What is that called in and I came on and

338
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.880
Richelle Direny: Would you talk about with your student loans.

339
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.770
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah. Student loan that's what it is. I get my student loans figured out first, because

340
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.930
Richelle Direny: forbearance.

341
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:59.970
Jasie Crotinger: And live in pain on it. Instead, so it doesn't affect me as far as like my taxes and stuff like that. So I know that I talked to take him because of it.

342
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:07.590
Jasie Crotinger: So I can deal with like paying every month for six months and then now it's to the other part where I'm getting a deer down

343
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:27.510
Jasie Crotinger: Zero dollar a month. I don't have to pay nothing every month. It keeps it from being in the negative like stuff. We're getting near I mean are piling up so it's been taking care of, or is that it goes, I should be able to go back to school. I didn't have to go figure that out how that goes.

344
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:44.430
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I mean I would definitely encourage you, just to, you know, kind of like be more proactive in kind of figuring it out so you can get into the program because what are you what you're doing now.

345
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.720
Richelle Direny: Is it pretty lucrative in terms of financially.

346
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.960
Richelle Direny: It's meeting a need right now. But do you think if you go into

347
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:07.050
Richelle Direny: cosmetology school or get your license you would, would you be a little bit more in terms of generating income, it will be a little bit better. And you'll be more stable.

348
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.160
Yeah.

349
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:09.900
Jasie Crotinger: Definitely

350
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:10.650
Yeah.

351
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:20.640
Richelle Direny: I mean, and it's just, you know, being proactive about seeing like what kind of assistance is out there with helping you kind of stay to

352
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:29.880
Richelle Direny: With your if you're if you're already paying on your student loans, then it's just kind of finding out through whatever program. You want to go to how you know

353
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:39.960
Richelle Direny: In terms of flexibility or them. How will it work with with your children being able to go to school while your children are in school or

354
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:51.000
Richelle Direny: You know, if it's in the evenings and someone assisting you with the kids in the afternoon. I mean, it sounds like your children's for your first kids father is involved, so he'll be helpful with them already.

355
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.210
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, he is.

356
00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:59.160
Jasie Crotinger: He is

357
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.140
Jasie Crotinger: He

358
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.400
Jasie Crotinger: He's a need for a bit about it sometimes he can, though.

359
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.040
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I mean,

360
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.360
Richelle Direny: You said sometimes he's not able but I mean it's just looking into

361
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:28.740
Richelle Direny: In terms of, I mean, when you look at your, your life now are kind of the structure of how things are for you now.

362
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.730
Richelle Direny: Do you see various areas of improvement.

363
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.670
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, most definitely.

364
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.530
Richelle Direny: Okay.

365
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.930
Jasie Crotinger: I want to career because

366
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:54.150
Jasie Crotinger: I want them to fall back on something that's consistent. I don't want to have to keep bugging out here again, never. I mean, I'll work a second job that you enjoy the night prayer, but my first job to be that you're i mean i my first job to be

367
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.850
Jasie Crotinger: Mm hmm careers that my kids. I mean, all your be so I wanted to worry about.

368
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.990
Jasie Crotinger: Anything you know they'll be taken care of and so

369
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.040
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, they weren't ready for anything you're i mean

370
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:13.740
Richelle Direny: Doing

371
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.850
Richelle Direny: Go ahead. You just see like what

372
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.480
Jasie Crotinger: I just like a career would definitely be something that's better for me and

373
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:37.500
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of taking on that kind of really sitting down and really thinking about it and saying, How bad do you want it.

374
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:48.540
Richelle Direny: And when you think about how bad do you want it, how bad do you want stability, how bad do you want structure, how bad do you want financial stability.

375
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:58.470
Richelle Direny: For not just for you. But for your children or no, I should put it the reverse, not just for your children ultimately for you.

376
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.300
Jasie Crotinger: Right.

377
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:07.980
Richelle Direny: How bad do you want it. And I see it is that then gives you the courage to

378
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:15.990
Richelle Direny: Move forward in and saying, Okay, I'm going to be pro. I'm going to look at what programs are out there.

379
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.810
Richelle Direny: And based on the programs that are out there.

380
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:25.290
Richelle Direny: THEIR SCHEDULE IS IT conducive to the schedule that I have with my children and the work that I do.

381
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:38.280
Richelle Direny: It means that I would have to maybe work on the weekends and have friends and family helped me out with my children. And that's what I will do, because at the end of the day, sometimes we often kind of look at

382
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:51.900
Richelle Direny: Our situation and circumstances right now and not think of it as you know what i can't i will get out of the situation that I'm in this my circumstances is not going to last forever.

383
00:37:52.710 --> 00:38:03.960
Richelle Direny: It is just for time. And once we stop thinking about it. It's our circumstances as a thing that's going on for eternity. And just for a short time.

384
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:14.250
Richelle Direny: I think it will give us a little bit more courage to say, hey, I'm going to do this. It's only let's say it's a six month program six months is going to come and go in no time.

385
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:29.160
Richelle Direny: And in that period of time. You think in six months. My goal in six months. I'm going to be in school. I'll be done with it and at least I will have something lined up. I can work. I can see the light of the end of the tunnel ultimately

386
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:39.990
Richelle Direny: And if you think of it in that aspect. Then you will have a little bit more courage and a little bit more motivation to move forward.

387
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:41.580
Jasie Crotinger: Right.

388
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:53.910
Richelle Direny: If I just think like today, I have no money. So I have to work. I have to go and I have to do this job in the morning, I have to do this job in the evening. If you think like that all the time, you will you will become

389
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.620
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

390
00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:06.630
Jasie Crotinger: That's how I go to my other one I am after I get off with you. I just I can't get any money coming in from the last round money was unique members Arnie February.

391
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:20.340
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I mean, like, it's already had revival had a check from there, like two months. And it's just like a kind of like a pain in the ass because it's like, Come on now, like I gotta have money coming in, you know, I mean,

392
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:26.310
Richelle Direny: It's, it's always becomes like that in. So you like you. You're on their books, but you're not making any money.

393
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.640
Richelle Direny: So yeah, it's thinking, Okay, well, this is not working. This is not lucrative, what is the what, why am I

394
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:38.550
Richelle Direny: Why am I wasting my ultimately being on their books and I'm

395
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.840
Richelle Direny: Not really making any money.

396
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.290
Richelle Direny: So they're looking at what else is out there and the

397
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:53.250
Richelle Direny: Other thing is maybe seeing if you can get a job in a salon as a you know a receptionist or just doing something

398
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.290
Jasie Crotinger: Because if you go back to school.

399
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:02.460
Richelle Direny: Your job is being a stylist or whatever it is that you want to specialize in in that salon.

400
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:10.980
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right, sorry, I didn't hear you there for me I my air pods disconnecting

401
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:19.530
Richelle Direny: Okay, no problem. No, I was saying that maybe another thing that you can look into is trying to see if they're hiring in a salon in your area.

402
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.520
Richelle Direny: On whether, if you're a subsection is or you just wash their hair or whatever it is.

403
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:33.420
Richelle Direny: That if you're only available on the weekend to do that. That's a foot in the door, because then you know your ultimate goal is

404
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:44.550
Richelle Direny: To become a cosmetologist if that's if it's here that you want to do, because I know cosmetology covers all different things. So what does it cosmetology has just here where it's hair. And what else

405
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:51.150
Jasie Crotinger: Or it's just hear me and hear me now okay here now and stuff I'd make up

406
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.280
Jasie Crotinger: Yes. So what specifically

407
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.480
Richelle Direny: Wanted to enter

408
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.830
Or you want to be well rounded

409
00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:57.810
Jasie Crotinger: I'm going to do all of it.

410
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.350
Jasie Crotinger: Okay.

411
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.020
Richelle Direny: So if you work you work in a salon where they have all of it in

412
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:14.760
Richelle Direny: And even if it's you're just washing the hair or you're just doing Miles manicures and pedicures whatever it is that you don't necessarily need a license in but you can work in the salon.

413
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:26.550
Richelle Direny: It's it gives you a foot in the door because you now, you know, my goal is to get license and once I become licensed, then I can move from just washing the

414
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.280
Richelle Direny: Hair. Now I can call him how I can do this. Now, I could do

415
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.520
Jasie Crotinger: That

416
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.520
Jasie Crotinger: At least you've already had something and then you've excited

417
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.910
Richelle Direny: You have established a clientele from working.

418
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.290
Richelle Direny: In the salon. Right.

419
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.730
Richelle Direny: Voluntary your time. So that's kind of how you look at it, because oftentimes

420
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:42.900
Jasie Crotinger: Our circumstances.

421
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:53.880
Richelle Direny: Asleep were in all I do is I look at my circumstance, and I only look at, okay, this job pays me let's say $15 an hour and so

422
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.540
Jasie Crotinger: You know,

423
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.290
Richelle Direny: It's, it's

424
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:59.520
Richelle Direny: It's answering the needs that I have right now and

425
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.570
Jasie Crotinger: Right.

426
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:09.300
Richelle Direny: You can't, you can't see yourself doing anything else there's fear of you moving forward because of the current circumstances that you're in.

427
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:19.380
Richelle Direny: And you fear if I if I take a leap of faith and go do something else. I may lose the little bit of income that I'm getting you understand it's like our minds run wild. Yeah.

428
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:32.970
Richelle Direny: And it is a somewhat stagnant our circumstances. Keep a stagnant. Instead of thinking out of the box and get creative of how can I work towards. Ultimately, my goal of financial stability.

429
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.640
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right.

430
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.500
Richelle Direny: Or just overall stability.

431
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.820
Richelle Direny: For myself and my

432
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.360
Jasie Crotinger: Children.

433
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:50.820
Richelle Direny: When dinner. Oh, yeah. In general, and not having to depend on whether or not your children's Father give you money to help you with the children, but having some degree of independence, because sometimes

434
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.380
Richelle Direny: Even with the relationship with

435
00:42:52.950 --> 00:43:07.290
Richelle Direny: Either one of your kids fathers, if they feel like you have some degree of dependency on them financially with the children, they will. It's almost like you're giving them that room to want to Earth to feel like

436
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:12.330
Jasie Crotinger: They have something to your life they have that right hand or

437
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:20.400
Richelle Direny: You are you you need them. And you're dependent upon them. I mean you personally don't need them. Your children needs them, but you don't need them.

438
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.890
Jasie Crotinger: So you

439
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:30.330
Richelle Direny: You work towards your own independence. Is that what you're saying is I'm independent and I can handle my own

440
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:39.060
Richelle Direny: I don't need you, but your children need you. Your children needs us to work together to help them right

441
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:46.080
Richelle Direny: Just, just so to pretty much raised them and to teach them what is right from wrong or just kind of how to meet independent in life and how to get through life.

442
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:56.610
Richelle Direny: That's what children need but they don't need you feeling like you have the upper hand over me because I need your money to provide something for that you understand

443
00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.020
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and so it's so it's kind of like

444
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:19.200
Richelle Direny: Taking an inventory of your life as it is right now writing down what your goals are, what is it that you, where do you see yourself or where do you. Where would you like to see yourself in six months, and what are the steps you're going to take to get there.

445
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:32.310
Richelle Direny: And just being proactive about that, in fact, gives you some sense of motivation. Once you could once you put it down on paper and you start making those tiny steps towards that goal because I'm telling you, JC

446
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:37.710
Richelle Direny: one foot in front of the other is going to get you to the finish line. It may take you a while.

447
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:38.550
Richelle Direny: But you don't get there.

448
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.190
Richelle Direny: If you keep putting one foot in front of the other.

449
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:50.430
Richelle Direny: But if you stay still, you will never, you will see the finish line. But you'll never get there because hey, you're not moving. So it's just taking those small little steps can

450
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.960
Jasie Crotinger: I do like I procrastinate a lot. And that's really hindered me and a lot of

451
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.510
Jasie Crotinger: Operations. I was always a last minute.

452
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:05.910
Jasie Crotinger: Addition around and then I wonder why I don't have anything to to buy now, and it's just kind of like a pain in the ass. I don't know why.

453
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:20.010
Jasie Crotinger: I really don't. It's like saying, I'm going to have so much to get overwhelmed and I'm just like all that can wait because I got all this going on and I allow people to kind of blocking

454
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:26.100
Jasie Crotinger: from achieving that stuff. Nothing erasing the most. A lot of people like

455
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:40.140
Jasie Crotinger: Like basically Wesley will try to call me like drag it off work right and try to call me. But he said, find out my hours because of him calling me about a Mari and like

456
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:47.460
Jasie Crotinger: He was like when you get off work. I need to talk to you about her son. I'm like, okay, I get off this time, whatever. So now he knows my hours.

457
00:45:48.090 --> 00:46:00.990
Jasie Crotinger: So you try calling me and Jay and then don't try to sit on the phone me when I'm just making the calls. It's like you're blocking me from being able to handle my stuff. But I got work I have to do here. I mean, I had to get to work like

458
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:17.250
Jasie Crotinger: I am to make causes death and same with run he'll stop over here. And then he asked me to entertain him or, you know, do something and it's like they don't understand, like, I have a job. I have to do. I don't get money unless I do my job. Yeah, I mean,

459
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.080
Jasie Crotinger: It kind of does

460
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:20.700
Richelle Direny: So,

461
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:29.400
Richelle Direny: So think of the. Think of someone that is a woman that's very independent

462
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.310
Richelle Direny: And kind of look at the

463
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.810
Jasie Crotinger: The mindset of

464
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:48.300
Richelle Direny: A person that's in them. I'm not talking about over independent and super independent who think that they don't need anybody and likes to get through, like, that's just being over. That's just being ridiculous, but I'm talking about an independent person who sets goals.

465
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:57.420
Richelle Direny: Right. And they work towards those goals and in the reason why I say that because a lot of that comes from

466
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:10.620
Richelle Direny: To be independent means to set very clear boundaries for yourself and for everybody else outside and you're saying it's if you say

467
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:19.710
Richelle Direny: Okay, for instance, let's look at something as small as you want it to me for a session. Right, this is your work schedule.

468
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:28.200
Richelle Direny: So I have to respect the fact that your work schedule is from nine to one from one to five. So then I have to work within

469
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:41.100
Richelle Direny: Your availability. So, then your availability is okay well what about eight morning. I know that I have x amount of time to have this interaction with you that will not infringe upon the

470
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.990
Richelle Direny: Other responsibilities that you have

471
00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.430
Richelle Direny: And so

472
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:51.840
Richelle Direny: The say it's, it's, but you have to voice that to everybody else in your life. This is, this is my availability.

473
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:58.770
Richelle Direny: If you say to any one of your children's father. You want to talk to me about my about our son. Okay.

474
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:03.930
Richelle Direny: Is it an emergency. Well, no. Okay. Well, this is my availability.

475
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.520
Richelle Direny: And you

476
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.060
Jasie Crotinger: Know them.

477
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:12.210
Richelle Direny: Not necessarily the time you work. But when you are available after your work hours if that is it.

478
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:26.010
Richelle Direny: If it's an emergency, then you know okay we're gonna, I'm going to carve out 10 minutes right now and we're going to have that time. So if you have to have a mental time clock going a timer going on. Okay, you have 10 minutes to tell me what's going on.

479
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.590
Richelle Direny: And then after that 10 minutes I have to go.

480
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:42.210
Richelle Direny: You stop and you keep it moving. Because now you're demanding you're you're sending those boundaries. And not only are you setting it you're demanding that respect of a person being respectful of your time and availability.

481
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:53.190
Richelle Direny: We're not saying that you don't want to have the conversation and you don't want to have that interaction. I'm just saying you have to respect my time and my availability.

482
00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.150
Richelle Direny: In terms of

483
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:54.810
Richelle Direny: What it is that

484
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.140
Time.

485
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.920
Jasie Crotinger: Right.

486
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.140
Richelle Direny: So,

487
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.220
Jasie Crotinger: But you

488
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.140
Richelle Direny: Know, based on what you're saying is that, especially your youngest child.

489
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.930
Richelle Direny: He's always going to use

490
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.790
Richelle Direny: The child as leverage

491
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.990
Richelle Direny: To come in and open that line of conversation.

492
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.870
Richelle Direny: And once he gets in there. It's not maybe

493
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.880
Richelle Direny: Five minutes. Our conversation will be

494
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.640
Richelle Direny: But the next 10 to 15 minutes

495
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:28.950
Richelle Direny: Would be about you and him, and how are you guys going to try to work out things and him telling you about his problem.

496
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:32.400
Richelle Direny: And trying to figure out how we can get back in your good grief.

497
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:45.480
Richelle Direny: That's not visible. That's not the purpose of our time together. The purpose of our time together is to only talk about our child and to find out how can we effectively cope parents. That's all we need to talk about

498
00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.000
Richelle Direny: And one of them is

499
00:49:48.750 --> 00:50:01.380
Jasie Crotinger: Is I tried to make the boundaries boundaries down today. Listen, I don't want to mess with you, unless you're divorced and if you're coming back, you're back. I've been. I don't want to do that extra stuff you know me, I don't want to be a side.

500
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:07.140
Jasie Crotinger: A side piece that's not my, my, my, what I want to do, you know, I mean, I don't want to come in.

501
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:15.360
Jasie Crotinger: And ruin a marriage and I made that clear to him, you're having the first time you call it something, how much he loved me and miscellaneous I'm sorry that he was being selfish.

502
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:23.490
Jasie Crotinger: And that he acted like it was bad when it really wasn't. It was just him being selfish and asking how much I was really doing for him and when

503
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:31.200
Jasie Crotinger: You know i mean inside that runs a really big and I was just trying to you know to make a relationship work because he was acting as if it was

504
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:41.550
Jasie Crotinger: Something that wasn't working, you know, I mean, just to justify behavior. So, that time I kind of brushed it off because it was like you were talking about our side. Now you're talking about us. I gotta go. You know, I mean,

505
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:56.910
Jasie Crotinger: Then he kept making reasons to call and so then I'm like, Okay, well then, he then he comes back around with a bunch of fuck with around. Now you're a boy and you'll do whatever the fuck boy, you can do this, this and this thing.

506
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.700
Richelle Direny: But you want to. That's where you end the conversation.

507
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:00.600
Jasie Crotinger: Like

508
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.070
Richelle Direny: It doesn't matter you I am

509
00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:02.970
Richelle Direny: The conversation.

510
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:13.320
Jasie Crotinger: Right, if he can see the difference between a minute relationship that actually something more than that. And I just a little bling relationship that whenever someone's not committed

511
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:23.910
Jasie Crotinger: Then you just don't know what marriage is period because this is a second man cheating, you know, I mean, the second major cheating like wasn't

512
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:31.380
Jasie Crotinger: Anywhere in the same sense. I don't even if he didn't leave her. I don't even think I wouldn't give them the time of day because I was like

513
00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:37.050
Jasie Crotinger: Why wasn't that managers are for me, you know, I mean, and I don't understand, like,

514
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.750
Jasie Crotinger: We were together for years and years and years. And we were

515
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:47.160
Jasie Crotinger: So what was the lighting bank me to be with you so many times. Like, why wasn't I the person that you would on that would, you know, I mean,

516
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.780
Richelle Direny: In a businessman. He

517
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:58.560
Jasie Crotinger: Says, Well, I would have married you. But you said you didn't want to married get married to me. So no, I just didn't want a marriage. My name only seen it at the piece of paper. So that's on you if you took that away from that.

518
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:06.840
Jasie Crotinger: Because, you know, it's, that's how you treat it, you know, I mean that's on you because you're assuming I'm talking about you because that's actually how you feel about a marriage.

519
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:13.560
Jasie Crotinger: The only comment I ever made was saying, I don't want to be married to somebody that makes it seem like it's just the paper here. I mean,

520
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:28.140
Jasie Crotinger: I probably wouldn't marry him just because of the fact I did. Is it the tear, but it doesn't matter, marriage is not holding me. And down here. You know, like that's what she thought it was going to do. But

521
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.740
Jasie Crotinger: That's beside the point. My point is just that.

522
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:34.770
Jasie Crotinger: Like I said, it's just I feel like

523
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:41.220
Jasie Crotinger: Like if he really, you know, was telling the truth. You would find a way bag. You know, I mean,

524
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.490
Jasie Crotinger: I tend to wait for nobody like that.

525
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.050
Jasie Crotinger: Nigel. I would take him out though.

526
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.010
Jasie Crotinger: I don't think I would

527
00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.700
Richelle Direny: Eat into it. Yeah. And that I'm in. And that whole situation is like a whole

528
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.410
Richelle Direny: Session by itself in terms of addressing your own thought process in

529
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:09.570
Richelle Direny: Right, if a person divorces their spouse to come to you. It's the processing. Well, what needs to the same meaning to you and kind of dig a little bit deeper in understanding that whole concept of you're going to

530
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.210
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I mean,

531
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:20.130
Jasie Crotinger: First of all, there together in a relationship, and then he got with her and he married her. And then for him to try and save and now we're not doing that, you're not coming back.

532
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:26.700
Jasie Crotinger: Because in my mind. It's like you're on the first time I'm not gonna, I'm not going to forgive you for everything you did.

533
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:37.140
Jasie Crotinger: The live the sheet. You put me through the body you marry her behind my back. You know, I mean, and the fact that, and I had to be the bigger person on this whole situation. I just let my son go down there, even after the fact.

534
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:48.270
Jasie Crotinger: You know, so anyway, and then Maria has nothing to do with that is where they should have the father is more important than my, you know, the meat, or in some type of way and trying to use them at the part I don't use my kids.

535
00:53:49.410 --> 00:54:04.560
Jasie Crotinger: That's the, I mean, now if I've ever taught my kids, the way it's been for their safety or because I felt like it wasn't a good space for them to be in with their fathers in the situations, they were in at the time that I've never used them as as like empire, so

536
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:15.390
Jasie Crotinger: You know, I've always had a I mean, being a bigger person that situation. And it's like, I really don't think I ever would forgive him for all that you did to see dreaming like shit.

537
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:25.020
Jasie Crotinger: Then to turn around to you. You're doing all this shape for her and her kids and you like, when are you basically raise my kids like this. I see like

538
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.370
Jasie Crotinger: Mean, he was it there the whole time but well yeah actually was from the time I had asked when

539
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:45.780
Jasie Crotinger: All the way up to me on in a minute. So he basically did raise my kids when when me and around more together. He was there. If I trained him all that, you know, I mean, if anything, you should be treating my kids like they're your kids, you know, I mean, and you never day

540
00:54:46.530 --> 00:55:00.930
Jasie Crotinger: And I brought that up to him yesterday, like you never bought them for their birthday. You never done, none of that shit and butter and do for the next bunch of kids. I don't get that. Like, just stop trying to make something like, oh, I owe you. I owe you nothing.

541
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:10.440
Jasie Crotinger: I don't owe you anything. I don't know you any explanation for why, that's why I'm around my other ways that don't owe you nothing. I owe you the time day. I mean, anything you

542
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.220
Richelle Direny: Mean

543
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:19.080
Jasie Crotinger: An explanation, right, if I can do it today and you know me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know, we forgive me. But, but whatever. And that should be

544
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:26.430
Jasie Crotinger: You shouldn't be trying to force me to forgive you quickly and come down there and see, you're not. And we're not doing all that

545
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:43.890
Richelle Direny: But, um, I would definitely like I said just continue working on those boundaries with him and and set the boundary in and I keep saying boundaries because it seems like

546
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.800
Jasie Crotinger: You know, yeah.

547
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:53.100
Richelle Direny: He doesn't know them and but but then it's he doesn't know them. But then it's you also

548
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:57.600
Richelle Direny: setting them and making it. Yes. You're not making it very clear for him.

549
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:08.340
Richelle Direny: I'm you shouldn't be you're married. Whatever I do with my life and whomever I do it with. It's none of your business or your concern and we should not be having this back and forth conversation about that.

550
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:17.460
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, right. And he drives a usama taker son away from me because he knows you know I mean a marine marine play when it comes to my kids all my

551
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:23.760
Jasie Crotinger: Undergrad that you know that right with my other one. So mine is only one I've ever had. That's right. He knows I don't play it on it.

552
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:36.690
Jasie Crotinger: So you're starting to take my son and threaten to do stupid Shane. And it's like, Why are you trying to to involve our son in your petty shit like I just don't get it.

553
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:45.660
Jasie Crotinger: Right. He doesn't need to have boundaries and I think I'm gonna make that clear because I just, I can do it around. I refuse to go back to that bullshit again.

554
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:47.160
Jasie Crotinger: Or

555
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.780
Richelle Direny: You leave yourself open you leave yourself open to be hurt.

556
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:58.650
Richelle Direny: Use leave yourself, you know, really questioning what is it that you really want for your life. And like you said.

557
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.140
Richelle Direny: It's for creating a distraction for you to set

558
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.900
Richelle Direny: Your own personal goals to what it is that you want to do.

559
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:05.790
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right.

560
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:07.740
Richelle Direny: So, so

561
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.450
