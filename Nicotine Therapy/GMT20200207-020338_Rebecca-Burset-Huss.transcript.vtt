00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.400
bonnie: Hello. Sorry about that.

2
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay, how are you

3
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.860
bonnie: I'm okay. We're having a little, uh, hopefully I may not, I may have to depending on how things go jump off, we're having an infant.

4
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.820
bonnie: Kind of illness emergency so yeah

5
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.850
bonnie: Hopefully, everything's okay he's just really coughing a lot and not wanting fluids. So we're just trying to figure out what to do in the meantime, but

6
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:28.650
bonnie: We're going to see how things go. And then I definitely said, if anything, if we end up having to go to the doctor or the ER. Well, the doctors and an option, but that they'll come get me. If it seems like he's has a my husband's going to check his fever and all that good stuff.

7
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

8
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you, do you want to go and just reschedule for next week and take care of the baby.

9
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:49.920
bonnie: Oh, it's okay. Let's see how he responds, my husband's just got home, so he's gonna bring him in and just try to give him some more milk and see if he'll take that and kind of, I don't know if he's just aggravated also because he's in the car and he's not feeling well.

10
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.040
bonnie: So we're I think it's okay to play it by ear and see how he goes and then if I have to jump off all and a little early.

11
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that's fine, that's fine, either. Which way.

12
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you no

13
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, don't you worry about it.

14
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, babies come first, they are. Yeah.

15
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:23.580
bonnie: Yeah, our other one was just getting over being sick and now the other one that sounds like is having a hard time so yeah well one has it then. Luckily, I've been okay I thought I was going to get sick, the other day, but I've kind of bypass it, I think. So, so far it's been okay

16
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It goes around

17
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's for sure.

18
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.500
bonnie: Yeah, that's for sure. So um can I, can I just my husband's calling me. Can I just yeah can and then

19
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.100
Sorry. Yep.

20
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.660
bonnie: Hello.

21
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.050
bonnie: Hello.

22
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.800
bonnie: Hello.

23
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.740
bonnie: That's what I thought I saw he called me by accident.

24
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.090
And I think that's what happened.

25
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

26
00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:02.430
bonnie: Just want to make sure it wasn't an emergency, although he can knock on our door. Um, yeah. Thanks again. Okay. Otherwise, I'm

27
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:14.850
bonnie: A LITTLE ROUGH. This week I think emotional regulation wise, just because my husband and I have been having just some difficulties with parenting, you know, and different parenting styles.

28
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:27.210
bonnie: Just, I realized to, like, you know, certainly certain dynamics, like I've been thinking, well, first of all, I want to tell you things that worked this week, so definitely the stop sign. There were two moments when

29
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.620
bonnie: I was having I haven't had too much physical anxiety recently over like bodily things because I feel like I think when I stay on track with like my eating goals.

30
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:55.230
bonnie: You know, keeping like everything kind of keeping my own bat like boundaries around like you know not over eating, not having too much alcohol exercising like keeping everything on track. Then I have it I feel more confident that the Nothing's wrong. Like, I'm okay.

31
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

32
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.160
bonnie: So there were only two times I noticed some anxiety coming up and I did the read the stop sign and that worked really well. That was really effective and just

33
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:15.000
bonnie: You know visually seeing the stop sign, in my mind, and just saying we can't go here and I was able to kind of, and it wasn't SeVEre. SeVEre. Like, I wasn't in a full

34
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:31.260
bonnie: Tumble so maybe that helped her that was easier, but it did help me. I was able to kind of pull it back, and then I have been trying to make more time I remembered after we talked. I have a mindfulness app and I downloaded a bunch of

35
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.730
bonnie: Kind of guided meditations, a while ago and I just haven't really been listening to it or using it. And so I've been trying to do that at night.

36
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.220
bonnie: When I can remember just even short ones. And I think that's helped a bit, just in just creating that space and kind of that. Pause

37
00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:02.850
bonnie: Because where I feel like I still have, you know, emotion brain issues is I realized like, sometimes, you know, and naturally I think my partner and I we trigger each other's childhood stuff sometimes and

38
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.720
bonnie: There are certain things I'm sensitive to that I realized that

39
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:16.200
bonnie: And you know that I just start reacting. I just start yelling back or I start saying things. I don't want to be saying, you know, and I, I know all the things I shouldn't be doing.

40
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:25.260
bonnie: You know, or like I know that's a time like that. I thought I kept thinking of what you were saying last time about totaling up and how I have a really hard time doing that in the moment.

41
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:35.250
bonnie: And I was able to kind of think about it a lot. This weekend because we kind of had a hard time on Sunday, and then we a few other spots. This week, and I realized that

42
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:48.570
bonnie: I think I still have some trauma responses to, you know, I think I mentioned how my dad was he was never physically abusive, but he was emotionally. I would say abusive in terms of like, you know, his anger like

43
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:58.230
bonnie: He would yeah you know his yelling would be just out of control. And he just would, it would be independent of this location. You know, we could be in public. We could be, you know,

44
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.120
bonnie: Right. It just was really

45
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.030
bonnie: Unsettling and I think

46
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.070
bonnie: I think a few things like because I noticed that I have kind of two responses I either kind of immediately go into

47
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:19.080
bonnie: Kind of attack mode and fight. I was thinking fight, flight, or freeze, you know, and I noticed I tend to go into like fight mode, very quickly.

48
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:28.020
bonnie: And I think part of that was because like when I was growing up, my mother was very passive and she never challenged. My dad and I now looking back, I realized I think

49
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:40.620
bonnie: You know she was trying not to escalate the situation. But to me, it kind of looked like she wasn't standing up for me or wasn't like, you know, like he's clearly out of control like somebody like he's like

50
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.220
bonnie: But it's still something you're the adult. So, you know, like, and

51
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.750
bonnie: As an adult with kids and I understand, like, so I'm really sensitive to, you know, for example, like if

52
00:06:51.750 --> 00:07:00.780
bonnie: Yelling happens you know i'm very quick to like attack and, you know, like I just, it's like that filter disappears between thinking, you know, the

53
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:12.990
bonnie: Thinking about what I'm saying. And then we kind of my husband and I both kind of tend to then I attacked and he's attacked and I attacked and we're just saying things that aren't helpful and

54
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.590
Yeah.

55
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.010
bonnie: And it's really frustrating. I think kids definitely add another layer to the level of stress and

56
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:39.180
bonnie: Kind of just bringing into, you know, I'm so much more sensitive to not doing what my parents did in terms of parenting and I'm just so like aware of it, almost. I feel like to you know where I'm just like, you know, it makes. I'm very sensitized to it. I guess is what I'm trying to say. And

57
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:47.550
bonnie: Even how we interact as a couple. Like, because I know how it should be. Yeah. And I know when not falling short. And when he's falling short and

58
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:58.950
bonnie: And so, um, it's just tough like my I know situ. I know I'm not making situations better when I'm reactive and I have a really hard time and I think

59
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:07.350
bonnie: anger toward my dad is coming out. I think that is what I mean. And I know it after the fact, like, you know, because I'll tend to go into

60
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.650
bonnie: Reactive, you know, kind of attacking you know i'll say things. I don't mean I'll yell or whatever and then

61
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:22.350
bonnie: I go immediately into kind of a state of like helpless hopeless where I'm like this will never get better. Like, I don't know, you know and and and

62
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:37.710
bonnie: I it's both states are really uncomfortable and unpleasant to be in. And you know, I just like I realized that my own reactivity doesn't help the situation, it just kind of amplifies, you know, it just ends up ratcheting up

63
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

64
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what happens when

65
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You go into war, you're pulling

66
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can go

67
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.740
bonnie: Yeah, exactly.

68
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:57.960
bonnie: And I can see it, but I can't stop it. And that's where I realized like, I could probably use some tools there, you know, just in my own reactivity. I mean, it's kind of like very similar to

69
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:10.950
bonnie: In the sense. Like when my anxiety really takes over and I haven't stopped it or challenged it in time, you know, and it's no balls. It just really becomes like you know uncontrollable or feels very

70
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Controllable

71
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:21.630
bonnie: And it's kind of like the same thing. Like, I, I, I am not I wouldn't say quick to anger, but like if my buttons are pressed. I think I can.

72
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.970
bonnie: You know,

73
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.730
bonnie: React a certain way.

74
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the idea is to change those buttons.

75
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. And really, you can actually utilize your stop sign in this scenario as well.

76
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.440
bonnie: Okay.

77
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you start feeling, you know that defensiveness coming up.

78
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And feel the anger coming up and the frustration and you want to respond.

79
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

80
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not response. It's reaction.

81
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.330
bonnie: You want to

82
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To react, you know, ask yourself, what do you want to get out of this.

83
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, basic question, what is it I want to get out of this, what direction do I want this to go to war or, you know, do I want to resolution.

84
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.540
bonnie: Yeah.

85
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and really kind of again turtle up and ask yourself those questions.

86
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And pay attention when they're first starting to bubble and they're very big. Yeah.

87
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't wait until they get to the

88
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Point where

89
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're on the attack mode or on the defense mode in it.

90
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.410
Yeah.

91
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think.

92
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.410
bonnie: Mm hmm.

93
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, going to be happier. Do you want to be right.

94
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:47.580
bonnie: Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I do. I think where it's especially tough for me is like, you know, having kind of the education and the background and knowledge. I feel like I do have a knowledge of what's right.

95
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.090
bonnie: And that can be kind of tricky. That's kind of like mo like I know how things should it be going

96
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.280
bonnie: And but it's not all, it's not exactly helpful, especially because like if I do have anything useful to say

97
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.930
bonnie: Definitely. He's not hearing me in that moment, for sure.

98
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.010
bonnie: Know,

99
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.470
bonnie: The minute that the walls are up and the defenses are up there.

100
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either side is not hearing anything, you know,

101
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's a piece of it and you know you have to know that above everything else you're human.

102
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you're a person

103
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, we still need tools to

104
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.880
bonnie: We need to learn how to react or respond. You know what I mean. Yeah.

105
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.720
bonnie: Yeah.

106
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't matter what

107
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What myself. Yeah, I think I judge myself pretty harshly for that like when I think about, you know, things I tell clients and like do

108
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do. I kind of keep on more like self criticism I think around it.

109
00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:04.830
bonnie: You know, especially because I see myself not choosing the right you know or not the right but the more optimal path and it's just kind of like all that stuff goes out the window when my emotion brain is like activated. It's like there's no logic. It's just like

110
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:16.260
bonnie: Reacting before that, I think the hardest part. And all of this and with anxiety to or all of it. I think around the motion brain is even getting that pause in there.

111
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:32.460
bonnie: To like even stop and think about it. And I guess that's what you're saying about the stop signs like just even getting that moment in there to even think about what's going on, rather than just like responding is is really tough for me.

112
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's, it's tough for a lot of people, you know, and it was tough for me for a long time to and every once in a while it's still tough.

113
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.920
bonnie: You know, to

114
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To stop and breathe and you know really ask yourself, what do you want to get out of us right now we want to go to war.

115
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you want a resolution, you know, and what does that really look like

116
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, be able to stop for a second.

117
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And ask yourself those questions and helps you and gives you the time to re evaluate your side of things and how can you, how can you present it in a manner that he's going to hear

118
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:21.600
bonnie: Yeah, and that's the tough part two, because like sometimes like I think I'm just, it's just occurring to me now as I'm kind of thinking about things like

119
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:32.670
bonnie: That moment is not the time to even do it like, there can be no resolution, I think in a moment where he's hijacked I'm hijacked kind of by, you know, the emotion brain it's like

120
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:40.890
bonnie: There's no, you know, I try to have instant resolution and in those moments like really, I think,

121
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.620
bonnie: The only thing that can be done is taking a break or taking space or de escalating or just making

122
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:59.100
bonnie: You know, we're trying to work together on like fair fighting rules I printed some things out to talk about and like you know just how we can kind of maybe work on some of those things and just at least have some ground rules.

123
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:12.390
bonnie: And I think that's one of them is like we can't talk about anything when we're already activated. It's just not there's, it's not, you know, and I have noticed, like the times that

124
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:23.790
bonnie: Because I do think, you know, like my dad coins and like me okay like me to, you know, he has some emotional dysregulation issues. You know, I think it

125
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.420
bonnie: Is hard, you know, and maybe we both grew up that way, I guess.

126
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:35.310
bonnie: in similar ways we definitely have some common ground and some of our life experience. So it makes sense, but

127
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:52.620
bonnie: You know, I think the hard part is like, you know, I do know that the times I'm able to hold my ground and stay calm. It's the hardest thing for me when I'm feeling a lot of reactions inside and I'm just kind of white knuckling it and just holding my ground trying to stay calm.

128
00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:10.500
bonnie: I do notice that even though it's really, really hard for me really hard and it makes me feel really hurt and really angry inside to do that when I am able to not react. I have noticed it does kind of come a lot of things down like

129
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.570
bonnie: The calming is kind of contagious. It does kind of, you know, like, help him.

130
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:22.650
bonnie: De escalate to because you know there's no reaction. There's no kind of there's no we're not having any

131
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:31.260
bonnie: Yeah, it doesn't escalate it kind of peters out you know there's a more calming influence and you know I think maybe one thing I feel

132
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:42.360
bonnie: If I don't, I think there's a part of me. It's funny. I'm just realizing this now. I think there's a part of me that feels like if I don't respond. I'm not standing up for myself.

133
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.060
bonnie: And that really bothers me.

134
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.470
bonnie: Well,

135
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

136
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.330
bonnie: I'm not taking shit now. I took it. You know, it's like

137
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you also think about what you just said about your mom to when she

138
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Didn't respond and you know you felt like you weren't being protected.

139
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.900
bonnie: Yeah, only

140
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's a direct connection on why you think it's so important for you to give that instantaneous

141
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know yeah reaction. It's a reaction. It's not a

142
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: response, the response is

143
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.260
bonnie: Writing thought through.

144
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.030
bonnie: Right, right.

145
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so there's that. There's that connection to

146
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your parents, but again, really telling yourself. I need to do this different

147
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.550
bonnie: I need to do. Yeah, but then

148
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My parents did I want the outcome that I want is not a war or a fight.

149
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I'm hurt right now or

150
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm afraid right now. And so, you know, and really even voicing that

151
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.920
bonnie: At that now.

152
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just saying, look, I'm, I'm really starting to get to feel my emotions stirring and I need to step back for a few minutes.

153
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:56.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take a few breaths and come back out this later tonight, you know, let's let's stop this right now and let's come back in an hour and

154
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and discuss it for a resolution and not engaged in the warfare, because that just a lot of things when things are said they can't be taken back.

155
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:15.960
bonnie: I know, I know. And I even violently. You know, I have certain rules like, you know, LET ME BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED ON THIS LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE THESE ISSUES weren't

156
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.000
bonnie: Present when we in the beginning of our relationship and but we did do some work on them and like

157
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:30.240
bonnie: You know certain things like you know we first met, you know, we would say that, you know, say things like, you know, bring up divorce or things like just as a threat, you know, or something.

158
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.890
bonnie: And things like that, you know, we talked about how hurtful. That like we've kind of, you know,

159
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:46.320
bonnie: Eliminated things that are sensitive to each other like cursing or, or, you know, things that are inflammatory right things that are very hurtful and that you can't take back in, or just not you know

160
00:17:46.710 --> 00:18:01.950
bonnie: Useful and and they're not true. They're not things that were intending to say or do you know so you know am, but I think with kids. It's just really, you know, you kind of some of the groundwork. I feel like you regress a little bit, just because

161
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:07.320
bonnie: There's, it's so hard to have that time you're being more triggered with kids. I think it's

162
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:14.670
bonnie: Like, I don't think I was really prepared for that. To tell you the truth. Like, I thought I had done so much work on myself.

163
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:23.280
bonnie: And you know, we had done a lot of work together, just in terms of like I felt we had a good we kind of work through some of these things. I felt like we had good communication.

164
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:31.050
bonnie: Not perfect, but, you know, definitely. I felt, you know, and then like kids just just like pouring gasoline like

165
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:49.770
bonnie: You know, it just, it brought up so much stuff from my past and just this you know I'm so triggered because I'm like constantly kind of judging my parenting and feeling like, yeah, I don't want to be. I want to be much better, not just a little better.

166
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.690
bonnie: Than the parents I, you know, and they meant well i'm not saying anything bad. I mean, they did the best they

167
00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:06.330
bonnie: Could obviously but you know I'm just like, I want to do things much more conscious way and like model and I'm so disappointed. I think there's like this double thing going on. Like when

168
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:16.500
bonnie: I'm both, you know, of course I'm upset because, you know, we say things you can't take back or, you know, it's just not the way I want to be relating but then also on top of that. I'm like,

169
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:27.450
bonnie: You know, then I feel bad about myself for like not modeling good behavior. You know, like I don't want my kids to feel the way I did with my parents arguing all the time like

170
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.450
bonnie: Yeah. And then that just makes me feel worse.

171
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.000
bonnie: No. And so it's like it's tough, you know, and

172
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:47.220
bonnie: Yeah, it brings it just having kids brought up a lot of my childhood in a different way. Every like I thought I had dealt with it as a single person I had dealt with it.

173
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:56.550
bonnie: And I dealt with a lot of my feelings and I definitely did do that work. But having kids just kind of brings it up in a different way because

174
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:04.230
bonnie: You know, I think in my own therapy when I was young adult. It was like I was processing feeling like the victim, you know,

175
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:17.790
bonnie: And now it's like, well, I'm not the victim out and I'm also want to place a responsibility to do something different. So it's a different it triggers me differently than it used to.

176
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.180
Sure.

177
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure. And you know again knowing

178
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you get to that place or when you see that plays coming you know be

179
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To stand back and say,

180
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, stop it. What do I want from this right now. You know, do I want to battle or do I want things to you know be okay and communicate

181
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:40.860
Yeah.

182
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a piece of effective communication is just stepping back in it and you know statements like you always and you never and

183
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know all about us. You got to take the you out of it and say, I feel

184
00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, this is what where I'm at with this and when you're heated and you're acting out of that frustration and anger PS. It's almost like all of that is just like sitting back here and not. Yeah.

185
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:20.520
bonnie: Well, I think what frustrates me like where I get especially triggered is I feel like I I typically do a good job of saying like how, like, I feel using I statements, you know, using some of the things I've learned

186
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:31.500
bonnie: But where I get really triggered is you know when I'm hearing you you you are like he's not using it. I'm like, Why the hell should I then I just kind of lose and like, you know, like I said,

187
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:41.730
bonnie: It's like, why should I be trying to communicate in a different way, you know, or and that's not obviously the best way to think about it and

188
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:55.590
bonnie: Certainly, my husband doesn't have all the therapy experience and like learning about all these things that I have. So I understand that works sometimes coming from two different you know perspectives. You know, like I have a lot of

189
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:11.460
bonnie: Kind of, you know, benefit of information that you know I try to share with them and we just have to he's just not as practiced at knowing about it as I. Amen. But it doesn't mean I can always do it because definitely when he's not doing it. Then I feel like I shouldn't have to do it again.

190
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.000
bonnie: Which isn't helpful. I mean, bottom line is it effective or not effective. It's not effective and

191
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.140
bonnie: I think it helps to I do help. I think it helps to think of

192
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:29.700
bonnie: Like when I think about things I've told done and couples work is like, or things that concepts. I've come across as like

193
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:38.670
bonnie: You know, is it effective I think to me that really helped me get out of like the right or wrong is like it doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong.

194
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:51.270
bonnie: It's not effective. It's just not effective, you know, and the goal is, like you said, What do I want from this you know I want effective communication and how can I best get it and

195
00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:07.080
bonnie: You know, it is hard to throw, especially the right or wrong, out of the picture when he reveals like you know it's Rehman, you know, certainly the triggers are familiar to me from when I was younger, like some of the like criticism is a big one for me or

196
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.460
bonnie: You know, feeling like someone is avoiding responsibility is a big, big one for me.

197
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.200
bonnie: So this would be certain hot buttons are definitely things. My dad did and

198
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:27.180
bonnie: So like you know it's it's hard and it's hard because it's such a knee jerk reaction and then

199
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:38.580
bonnie: You know, but I definitely hear that piece around just even just just inserting that stop sign and and what do I want from this and just realizing that

200
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:48.060
bonnie: There's never, I think it's helpful for me to remember there's never a time to discuss it. When we're activated. I just know from experience, we're not able to do that at this point.

201
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:57.120
bonnie: And so there's nothing. You know, I didn't. I think naming yeah and naming it helps it's I think it's it'll

202
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:09.420
bonnie: It's very hard for me to hold that feeling when I feel so distressed and so sad and angry, but I can't do anything about it. And that moment that feels, you know, and getting over the part that

203
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.360
bonnie: That's not like

204
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:31.500
bonnie: Like I am still standing up for myself like getting over that piece because I think there is still a lot of hurt there that I felt like, you know, like, you know, I would never live someone talk to my kids, the way that my father used to talk to me. I just cannot. I like I refuse.

205
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:39.210
bonnie: I will leave over something like you know if that were, you know, chronic. I know.

206
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:51.780
bonnie: So it is it is a hot button for me. And so, like, you know, it's really hard for me to feel like I'm not, but I have to remember, that's not the same as fighting

207
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.350
bonnie: You know, fighting is not standing up for myself, either.

208
00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:06.720
bonnie: Actually, you know, and maybe it's kind of just, I need to just kind of think of it from a different angles actually standing up for myself is seeking effective communication.

209
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:19.800
bonnie: Yeah, and and stopping in the moment that is standing up for myself at or, you know, thinking through the situation. I mean, I know it doesn't help to have two people modeling what you shouldn't do in this situation so

210
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:29.100
bonnie: And that's why when there's one person that's not engaging in that role when you sit back and you stop engaging in that and identify it.

211
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It then allows the other person to get off that defense to

212
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:33.960
bonnie: Right.

213
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. You know what I mean. Because when you go into war you go into an argument. It's like both people are in that defense mode.

214
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.030
bonnie: Find out like

215
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to fight. I'm going to fight.

216
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I need to be heard.

217
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need you to understand coming from

218
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In reality, you know, they, the other side. They don't hear

219
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.540
bonnie: What you're known

220
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They hear you know that they're not perfect.

221
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.030
bonnie: They don't do anything right and

222
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

223
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that doesn't work either.

224
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

225
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.210
bonnie: So right it is about stepping back

226
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and thinking things through before it comes out of your mouth.

227
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and and again asking yourself, what do I want out of this.

228
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.260
Yeah.

229
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What outcome. Do I want

230
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I want a resolution, I want to find the solution for those. I don't

231
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be in a war and put more cracks in in a solid foundation. I want it.

232
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

233
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want to be able to work together.

234
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know, and then taking a look at the piece that says, what's my part.

235
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.890
bonnie: Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

236
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I do differently.

237
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. You know, and it doesn't regardless. You know what the other person is doing really

238
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have no control over him, you have to

239
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Drive, you

240
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

241
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so just acting in in a manner that helps you get to their resolve.

242
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the solution at the end and war.

243
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just doesn't do it you know

244
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just doesn't do it.

245
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.630
Yeah.

246
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, they're going to be things that are said that you got to just like

247
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bite your tongue and

248
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.900
Yeah.

249
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.720
bonnie: It's the biting the tongue. That's been our part. Yeah, exactly. Or, you know,

250
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, but that's really, you know, a sort of communication.

251
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, passive aggressive doesn't work. Aggressive doesn't work, you know,

252
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.080
bonnie: Right, you know,

253
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again asking those questions to yourself, what do I want to get out of this.

254
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.820
bonnie: Right. Because when I think about, like, yeah, definitely, like when I you know people I

255
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:42.090
bonnie: Really am so impressed by even like like when I think of my supervisor or people like you know that

256
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:51.570
bonnie: In the therapy sphere. When I just see people and I picture. You seem very like this to like just very grounded. Like I picture that

257
00:27:52.050 --> 00:28:00.480
bonnie: I can just tell that you know i i wonder I want to be more grounded. You know, like, in general, and also just like you know

258
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:10.650
bonnie: I don't want to be as reactive in general, even you know like we talked to even. I mean, luckily, everything's going well with my clients so far and

259
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:24.210
bonnie: But even like just even when I worry if worries come up about them for some reason or another, like I still want to be able to be grounded and not have it, like, you know, just in all parts of my life I have things not

260
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:31.350
bonnie: Sometimes I do feel like a fear that, you know, emotions are just going to overtake me you know like sometimes

261
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.540
bonnie: Like it, you know, and

262
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:48.030
bonnie: I'm better than I used to be in terms of kind of like feeling my feelings and like as they come up. And like, Oh, I'll still journal sometimes or, you know, I have things that you know it works, and certainly like slowing down and like

263
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.080
bonnie: You know, being kind to myself, you know, I feel like I have some tools, but

264
00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:07.590
bonnie: You know, I still I'm still more reactive than I want I'm still an emotion brain more than I wanted it sometimes and I always envy that like when I see people that seem to just be more grounded that just in terms of

265
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.660
bonnie: You know, like

266
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:18.390
bonnie: seems like no matter what someone would throw at them. They'd be mostly fine, you know, or something like that. I don't know how to explain it, but like

267
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:29.070
bonnie: Just like not not like not human, but like, but just grounded. You know, like that they can handle things, you know, like I want that. And sometimes I feel like

268
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:37.950
bonnie: You know, even like with my health scare with like, you know, the biopsy. I mean, I'm sure what it's natural for everyone to have I, you know,

269
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:50.040
bonnie: No matter how grounded. You are. I mean, I imagine most people would have some response to that, but like, you know, my responses can just feel so extreme. You know, like I feel

270
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:58.050
bonnie: Like I just and just over little things. I just want to be more less reactive in general. Right.

271
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:07.770
bonnie: And even, like, yeah, I guess that's what I'm getting at in the room is sometimes, you know, like, yeah, when suicidality came up I become immediately reactive and like you know

272
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:14.430
bonnie: And I want to be able to step back, even in that moments like that and kind of have enough grounding to kind of think through

273
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:25.860
bonnie: The situation and kind of process it, you know, and obviously it's not perfect, but I mean, I don't know, just in different aspects, I want to be the cool ahead and the situation.

274
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I can tell you that I do a lot of totaling

275
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do a lot of reflection. I do a lot of asking myself what I want to get out of this. Do I really want to go into war is this really worth the cost

276
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.460
bonnie: Really, yeah.

277
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and just really focus inward for a little bit.

278
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I work on calm myself down. I work on looking at things, logically,

279
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and really dissecting the emotions behind it, because sometimes we can react with emotions that aren't appropriate for the situation.

280
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, you know, and it took a long time. You know, I can tell you, you know, I can tell you that

281
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there are several times when I didn't do it perfectly, and you know we're all works in progress.

282
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.620
bonnie: Yeah yeah

283
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's about learning how to deal with things differently, but that for me is the big one. What do I want to get out of us to I want to fight with them or do I want a resolution because I want to be happy. I don't want to be full of ads.

284
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.330
bonnie: Ever began to

285
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be mad at him all the time. I want to

286
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I want to figure out, you know, what makes you know makes me happy.

287
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and how can we meet in the middle. You know, what does that really look like

288
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:47.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that helps you know and then if I can't control my emotions. I will go sit and cry.

289
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.210
bonnie: Now,

290
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will go to someplace for me.

291
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah patio go take a hot bath, whatever it is, and have that time for me to be able to release.

292
00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and come back down.

293
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.230
bonnie: Yeah yeah

294
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely being in that that fight or flight mode.

295
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:13.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, like this. The. It just doesn't it just the outcome. It doesn't isn't good.

296
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not now what

297
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. Um, and understanding that and knowing that identifying that within yourself when it's going on. I know what's happening. I, you know, I'm afraid, right now.

298
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.250
bonnie: I'm hurt.

299
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right now, and

300
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's just how he feels or just what he's doing.

301
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:33.990
bonnie: And

302
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How can I appropriately, you know, stand up for myself.

303
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a manner that he's going to hear

304
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's, you know, that's really it. And so, for the most part, I can be grounded. But I can tell you that I can still have struggles

305
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know to do it because it's something that takes

306
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.380
bonnie: A lot of practice. Yeah, yeah.

307
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then listening to

308
00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.530
bonnie: The music. Yeah.

309
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.660
bonnie: Mm hmm.

310
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.770
bonnie: I mean, yeah.

311
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:08.640
bonnie: Yeah, no. That makes sense. Like, and I think, you know, I realize to like

312
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:20.820
bonnie: It is a lot about practice like the more you kind of let yourself like slide back into old behaviors and like you keep doing that, then you know the more

313
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:29.070
bonnie: You know what, the more you get away from practicing it, the more easy it is to kind of slip into just unconscious behaviors, you know, it really does.

314
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.830
bonnie: Take a lot of vigilance and practice to kind of

315
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:40.680
bonnie: Before it starts becoming your default, I think, and I don't think I've ever gotten to that place, at least not with my partner. I feel like I've done better in life with other people.

316
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:41.820
But

317
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:48.180
bonnie: I, you know, it's still not become my default in, you know,

318
00:33:49.020 --> 00:34:01.530
bonnie: My most personal relationships, you know, to kind of approach it from that place. You know, it's obviously easier to do with coworkers or people where you're not as charged or they're not trigger you maybe to the same level.

319
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:08.220
bonnie: You know, and I think to like was I just going to say there was something he said that made me think of something else too.

320
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:20.250
bonnie: Oh yeah, and just, I wish I had a, you know, it's, I guess part of practicing is developing like a thicker skin like sometimes I'm just so sensitive

321
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:28.680
bonnie: To the feelings of others, like it's very hard for me to kind of stay in my bubble, like let's say I'm having a really good day.

322
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:36.150
bonnie: And then I come home and for whatever reason like he's not in a good mood or he stressed about something like I totally take it on.

323
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:45.780
bonnie: It like totally changes my mood and like I wish I was better sometimes about just the emotional like the boundaries. I have to kind of be like okay

324
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:56.130
bonnie: That's where he is, and I'm still where I am. And you know I had a good day or you know whatever you know I want to have a good day, or I have, you know, just trying to

325
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:05.340
bonnie: Team with clients like you know I'm thinking of this because I've just been i a friend of mine from my program I

326
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:19.170
bonnie: She was interested in maybe working for my same supervisor and her private practice. And so I was describing her and just how I work with her and she's just a different personality wise and some of the supervisors. I've had in the past and

327
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.240
bonnie: One thing.

328
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:31.290
bonnie: Retreats thought again. What was it, okay. So the one thing I have to go backwards. Let's see. Sorry, I got distracted.

329
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.490
bonnie: No, I was list I mommy.

330
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.760
bonnie: Year I was listening for things in the house, um,

331
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:48.720
bonnie: No, but I was, what was it about my supervisor. Oh, just about because one issue that came up and I think it relates to this is like

332
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.820
bonnie: Kind of how you know I was kind of being missing things with clients because

333
00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:03.900
bonnie: You know, I was thinking they were opening up and that we were developing rapport and that that meant something good was happening, but yet I would find out these things like either they were going to drop out of therapy or

334
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:10.230
bonnie: You know, with a different client like they weren't going to school and I had no idea like that. They just stopped going to school and

335
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was like, how did how did

336
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.840
bonnie: I not know these things and

337
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:24.780
bonnie: Kind of where we were working together with what was maybe going on in the room or the dynamic, you know, I realized like, you know, she kind of challenged me around being aware of that where I am as an intern. I'm still very like

338
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:37.620
bonnie: You know I'm it's a little insecure about my, you know, abilities, and where I am and that sometimes maybe I want to be liked and I think that that was very eye opening for me or like my way of engaging as

339
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:45.810
bonnie: You know, wanting to be liked, rather than kind of seeing what was kind of what the relationship was was like, are you know

340
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:58.260
bonnie: Right. And she was pointing out, you know, I don't necessarily care for my clients like me. That's not, you know, and it just was kind of eye opening in a way that I think I did learn kind of a style of

341
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:08.460
bonnie: Relating socially, kind of like my mom in in that, you know, I felt she was very meshing so I can kind of fall into that space very yummy.

342
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:15.180
bonnie: And I, it just was like a light bulb. I was like, wow, you know, like, and that's how I was missing. I feel like I was kind of

343
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.030
bonnie: Unconsciously they were kind of replicating with me other relationships in their life, and I was kind of

344
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:28.290
bonnie: Unintentionally playing into it because I thought that, like, oh, they're sharing a lot with me like this is good and I didn't really realize well

345
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:42.480
bonnie: Not like just a question that you know we didn't know each other very long. And yet, I don't know. Like it just was very eye opening for me in terms of looking at my own anxiety and how that plays out and just realizing that

346
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.400
bonnie: You know,

347
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:50.220
bonnie: I wish I had better like I wish I could be like, I don't care if they like me or not.

348
00:37:51.780 --> 00:38:00.090
bonnie: You know, and sometimes it's still hard just with people in general or just like I guess what I'm saying is just those boundaries, not to take it on like people are

349
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:15.480
bonnie: Where they are, and either they like me or they don't. And that's fine. And you know, on some level, I do feel that way but i i see how I can kind of get reactive to things, you know, or take things personally, you know, like I

350
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:25.950
bonnie: Said, I remember like that was something really valuable when I was doing more 12 step work. Many years ago, is kind of just learning about like don't take things personally, you know, like

351
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:34.170
bonnie: Don't make up stories. Don't make assumptions about people's behavior and like that it's directed toward year has anything to do with you and

352
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:39.330
bonnie: You know, just some of those basic things. Sometimes I still forget or I fall into and

353
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:51.330
bonnie: So going back to not wanting to be reactive. I also like a goal for myself would be to be more just confident in who I am, I guess, and in all areas of my life and

354
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:55.290
bonnie: Sure, not be as affected by other people.

355
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if that can be, you know, I can tell you that that is really, really hard and

356
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that even for me now when I'm working with.

357
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With a client that has is really struggling

358
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I go to any lengths, you know, to help them.

359
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's, it's

360
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The one thing about, you know, being a therapist is that we

361
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At the end of the day, we're not just holding our own stuff, but we're

362
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Actually holding

363
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our clients stuff too. Right, right.

364
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And trying to learn how to shed that

365
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And leave it exactly where it is because it's not ours to hold

366
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, can be tough.

367
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, especially when you've got one that you know is really emotional and some of the

368
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things that

369
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they're experiencing you've experienced you know that in fact

370
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it can be tough.

371
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:53.070
bonnie: But

372
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you keep in the forefront of your mind. The idea is to teach this person.

373
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The skills that they need.

374
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:01.710
bonnie: Right.

375
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.670
bonnie: You know what I mean to move forward in themselves. Exactly.

376
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To help

377
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.070
bonnie: Move forward. Yeah.

378
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you apply that and you start applying that, you know, then you're able to most of the time.

379
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Separated and if there's a question for me when I all go straight to my supervisor and

380
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say this is the scenario. What do you think, you know,

381
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Unfortunately, my supervisor has a good way of throwing it back on my lap and saying,

382
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.500
bonnie: What do you mean

383
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think about it, and

384
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

385
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about it for a few days and then let's talk about it and

386
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which really has helped me stop and

387
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about the situation and then address it. You know, if I if I still am struggling with it, then I'm like, I can't do it. You know, I can't see how I can do it. And I just would rather this person, you know, work with somebody that has the abilities.

388
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so just being self aware

389
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of it.

390
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really being self aware and paying attention to you.

391
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Paying attention to when those feelings are rising a lot of a lot of self talk

392
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of control self talk for your emotions, really, really help. Why am I feeling this way right now. I can do this. Just breathe through it.

393
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

394
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We. I don't know if we talked about deep breathing, but I can tell you what that certainly helped

395
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm, you know, taking in deep breaths.

396
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From your abdomen, not from your chest.

397
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Breathing in from your nose and blowing it out, you know, through your mouth and doing that for five and six times until you feel it releasing from your body.

398
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:46.110
bonnie: Yeah, I need to practice that. I mean, I do notice and it's connected

399
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:56.400
bonnie: Like when I'm having a lot of anxiety, especially I noticed. Like I feel like all my breathing is so shallow like is. So kind of like an eye and, you know,

400
00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:10.920
bonnie: I feel like I yeah I should definitely practice that because, you know, again, it's one of those things that when you do it. It feels good, but if it's not, if you don't practice it, it doesn't become an automatic response. So then, like, you don't

401
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.150
bonnie: Realize it. And the moment you need it. You're by, you know, you kind of

402
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:27.840
bonnie: Don't remember to do it. Or like, you know, so I realized there's that piece to have, like, you know, practicing these things so that they become more kind of my default instead of

403
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:34.290
bonnie: Yeah reactivity being my default. And I realized that, you know, that's part of it. I'm so like over

404
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:41.010
bonnie: Like if I picture kind of my ideal life in a way you know like if if money wasn't an issue or

405
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:53.670
bonnie: Anything else that you know I would have all this time for like meditation and like, you know, and it's like things have been so busy and so crazy that I realized like slacked off on like self care stuff. I really have and I think

406
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.740
bonnie: That's one thing like that.

407
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:13.230
bonnie: I wouldn't say I miss it. When I was going through 12 step times it was, you know, I think most of the time what people are there it's it's a desperate time. It's not a fun time. But there's something there was also something very like when you're forced to focus on basics.

408
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:19.800
bonnie: You know, it really your self care is actually pretty extraordinary. And a lot of ways because like you have to

409
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.710
bonnie: Or, you know, like and and

410
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:37.770
bonnie: Like I feel like I've kind of gotten to such a place of kind of complacency. We're usually I'm mostly okay you know but then when I'm not okay. I don't have the tools because I haven't been i've been neglecting like things I've learned or just making that space, like I used to really

411
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:46.680
bonnie: love doing daily readings. I don't know if you know about. Have you guessing you have heard the name melody VAD VAD yeah

412
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:52.920
bonnie: She does like writing oh you know it already. Yeah, I love her stuff and I have like

413
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.790
bonnie: A book.

414
00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:05.490
bonnie: A book of her like her. Her book was, I guess it was that one was really helpful for me during that time to kind of untangle water my my issues and kind

415
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.010
bonnie: Of like focus on myself in a different way.

416
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:21.780
bonnie: I was still in therapy. Then, but it's still like you know my therapist was the one to recommend 12 stuff. And for me, it was really. I know people can have different feelings about it, but for me it was really, really helpful and and got me into the, into

417
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.530
bonnie: Like learning about her her stuff. And so, like, you know, I used to read like

418
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:35.460
bonnie: She has like 365 daily meditations, things like that. And just things I would find just kind of that brought me in contact with, like, you know, I kind of

419
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:43.560
bonnie: redefine my spirituality, apart from religion. I think when I went through that process. And that was really rewarding for me and I used to have kind of

420
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:52.020
bonnie: I would make time every day, like you know book ending my day like just all these basic things that I've kind of gotten away from just as like

421
00:44:52.410 --> 00:45:01.380
bonnie: You know, I, I, my time has become so stretched, but then it means I kind of neglecting myself and neglected things that we're working and kind of, I think,

422
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:12.330
bonnie: And like doing like meditations and things are part of it like deep breathing. You know, when I'm not practicing these things then I kind of have less tools when I need them.

423
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:27.330
bonnie: slacked off in that department, you know, as I've kind of like my the rest of my life became very stable and normal and, you know, and after years and years of that I felt like I don't I'm okay. And I am mostly okay but

424
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:33.870
bonnie: When I'm not as okay I kind of, it's not my default to go back to this. So,

425
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:47.370
bonnie: Right. It's like Maintenance. Maintenance is really important, I think, and I've kind of gotten away from it a bit. But yeah, I kind of, yeah. I used to read like just her things every day would be really helpful.

426
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:56.520
bonnie: And just I'm trying to think. Other things you know but yeah just things to kind of put me in that space of just kind of like

427
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.640
bonnie: There's a just remembering like

428
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:11.220
bonnie: For me, it's been helpful. And it's interesting because I never really talked about unless clients have a particular inclination, they told me about toward like spirituality. I don't really bring it up unless they're telling you something. It's helpful for them. And then I say,

429
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.510
bonnie: Encourage that and

430
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.220
bonnie: Because it is helpful for

431
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:21.120
bonnie: Me just to just to gratitude and, you know, just kind of remembering. You know, like

432
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:33.540
bonnie: That the challenges that are happening or lessons for me and things that have a greater meaning than just the moment. And I think, you know, I've kind of gotten away from that. But it's still really helpful to go back to

433
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.800
bonnie: Long with these. I think it makes you just more

434
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:47.190
bonnie: I just cultivates that quiet space that helps you then kind of call upon it and times when you're wanting to be more reactive

435
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know there

436
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:58.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's this other piece to what the way that I initially were was taught was going through my own therapy.

437
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the

438
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love this woman. She turned out to be, you know, my mentor for a

439
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Long time and

440
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was just, she was just amazing. She taught me so much it once I got into the education piece of becoming a therapist. I started recognizing the tools, the things that she was

441
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holding up you know

442
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right interviewing skills. See, we do.

443
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But one of the things that she told me is

444
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tomorrow, when you drive to work.

445
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't listen to the radio.

446
00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really pay attention to your surroundings.

447
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:42.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay attention to where your feelings are pay attention to what you see use all your senses.

448
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay attention to what you're feeling what you're smelling and what you're hearing

449
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And stay out of your head.

450
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So often times we go on autopilot.

451
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.010
bonnie: Right, exactly.

452
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.330
bonnie: YOU JUST GO WE JUST GO WE JUST DO WE JUST DO. Yep. And I never I

453
00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: never realized

454
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much autopilot eating really goes on.

455
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.280
bonnie: Yeah, totally.

456
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know until you stop for a second. You start paying attention to this at this is something really good for anxiety to something. Pay attention to your drive pay attention to the scenery. What you're smelling what you're hearing

457
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.050
bonnie: And repeat it to yourself and your head. You can even do it when you're doing dishes.

458
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.250
bonnie: And yeah, right.

459
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. You know what I mean. But really,

460
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bringing yourself into the present moment.

461
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because we lose so many of them being on

462
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.840
bonnie: All totally

463
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.010
bonnie: Yeah, totally.

464
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: By the end of the day, it's like, Wait, what happened.

465
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:38.670
bonnie: Yeah, totally.

466
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.960
bonnie: I haven't really or even like I think about times like with my anxiety like

467
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:52.830
bonnie: Times. I'm with my kids. I'll be worrying about like someday. It's just crazy where my mind goes I'll be worrying about dying someday.

468
00:48:52.950 --> 00:49:00.030
bonnie: And then how sad it will be that I'm won't be with them, like right here and I'm missing this moment where I'm like,

469
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:13.650
bonnie: Worrying about that and not like thinking about like they're right here. Like right now, like I can just enjoy them. How about that, you know, it's just like, it's funny how the mind is like kind of can definitely be a runaway train and

470
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:23.550
bonnie: Yeah, like building more of those moments I you know I definitely have to practice. And it's funny because I encourage people to do that. I totally don't do it and

471
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:31.680
bonnie: You know, I think it yeah what really helped me a lot. I think it is just getting in the habit, you know, getting in the habit of doing those things.

472
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.450
bonnie: That I definitely, yeah. Work on

473
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're just simple things, but

474
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that they work.

475
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:43.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know, and even in recovery, we're taught to go back to the basics.

476
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:49.260
bonnie: Yeah, totally. Yeah, I'm hungry. Angry lonely tired. Where are you fed your shell food today. Have you done

477
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any of water are you getting enough sleep, you know what I mean, and just really honing in on that piece which is another part of emotion regulation.

478
00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:58.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know,

479
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If we're not taking care of ourselves and then it's easy to react.

480
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To things because we're agitated when

481
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're hungry. If

482
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.590
bonnie: We sleep. The biggest big trigger for me. Yeah, when I don't get enough sleep.

483
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so just really, you know, paying attention to the basic things and you know when you find yourself starting when those emotions start bubbling and you are getting ready to go into defense mode. Stop.

484
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.230
Yeah.

485
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That remember you stop sign.

486
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.860
bonnie: Yeah.

487
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.800
bonnie: Well, and that's one thing to like I wish I could

488
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:42.990
bonnie: I want to get better at is like sometimes it'll, you know, it's so funny because like I'm so used to focusing on patterns, you know, in terms of

489
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:52.320
bonnie: Clients lives and themes and blah, blah, blah. And in my own life. Like sometimes when these situations come up where I become really reactive. They feel like they come out of the blue.

490
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.710
bonnie: When I realized they're not like there's a definite pattern. Like if

491
00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:01.770
bonnie: You know, my partner start saying, certain things or has a certain tone of voice like I know I'm going to be triggered. It's not. It's not.

492
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:09.570
bonnie: It's not an if it's a when and yet somehow they always catch me by surprise. So I think like, and to my reaction like

493
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:26.250
bonnie: You know, I want to maybe pay attention more, I have to work on paying attention more to like why it didn't come out of the blue. Well, catching it sooner is like I need to kind of notice what's happening right before that happens. So I can

494
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.920
bonnie: Kind of that. Exactly.

495
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:42.120
bonnie: Right. Yeah. Because I think that's what worked with my anxiety. I wonder if that's what worked with the stop sign is because I was doing them in moments when I wasn't already. I was maybe like a three or four out of 10 not an eight.

496
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

497
00:51:42.870 --> 00:52:00.210
bonnie: You know, and so I was able to come right back pretty easily. You know, like just remembering that and that really helped. And I was able to kind of get back down. So you know that that's finding the time like catching catching things hitting

498
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.430
bonnie: The beginning, yeah, knowing

499
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:08.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the beginning, in the very beginning before it escalates to the point of no return.

500
00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.390
bonnie: Yeah.

501
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, that's just, that's where that stop sign comes in, but it also is where your turtle needs to come into

502
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.050
bonnie: Yeah.

503
00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, at the very beginning when you start feeling those emotions starting to turn up.

504
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, stop and take a step back and just say, you know, I need to take a few minutes before we go into this discussion.

505
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and, you know, you know, can we please get back together, you know, and come back to this situation in an hour or two hours by itself, time to process it. Give your time self time to think about what you want the outcome to be

506
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.450
bonnie: Yeah yeah

507
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.380
bonnie: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

508
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That just kind of gives you, you know, a few minutes to get to de escalate.

509
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into that wise mind because you don't want to be completely logical, but you don't want to be reacting out of your emotions.

510
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just really saying

511
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what do I want to get out of this.

512
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what's the outcome. I don't invite

513
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Him. I don't want you know these are the things that I don't want, what do I do want

514
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.970
bonnie: Out of it. Hmm.

515
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want to feel heard, I want you know to have the situation change what's

516
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The best way for that to happen. Yeah.

517
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:34.770
bonnie: And I think sometimes part of that for me is like, I know I need to simplify. Like, I'm just realizing now as you're saying this, what I'm thinking about is like

518
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:46.470
bonnie: You know, would help me to have those moments to so I don't. I know I can be a little overwhelming. Because, like, you know, I can't talk to my husband is exactly the same way. I talked to a therapist because it's like overwhelming.

519
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:51.480
bonnie: If I'm like, you know, going through this made me feel this way and this made me feel this

520
00:53:52.050 --> 00:54:00.780
bonnie: I felt this way. Because of this, and it's just like sometimes like I think sometimes and I don't know if it's a male, female thing too, but like sometimes simplicity

521
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:10.260
bonnie: Like it, you know, I don't need to share every emotion. What triggered me like because, you know, especially if I know wasn't intentional, you know,

522
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:20.100
bonnie: Like picking and choosing your battles of what you react to and like again going back to what do I want to change or like, what, what will be helpful, you know,

523
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:32.310
bonnie: Need to share, every feeling I had in that moment, maybe, maybe not as long as I processed it and I know what it means. I mean, if it's significant. If it keeps coming up, that's one thing but like I know sometimes

524
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:50.130
bonnie: You know, I can you know certainly be because I am a obviously I like processing things and are drawn to this world and you know like and but not everybody's a therapist, so they don't necessarily, you know, it can, I think, be overwhelming sometimes

525
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:58.500
bonnie: To go through everything. You know, it's like kind of keeping it simple to what are the things I really want to focus on

526
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.710
bonnie: Because if it's too much, then

527
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:03.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You overwhelm some and then they

528
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:10.020
bonnie: Use them anyways but we're also making sure that you're bringing positivity to the tables. Yeah.

529
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.770
bonnie: Yeah.

530
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a piece of it. Yeah.

531
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:24.030
bonnie: Yeah, I see that. And that's where I have to be careful not just talking about the things I want to change, but the things that are going well and I know I have that kind of

532
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:31.560
bonnie: You know, a strength based versus like problem based problem.

533
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:44.250
bonnie: Yeah, you know, like, it's so in my nature to kind of think about what is the problem and how do we fix it, you know, instead of also thinking about, like, you know, what's going well and what are the exceptions to the problem. What are the times that when

534
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:53.760
bonnie: You know, maybe some solution focus, you know, well this. I like the way it went this day when it didn't go that way. And it was great. I know we were going there and then we didn't

535
00:55:54.390 --> 00:56:01.920
bonnie: Have a file, you know, we, you know, and it's sometimes I have to remember that I don't always share the positive sometimes

536
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.900
bonnie: At least. Yeah, I didn't those moments.

537
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think a lot of people. I don't really think a lot of people do, because we're on that defensive. And so, yeah, trying to figure out what's positive about, you know, your moment.

538
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but really if you say, you know,

539
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:22.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You go through that list in your head. All right, let's focus and it's a basic a mini gratitude list. You know, I

540
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have over my head athlete in my mouth. My children are good. Yeah. You know, I have a great partner you know i i am learning how to communicate.

541
00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do I want to get out of this situation.

542
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:35.280
bonnie: You know,

543
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just doing that self chicken with

544
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:38.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yourself, you know,

545
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, where do I want to be. Where is n. If you know if, again, there's that other piece to of choosing your battles.

546
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, like, how is this going to matter in another

547
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:56.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Five days, five minutes or five years. Yeah. Right. Right. So, you know, really honing in the ones that are

548
00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Unimportant but really learning how to regulate your emotions for the ones that are, you know,

549
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you need to be here. You know her.

550
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, it takes practice.

551
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:09.330
bonnie: So, yeah.

552
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You use her stop sign when you when you first stop.

553
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, start feeling that just regular you know that emotion turning

554
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That happens in the very beginning.

555
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Use it right then.

556
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just say I need to step away from this working

557
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and

558
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give yourself permission to do it. Give him permission to to go and process his stuff too.

559
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:34.980
bonnie: Yeah. Mm hmm.

560
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:40.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then come back at a later time where you can talk about it in that wise mind and not not emotional mind.

561
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:45.060
bonnie: Mm hmm. Yeah, I would love that. I mean, I would feel a lot better. And then I feel

562
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:54.510
bonnie: Pretty, pretty positive about myself. It wouldn't make me feel bad, or like, you know, I wouldn't have this double edge where then I feel ashamed of acting out. You know what I mean.

563
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or those are the consequences of

564
00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah reactions.

565
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.390
bonnie: Yeah, totally.

566
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Consequences to responding are two totally different things.

567
00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and so, realizing that piece, too, is like, I don't want to feel guilty. I don't want to, you know, feel bad about myself when this is over with.

568
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I certainly want to get that resolution piece.

569
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's really like you know way in it all out and what it really looks

570
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:23.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like allows you to get and stay in that white find area.

571
00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. And it takes practice.

572
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:27.270
bonnie: Yeah.

573
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:28.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just got to practice it, you know.

574
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. Okay, so I want to

575
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Close our session.

576
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:36.330

Yeah.

601
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:06.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that one hour time difference. It sounds so simple but for some reason for me it feels so complicated. I don't you know

602
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so

603
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.970

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.180

615
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.900

Matt Huss III: To a university.

619
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.890
Matt Huss III: And then being in all these like

Matt Huss III: 405 hundred classes.

621
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:29.250
Matt Huss III: That I've never had to take

622
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:37.620
Matt Huss III: And it's just how much is required of you for like reading and writing outside of class.

623
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.880
Yeah.

624
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.080
Matt Huss III: I am. I'm just not used to that.

625
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.040
Matt Huss III: I'm

626
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.610
Matt Huss III: Not used to

627
01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.380
Matt Huss III: Being the smartest one in the classroom.

628
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.190
Matt Huss III: Like always. I've been I'm

629
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you managing it.

630
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:20.670
Matt Huss III: Not too well I'm procrastinating.

631
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:23.820
Matt Huss III: A lot more than I used to.

632
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.110
Matt Huss III: Because

633
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:39.420
Matt Huss III: I don't know. It's like, yeah, it's like I'm so, so, so

634
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.650
Matt Huss III: Worried about how good a paper is going to be or

635
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:45.900
Matt Huss III: I'm

636
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:56.430
Matt Huss III: Like last time I always knew whatever I wrote would be would get an A, and I'd be fine. And now it's like, I don't know.

637
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:10.290
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm worried about how well, everything is I'm so worried. This time that it's making me procrastinate. Even worse, and

638
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:16.320
Matt Huss III: waiting till the night before to write the paper, which makes it even worse, you know,

639
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.250
Matt Huss III: I don't know. Oh.

640
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So really stepping back and and planning it out, you know, you got to pay for do

641
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But planning it out and giving yourself blocks of time to work on it a little bit at a time and again breaking it down to bite sized pieces.

642
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, because oftentimes things like you know they can be overwhelming causes anxiety, stress.

643
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:51.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, especially when you're in school.

644
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: God, do I still remember that.

645
01:03:55.650 --> 01:04:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's really about stepping back and saying, Okay, I'm going to work on this on my paper that's. Do you know Sunday. I know what to do. It's coming up due on Friday.

646
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:20.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm going to give myself, you know, a couple hours today. A couple you know couple hours Wednesday, maybe Sunday. You'll you know you are Monday, you can, you know, read the material and write down some notes, you know, come back at it.

647
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A day later, and write your first or second paragraph, but really breaking it down, breaking it down into bite sized pieces.

648
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you don't feel overwhelmed. Wow.

649
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:37.140
Matt Huss III: I used to be a much better at it, actually, um,

650
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:40.980
Matt Huss III: So I don't know what

651
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.110
Matt Huss III: What some changed.

652
01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, how long have you been in school.

653
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.070
Matt Huss III: Well, I've been since I've come back.

654
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.690
Yeah.

655
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.500
Matt Huss III: I took a semester in January.

656
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.850
Matt Huss III: And actually that was it until

657
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.560
Matt Huss III: This semester. So January took a semester at a Community College or State College.

658
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.660
Matt Huss III: And this is my first semester at a university.

659
01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much all together.

660
01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.710
Matt Huss III: Oh, all together. Oh god.

661
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.610
Matt Huss III: I've been in and out of college for the last

662
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.240
Matt Huss III: I can say it's probably it's probably taken me like

663
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.950
Matt Huss III: You know, for every

664
01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:01.560
Matt Huss III: two semesters. I probably have a semester that I dropped out of them had to quit.

665
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.020
Matt Huss III: And then go without further than, you know, work for a year or two. There was a big period where I didn't go to school.

666
01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:15.120
Matt Huss III: until just now, but before that.

667
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:17.490
Matt Huss III: You know I

668
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:33.330
Matt Huss III: Probably four years probably four to five total years of education, but it took me probably eight or 10 years to get that much done.

669
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.400
Matt Huss III: Because I was constantly in and out of it or screwing up or, you know,

670
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about the length of time that you're in school. You know, we get to a point where we become complacent, we get to a place where we are.

671
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Drained tired.

672
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, when you look at

673
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The papers they feel enormous

674
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and putting it off and putting it off putting it off, you know, end up being a priority and that plays a big piece in it you know the length that you've been in school.

675
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the struggles in between.

676
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But also

677
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feeling overwhelmed with what you're doing now. So really it's about taking it back to basics, taking it back to bite sized pieces. Giving yourself, you know, these, these boundaries in these times that you set aside to finish you know to do your paper and complete it.

678
01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And making sure that you're eating, you know, you're putting healthy food in your body that you're getting enough rest that you are

679
01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, really in the right mindset to be able to start the process of studying

680
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:58.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really keeping it at the eye on the prize, you know, is another thing. What's, what's going to be the outcome you know when this is when this is finished.

681
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and really saying I can't wait till I get to that point. And these are baby steps that I need to do to get there, but so it's a lot of self talk. It's a lot of

682
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:22.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Structuring it to where you have the time to put in a little bit at a time on the on your papers and not having to cram it all at the day before, and then

683
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:37.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, not doing such as a good job is what you know that you can do. And then that makes it. That's a spiral because then you feel guilty about it and you know God. I should have done this better, and I should have done that better. Right. Yeah, so it's

684
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know what to talk about definitely

685
01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:52.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's just really about breaking it down into simplicity, you know and and doing it a little bit of time giving yourself permission to take breaks

686
01:08:52.410 --> 01:09:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: giving yourself permission to sit down and eat a good meal and watch a TV show. And you know what I mean, being able to check out of what you're learning

687
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And helps us to be able to come out come out with a fresh mind, be able to get more accomplished, be able to do our best. Right.

688
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And because it's it's hard. I don't care what anybody says. It is tough in school and you know when you're getting to a point where where you've been in and out of school for so long that wears plays its own wear and tear on you, you know, and so you have to remember that piece to

689
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long until you

690
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Meet your goal.

691
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Graduating

692
01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.110
Matt Huss III: If I stayed in school straight through.

693
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.800
Matt Huss III: It could take four to six years, probably because I'm

694
01:09:54.300 --> 01:10:00.540
Matt Huss III: It's like right before my bachelor's and then you know that's not too far off.

695
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.030
Matt Huss III: But then

696
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.750
Matt Huss III: But a masters and then who knows how long it takes to get a PhD, so

697
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:20.310
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and then I'll probably procrastinate my both of my thesis is

698
01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.490
Matt Huss III: Forever, so we'll see.

699
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you got it. Okay. So get rid of that mindset. Yeah.

700
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because that sabotaging yourself at the end. Right, but

701
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really giving yourself, you know,

702
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:59.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The discipline that you need to say I need to finish this course right I need to really dedicate some time to this to this course so they can get, get it over with and and really structuring your weekly time to be able to give yourself enough time to give it your all you know

703
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it sucks because sometimes we feel stuck. Sometimes it's it's tough. It might be a subject that you just have no interest in

704
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the moment that you give yourself permission to break it down into small bites. It's easier to get them done. You know, you get yourself in a rhythm, you get yourself in this whole new routine.

705
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

706
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:28.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before you know it, the papers are getting done. They're getting done with your hundred percent

707
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not procrastinating.

708
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.

709
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:43.080
Matt Huss III: I've always been bad with the routine. I've always wanted constantly want to create a routine for myself, but I've never been able to stick to one.

710
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:55.410
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's been a lifetime thing for a long time, or I'm constantly trying to make a schedule and this never stick to it. I

711
01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:56.970
Matt Huss III: Don't know why.

712
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And why you don't know why.

713
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:00.630
Matt Huss III: I know I

714
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:11.220
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I mean, the first time. I'm like, Well, I just don't feel like this right now. So I'll put it off and then all of a sudden the whole schedule goes, I don't know.

715
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it takes. I'm telling you, it takes a lot of perseverance. It takes a lot of fighting with yourself and to just do it. You think about if you had

716
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A dog or a cat or if you had even as a child, a small child. Do you think about

717
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:38.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know how many times you know, parents don't want to, you know, or pet owners don't want to take the dog out because it's freezing rain outside it's cold.

718
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you still get up and you do it anyways because it's something that you need to do right

719
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, parents with small kids they, you know, I'm sure. Well, I know from experience. You don't want to get up at two, two and three and four in the morning, but it's some it's a necessity. It's something that you have to do.

720
01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've got to get into that mindset to get yourself out of be of procrastinating.

721
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and saying this is I have to do this. I have to do this. I need to build a schedule and stick to it, no matter what. And that's the hard part is is when you we give ourselves permission to walk over the no matter what it all goes right we're right back to procrastinating.

722
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:35.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you are really, you know, if you can just set those boundaries with yourself and say, I have to stick to this, I have to stick to this.

723
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:44.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're not going to always do it perfect, but the great part about it is you get to pick up and start again. You know when you don't do it. Perfect. Right.

724
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, remembering that to

725
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it's going to take it just takes a lot of work and perseverance.

726
01:13:53.370 --> 01:14:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And self discipline you know anything, whether or not you can also, you know, throw remarks in your head. Like, how long do I want to be in school for

727
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At what point do I not want this to be over, you know, and really give yourself that self talk that allows you to become motivated to get this done.

728
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

729
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I can just tell you from my own personal experience that I had to do that several times and you know procrastinating on a paper to the last minute.

730
01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Several times and that causes anxiety and frustration and and you know worry and and it just doesn't have the outcome that we would hope you know

731
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's gonna take some work. It's gonna take some work on your side.

732
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.760
You know,

733
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:02.820
Matt Huss III: It's

734
01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:15.540
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm sorry it's it's it's late for me.

735
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay.

736
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.900
Matt Huss III: Tired.

737
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's

738
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot to digest, you know,

739
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:43.470
Matt Huss III: I'm always fighting on myself, you know, eat from the beginning of the day. I have to fight with myself to get out of bed and then, you know, to take a shower to

740
01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:48.510
Matt Huss III: Every little thing is like a battle in my head.

741
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you're doing it.

742
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:54.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The right

743
01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:56.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you're doing it.

744
01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember that you might have a battle going on here. And inside your head to accomplish these basic things, but you're doing it.

745
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember that.

746
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I have to fight with myself to get out of bed. But guess what I am getting out of bed.

747
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And guess what, it's tough, but I am doing these things.

748
01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and recognizing you know that you are, you know, not focusing on the things that that you feel you're falling short on but really focusing on the things that you are doing, you know, helps us bring up our motivation, a little bit more

749
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

750
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:40.920
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Yeah, it's true.

751
01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just getting getting back down to that basic piece you know i know i you know I'm struggling with doing this right now, but I have to do it anyways have to

752
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just come into that point. You know what I mean. Um,

753
01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you on depression medicine. Yeah.

754
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:06.870
Matt Huss III: Very high dose of like the highest those possible effects are and

755
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:13.080
Matt Huss III: Well you trend supposed to help it.

756
01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:17.280
Matt Huss III: Yes, and anxiety medication as well.

757
01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you think that they're working

758
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:32.550
Matt Huss III: File. I mean, and they work compared to the places I've been at in my mind, you know, I'm still

759
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:37.920
Matt Huss III: Going right now and I'm not stuck in the bed for days on end, but

760
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.040
Matt Huss III: Yeah, maybe.

761
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:46.350
Matt Huss III: I might ask, try something else. Because Lately it's been

762
01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.660
Matt Huss III: It hasn't been as easy to do things as it was

763
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.300
Matt Huss III: Before

764
01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And don't forget that the medication, you know, it helps. But there's also that whole piece that you have to have to dedicate to it to, you know, and again, paying attention to what you're eating paying attention that you're getting enough sleep.

765
01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And paying attention to how you're taking care of yourself. You know, that's a vital piece of it too.

766
01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When it's sunny out. You know what I mean when you have some being able to be in the sun and get those vitamin D rays and

767
01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if it's just sitting outside for a little bit and just soaking in the sun.

768
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That also helps with depression.

769
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tanning booth can help if you're able to get in one with depression.

770
01:18:45.060 --> 01:19:00.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A red light also helps with depression. I mean, there's several different things that you can use if you can, you know, if you have the option to that can help you with that piece, but certainly talking to the to the doctor and saying,

771
01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is how I'm feeling.

772
01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I feel like I've kind of step back a few steps, you know, and just addressing that with your doctor to help

773
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.260
Matt Huss III: I did go free. A but

774
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:27.810
Matt Huss III: The wind chill was so cold that I had to. It was painful. I'm still New Mexico weather. Yeah.

775
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:29.430
Then in Florida for to

776
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah,

777
01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a change

778
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh, yeah, I can see that. And, you know, cold weather, a lot of rain a lot of cloudy days.

779
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can contribute to that depression piece. So, you know, being aware of that, you know, and knowing that that can possibly be playing playing have an effect, you know, having a factor in this whole thing.

780
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.450
Matt Huss III: You know, yeah.

781
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:22.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But also, again, telling yourself you know i know i don't want to do this, but I'm still doing it. I know I don't want to do this, but I'm still doing it. You know what I mean. Also helps reaffirm that you can do it. You know what I mean I'm just keeping an eye on the prize, you know,

782
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I went through, you know, my associates my bachelor's and my masters. By the time I got to my master's I was exhausted and I wanted done. I just wanted to be done.

783
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I found myself trying to take shortcuts and procrastinating and waiting. And what I realized was that when I did that I was not giving it my all and

784
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:52.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My, my school work was suffering and there was a point where I just wanted to give up, but I didn't.

785
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I fought all those things inside my head that tells me it's okay, I can wait till the last minute.

786
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it's really I don't know how you feel, but I know for me, that if my grade isn't a decent grade I. It makes me feel worse about myself and I start beating myself up.

787
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:24.690
Matt Huss III: The I yeah I've never gotten the lower than a day so I get pissed off. If I get a beat. So I like I've dropped classes before if i thought i was i was gonna get like

788
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:35.220
Matt Huss III: Lower than a, like a if I didn't think I was gonna get at least to be I might I'll probably dropped the class, and it's crazy. It's like that black and white.

789
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.430
Matt Huss III: Thinking or something.

790
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's also a piece of it and that says that you're trying to

791
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: sell yourself short.

792
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:56.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what you're capable of doing better than anybody. And so if

793
01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:00.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A course or classes challenging

794
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:07.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Then it becomes too hard to do. And so knowing that you're, you know, you're

795
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're extremely smart. It's a lot better if you can take things that aren't so challenging that you know that you can do.

796
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

797
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:36.690
Matt Huss III: I guess, to start off, maybe, but I would I would want to be challenged. Yeah.

798
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:46.770
Matt Huss III: I enjoy being challenged and stuff. That's the problem. But at the same time. It's like I'm

799
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:50.490
Matt Huss III: Not putting all my effort in now because

800
01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:56.700
Matt Huss III: It's challenging, it's, it's weird. Yeah.

801
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty self sabotaging behaviors. That's what those are, you know,

802
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think that we can do to be able to change, help, help you change that mindset and turn it to a point where

803
01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you recognize what you're doing.

804
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You give yourself.

805
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kudos or pat on the backs and wreck and really talking to yourself about, you know, I know. I don't feel like doing this but I'm doing it.

806
01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

807
01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:32.250
Um,

808
01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think that you can you can do to help that process along and become more more less procrastinated for school.

809
01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.720
Matt Huss III: I don't know. I mean I have to

810
01:23:57.150 --> 01:24:00.540
Matt Huss III: Set up kind of some kind of schedule but it's

811
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:05.220
Matt Huss III: It's hard to

812
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:18.720
Matt Huss III: force myself to write when i don't know i'm not in that in the perfect mind state in our

813
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:28.560
Matt Huss III: That I feel like writing. If I don't feel like writing that I'm like, I'm not going to write, which is horrible. If you know

814
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:41.790
Matt Huss III: Especially, you know, finally have if I was given us some an assignment and it's due in two or three days. If I don't happen to feel the way I want. I like to feel when I right then.

815
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:45.870
Matt Huss III: Then all of a sudden it's like do the next day in its

816
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:49.800
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I haven't. So how to

817
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Navigate it

818
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you know that you have worked on.

819
01:24:58.890 --> 01:25:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And here's just something to try, but when you know you have a paper to writer you have work to do and you're not in the space that you want to be that you feel you need to be to do it sit down with a piece of paper and a tablet and just start writing anything

820
01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not nothing that pertains to your work or or you know what you're trying to learn, but how you're feeling and what you're thinking. But just start the whole process of doing, you know,

821
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because the idea is that it will help you get into that mindset, a little bit that you feel that you need to be in, in order to start writing

822
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:38.880
Matt Huss III: Okay.

823
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see what I mean.

824
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.710
Matt Huss III: Yeah, no, I'll try.

825
01:25:50.970 --> 01:26:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, I definitely have several tablets that I just sat down and wrote and wrote and wrote and it helped put me and where I needed to be to be able to start focusing on the work

826
01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

827
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:08.850
Matt Huss III: Some little

828
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.140
Matt Huss III: Bro, yeah.

829
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:13.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it does. It does help.

830
01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, I'm trying to do it. I know I don't feel like doing it right now, but I'm going to read what it is I need to write about, you know, um, and just giving yourself permission to break it down into smaller pieces digested, a little bit at a time, you know, right, one paragraph at a time.

831
01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:48.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just breaking it back down to to baby steps to spoonfuls instead of mouthfuls or instead of something that feels so big that you don't want to do it.

832
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

833
01:26:50.160 --> 01:27:01.470
Matt Huss III: I've never. Yeah. And I've never felt so behind either. This is the first time I've actually feel behind because I have two or three more assignments. You know that I've to do

834
01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:06.420
Matt Huss III: That I wish I could have been starting already you know

835
01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'm still working on the first one because I

836
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:15.180
Matt Huss III: procrastinated it, you know, and it's it's nuts. It's, um, I'm not

837
01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:21.960
Matt Huss III: Used to the yeah how much state.

838
01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:29.340
Matt Huss III: They require you to work at the post grad level because my classes are the post graduate level.

839
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:34.470
Matt Huss III: So there's me and only a couple other

840
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:37.890
Matt Huss III: Undergraduate students in the classes.

841
01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.070
Matt Huss III: And it's just, I've never experienced

842
01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:53.040
Matt Huss III: And on top of that. I'll take like a short response as question that they asked you to write

843
01:27:54.210 --> 01:28:01.170
Matt Huss III: Over the next few days, and I'll make it like such a big deal out of it like it's a huge paper essay and

844
01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:14.610
Matt Huss III: That'll make me depressed and even longer because I'm taking notes and or, you know, doing research for this stupid little one or two page paper making it into a whole

845
01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.290
Matt Huss III: Thing.

846
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got a little bit, uh,

847
01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like procrastination and a little bit of perfectionism.

848
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.940
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and

849
01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In there too. And, you know, a response paper is is simple, as I keep it simple. Keep it simple.

850
01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

851
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:41.040
Matt Huss III: I'm figured out how to do this.

852
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's about that mind control, you know, it's about really, you know, controlling learning how because it's not something that you can just change overnight, but

853
01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: just learning how to be able to control that mind you know that mindset, this doesn't have to be a big huge ordeal.

854
01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's that self talk that you're giving yourself. You're telling yourself these things, this doesn't have to be such a big deal. This can be exactly what they asked for. And it's a repetitive.

855
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: self talk in your head that allows you to keep it, bring it back, back in and keep it at a more simpler level so that you don't get so you know stressed out over it and it doesn't turn into something that's

856
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's big or huge you know

857
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:33.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I was going to school. We called it, we had to respond.

858
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To message stream or about the topic and had to be so many words and had to have so many things in the content and overthinking it really causes more damage than just letting it flow. That's what I learned the hard way.

859
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:55.890
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's what I'm doing to myself.

860
01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:57.750
Yeah.

861
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.650
Matt Huss III: Yeah, because, I mean,

862
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.010
Matt Huss III: I'll have

863
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:10.860
Matt Huss III: I'll have like three pages of bullet point notes.

864
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.250
Matt Huss III: But no essay for a stupid little

865
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.690
Matt Huss III: Short response thing and it

866
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.380
Is

867
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:34.350
Matt Huss III: This is driving me nuts because you know they expect you to be able to do it in an hour to, you know, after all, the reading is done so that they can aside, they'll sign a second one. Do you know I have

868
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:48.870
Matt Huss III: One do tomorrow morning. One do by midnight online tomorrow. And then I have another one do by Monday, you know, and it's just an I haven't and I'm still working on one that

869
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.680
Matt Huss III: I should have gotten done

870
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:55.860
Matt Huss III: And then beginning of the week.

871
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.150
Matt Huss III: But have worked on the other ones that are coming up, you know,

872
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.720
So,

873
01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can say some little bit it

874
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Takes a little bit of training to change that mind thought, you know, that mind process. And again, making sure that your self care is at its peak level, you know, making talking to the doctor about your meds will I'm sure will help

875
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But also what are you doing for self care. What are you doing,

876
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, I tried

877
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:36.240
Matt Huss III: Tried to go for walks. But that happens, maybe once or twice a week.

878
01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.580
Matt Huss III: But

879
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:52.530
Matt Huss III: A big goal of mine is to get to the gym every day or every other day. Again, like I did at one point in my life and I'm

880
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:59.100
Matt Huss III: And it's the best I've ever felt my entire life is when I was going to the gym on a regular basis.

881
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isn't it crazy that the things that are best for us seems to be the most difficult to do.

882
01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:05.040
Yeah.

883
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:07.020
Yeah.

884
01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely true and

885
01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just

886
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.990
Matt Huss III: Too much. That's another thing.

887
01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're eating too much, as I said,

888
01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:19.740
Matt Huss III: Leaping too much.

889
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:29.250
Matt Huss III: Sleeping. Yeah. And then only eating like right before bed someone metabolisms not breaking up any food is just turning into fat.

890
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.720
Matt Huss III: In my diet. It's not good in my sleep habits are not good.

891
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:45.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's gotta, you gotta start there. You've got to start there. You've got to hone in and on what you're eating and on your sleep.

892
01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:54.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and they always say that it's healthier to eat five meals a day than it is to eat one big one or two big one, you know, put

893
01:32:54.870 --> 01:33:03.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Healthy put an apple. You know what I mean in your pocket and set a timer on your phone. You know what I mean. For each for five times throughout the day.

894
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean and eat that apple or banana in your pocket or you know whatever it is that's healthy and I bet you you will begin to start feeling

895
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:31.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little bit better because your body is going to get you know what it means. And oftentimes will stress, he will will eat more junk food than we do anything else, because it's easy, convenient. We're on the run, you know, hate, too.

896
01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.770
Matt Huss III: Many too many frozen foods. Yeah.

897
01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's just really taking a look at first you know your diet and adding in some healthiness setting a cap on, what time is too late to eat.

898
01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being aware of that, you know, but it's about bringing it back into you.

899
01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bringing everything back into you making you your priority.

900
01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Making your, you know, your self care the priority.

901
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that's what what needs to happen.

902
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:12.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because everything else flourishes.

903
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When maps taking care of Matt.

904
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can tell you that to

905
01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.300
Matt Huss III: Better

906
01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:30.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

907
01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:34.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's a work for me.

908
01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the week,

909
01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's about implementing

910
01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some kind of healthy snacks throughout the day for you.

911
01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:45.480
Matt Huss III: Good.

912
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're just gonna, we're just going to start basic stuff, you know,

913
01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:52.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of

914
01:34:54.150 --> 01:35:06.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A TV dinner, you know, grab some fruit or vegetable something that you like to eat. That's good for you. Good, making sure that you're counting how much water you're putting in your body, a day.

915
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much water do you drink.

916
01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:13.860
Matt Huss III: Not enough

917
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

918
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.790
Matt Huss III: Soda and energy drinks.

919
01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Haha, yeah. Water is going to be in there too. Um, but really honing in to drinking one bottle a day. I mean, that's really, you know, so, because if we said if I say I expect you to drink three bottles of water a day. I'm going to set you up for failure.

920
01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

921
01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just. No way. I mean, I set my own self up in those at, you know, when it comes to water. It's like something that you have to pay attention to every day.

922
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:53.220
Matt Huss III: So water thing I was was one thing I was doing before.

923
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.900
Matt Huss III: This bout with like within the last like

924
01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:09.150
Matt Huss III: Four months or three, three or four months, I've been before this bout of depression and I had to start fighting with myself to wake up again.

925
01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:10.980
Matt Huss III: And

926
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.080
Matt Huss III: Fighting myself to do everything again but but right before that I was drinking, you know, two or three bottles a day.

927
01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:30.990
Matt Huss III: And yeah and then and then but everything disappeared again when I, you know, because like I said I'll

928
01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:44.910
Matt Huss III: For some reason I get these depression bouts that I'll be fine for a while. But then I'll still once in a while I have about of it and stop doing everything that I've

929
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.760
Matt Huss III: Got myself to do

930
01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And here's the again.

931
01:36:52.980 --> 01:37:01.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Putting an alarm on your phone. You know what I mean, to remind yourself and you can put one on your phone to say have you drinking your water today.

932
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:14.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean and asking yourself, giving yourself those questions. You know, and brings you back to being mindful about what you are doing, because you know when we eat healthy energy drinks and soda.

933
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And we're not putting goodness in our bodies to kind of counteract that then that becomes a part of the problem.

934
01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

935
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's the basics.

936
01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's, there's your assignment for for the week.

937
01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is to really implement some healthy different healthy snacks throughout the day.

938
01:37:38.130 --> 01:37:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And drink one bottle of water.

939
01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:40.410
A day

940
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Simple things that you you know that you should be doing. Anyways, that you know you should be. But it's easier to do. You know, I know.

941
01:37:51.780 --> 01:38:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's easier to drink. Red Bull than what it is to go and grab that bottle of water. Sometimes, I mean, I get that or not even really recognizing or identifying that you need water, you know,

942
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a piece of it too, but just getting back to being mindful about Matt.

943
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which will then help you, you know, and your schoolwork.

944
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That make sense.

945
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:16.710
Yeah.

946
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm not going to give you too much. You got enough on your plate with their schoolwork, you know,

947
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:30.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, I remember all too well. I think I got a little traumatized from it because it felt so overwhelming, but

948
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how I knew that I had to

949
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To break it up into little pieces.

950
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I there's a piece of it. The wonders.

951
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do I explain this. It's hard sometimes to stay focused. Right.

952
01:38:49.500 --> 01:39:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On the subject that you're doing. And if it's not a subject or you feel, and this is my own personal experience, and you feel like it's too hard. It's easy to find reasons why you don't want to do it right now.

953
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

954
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To change that mindset is the sooner that I get it over with the sooner that I get this done.

955
01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm done with it, and I don't have to think about it anymore.

956
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:21.870
Matt Huss III: You know,

957
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:29.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what what kind of helped me stay at the very end when I was dragging my feet being motivated to

958
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, complete

959
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The work, even though it was a struggle.

960
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:42.690
