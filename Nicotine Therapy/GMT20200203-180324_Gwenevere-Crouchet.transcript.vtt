00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to pull up a note here I'm just kind of bring me up to speed is anything kind of really present for you right now, anything going on.

2
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.080
Jaime Crouchet: No, I just feel like shit. I think I got sick traveling or something. I feel really bad today.

3
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So hard so you're back at home.

4
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your son doing

5
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.380
Jaime Crouchet: He's good. Yeah, this time was really good. Yeah.

6
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
Jaime Crouchet: Things are getting better for him. He's maturing as well. I think that has a lot to do it.

7
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be a fast.

8
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty good with him. Yeah.

9
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say the maturing part

10
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be awfully fast. It sounds like medicines working the the therapy. It's working. You know what I mean. Mature over what, six months, three months. That'd be pretty fast.

11
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.600
Um,

12
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess this other stuff.

13
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.160
Jaime Crouchet: But something's getting

14
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Some new thoughts are getting in. You know when when we're not completely emotionally activated and fear isn't leading the show, we can take in new information. And so maybe he's able to absorb what you're doing what you're saying. And because he's seeing a counselor to isn't he

15
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So maybe he's absorbing the information

16
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.140
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, that's probably true.

17
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.250
Jaime Crouchet: It seems to like go to counseling lots of

18
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Different difference than when I was

19
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was in New Mexico, and there was this big stress and he was, you know, wanting to hurt himself and what a difference.

20
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.660
Jaime Crouchet: Right, a huge just different.

21
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.340
Jaime Crouchet: Uh huh. Crazy.

22
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And does he see it too busy.

23
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize. Hey, I like lion. Yeah.

24
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I like this better. He does.

25
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.530
You see,

26
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.010
Jaime Crouchet: You've got a snoring sorry my internet was cutting out for a second.

27
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.430

Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing around

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The desk at the hotel.

41
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.470
Jaime Crouchet: It's just weird.

42
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.140
Jaime Crouchet: It's weird being like

43
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.570
Jaime Crouchet: I guess the one race not responsible for happening but you know the one that's on the front lines kind of answering to everything with corporate

44
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.510
Jaime Crouchet: And legal and all that.

45
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone

46
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.080
Jaime Crouchet: What

47
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I was asking. Yeah, we've got a little bit of a delay. So I keep interrupting you. I'm sorry about that. Um, I was, I was asking if if anyone on your staff is to compensating

48
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In some way

49
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.730
Jaime Crouchet: Stop doesn't really seem to be too affected by it. Nobody really saw anything

50
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.700
Jaime Crouchet: And we only happen to know that that something had happened was because the police were there and knocked on the door.

51
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.810
Jaime Crouchet: So it's not like we saw it and had to call the police.

52
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.070
Jaime Crouchet: And so I staff.

53
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.860
Jaime Crouchet: So working with corporate I think corporates going to offer them counseling, but we'll see what happens.

54
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.820
If they do.

55
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.890
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

56
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To have it, Jamie. Let's take today. Take as long as you need to set up your phone, your laptop, and if you're on a phone.

57
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably going to need to set it up so that you can have right in front of you to two objects that are about a foot and a half apart.

58
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.540
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, yeah, I don't have mine.

59
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.700
Jaime Crouchet: My Love, talk to you. I don't know where the charger is to it. And it's dead, so I had to go buy any charger work and make it work for the phone.

60
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.020
Jaime Crouchet: Well,

61
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.540
We just need

62
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Some setup in front of you.

63
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.030
Jaime Crouchet: So like in between my phone help stuff on the side of it.

64
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Exactly. Because what I'll be doing it well. Just find those two things maybe in the kitchen or two bosses or something.

65
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.700
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, I have like my air purifier and a cup right here.

66
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I need to be the same, right, because I don't want your eyes going like this around funk funk, we kind of want them about the same height so that you're

67
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.990
Looking horizontal left and right.

68
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.670
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, they are actually the exact same height. They have these two things.

69
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

70
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.520
There we go.

71
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Put him about what is this shoulder width apart.

72
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.050
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah. OK.

73
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. And I'm going to look through here.

74
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.540
All the grunts I'm

75
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.790
Jaime Crouchet: Looking through your

76
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your 50 you know your said 50 here.

77
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You were sharing. I remember being younger and wanting to talk to my mom about certain things, but I felt uncomfortable and

78
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.280
Jaime Crouchet: Awkward your

79
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of not

80
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.390
Well,

81
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotion was resentment and starting to feel more angry.

82
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The body felt sense

83
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Was tense in the army was kind of shaking core belief about yourself was I'm in her way and I don't matter.

84
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive cognition one preferred thinking is a matter and I'm valuable.

85
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Number that

86
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.540
Jaime Crouchet: Kind of

87
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Time for you.

88
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.510
Jaime Crouchet: What's up,

89
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the age, you were the symmetry to know the age

90
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.120
Jaime Crouchet: And then I started thinking about my mom.

91
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.230
Yeah.

92
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.530
Jaime Crouchet: For as long as I can remember.

93
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: People have recall at about age five doesn't seem that old

94
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.380
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, like I specifically remember my first day of kindergarten and how my mom just

95
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.360
Jaime Crouchet: It just didn't feel like it mattered to her.

96
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about it. Now, what emotions come up for you.

97
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.280
Jaime Crouchet: Sad.

98
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.680
Jaime Crouchet: I just don't understand what I did wrong.

99
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.160
Jaime Crouchet: Like why I didn't deserve her let me back.

100
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.810
Jaime Crouchet: I think this is pretty

101
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty powerful we might do a little work right around this time you have

102
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.700
Jaime Crouchet: I'm having terrible, terrible internet to me.

103
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

104
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So this might not be the best day. So if I were to do

105
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The

106
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This might not be a great day for it, since you might have an interruption.

107
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

108
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The internet

109
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a little clunky.

110
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

111
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.170
Jaime Crouchet: I don't know what is going on with my internet today.

112
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. See if it's

113
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.370
Jaime Crouchet: Wi Fi.

114
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

115
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe everybody's using it. I don't know. Let's

116
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn your video off for a minute, and we'll just go to audio for a second, just to make sure I don't want to miss anything. I'm trying to take some some notes on what you're saying.

117
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.350
I

118
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that's pretty powerful as early as kindergarten, you know, this awareness of

119
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of thinking, What did I do wrong. So you were blaming yourself somehow and questioning whether you deserved or didn't deserve some way her love back. And that's a really early age.

120
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:11.880
Jaime Crouchet: I think all i don't i mean at that same exact time was, I mean, that was the age that I was being molested to, I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

121
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm just wondering, as you say that

122
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's go back and forth between these two. So the, the imagery, you have around kindergarten, first day of school.

123
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.630
Jaime Crouchet: How distressing.

124
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm trying to fill in right on this thermometer how distressing is it when you think about what you know. What did I do wrong and picturing going to kindergarten how distressing is that for you right now.

125
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.130
To think about it.

126
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.490
Jaime Crouchet: What number

127
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.860
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I mean, it makes me like I still feel that ache in my chest.

128
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And what subjective unit of distress we give it from zero to 100

129
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.560
Jaime Crouchet: I'd say like a six or seven probably

130
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll put it a 60 I'll put it, if

131
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You want it somewhere between like 65

132
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:17.910
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

133
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And

134
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you just now pulled up this other piece which is this is at the same time that I was being molested did the distress go up. Did it go down for happens when you pull that into your awareness.

135
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.240
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, when I felt like I was fighting definitely fighting tears at that point.

136
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And how high if 100 is the worst thing. The worst how high up.

137
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.980
Jaime Crouchet: I'd say probably 80

138
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.260
Jaime Crouchet: Maybe 70

139
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.340
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

140
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm fighting, fighting tears that was very in the moment. And what's the emotion that you felt, you know, that was

141
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.400
Jaime Crouchet: No, no.

142
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The tears.

143
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They have something in common, maybe, maybe with the belief about the self. What did I do wrong.

144
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything in common between those two stories being molested and mom.

145
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Not showing love back to you. Was there any connection between those two.

146
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Memories.

147
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:22.530
Jaime Crouchet: I think so, yeah. I mean, for a long time. I just couldn't understand why nobody did anything about it, or why

148
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.590
Jaime Crouchet: I just wasn't protected, I guess.

149
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And was your dad working during this time.

150
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.960
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry what was that

151
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I was asking. Was this a time when your dad was working a lot

152
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:56.880
Yeah.

153
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want to do some some work with this, but I'm I'm concerned that that the zoom will fail us. Should we check it one more time.

154
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happens if you put your video on

155
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.440
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I am a little. I don't know why my internet is being so crappy today.

156
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.260
Jaime Crouchet: Usually I have really good connection with zoom

157
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep me posted when it breaks up or I freeze because I want it right now. I'm just in wanting to test and make sure that it's stable enough to move forward. Okay.

158
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.040
Jaime Crouchet: Okay. Okay. Keep

159
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.380

Okay.

162
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to share the screen with you and we're just going to just check check how it does

163
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see see if it's pretty pretty

164
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's right. I've got to do it with my finger, because you're on a phone.

165
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I've got to do it this differently, you're on a phone there won't be any here. So what you're going to do is

166
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll actually this is might be a little better considering zips not working great. So what I want to do is I want to watch your eyes.

167
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to try and sit right in front of these. So your center with these two objects. So they're like right here in front of you. Okay, and

168
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do is I'm just going to point in the direction. So all I'm doing is I'm pointing at the direction and you're going to be looking at that object over there.

169
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.660
Jaime Crouchet: And then

170
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: setting the pace is really all I'm doing okay. And I'll be setting the duration. So it doesn't go on flower and then what you'll see me do is I'll say let's read them together nice belly breath and then

171
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, and let it go. So you're going to hear me doing that and then I'll say what's coming up for you and I literally mean that

172
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be the soma that's body. Ooh, my teeth, my stomach turn my foots tapping and also be a thought that just ran through a new memory might come up

173
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.550
Jaime Crouchet: You're cutting out

174
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.540
Oh,

175
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.610

Gwenevere Abriel: Too bad.

179
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.080
Jaime Crouchet: So what do you want to do.

180
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: We can say talking about different things and and put postpone this work for another time. What do you think

181
00:18:51.360 --> 00:19:00.120
Jaime Crouchet: I because I'm really interested in this part, I would. Can we do it next week and I'll make sure I have my laptop with the new charger.

182
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that. So let's take a look at next week right now. Um,

183
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I have I have that 10am spot back open. Do you want that on. Okay.

184
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.780
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I like that one.

185
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'll do Jamie, it's all right you in for February 10 at 10 and I'll also write it in the next week to just to kind of protect that spot.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.280
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, yeah.

187
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:27.960
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

188
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is all

189
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not one of those things that I'm requiring of you, meaning the frequency. This is just to address the work sort of more aggressively.

190
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But if in between there and there. You're like, you know, I need a little break. Go ahead and schedule someone else in that spot, just let me know as soon as you can. Okay.

191
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not a record amount of frequency. This is you sort of setting the, the rate that we're meeting so that we can see some progress.

192
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, good. So I've got that down. I've got February 10 at 10am I also have February 17 at 10am. All right.

193
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we do this.

194
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we, we want to we want to the the bilateral stimulation. But what you can do.

195
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

196
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do a little bit

197
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Of work in

198
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The anchor room. We can go in there and explore what you just said a little further by going in there, some really interesting things can happen can discover resources that we just hadn't thought of before.

199
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.000
Jaime Crouchet: So I want to see.

200
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome to go there and your imagery right now and I'm going to try and

201
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Guide with the notes that I have. But if you happen to

202
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, and go for it. Just take a nice

203
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: setting the tone setting the intention breath.

204
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: On that out breath to slowly bringing yourself in

205
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Into this anchor room this safe space.

206
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe Space have filled with the stuff you need all the temperatures. Right. And let me see what I see here we have a normal temperature

207
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And the lighting is just the way you want it from behind you, I believe.

208
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In

209
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier the, the door was open.

210
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a hall.

211
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's bright from the ceiling white walls and tiles kind of narrow this hall right nothing on the walls, nothing in the halls.

212
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Temperatures a little cold feels really relaxed.

213
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice now this cold.

214
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As the feet make contact with the tile.

215
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you were to touch it, you'd notice that the spackle texture of the wall is also cold.

216
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's complete silence.

217
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no smell, taste,

218
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you noticed earlier picture a sense an image of your dad being there.

219
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.370
Jaime Crouchet: And giving you a hard to move you can hear me connection for a minute.

220
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, today is just to hanky

221
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you did you froze. A little bit.

222
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this since we're not doing any I movement, you can take me off video and I'll just guide you

223
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just be heavily dependent on your, your feedback. So just take the video off we'll just go audio for another 10 minutes

224
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.320
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry.

225
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta work with what we got.

226
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.120
Jaime Crouchet: I just upgraded by Wi Fi to this is crazy. Yeah.

227
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta give me a hard time about the end it's locked. Right. It's not like other people are signing in under your name.

228
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.290
Yeah.

229
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.730
Jaime Crouchet: Okay.

230
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like to mention that

231
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.140
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I definitely have it cured.

232
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so am I. You can hear me okay now. Yeah.

233
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So to the degree that you're comfortable just give yourself permission to go

234
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Back in there.

235
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was just about when I had

236
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentioned that your

237
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That your dad was there and he was giving you a hug.

238
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of the reason why was it was a solution was a resource to this tightening

239
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Body.

240
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So pay close attention to how it's doing now is we

241
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We do our best to try to go to this.

242
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.140
Right.

243
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Here attention to the chat.

244
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:14.820
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

245
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.420
Jaime Crouchet: See if there's, I just got really tense and really

246
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.730
Okay.

247
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it in the chest isn't in the gut the shoulders to see what's where's it happening.

248
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.880
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, like it's I feel it in my chest and I was just squeezing my hand.

249
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll use some of that metaphor to try and get get some information. So just give those squeezing hands.

250
00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Permission to really be creative here and we're going to go kind of on that kooky direction where you're just going to let the first things that come to mind, it's going to be this free association stuff.

251
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just take a look at your hands.

252
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And take a look at them and just sort of get a sense of, do they both want the same thing.

253
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:24.900
Jaime Crouchet: I keep rubbing them together.

254
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And do they like it in the room.

255
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.620
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry you cut out for a second. Oh, interesting.

256
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Did these rubbing hands. Do they like it in the room.

257
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: In the area. Yeah.

258
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.400
Yeah.

259
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is where we get into sort of metaphor here. See if we can ask

260
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: These rubbing hands.

261
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this what they want to be doing today want to be rubbing like this or is there is there some other activity, they would like to be doing.

262
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it seems odd just sort of turn the attention to

263
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you like it in this room.

264
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they want to be doing something else, or maybe

265
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's needed in order for them to do something else.

266
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.380
Jaime Crouchet: My first reaction was that they did not

267
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.200
Jaime Crouchet: Like being roped like the stress of it.

268
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't like the stress. Okay. Okay, so let's use let's use some magic here. Okay.

269
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to

270
00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Open up that secret compartment in this room. It's tucked away in a wall somewhere and pull out this magic.

271
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And if they could indeed wish something just get exactly what they need to not be so stressed, what would they wish.

272
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.560
Jaime Crouchet: I just my first reaction was just my dad comfort to just

273
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.470
Jaime Crouchet: Not be so alone with life, I guess.

274
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So give yourself permission to truly

275
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Get this comfort from dad. Last time it was a hug. Let's see. Let's see what brings comfort so that

276
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Those hands don't have to be ringing and rubbing and so much stress.

277
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This picture what that's like. Just maybe the hands. Notice

278
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They noticing. Now, is this comfort from dad is now present

279
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.790
Jaime Crouchet: Well as soon as you said that when I started paying attention to my hand, there's just enter locked and just laying on my lap. No.

280
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

281
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did they feel sort of on that emotional level is there is there an emotion, has it shifted hasn't changed.

282
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.400
Jaime Crouchet: Just feels more relaxing.

283
00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And in this imagery. What are you and dad doing or what is going on in this room.

284
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.420
Jaime Crouchet: I just pictured my dad telling me it was gonna be okay.

285
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

286
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that

287
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The little girl believes that, let's check on

288
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How true that

289
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.710
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry you cut out again. So

290
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and make sure this little girl believes that everything is going to be okay.

291
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.930
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I believe him.

292
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your hands doing right now.

293
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.560

Gwenevere Abriel: And nurturing wanting the growth for you. The development for you.

448
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Always protected.

449
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And always acknowledged there.

450
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: On the riverbank on the side and

451
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever needed to be at a distance, you can just barely see it now.

452
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice as that weight eating moves.

453
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: From the shoulders down, just this heaviness is aware in the arms.

454
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. Notice the warmth

455
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And wait your arms as they rest.

456
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Be aware of the heaviness.

457
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the thighs, the legs.

458
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: As they get to rest.

459
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice their warmth

460
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring your attention to your natural breath.

461
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit be present.

462
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: At this moment.

463
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just taking the little sounds from your, from your dog taking little sounds from your own breath and many other things in your home maybe through the zoom you might hear some things and just just just tune in.

464
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Returning into the present moment.

465
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What is real.

466
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And concrete unconscious now.

467
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of safety.

468
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And peace.

469
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can. Let's see if we can bring that video back online and maybe I can see it.

470
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

471
00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.610
Jaime Crouchet: Let's do video well

472
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you, what did you observe room for you today.

473
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:53.640
Jaime Crouchet: Well, I guess I didn't really realize what I truly needed

474
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.680
Yeah.

475
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as that team got there. It didn't take you long at all. You, you were unburdened and you just needed that acknowledgement you needed someone to hear you believe you.

476
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So you crazy.

477
00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.100
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

478
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Question yourself.

479
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.760
Jaime Crouchet: Crazy. What we carry around our whole lives.

480
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a nice room you have

481
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.060
Resource there.

482
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you at any time.

483
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And what a lot of people do. Jamie is they when they're confronted with a real trigger

484
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: A real smell a real interaction with someone sent or it's a some visual thing or tactile, whatever it is, if something gets triggered with them.

485
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they're wrapped up in a potential negative future they've imagined in their head, right. That's where anxiety about the future comes up when people go there. You may say I want to go to this room.

486
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do this on your own. You go before you take any action in saying anything doing anything, no decisions until you go and you get what you need in there.

487
00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a place where you can figure it out. There's no pressure. There's, there's just, what do I really need right now.

488
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What's my resource and how can I get it, and you make sure you get it.

489
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:57.420
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

490
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you are like, wow, it's a great those rooms are awesome. A lot. I'll do all their problem solving in there because

491
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can imagine we have all the resources we could possibly imagine.

492
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What what my solution for this dilemma be outside this room, what would it be right. I mean, we get

493
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.450
Jaime Crouchet: In on what's

494
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the actual solution versus this sort of compensation for something and overreaction is something we're outside of already our underlying needs that we come crystal clear on what we need, what we want. What we prefer

495
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would invite you, if you want to write if you're confronted with decisions to be made, or you have something come up that you go inside that space.

496
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you find out

497
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Your problem solving in there.

498
00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the same as

499
00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The box breathing. It's just another technique, except this one isn't bottom up where we're doing working with the organs up that messages to the brain. This one is top down, it means it's we're using the left and right part of our brain.

500
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This is like all the cerebral stuff also effective, but we can be doing it the same time, we could be doing our breathing, as we're in that room.

501
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I need, what do I need, what do I need, what do I want

502
00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You can slow time down and really be present with whatever's coming up.

503
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you'd like to experiment with that this week.

504
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.290
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

505
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:44.880
We did.

506
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: pretty good considering our crummy internet haha

507
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so.

508
00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.800
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah yeah like that.

509
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So yummy feeling

510
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.680
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, it's a little bit heavy at first.

511
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.090
Jaime Crouchet: But finishing out like that definitely just feel lighter

512
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So the, the, the science behind it. The operating Siri, is that what we monitor. So you just brought up some images and

513
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You were monitoring it. You were conscious so basic we say conscious, but I like this monitor whatever we're monitoring we're modifying

514
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just brought stuff up and you changed it. You actually rewire the brain because you sat there with it for those seconds and minutes and yes it was scary and hard and emotional and all that but you changed it to change the chemistry and the wiring in your brain.

515
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's neat.

516
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.640
Jaime Crouchet: Creepy because you like you feel that

517
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So from the top down the message went oh

518
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I have my needs met, and your body started to relax.

519
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The other way with the box breathing right with the diaphragm. That's a signal that comes from the bottom up and tells the brain. Oh, you could stop freaking out. There's really no life threatening danger in the room.

520
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But this this technique went the other way and the message went to the viscera to the muscles and said we're okay we're getting our needs met. There's, there's no danger. Okay, it's kind of neat. You can come at it from different directions.

521
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.160
Yeah.

522
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything

523
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any charge left or do you feel ready to face your day.

524
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.620
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, you feel good about that idea.

525
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Use this imagery to if you bump across some strong emotions.

526
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If you go into this room with your imagery and do a little bit of

527
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem solving in there, let me know.

528
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

529
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.700
Jaime Crouchet: Already so yeah

530
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:03.000
Jaime Crouchet: So before we go I'm, I'm a little concerned about my meds coming up.

531
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:10.440
Jaime Crouchet: So we're good until Monday. But if I have to fly out Wednesday or Friday, how's that going to work.

532
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. I see. Okay, let me, let me just talk that through

533
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.020
Jaime Crouchet: Oh, you cut out

534
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To leave February 5 or February 7

535
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your concern right

536
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: How long would you have to stay out there.

537
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.320
Jaime Crouchet: I can't hear you. Can you hear me.

538
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Test. Yes, I can hear you.

539
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.310
Jaime Crouchet: Um, how long would you have a. Now I can hear you.

540
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How long would you have to stay out there if you flew out Wednesday or Friday. Do you know how long you have to stay

541
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.310
Jaime Crouchet: So I'll be coming back the 22nd.

542
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, that's a long day.

543
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.450
Jaime Crouchet: Two weeks again.

544
00:54:53.220 --> 00:55:00.660
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, but she wrote. She wrote meds for almost 30 days which it just, I don't want

545
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:10.830
Jaime Crouchet: I'm just so worried about stuff that happens with that. So it'd be great if she could stick with writing it for the 15 days.

546
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.110
Jaime Crouchet: I you cut out again.

547
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:14.670
Jaime Crouchet: Are you

548
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.990
Jaime Crouchet: You can hear me because

549
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you. I can hear you.

550
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you.

551
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no.

552
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you worried that you'll take more than you're supposed to or

553
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:38.790
Jaime Crouchet: No, no, I'm actually very proud of myself for what I do take like I I'm fully confident in what I take, I just

554
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:50.040
Jaime Crouchet: It just stresses me out. Like, I don't, because you know that first hotel. I went to in San Francisco. When I left my stuff there. And then they didn't turn in, like, that's the kind of stuff. I'm worried about. I was scared.

555
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.180
Jaime Crouchet: I'm

556
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:52.110
Jaime Crouchet: scared to death of that.

557
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, it sounds like you're going to take enough medication.

558
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, for the entire trip and

559
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You can look at it as a negative reinforcer. In other words, this is a continuing to be a motivator of the inconvenience of being on a drug.

560
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:16.680
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

561
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It might serve you.

562
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To say look at what a pain in the ass. This is

563
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To continue to say I when I start to think, I'm not going to taper. I'm going to remember what a drag this is it's a drag

564
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.320
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

565
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting you're going to get there, we, you don't need anything. You're not going to need it anymore. Okay.

566
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:38.670
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I

567
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean it's for

568
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Four to six. You've already seen that pinch come push come to shove she's she will

569
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Should the thing is, is what she didn't say is it's not good for her medical license to prescribe outside the state so

570
00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. If she really needs to not do that.

571
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't say that part. But I had heard that from other doctors, so

572
00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:03.900
Jaime Crouchet: That's

573
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A scenario. You've already seen that she'll do it.

574
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.010
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

575
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:23.400
Jaime Crouchet: Right, so. But if she prescribes this week so that I can pick up before I go. Should I talk. My company into Friday because then I'm only picking up two days early

576
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my question, I gotta keep it really simple, really simple for me.

577
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I just need to know specifically because I thought I heard if you have three weeks covered. Then you have enough medicine, then I think you're fine, but I'm curing fuzziness um, do you have enough medicine to get you through. Let me see if I can do it.

578
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:49.980
Jaime Crouchet: I have enough medicine right now to get me through our next next week's what I'm one which is Monday.

579
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:57.630
Jaime Crouchet: But I fly out either Wednesday or Friday before then.

580
00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.760
Jaime Crouchet: Do you see what I'm saying.

581
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I do but you said she wrote for three weeks.

582
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.590
Jaime Crouchet: Right, two weeks ago.

583
00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

584
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.010
Jaime Crouchet: last trip. Yeah.

585
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on.

586
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.100
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry, I would, I

587
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:16.170
Jaime Crouchet: Would

588
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

589
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:25.260
