00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.040
Richelle Direny: Like

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.860
Richelle Direny: It's almost like when you, um, what do you call this, but like it when you're in one location and they like exactly what another location. What do you call those

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:06.510
Jennifer C.: Right, I know john about green like a green train yeah yeah yeah yeah like that. Let me pick which ones because it was that are a picture. There's a picture I didn't move

13
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.750
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, give me a moment.

14
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, so are you still there.

15
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.300
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I'm here.

16
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.910
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, so you met with I believe it's Natalie right

17
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:36.090
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you do your medical and not okay. So for this our session now is just going to be just the information gathering. That's what the bio is just kind of getting a little bit of background information.

18
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:49.890
Richelle Direny: So good session would be to develop your treatment plan. Yes, your treatment plan. So typically what we go over in the first session is kind of basically to explain

19
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:59.670
Richelle Direny: Um, you know what the program is and you know our time, our time together your group, I believe you met with Natalie, you said right

20
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.780
Richelle Direny: Your group is going to be on Thursdays at one o'clock. Is that a good time for you to meet for groups. Yeah.

21
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.770
Jennifer C.: How long are they

22
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.590
Richelle Direny: About 45 minutes to an hour.

23
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.590
Jennifer C.: Yeah that should be fine. As long as I'm out by like two

24
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.590
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, well you both doing. Yeah.

25
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.350
Jennifer C.: Yeah, yeah. That should be fine.

26
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

27
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.110
Richelle Direny: We'll meet every Thursday at one o'clock. There are different. There are times where

28
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.280
Richelle Direny: You know, if I'm the only one running the group because Natalie can't make it. But typically, we do run the groups together.

29
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.640
Richelle Direny: That's, you know, the plan is that we run the groups together. And at that time I think she does her medication check in on that, on that time. And then, you know, I'll go over

30
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.730
Richelle Direny: Whatever the topic is for that day and we just asked, especially when we're meeting for group. It's that you're always have

31
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.240
Richelle Direny: The headset plugged in, because

32
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.120
Richelle Direny: You will have more than one people there.

33
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.080
Richelle Direny: Right.

34
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580
Jennifer C.: No, I think I have to just to use the phone anyway.

35
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.710
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, like

36
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.350
Jennifer C.: I don't think it will let me use it without headphones.

37
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.080
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Yeah, no problem.

38
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.620
Jennifer C.: I've tried to you, but I don't think I'm quite figured that part out yet.

39
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.260
Jennifer C.: So no

40
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.060
Richelle Direny: That's fine, um, you know, again, a lot of that is just more for

41
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.770
Richelle Direny: You know the confidentiality of other people.

42
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.430
Jennifer C.: Right, right.

43
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:45.540
Richelle Direny: You're sharing or whatnot, um, you know, when we meet for individuals, I just always ask if you're unable to make it, you could just send me a message like you did today just to say hey show, you know what, I'm not going to be made. I'm not gonna, I'm not able to make it for the

44
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.700
Jennifer C.: Individuals or for the group, especially

45
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.950
Richelle Direny: For the individuals because the individuals like I'm literally sitting here waiting for you to

46
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.420
Jennifer C.: Write

47
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.640
Richelle Direny: You understand, I mean groups are a little bit different. It would, you know, out of courtesy. If you just say hey, or you send a message saying I'm not going to be able to make it for the group.

48
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.520
Richelle Direny: And if you need a medication check in. I can always just let me know. But especially for individuals.

49
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:21.960
Richelle Direny: On after I typically say after 15 minutes, kind of like when you're going to your doctor's appointment after 15 minutes I just say, Okay, we're gonna have to reschedule because then if you come late, then you run into somebody else's time if we have someone else.

50
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.030
Jennifer C.: Right, right. I get it.

51
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:39.150
Richelle Direny: So, um, you know, when these are recorded sessions are video sessions. The they are recorded session. So for the most part, whatever is said is confidential unless you state, something that

52
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:48.810
Richelle Direny: You want you voice that you want to hurt yourself or anyone else and or have like an active plan to hurt yourself or anyone else, then of course, you know, I think.

53
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.120
Jennifer C.: Whoa, yeah. So

54
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.760
Jennifer C.: Mandate yes

55
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.280
Jennifer C.: Exactly. Yeah. Sure. So

56
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:13.320
Richelle Direny: Outside of that, overall, you know, it's, you know, we also at the end of our time together. Now we will determine how we would schedule the individuals, whether it will be once a week, once every other week, once a month. It just really depends on where you're at.

57
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.980
Richelle Direny: Okay so far you have any questions.

58
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.530
Jennifer C.: No. Okay.

59
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.440
Richelle Direny: All right then. So let's just get started.

60
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:36.510
Jennifer C.: I think the only thing that I didn't do was the blood work because my son. I think deleted all of my emails like I went into my emails and there is none.

61
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.520
Richelle Direny: Alvin C.

62
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.510
Three.

63
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.690
Jennifer C.: So that's why I need the blood work when she says she's gonna send it back to me like when I called it got into the meeting.

64
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:59.400
Jennifer C.: To get the number or whatever that she sent me for your room. Yes, she said she was going to send me another one. So I started to get the blood work and then I still have to make

65
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:10.620
Jennifer C.: An appointment. I don't think we made an appointment for the two weeks because we have so much difficulty getting my medication, but it was hell on earth.

66
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.010
Richelle Direny: Let me double check for you.

67
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.790
Richelle Direny: You're talking about with Natalie right

68
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.870
Yeah.

69
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.730
Jennifer C.: Yeah, it would be for I'm assuming Monday this coming Monday.

70
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.650
Jennifer C.: And hopefully, this time, we don't have any problems.

71
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:43.650
Jennifer C.: Or maybe she'll even do it might even do it for Sunday because they cut me one sort at the pharmacy. Okay, I had to end up buying some of them with money.

72
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.040
Jennifer C.: And then care sores would go and cover like 27 so it was still short one.

73
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.840
Jennifer C.: So they like it's all messed up the way they do it here is messed up writing wouldn't do it at all.

74
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.480
Richelle Direny: I don't know, based on her calendar. I don't know how they schedule her because based on her calendar, she's on here.

75
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.540
Richelle Direny: I don't see any. I don't know if they spend per, per day. I don't have a schedule.

76
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.190
Jennifer C.: Okay, so then I guess I would just text her then. Or would I just call the the

77
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.910
Richelle Direny: Discussion caught call

78
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.470
Richelle Direny: Her

79
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:45.510
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I'm hoping next time. It's not as much trouble because it was literally like three days and trying to get medication from the pharmacy.

80
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.820
Richelle Direny: So like I said, our first session. Our first group session is going to be on Thursday.

81
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.660
Richelle Direny: So maybe taking with her on that day to find that one.

82
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.970
Jennifer C.: Okay, yeah, that would work.

83
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:11.280
Richelle Direny: Okay. Alright, so let's just get started. So each of our sessions will always be roughly between 45 minutes to an hour.

84
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.290
Jennifer C.: Now unless I know

85
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:25.650
Richelle Direny: There's a crisis or what have you. And the other thing is that if you ever, like experience in a crisis or whatever the situation is, you can always, you know, reach out for session. If you do fine.

86
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.000
Richelle Direny: Okay, um, how did you hear about bright heart.

87
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.310
Jennifer C.: It was a friend of mine.

88
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:42.330
Jennifer C.: And it was like, Oh, it was months ago, like it was in at the end of summer beginning of fall last year.

89
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.710
Jennifer C.: But when I called I had to live because I live in Ohio. I had to wait 30 days or something.

90
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:59.790
Jennifer C.: And by the time they called it was only this past few weeks that they called so all this past month I've already been going to another doctor

91
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.300
Richelle Direny: So you'll be going to another doctor

92
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:11.130
Jennifer C.: No, I was going to another doctor and I just switched over to bright heart so that I don't have to drive all the way out to another doctor

93
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.320
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you were getting you were using you're getting Suboxone

94
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.120
Jennifer C.: prescribed to right yeah because it took me months to get any you guys

95
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:31.800
Richelle Direny: Oh ok ok ok yeah i know i believe they do have a waitlist so now everyone in our guest is getting taken on the waitlist on let me have a provider.

96
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.840
Richelle Direny: Yeah, okay. Um. Now, have you ever

97
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.130
Richelle Direny: Gone through any type of treatment programs.

98
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:52.410
Jennifer C.: Not and so there was one right before I got into the last one that I was in, but it was for a very short time. So I got shut down.

99
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.210
Richelle Direny: And that was the only what is it a detox or like a

100
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:18.480
Jennifer C.: No, it was basically just like you guys are like I go in for my doctor's appointment I started off once a week for four weeks and then once you had four weeks of clean your hands. Then you go to two weeks and then every week or every two weeks, whatever was I did an hour.

101
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:31.800
Jennifer C.: Worth of counseling. It was like 30 minutes of a group session. And then the last 30 minutes was an individual session. And then I seen a nurse and then the doctor and all that stuff.

102
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.570
Richelle Direny: They kind of like a rehab, but the outpatient like i o p type thing.

103
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.710
Jennifer C.: It was just like, it's about like so box and Dr.

104
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. But you so so you were doing it.

105
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.490
Jennifer C.: Was it

106
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:51.270
Jennifer C.: It wasn't like a like a real like you didn't, we didn't. I didn't do any detox like I had to go and do it myself.

107
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.960
Richelle Direny: But you saw a therapist and a nurse and you

108
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.310
Jennifer C.: Right, right, right.

109
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.860
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Now that's the only kind of program program you've ever been in.

110
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:03.990
Richelle Direny: Oh,

111
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.720
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I mean, I'm fairly new. It's only been since

112
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.690
Jennifer C.: Probably September, October.

113
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.530
Richelle Direny: How, so if you can just

114
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:24.060
Richelle Direny: Get a little insight into your history of, you know, whether it's substance abuse alcohol.

115
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:36.000
Jennifer C.: Whatever it was, um, it was a while. It started off when I had my first daughter I when I was pregnant. My OB put me on Vikings and she's 12 now.

116
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:48.240
Jennifer C.: And I was on them with her for migraines. And then when I was pregnant, my second daughter, who's now nine I had my gallbladder was like going out while I was pregnant.

117
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.310
Jennifer C.: And

118
00:12:52.050 --> 00:13:10.200
Jennifer C.: I had mastitis in my left breast with her. So that was like sliced open like four times where they are. They like come out and stuff it with God's so I was on the whole time I was trading with her. The old time after that and then basically by then I was hooked.

119
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:29.220
Jennifer C.: And I mean I was already, you know, nine years worth it doesn't take that long to get hooked on on violence and then eventually it moved to Percocet and it was just stuck there. And then when my husband went to prison last year for marijuana. I had to get also

120
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.190
Jennifer C.: It's just me and my three kids.

121
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.670
Jennifer C.: Don't really have a choice.

122
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.340
Richelle Direny: And

123
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.370
Richelle Direny: So, you know, we're never really exposed to any kind of

124
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.750
Jennifer C.: Any I'm gonna not anything hardcore no

125
00:13:49.980 --> 00:14:03.030
Jennifer C.: Mean I had messed up. I'd mess with cocaine every once in a while. But as far as like heroin or like math or alcohol. My dad's an alcoholic. I always say I'm it's never been something that was for me.

126
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.830
Jennifer C.: And the other day, I just never

127
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.290
Jennifer C.: Had an interest in

128
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.550
Richelle Direny: So you're so your introduction, just to kind of the whole I'm

129
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:24.510
Richelle Direny: Taking any kind of or being on any kind of substance was due to the pregnancies and

130
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:32.100
Jennifer C.: Right, right. Like my OB had me on them through all three pregnancies and then eventually my

131
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:48.810
Jennifer C.: Well, I guess. Yeah, I probably did start out my first daughter in the migraines, because I found out that I had a vertebrates out of place in my neck, which would cause me to get real bad migraines. So I did go to like a neurologist that had put me on Vikings.

132
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.600
Richelle Direny: Did you get into an accident at some point.

133
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.650
Nope.

134
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.190
Jennifer C.: I was never an accident, nothing.

135
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.300
Richelle Direny: So, so you were born like that with your vertebrae.

136
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.520
Jennifer C.: I know no clue.

137
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.740
Jennifer C.: No idea.

138
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.570
Jennifer C.: No clue. They're still there, and I still get migraines.

299
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.600
Jennifer C.: My dad remarried. One of my best friend's moms, but that didn't work out very well.

300
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.510
Richelle Direny: Your best friend's mom.

301
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:31.260
Jennifer C.: Yep. But that was when we were in like seventh or eighth grade that didn't that didn't work out very well for him.

302
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.980
Richelle Direny: Oh, what did you do your best friend.

303
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.480
Jennifer C.: Oh well, I mean, yeah, she's still my well she's she still is, who I would still consider my sister. We just don't talk

304
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.820
Jennifer C.: Kind of grew up, you know, we all grew up and had kids, and she she ended up going off and getting on Dumb Dumb Dumb, dumb shit.

305
00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.660
Jennifer C.: Like where she's three years younger than me lost all her teeth and everything. I'm not about that.

306
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.370
Richelle Direny: You have three children. A 12 year old a nine year old and a three.

307
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.600
Jennifer C.: Yep.

308
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:17.370
Richelle Direny: No history of mental illness, no history of thoughts of suicide or anything like that. Anything of that nature.

309
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.090
Jennifer C.: I didn't go through like postpartum or anything like that.

310
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:31.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, and your husband. Now, did your husband. You said your husband had a history of substance abuse or it was just marijuana, then

311
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:47.340
Jennifer C.: It was marijuana but I'm sure like when we first got together. We were neither one of us did anything. And then, I'm assuming, like he just kind of drifted into it when I drifted into it from this Cajun shit.

312
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.770
Jennifer C.: People. He hung out with

313
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.190
Jennifer C.: We've been married 12 years

314
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:54.960
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

315
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.380
Jennifer C.: And we've been together about 15 so

316
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.120
Jennifer C.: It's kind of hard to gauge exactly where it picked up. I don't remember a lot of them.

317
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:21.240
Jennifer C.: After a while after doing pain pills for a while, it kind of numbs all of your feelings so you don't really have feelings. So when you stop taking this stuff.

318
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.320
Jennifer C.: You get all and feelings all at one time.

319
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:27.360
On it. Oh.

320
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.800
Jennifer C.: Yeah. Yeah, like when you when you take paying bills. It just knows everything.

321
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.480
Jennifer C.: I mean,

322
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.840
Jennifer C.: Percocet. I'm not gonna lie. It's a great medication.

323
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.220
Jennifer C.: And I loved it, but I just can't do it no more.

324
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.660
Jennifer C.: No I don't, I can't do it no more.

325
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.230
Richelle Direny: And so you got to is it after

326
00:30:54.090 --> 00:31:13.170
Jennifer C.: Yes, it was after he went to prison. Like my husband went to prison in March and I found out that my 31 year old sister had the cancer in June, she passed away right before Christmas. So it was like literally a few months before she passed away. She got pneumonia.

327
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.070
Jennifer C.: And had complications from that passed away.

328
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.770
Richelle Direny: Also heard from from diagnosis to passing it was a few months.

329
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.760
Um,

330
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:31.320
Jennifer C.: She was staged for like when they caught it. She was staged for they kept telling her for like five years that it was a UTI.

331
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:49.890
Jennifer C.: And then when she finally they finally caught it like her kidney was the size of a watermelon and then they went into and put the state in for the kidney and found the cancer, like you they like this. That's all where they found it.

332
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.510
Jennifer C.: Like they didn't do any scans or anything like that. You need me to blow your nose.

333
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.190
Jennifer C.: You sure

334
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.110
Jennifer C.: So it wasn't like they were looking for it, they found it by chance.

335
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.520
Jennifer C.: And yeah, look man.

336
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.690
Richelle Direny: And so you said like in. So in the last year you've went through.

337
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.710
Richelle Direny: Some major

338
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.520
Jennifer C.: Yeah. Yep.

339
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.380
Richelle Direny: And with all of them. Did you have like a relapse, did you start, you know,

340
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.670
Jennifer C.: I mean I'm I've done to where like, I'll go

341
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:40.860
Jennifer C.: Where. That's why I quit going to the last doctor last Dr only how to me on to, like, they started me off on the three a day for two weeks and then just drop me down to two a day.

342
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:49.890
Jennifer C.: And I had been on the three day from the previous place. So now wasn't comfortable with the two a day with having three kids like I got three kids.

343
00:32:50.250 --> 00:33:00.750
Jennifer C.: I was working doordash and working another job living on my own paying all my bills like I just could not do it on the two a day and I found myself running out.

344
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:11.040
Jennifer C.: And having to like go and supplement. So I would have to go and like take Percocet, for a day or something like that. And I just, I'm just not

345
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.670
Jennifer C.: I just don't want to do that. No more.

346
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:24.030
Jennifer C.: So that's why I that's what me and Natalie mainly talked about was seeing if we get down on the three a day that's the main reason why I switched

347
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.620
Jennifer C.: Because I was tired. I was tired of running out.

348
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.830
Richelle Direny: And you weren't you weren't able to

349
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:48.210
Jennifer C.: Sustain I was right and I kept having these like like needs feelings that like I'm gonna end up going and using again. And there were some times where I went to go use again. But it wasn't like for you to sell my car alarm you little shit.

350
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.100
Jennifer C.: I'm saying

351
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:53.520
Jennifer C.: I'm

352
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.820
Jennifer C.: Sorry about that.

353
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:12.000
Jennifer C.: It wasn't for like a long periods of time, like it was literally like if I was out of the box and for a day, I would buy like one or two Percocet and take him for a day, and that was when right when my sister passed away.

354
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.170
Jennifer C.: And that was right around my birthday so

355
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.990
Richelle Direny: I when you said that you start using it and you need

356
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.750
Richelle Direny: Medication

357
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.250
Jennifer C.: What is it

358
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.150
Richelle Direny: Would start using again that

359
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.910
Richelle Direny: Were of the Percocet, or or finding

360
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.370
Jennifer C.: Well, it would just be simply because I was running out of my Suboxone

361
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:49.680
Jennifer C.: Like, and then I would have the herbs eat like I like it would be like three days before I go back to the doctor because he wouldn't have been my old doctor went up them.

362
00:34:51.840 --> 00:35:02.310
Jennifer C.: He dropped me off of for the three a day way to quickly as what the is what Natalie said. I mean, when you're on the box and even a quarter, like a quarter of a girl is a lot

363
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.320
Jennifer C.: Well, you have to gradually go down.

364
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.110
Here.

365
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.950
Richelle Direny: Definitely. See, you know, the onset of the depression. And that's a lot to go through. So with your with

366
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:34.980
Your husband.

367
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:47.730
Jennifer C.: And my two daughters are in school during the day and my son is with me during the day and then like when I go doordash the stuff I usually just take them with me.

368
00:35:48.450 --> 00:36:03.450
Jennifer C.: And then the other job I was working third shift, but it wasn't working out like it was me. I don't know if I was having like anxiety being Where's my kids or what, but it just

369
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:17.670
Jennifer C.: It wasn't working out with me so I I left there like I couldn't work third shift was they were wanting me to work 13 days in a row before I had a day off. And it just wasn't working out. So I'm currently looking for another job.

370
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.670
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what kind of work do

371
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.110
Jennifer C.: That place was a place where we made

372
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.510
Jennifer C.: It was basically like a factory where we made. I was a

373
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:38.640
Jennifer C.: Chrome later like a chrome plated rods that went into the

374
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.460
Jennifer C.: struts in socks on cars.

375
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.070
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

376
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.650
Jennifer C.: Like I just put rods on onto a conveyor belt and they got chrome plated

377
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.340
Richelle Direny: Okay. Now, what's your highest level of schooling.

378
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.470
Jennifer C.: Some college

379
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.820
Richelle Direny: And do you have any legal um

380
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:11.190
Richelle Direny: Any kind of legal issues pending legal

381
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:21.630
Jennifer C.: No, no, no. I'm the well I guess maybe so the school called CPS on me because of my one daughter.

382
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.750
Jennifer C.: But

383
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:31.290
Jennifer C.: Cuz she just wasn't wanting to go to school and it's not even that she wasn't wanting to go to school. She's got a lot of

384
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.860
Jennifer C.: Issues with UC eyes and stuff herself, and we just found a spot on her kidney and

385
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:46.380
Jennifer C.: When I was going through all this stuff with my sister from her, you know, being sick and then wanting to spend time with her and stuff. The school is don't like it.

386
00:37:46.860 --> 00:38:04.350
Jennifer C.: I mean their state regulations so there's so many, so many days that you can have for doctor's notes and the other days when they're visiting their dad or, you know, wanted to spend a day with their aunt before she died, they don't like them is missing them days. So it is what it is.

387
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:24.810
Jennifer C.: The caseworkers been out and stuff like I've already talked to the caseworker basically they want us to get into some grief counseling at the local hospice, which I called there and they have like art class on Thursday nights and they want

388
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:33.990
Jennifer C.: Me to talk to the principal about the teacher ended up the teacher ended up calling saying something because my daughter was either crying.

389
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:44.070
Jennifer C.: Because she misses her dad are crying because she misses her aunt or crying because their stomach hurt when she was there because she she's got an underdeveloped bladder.

390
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:54.630
Jennifer C.: And get like it's almost like she has a constant UCI well the teacher decided to throw in there that she was afraid of sexual abuse at home.

391
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.020
Jennifer C.: So that's called me pretty fired up.

392
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.750
Richelle Direny: After this is after your husband when

393
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.490
Jennifer C.: This was two weeks ago.

394
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.000
Jennifer C.: CPS was just here two weeks ago.

395
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.270
Richelle Direny: So,

396
00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.290
Richelle Direny: The teacher

397
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:30.420
Jennifer C.: Yeah, basically, the teacher, like, you know, I already knew that I was going to be in some sort of trouble because they're missing school or so much school without doctor's notes. It's not like you can ask the prison to write a doctor's note.

398
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:39.210
Jennifer C.: You know, so it's either. I had to make a choice. Let them go see their dad or not.

399
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:50.100
Jennifer C.: And make them go to school, um, what's it's a hard to get in there on Saturdays at the prison. They don't have very many of them that are open.

400
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.420
Jennifer C.: Like a book they booked up super fast.

401
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.240
Richelle Direny: They're all so he's local there in

402
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.970
Jennifer C.: Games about 45 minutes away.

403
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:07.320
Richelle Direny: Got You Got you. So now it's an old. It's a pending, it's still open investigation.

404
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:14.670
Jennifer C.: Yeah, she's got to come out and like, check out the house, one more time and make sure that I'm jumping through all the hoops, you know,

405
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:29.670
Jennifer C.: She basically told me to talk to the principal about the teacher see if we can get the teacher switch was I already tried to they said they don't think they can this late in the year, which I don't think I'm going to be up to that.

406
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:34.200
Jennifer C.: So I'll probably have to put her in homeschooling for at least the remainder of this year.

407
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:46.740
Jennifer C.: Yeah, because if not the only other option is they're going to take me to court and I'm going to end up going to jail for them listen to my school

408
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.810
Richelle Direny: Oh, well, yeah. Because with this with the school thing. Yeah. If you don't have

409
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.510
Richelle Direny: A whole lot of things to show why they're rich

410
00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:19.980
Jennifer C.: And which I mean, at the time, like I was living with my sister taking care of her daughter, her, her, her daughter that was 10 which is my kids, his cousin plus my kids plus my sister, plus a baby that she just adopted before she found out she had cancer and it was just me.

411
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:35.640
Jennifer C.: So it was me and five kids in like six dogs and one house, and it was just like, I didn't really give a shit about grounding a doctor's note, I didn't not take him to the doctor. I was didn't unless they shove the doctor's note in my face.

412
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.870
Jennifer C.: Like I just did not always remember to ask for doctors

413
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.010
Jennifer C.: And then when she was passing away, what do you want me to do. So they wanted the week of school.

414
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.430
Jennifer C.: She was literally in the hospital dying. They can kiss my ass.

415
00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:00.240
Jennifer C.: Mouth, then that's pretty much how I feel about that one.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.570
Richelle Direny: That because with the Suboxone for like you were doing it when

427
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:06.690
Richelle Direny: You

428
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.340
Richelle Direny: The other program that you visit

429
00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:14.850
Richelle Direny: The doctor and a nurse.

430
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.040
Right. Oh.

431
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.660
Who

432
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:28.050
Richelle Direny: Are you interested. Should I ask are you interested in doing one on one individuals.

433
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:37.500
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I can do one when individuals and there's days that I will leave one on one individually, because there's days where there's days where I'll just come in crying.

434
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.350
Richelle Direny: I mean, it is a lot to be going through all in one year they. It's a lot

435
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:53.880
Jennifer C.: It's alarming Christmas just past like she just asked on the 17th so December month

436
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.350
Richelle Direny: Today, makes it two months.

437
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.710
Jennifer C.: Yeah, so like it's, it's, I mean, I've been a hell of a lot about here. Yes.

438
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.410
Richelle Direny: I agree. I agree.

439
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:17.130
Jennifer C.: I mean there's days like I already know there's days where I'm going to mess up. There's days where I do want to just go out and get a couple of paint mills and i just i just i just don't. I just don't want to do that no work.

440
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.360
Richelle Direny: Innovating you to not do that now.

441
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:22.710
My kids.

442
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.580
Richelle Direny: Being there for them and not having to another parent because one is in person.

443
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.240
Right.

444
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.570
Richelle Direny: Actually, I mean, that's a good motivation.

445
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.580
Jennifer C.: Like I have no one else to take them.

446
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.810
Jennifer C.: I had my sister and she's gone.

447
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.360
Richelle Direny: There's your mom and dad live close by.

448
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.470
Jennifer C.: The other they live close by. But my dad is still so slight he's still so sick from the pancreatitis.

449
00:44:49.830 --> 00:45:05.730
Jennifer C.: Plus, he's got like a heart problem. He just keeps saying, All I gotta do is make it through March before I can die. He goes, I'll get his life insurance policy that's how he thinks the ship. My dad is a money. Do it. He's always been about money, money, money, money, money, money.

450
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:12.210
Jennifer C.: I mean, that's, I guess he made us to make a lot of money. He was in the military for 20 years

451
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.170
Jennifer C.: He's still makes a lot of money, not being in the military.

452
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.830
Richelle Direny: So when he said that you will get his, um,

453
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:26.220
Jennifer C.: Yeah, yeah. So that's all he all he thinks about now is him getting through March.

454
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:32.010
Jennifer C.: So why they want him to get probably because they want him to get a heart of stone and as far

455
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.460
Jennifer C.: Because march 1 is when his, his when his

456
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.640
Jennifer C.: Insurance kicks in.

457
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.770
Jennifer C.: His policy.

458
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.400
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you're the only one that will get the points that you and your brother and

459
00:45:51.330 --> 00:46:06.270
Jennifer C.: It's me and my brother, but my brother gets another policy or some crap. And then I get one. I don't know, but he just had to go and switch them all back around again because my sister and it's just been it's just been a mess. I can't really give a shit less about that.

460
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.270
Richelle Direny: Well, listen, you do

461
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:17.580
Richelle Direny: You do, definitely. What would you like to our time together when we meet, and we can meet every other week, unless you want to meet weekly

462
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.470
Jennifer C.: Everybody's fine.

463
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:28.470
Richelle Direny: Okay, um, how, what are the bed. Are you for. Right. Are your, you said you do go out and work right. You're not a stay at home mom.

464
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.920
Jennifer C.: I mean I technically I am because I basically work with door DASH, BUT I take my kids with me.

465
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:52.980
Jennifer C.: Especially for the time being, just because like I would leave my 12 year old home with them, but I don't want to leave my kids here CPS is going to just pop in at the door. You know, so I don't really get a lot of time for myself, um,

466
00:46:54.090 --> 00:47:05.610
Jennifer C.: But that's okay because I only have till March of next year. So my husband's home and everything should be all good. Again, I didn't have before he went, I didn't have to do anything. I have to work.

467
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.860
Jennifer C.: I mean, he's in. He's in prison for two years for 100 pounds of marijuana

468
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.590
Richelle Direny: Oh, wow.

469
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:31.050
Jennifer C.: Yeah, so, and it was literally like a month before it was legalized and it wasn't even his like was we split up for like two months, and it was where you went to go stay at they didn't have any water on he put it in his name, which was a really dumb ass moves.

470
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.730
Jennifer C.: So he got busted sit on top of the shit, you know,

471
00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:47.640
Jennifer C.: It is what it is before then. He works. He works 50 hours a week he made really good money. He was a supervisor at a medical

472
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.470
Jennifer C.: A medical equipment distribution for therapy support. So it's not like you know

473
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.490
Jennifer C.: We were ever these like bad people running the streets.

474
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:05.790
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I'm looking at my calendar. Now, when

475
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.940
Richelle Direny: We can schedule is going to be in March.

476
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:09.990
Okay.

477
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:12.840
Richelle Direny: Right now.

478
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:14.310
Jennifer C.: I have evening.

479
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.870
Richelle Direny: Available, it will be more

480
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.220
Jennifer C.: That's fine, even easier better anyway.

481
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:37.380
Jennifer C.: Cuz I usually don't get home until after like 430 from picking my like visor cuz I gotta take to the both girls. I got to take both of them to school and pick them up from school. So that's another reason why it's all really hard for me to get a job work in between.

482
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.030
Richelle Direny: Okay, what the fourth at eight o'clock be fine.

488
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:17.970
Richelle Direny: That you're going through and those are not just little things. Those are some really big things that you're going through

489
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:19.950
Jennifer C.: Right in

490
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:27.780
Richelle Direny: doing it by yourself with three children, one child and a toddler. That's a lot to be doing.

491
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:31.140
Jennifer C.: A lot right and you know my 12 year old. She helps me a lot.

492
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:32.940
Jennifer C.: But she also wants to be 12

493
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:40.830
Jennifer C.: You know at that age, they only understand so much and she's had to grow up a lot, but she shouldn't have to

494
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:48.690
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I know. She said that she shouldn't have to watch her little brother, hold on. She needs to be able to go out and stay stay with friends and go out and do it to

495
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:56.010
Jennifer C.: So like my family, all these oh well you got Peyton. No, I don't have Peyton. Peyton as a kid paint needs to stay a kid.

496
00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.090
Richelle Direny: I agree wholeheartedly agree.

497
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:03.300

500
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:21.960
Jennifer C.: Like when I was doing that other job. The third shifting she she understood. She had to put you know her little brother to bed and stuff.

501
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:31.200
Jennifer C.: But the weren't comfortable with me not being here, like they weren't going to bed themselves, but she would be taxed, you know, four in the morning, I was not comfortable with that.

502
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.650
Jennifer C.: Because they weren't comfortable with me being gone

503
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:45.120
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm. So the, the third ship job just didn't work out. I'm going to find something between the hours like

Andriana Clark: Yeah.

545
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:19.020
Andriana Clark: The cops came and they just pretty much my husband had a warrant for unpaid funds for driving under suspension. He had from 2015 so he ended up getting arrested and he was supposed to be at work the next morning, so I had to pay $750 the bond amount that I had a $600 electric bill.

546
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:32.610
Andriana Clark: And then as soon as we got him out of jail, he went back to work. And then we ended up having another electric bill that came in that was 400 and some dollars that we had to pay immediately or they were just connecting

547
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:45.810
Andriana Clark: We were like, way beyond because we were on Fifth at one time and then once he started making too much to be on Fifth and they want it for a month. And we were kind of behind

548
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.090
Richelle Direny: Oh,

549
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:48.990

Richelle Direny: So do you be back to work, or he's um

551
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.560
Andriana Clark: It's back to work. He ended up on the

552
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:05.460
Andriana Clark: He went back to work. And he was out on the boat for 17 days and then it came back home any went to court. Few days after he came them and the

553
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:13.980
Andriana Clark: Judge told him just to pay the fund off that he is, and she's going to drop all the charges because I don't even know why they arrest. Have you ever found someone says,

554
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:21.120
Andriana Clark: No, that's fine. I guess we're already sent to the credit here.

555
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.340
Andriana Clark: But they did forfeit his license until he taped also

556
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:28.740
Richelle Direny: Wow.

557
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:33.120

Andriana Clark: And then Dr. Jamison prescribes the third row which

594
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:35.310

597
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:52.380
Andriana Clark: That might have to do with me sleeping more with until

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:46.500
Richelle Direny: So why what happened with that one. You weren't connecting with it or do you just haven't found the time

Richelle Direny: Yeah. Oh.

630
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.820
Richelle Direny: So the, the biggest change since we've last met, which was back in

631
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.940
Richelle Direny: The last time we met was

632
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.040
Richelle Direny: Back in December.

633
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:16.290
Richelle Direny: I think you joined a group. Yeah, it was all back in December, you came to a group on the day after Christmas.

634
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.490
Richelle Direny: And then we had an individual session.

635
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:23.850
Richelle Direny: Two weeks prior to that.

636
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.570
Andriana Clark: Wow, that has been a while ago.

637
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.990
Richelle Direny: And I know one of the things that we talked about in our last time meeting was, um,

638
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.880
Richelle Direny: Knowing the source knowing and understanding the source of your anxiety and your anger.

639
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.320
Richelle Direny: Have you done

640
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.350
Richelle Direny: Have you done any exploring where that is concerned.

641
01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:02.280
Andriana Clark: A little bit, but not not a lot like I haven't really been too angry or anything. I just

642
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.200
Andriana Clark: I don't know.

643
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.180
Richelle Direny: Well, so there's the whole situation that would be

644
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.880
Richelle Direny: anxiety provoking.

645
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:29.130
Richelle Direny: First, there's the anger than the anxiety that precedes right after that, after kind of the anger dissipates.

646
01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:42.060
Richelle Direny: With the whole situation with the dog and the threats and what have you. Like, how, how did all of that play out for you mentally and emotionally, not just in the moment, but times after that.

647
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:45.630
Andriana Clark: I'm

648
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:48.960
Andriana Clark: In the moment

649
01:05:50.640 --> 01:06:09.870
Andriana Clark: When it first happened, and he was arguing with my husband and I heard them threaten my dog, and I just kind of blacked out and jumped up and I was trying to go after him to fight him and my husband grabbed ahold of me, and he told me and out the door shut, and call me down.

650
01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:19.890
Andriana Clark: And I was just, I don't know, I heard and started my animal and then my family and I just kind of black out and

651
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.110
Andriana Clark: Ready to start fighting

652
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:26.970
Richelle Direny: You said that you were the one ready to fight him.

653
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:29.460
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

654
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:32.430
Richelle Direny: Oh, wow. So you're, um,

655
01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:36.300
Richelle Direny: But so in the moment you felt like you were

656
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.430
Richelle Direny: Somewhat defending your rights.

657
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:43.140
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

658
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:45.750
Andriana Clark: Okay.

659
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.740
Richelle Direny: Where did the for you. Where did the anxiety come from.

660
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:50.400
Richelle Direny: After that,

661
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.350
There was some anxiety.

662
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.730
Andriana Clark: After that, after the cops came

663
01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.010
Andriana Clark: And my husband went to jail. And I just

664
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.980
Andriana Clark: It was like I felt like everything was my fault because I didn't know how to control my getting that

665
01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:12.690
Andriana Clark: Group go

666
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:17.430
Andriana Clark: Whoa boxy quick, come here.

667
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:20.100
Andriana Clark: Okay, we'll put it down.

668
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.140
Andriana Clark: You get out of here.

669
01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.720
Richelle Direny: Now, how has it been with your neighbors, since that

670
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.210
Andriana Clark: The cops told me, just anything to them.

671
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.790
Andriana Clark: Roxy. Yeah.

672
01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:43.290
Andriana Clark: Oh my gosh, that's so good.

673
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:55.140
Andriana Clark: Because to me, not to say anything to minutes a day. To me, it's just the gun house. And if I feel like they're threatening me or anything to call them.

674
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.880
Andriana Clark: But pretty much. It's just been avoided in each other.

675
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:17.250
Richelle Direny: Now you're saying that with the threat of of hurt and harm you're seeing that the cops just thought that since it was just a verbal threat. It wasn't my thing.

676
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.490
Andriana Clark: Pretty much.

677
01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:30.780
Andriana Clark: Back then they just didn't care about it at all. Once they saw my husband not warrant for his arrest. That's pretty much all they care about.

678
01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.590
Richelle Direny: They just more focused on the warrant and the actual friends.

679
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:49.620
Richelle Direny: So how I mean in the time that your husband has been gone and you've been there. Have there been any issues that arise since then.

680
01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.380
Andriana Clark: No.

681
01:08:54.570 --> 01:09:04.140
Andriana Clark: I saw the cops outside of their house like once or twice, and I'm pretty sure it was because I'm pretty sure they call it because my dog was the mouse barking like crazy because I wasn't home.

682
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:14.520
Andriana Clark: And somebody had busted out. I don't know if it was the one because we had wrote that form and it was real windy out that night, but my bedroom window has been busted out

683
01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.640
Richelle Direny: You said your bedroom with no head worn

684
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.030
Andriana Clark: Out.

685
01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:27.960
Richelle Direny: And you don't know what happened.

686
01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:42.930
Andriana Clark: Now, it didn't look like anything like it just looked like it was it was already crack look like one that like if if the wind blew to or sometimes you would hear it kind of does look like it. So finally fell out.

687
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:45.330
You

688
01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:50.280
Richelle Direny: Know,

689
01:09:53.640 --> 01:10:06.840
Richelle Direny: So with with everything outside of okay so outside of the issues with your neighbors and the threats in your, your husband getting incarcerating and you guys have to figure out everything. Like, how is it

690
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:19.020
Richelle Direny: For you, how has it really been because like you said you had certain plants that you want to work towards. And then this all happened which created somewhat of a setback for you.

691
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.170
Andriana Clark: And

692
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:26.550
Andriana Clark: Then it really bother me too much. I'm kind of

693
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:35.850
Andriana Clark: You said always happening like I mean I don't ever put in me like I make plans, but then I don't ever

694
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:49.860
Andriana Clark: Know is like I don't ever expect to actually have them because when I'm rely on everybody else. It just seems like something always falls apart or don't happen out this

695
01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.930
Andriana Clark: This kind of used to it and just kind of go with it.

696
01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.680
Andriana Clark: Kind of like whatever happens, happens I just gotta

697
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.440
Andriana Clark: Deal with it as it comes and

698
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.920
Andriana Clark: That's about all I can do.

699
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.040
Richelle Direny: Cheering sounds like you're not very hopeful about life, you just kind of look at things as

700
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:26.040
Richelle Direny: You know, life is not going to necessarily come go the way I planted and have a whole lot of positive ending. So you've kind of just accepted.

701
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.190
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

702
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:35.670
Richelle Direny: But how is that i mean

703
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.260
Richelle Direny: For you.

704
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:48.660
Richelle Direny: Like how do you work through that you don't work through it. You just kind of just accept life how it is.

705
