Jennifer C.: Um no I haven't driven for yet. I know that when I went to start with bright heart was, I don't even remember when something was going on to where we are in Ohio had to wait 30 days or something like that. And I found another facility and I've been going there since

25
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:24.780
Jennifer C.: I think October September or October, and I'm having trouble getting my doctor

26
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.050
Jennifer C.: First, he started me off on my normal dose that I was on when I transferred to him.

27
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:43.740
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm. But he had me on it for two weeks and then drop me back down and with my two jobs and three kids, I'm having trouble getting him to take me back up to that.

28
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.760
Okay.

29
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.060
Jennifer C.: I'm still having urges and stuff like that. Like, I'm a single mom.

30
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.210
Jennifer C.: I work all night.

31
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:05.280

32
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.700
Okay.

33
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.850

35
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.830
Jennifer C.: That's not

36
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:21.870
Jennifer C.: Right, like he he had started me on three guys, I went to a new horizon.

37
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.520
Jennifer C.: Was where I started.

38
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.650
Jennifer C.: Okay, I was on three four

39
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:34.260
Jennifer C.: And then he had started me on three a day but then drop me down to two a day after two

40
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.360
Natalie Austin: That's a little rough and it just, it's

41
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.820
Jennifer C.: It's been a struggle. Since

42
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.900
Natalie Austin: I'm sorry.

43
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.240
Jennifer C.: Yeah, yeah, we normally

44
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.580
Natalie Austin: Just a little bit at a time.

45
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.810
Natalie Austin: Not a whole dose, you know, you have to take a little

46
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.560
Time.

47
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.270
Jennifer C.: Right. And I've had setbacks ever since.

48
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.770
Ever since, okay.

49
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.550
Jennifer C.: So it's just been like, you know, I like the place, but it's just

50
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.550
Jennifer C.: I don't know. He says it's my insurance. I really don't believe that. Um,

51
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.290
Jennifer C.: I really don't care if it is the insurance, I'll pay cash.

52
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.220
Natalie Austin: Right.

53
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.540
You know,

54
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.400
Natalie Austin: How long you been

55
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.500
Natalie Austin: How many years you've been treatment.

56
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:43.530
Jennifer C.: Oh, I've been at this place in September and then only like two months before that was a new horizon before they shut like they just shut down didn't tell anybody. Nothing. Just didn't tell anyone. So like I really wasn't even on the three day for that long.

57
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.030
Natalie Austin: Does it didn't arise, a star you at three a day.

58
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.040
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

59
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:58.680
Natalie Austin: Ah, so I usually like to go twice a day. But I mean that's why the other doctor probably did that but that's just not how you do it, you know.

60
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.200
Jennifer C.: Normally, yeah.

61
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.540
Natalie Austin: Normally I like twice a day for people, but

62
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.490
Natalie Austin: New Horizons storage you on. Guess we might have to stay there.

63
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:25.350
Jennifer C.: Right, that's what they started me on and then the new doctor gave me the three day but only for two weeks and then it abruptly change. Yeah. Anyone who's, who's on Suboxone nose or even a quarter of a pill is an abrupt change.

64
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.220
Natalie Austin: Yeah, it is.

65
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.850
Why

66
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.710
Jennifer C.: For for us for for addicts. It's a lot

67
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:39.870
Jennifer C.: Yes, the border of bill or that quarter of a strip is it'll, it'll still make you feel like crap.

68
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.360
Jennifer C.: And it'll just bring urges back and it's just been a struggle sense

69
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:45.900
Right.

70
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:48.720
Jennifer C.: So,

71
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.690
Natalie Austin: Three months, three months at New Horizon and then three or four months.

72
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.830
Jennifer C.: Two months, two months at New Horizon.

73
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.550

74
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.390
Jennifer C.: Or October, but it

75
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:22.230
Jennifer C.: It was not out. It took me about. Yeah, but it wasn't, it wasn't five months straight because it took me about six or seven months to just find the new doctor at the new place that I'm at

76
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.340
Okay.

77
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.650
Jennifer C.: So basically I started at the new place from scratch again.

78
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.910

79
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.100

259
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.080
Jennifer C.: He was

260
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:44.490
Jennifer C.: Trying to call someone to get me into a place to see if I could get my Xanax back. That's what I was prescribed and he never got back with me.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.570

263
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.320
Natalie Austin: Okay.

264
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:57.390
Natalie Austin: Um, because we have counseling. We can get you set up with us as well for the anxiety and depression and

265
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.590
Natalie Austin: I don't know if we can find you a psychiatrist or

266
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.220
Natalie Austin: I can talk

267
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:17.820
Jennifer C.: About that. I think the biggest thing that they are doing for anxiety is a lot of their patients end up dropping dirty for marijuana. So they got a doctor in there that are prescribing marijuana card, but it just happens I'm allergic to marijuana so

268
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.690

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.900
Jennifer C.: It makes me definitely ill.

271
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.470
Natalie Austin: We are literally just the way from the Xanax, just because there's a contra indication, because it's

272
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.130
Jennifer C.: Right.

273
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.580
Natalie Austin: You know,

274
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.200
Natalie Austin: It mixes. What doesn't mix well. The Suboxone so we don't really encourage that.

275
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:46.020
Natalie Austin: Right, yeah, maybe some Zoloft or Prozac something else like that might Prozac. In the past, and it didn't work.

276
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.520
Um,

277
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.340
Jennifer C.: I know that

278
00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:11.970
Jennifer C.: I think they'll only I know would be the Zoloft is what the office that I go to is okay with a small doses of small doses of Xanax like I'm talking a very small do or the smallest of Claudine, they won't two people out for that.

279
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.110
Yeah.

280
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.920
Jennifer C.: And that's all I know of.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.110
Jennifer C.: Oh no, my family doctor says we have to see a psychiatrist.

284
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.130
Natalie Austin: Okay, yeah.

285
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.120
Jennifer C.: Yeah, it's real hard to get anything like that. And from a family doctor here.

288
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:53.820
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I don't have time. I don't have the time to work or spilling my kids, let alone to go to 10 different doctors

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:54.420
Natalie Austin: Brazil off, I'll put a question on there if they if the therapist can do that is they are myself will get daughter. Okay.

315
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:55.800
Natalie Austin: Good.

316
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.250
Okay.

317
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.280
Natalie Austin: Okay. Um, so just you're on the Suboxone film that's eight milligrams

318
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.110
Natalie Austin: Two, three times a day right now. Are you on the twice a day.

319
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.190
Jennifer C.: What okay

320
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.120
Jennifer C.: Hold on, because you started cutting several things already cutting out a little bit. What was that

321
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.510
Natalie Austin: What's the books are you getting. Are you getting from the other place.

322
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.300
What does I'm on

323
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.780
Jennifer C.: To eight milligram tabs, a day.

324
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.800
Okay.

325
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.580
Natalie Austin: Is it the Soviet text or Suboxone

326
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.070
Jennifer C.: It's Suboxone

327
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.540
Jennifer C.: Talk to the doctor being switched to the sub tasks.

328
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.510
Jennifer C.: Because he said that it works faster.

329
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.680
Jennifer C.: But then you have to prescribe it there.

330
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:50.610
Natalie Austin: Yeah, the subjects is kind of iffy with the DEA we try to stay with the Suboxone because it has the dinar candidate.

331
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.770
Natalie Austin: No options and

332
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.930
Natalie Austin: Okay, so, I mean,

333
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.430
Natalie Austin: That makes sense now.

334
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:03.510
Natalie Austin: The Sufi text is cheaper but it works better, but it's not as safe for you. I guess so.

335
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.130
Jennifer C.: We try to keep him on cutting

336
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.330
Jennifer C.: Out super bad

337
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.950

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.160

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.030
Natalie Austin: And he's right now he's giving you eight milligrams twice a day.

343
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.120
Natalie Austin: But, but you want to be on the three times a

344
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.710
Jennifer C.: Day. Yeah, okay.

345
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.490

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.190
Natalie Austin: Okay.

347
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:42.960
Natalie Austin: Um,

348
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:51.690
Natalie Austin: I will talk to my team and come up with a plan, but we could probably get back to the three times a day.

349
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.790
Natalie Austin: OK.

350
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.200

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:35.520

Natalie Austin: Um, yeah, we could do the film. Absolutely.

367
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:04.020
Jennifer C.: Because then they would probably fill it because it's a different thing.

Jennifer C.: Here in Ohio is filling for you guys because I know that when I first tried to get an appointment with you guys. There was a bunch of pharmacies that were not filling for you guys. And that's why I ended up having to wait 30 days.
