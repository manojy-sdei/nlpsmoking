00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.560
Ryan Ashoo: Any of

297
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.990
Jocelyn Corrales: It actually waste a lot of your time.

298
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.480
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, if you have something you want to say to me, just call me or text me. Don't, don't.

299
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.280
Jocelyn Corrales: See me a message on the computer, I

300
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.240
Ryan Ashoo: Don't do that.

301
00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:05.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, actually. Facebook is just good if you have a lot of friends specially if you want to reconnect with friends, you know, this, that, that, you know, other than that it's not really that you know

302
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:14.970
Jocelyn Corrales: But, you know, if you have lots of friends of your old friends that you want really want to reconnect Facebook is actually good. But, you know, fall is also fine.

303
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Talking to the phone is actually better you know

304
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.730
So,

305
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.440
Jocelyn Corrales: So maybe what we could improve with your

307
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Just that

308
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.710
Jocelyn Corrales: And

309
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.560

412
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.990
Jocelyn Corrales: The current pandemic that we're experiencing today actually believes everything in court also

413

414
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:02.250

415
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.570
Ryan Ashoo: I'll still be on parole for at least another year and a half.

420
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:49.290
Jocelyn Corrales: And I'll just fill in this. I'll just fill up this information later on. And I just placed in financial no problem with regards to financial just edit that. Actually, I'm actually going to edit this.

421
00:38:50.100 --> 00:39:00.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Before. I'm going to send you a final copy. So for your daily routine you routinely wake up and it's good that you also wake up early, even if it's on a weekend.

422
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:11.400
Jocelyn Corrales: And on weekend. Maybe you could do some exercise, but the weekend after that, you know, you won't feel sleepy. No. Anyway, you have problems with sleeping. Try to sleep in. If you can, you could

423
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:24.570
Jocelyn Corrales: You're able to eat meals on time. I just encourage you to eat healthy meals and snacks. Snacks and avoid junk food or soda. No, it's also including the junk food and do

424
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:33.060
Jocelyn Corrales: exercise every day instead of doing it every other day. Try to do exercise every day before going to bed.

425
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:43.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And do some stretching every after you know by your exercise, especially if you're doing a cardio to prevent you know

426
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Like grab

427
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.180
Jocelyn Corrales: I do. Yeah, you should do.

428
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.250
Jocelyn Corrales: And for routine activity.

429
00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:06.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Self meditation after exercise. It's like after toning down do some self meditation or, you know, self reflection or just, you know, just do nothing, just think about nothing and relax.

430
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Before you go to sleep and easiest after exercise and before going to sleep and you know

431
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:30.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Although you mentioned that your sister is, you know, has been trying to reach out to you from time to time. You could also send out a text message to your sister, at least maybe once in two weeks, or once a week, just a text message in, you don't need to reply. If she replies to you.

432
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.490
Jocelyn Corrales: At least you just you.

433
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:40.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Just letting her know that you're still alive, you're still doing okay maybe she's actually worried about you. Maybe you just don't know it. Although, you know,

434
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:49.980
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not really her fault. When your family or when your parents kick you out of the house. Maybe she was still young. Then, and she could do anything to help you.

435
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.610
Ryan Ashoo: That's true, but, uh, you know, when we were teenagers.

436
00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.640
Ryan Ashoo: We just cut me off.

437
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.900
Ryan Ashoo: You know what I mean it.

438
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.400
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, if

439
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:02.880
Jocelyn Corrales: You don't

440
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.070
Ryan Ashoo: Worry. There's a lot more to it than

441
00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.810
Ryan Ashoo: Anybody understands

442
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:18.570
Jocelyn Corrales: So I know but you know when you're a teenager. There are some things that, you know, but maybe she's trying to, you know, reconnect with you, you know, there are things that you know when you are

443
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:30.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Mature you know know those are actually, you know, kids tough team stuff. But when you try to get mature, you try to get older, you know, people change factory.

444
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:40.770
Jocelyn Corrales: So maybe you know she has a change of heart and she wants to reach out to you. She wants to reconnect with everybody. She was Direct Connect, we'd probably just like to reach out to her just a text message.

445
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:50.610
Jocelyn Corrales: It won't hurt you at all. You don't need to reply to her if just in case she messages or she calls. You don't need to answer just send out a text message to that she won't worry about you.

446
00:41:50.940 --> 00:42:02.430
Jocelyn Corrales: This tell her that you're doing fine. Just, just basic thing that. Hi, how are you, I'm doing fine. Something like that. Maybe just once, once a week or once in two weeks.

447
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.720
Yeah.

448
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:21.870
Jocelyn Corrales: And take care of your children's custody. I just put it here. So he would just also remind me about how you doing in that area.

449
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:31.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Are there any things that you want to include in the plan, maybe something that you would like. Although you mentioned that you don't like change, but maybe some things that you wanted, even though

450
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:36.180
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not open for a change to, like, maybe you want you know

474
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. And you're like, you know, sports like playing basketball.

475
00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.390
Ryan Ashoo: I don't like sports but I like to watch sports. I played a lot of sports. When I was younger, I was in martial arts.

476
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:39.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, IV, you know, have you considered doing martial arts back again.

477
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.670
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah.

478
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:54.630
Ryan Ashoo: I mean, I considered it. But I was really good at it. I'm, I'm a first degree black belt in taekwondo I took boxing for eight years.

479
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.310
Ryan Ashoo: Um,

480
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.190
Ryan Ashoo: By just, I don't know. I don't really have any interest in doing it now.

481
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.330
Mm hmm.

482
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:12.990
Jocelyn Corrales: I'll just add this initial interest, but I think maybe you should consider maybe going back

483
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:27.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing martial arts and boxing one of these, these probably maybe you're just not ready yet for it at the moment because there is so much. Or maybe there are so many things you have in mind, probably, maybe you could consider going back

484
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Some other days.

485
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:32.460
Ryan Ashoo: Maybe

486
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.450
Ryan Ashoo: I just, I don't. I did it because I enjoyed it.

487
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.460
Ryan Ashoo: And now I don't so

488
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:46.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could try probably try again. Maybe you just don't realize it. Although, you know,

489
00:45:47.520 --> 00:46:01.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Once, once you are there. Actually, maybe it would work out. Also for you it's, there's no harm in trying, but maybe not now. Maybe some other time. When you are not you know when you're already ready and prepared.

490
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:17.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually like that idea you going back to doing you know some martial arts or boxing. Yeah, yeah, maybe not. Now, maybe not now, but maybe on some other days.

491
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:19.710
OK.

492
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:25.620
Jocelyn Corrales: OK for a while.

493
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Sorry about that. I just had a phone call. Okay.

494
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.950

Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Okay.

496
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:08.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so consider going back to martial arts and boxing. I think we have everything here for the plan.

497
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:33.300
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe we could do just the first four and five. Maybe we'll do the six later on. But I'm putting it there just to remind me and to remind you when we meet again in the next 30 days. Okay. Okay. Let me see if I'll be able to make you sign this let me share again.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.250
Jocelyn Corrales: The signing

512
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.620
Jocelyn Corrales: It actually doesn't work for some, are you in a computer.

513
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:42.300
Ryan Ashoo: No.

514
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.510

521
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.570

522
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:32.250

523
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:40.530

Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it actually works for some patients, but I don't know.

528
00:49:51.510 --> 00:50:00.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe it's my computer or probably it doesn't allow you know, especially for 40 doesn't allow most of the phone users to sign it.

529
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:12.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Although there are some who are able to sign in control it, but it isn't safe, but there are some who you know that I am able to see, but it doesn't work, but it's fine. It's not really required. So, it's okay.
