00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670

Dr. Belis Aladag: And yeah, I mean if you try

33
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:40.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Who knows, in the future, if you feel like you're in a stable place and you want to try again. We could try very, very slowly to go down a notch by notch but but if you've been stable and you're good on it. I mean, why not you know

34
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm

35
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: So tell me what like you used to have an opioid problem or what

37
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. History of that, did you start when you were young, like

38
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.820
Kasia: No, no, no.

39
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.700
Kasia: I started in 2011 or 10

40
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:11.610
Kasia: I had an unhappy marriage. I worked a lot of hours. And it started after oral surgery I had they put me on a Viking and since I took that Viking and and made me feel like completely different.

41
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.190
Kasia: And I didn't even realize how I got addicted to it. I mean, I was up to $40 a day at 1.0

42
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.970
Wow.

43
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

44
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.450
Kasia: Yeah.

45
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.020
Kasia: And then, and I went

46
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.920
Kasia: Through my work through that employee assistance.

47
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.700
Kasia: They admitted they admitted me for the detox.

48
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.180
Kasia: And from there I went to the professional program.

49
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.400
Kasia: In Chicago with Dr. Fry and I was there for a few months.

50
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.170
Kasia: I was doing like it's a partial inpatient, we were in the apartment.

51
00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:02.580
Kasia: And everyday we had classes. Then after that for two years. I was in after care and right now I just see a doctor and meetings.

52
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK.

53
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So this is all because of the nursing. Is it like a diversion program thing.

54
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is it. Yes. Okay. So it's the professional board or whatever.

55
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.710
Kasia: It wasn't, it wasn't a board. I was never reported

56
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.140
Kasia: Oh, it was through the hospital.

57
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: All through the hospital. Okay. Okay, awesome. And this was all happening in 2010

58
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.800
Kasia: I think it was 10 or 11, something like that.

59
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and then you started in 2012 with the

60
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.360
Kasia: Yeah, because it happened in December and

61
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.510
Kasia: I wasn't that detox and everything. It was right after New Year's that I went there in January, I believe it was 2012

62
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.260
Kasia: And since then, I was started on some boxes that just worked for me. Really good.

63
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Huh. Okay.

64
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:11.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, it's, it's, I'm so glad that they they gave it to you because you know some people don't get introduced to it for a while. Like, they're like, okay, you know you need. Sorry about that. You need to go like full

65
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Abstinence, you know, get people off. And then, and then they have cravings and then, you know,

66
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:27.360
Kasia: Yeah. And also, that was one of my conditions to start work again. You know, so I'm protected for not taking anything

67
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, exactly. Exactly right. That's the others. Plus, right.

68
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:42.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, cool. All right. I see. And, and you were in an unhappy marriage. I'm so sorry about that. And you, you go right. Yeah.

69
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.290
Kasia: At the same time,

70
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.450
Kasia: Right after I got out of the program.

71
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you just decided, hey you know I gotta do this.

72
00:05:50.850 --> 00:06:03.930
Kasia: Okay, yeah, you know, it's kind of scary for me because I came here when I was 16 to this country by myself and my ex was the only person that I thought was close. But I didn't realize what it was doing to me until

73
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Years later,

74
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.490

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: 13 years. Wow.

76
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, that's a long time.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: But, but you realize you know you woke up and

78
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: And saw what was going on. And I mean that takes a lot of strength so

79
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm glad that you did that for you. Are you feeling like you're in a pretty good place now that

122
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:49.410
Kasia: Well, I was told in there in my when I was in a professional. I never liked alcohol but they told me to stay away because it could be easily substituted one for another

123
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.170
Kasia: Absolutely. So I really don't like the way that alcohol makes me feel so

Dr. Belis Aladag: You have you said you have enough lozenges, or

144
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.560
Kasia: Yeah, yeah. Because in Florida.

145
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.330
Kasia: It's a free program that if

146
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.710
Kasia: You want something just give it to you. So I have some messages.

147
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Awesome. Okay, good. So

148
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:38.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feel free to use them. So one is equivalent almost to a cigarette. So if you are like hey I need something I came home from work. I want to let go. That last cigarette after work. Instead, you could have the laws or something, you know,

149
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.090
Kasia: It's just a really nasty. I don't like the taste of it. It's

150
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.320
Kasia: Like it hurts that throat

151
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, yeah. Oh.

152
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.440
Kasia: Yeah, so

153
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: It sounds to me like

154
00:11:51.030 --> 00:12:00.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Darn it. Okay, that's not gonna work. But, you know, I'm glad that you're trying. Because yeah, especially with this fires. Hopefully it's a good motivator, like you need your lungs 100

155
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.800
Kasia: Exactly.

156
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:13.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: And we know like the minute you use quit smoking, your lungs do start to recover. There is recovery. So yeah. Less is more. I'm glad you've cut down but like let's push it if you can.

157
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:21.030
Kasia: Yes, yes I will, I will. I have two packs of cigarettes left and I'm hoping not to finish, but I'm for sure not buying any

158
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:30.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't ya know more by. Okay, good. Um, you mentioned surgery, you mentioned oral surgery in 2010 right

159
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:41.910
Kasia: Um, no. There was, I think there was earlier than that. So what happened was I had pain right like on the side of my mouth and for the longest time, they couldn't figure out what it was.

160
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:50.010
Kasia: So they thought it was the joint then an ear infection. I was like, several months they tried to treat me for that. It turned out it was my wisdom tooth.

161
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.330
Oh,

162
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you're on your left side.

163
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.580
Kasia: Actually, I think it was on the left. I mean, they took out all of them, but

164
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.230
Kasia: I think it was on the left.

165
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: But it was wisdom teeth that were bothering your parents.

166
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.560
Kasia: Yes.

167
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:13.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. Yeah, cuz I can feel like the bottom. Yeah, that's okay. So that's kind of what triggered all this, the pills and everything.

168
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, um, any other surgeries.

169
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.860

Kasia: Game, but that's okay.

193
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:40.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting one. And it's, it's so cold, you know, sitting and what I want to again on, you know, when I was there packers game.

194
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:52.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it was like, hold that everybody's out there. I think it's the only team in the whole league that's publicly owned. So that's why their, their fans are so loyal, you know,

195
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.130
Kasia: Oh, yeah.

196
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.300
Kasia: That I was concerned.

197
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.830
Kasia: She says,

198
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so

199
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:13.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I think I got a lot of history from you. I think I understand what was going on. And it sounds like basically since you started the Suboxone in 2012 you've been really steady and stable and doing well in your sobriety.

200
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.810
Kasia: Yes, definitely.

201
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:26.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Awesome. Okay, great. I'm so glad. And so, yeah, I'd be, I'm happy to take over for you and help you get through these months.

202
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:36.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the way we set up our program is we have like weekly group visits. Is that something that's doable for you.

203
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:45.510
Kasia: Sure, that's fine. It's just, it has to be like, you know, because I work for 12 HOUR SHIFTS right now. So as long as it's not my day off. No problem.

204
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:56.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, hmm. So do you know like, okay, so I have groups like I have a group on Monday morning at 10 would you do Mondays at 10

205
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.860
Kasia: This Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday. I'm working and then Saturday, so I could do next week, either Wednesday or Thursday.

206
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so there's a Thursday 4pm group.

207
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.190
Kasia: Okay, I could do this one.

208
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you could do that one, you could join us in that group.

209
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then are you saying that every week, it kind of changes.

210
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Hmm.

211
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.740
Kasia: I should get the schedule for the next few weeks when I go back on Monday.

212
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.210
Kasia: OK. But so far, we have a scheduled till next Saturday.

213
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Do you, do you feel do

214
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean I can do. Do you want to do individual ones with me, would you

215
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Jewel chat until we figure out like you can kind of tell me your, your schedule more

216
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, if we if we can figure out as consistent time we can put you in one of the groups, too.

217
00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:08.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Otherwise, like we could do one on one. I can give you the, the, you know, you can book with me just half hour visit, you know, just to check in. And hey, everything's okay still okay here's your repo kind of thing. Yeah.

218
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.930
Kasia: Okay, yeah, that's fine.

219
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:16.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, and then and then we go from there. You know, we just kind of establish this care that way.

220
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then and move forward. Okay.

221
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:31.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, good. Um, so I'll give you like today is what Friday. So I'll give you a week's wars and then if you, you said you have Thursday off.

222
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.290
Kasia: I have Thursday off but

223
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:49.770
Kasia: The only problem is that it's hard for me to get to the pharmacy, because the transport from the hotel takes us to the hospital. He also takes us to the grocery store. Like, I know that we will go on Saturday tomorrow, but next Saturday. I'll be working so

224
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.080
Kasia: Hard, it's gonna be an issue to get to the pharmacy, but I'll find a way. I'll get over anything

225
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:02.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hard to get to the pharmacy. Is there a pharmacy near the hospital, maybe that's

226
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.590
Kasia: Not that I would see

227
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.650
Kasia: The hospital is kinda on the hill that he takes us. It takes 15 minutes from the hotel to get to the hospital.

228
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hmm.

229
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.090
Kasia: It's a seat seat in the medical center.

230
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

231
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:26.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, trying to think. So would it be more helpful if I give you more than a week supply

232
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:35.730
Kasia: LV a lot more helpful because I know that every second Saturday at least I'm off so I can go to the grocery store with them and pick it up.

233
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:41.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: And pick it up. Should we do okay let's. Can we try every two weeks for now.

234
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.140
Kasia: That would be great. Thank you so much.

235
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:57.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, let's try every two, two weeks. Okay, so, so then walk with me before you run out so you don't have to see me next week then then book with me, like the week of the 20th

236
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.920
Kasia: Okay.

237
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.960
Kasia: I, how do I book with you. Do I call it

238
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:13.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, just call the virtual clinic. You can even do it now. You know, after we hang up. You can call them again like through zoom and say hey you know yeah and say, I've met with the doctor and she wants to see me in two weeks.

239
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.160
Kasia: Okay.

240
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:19.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, can I schedule something either the 24th would be that Friday or before the 24th.

241
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.730
Kasia: Would it be okay if I called him on Mondays. When I get my schedule.

242
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.410
Kasia: So yeah, absolutely.

243
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:33.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Totally fine. You'll be covered for the two weeks and then and then we'll see each other again. And by that time you'll tell me what your schedule looks like and

244
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:49.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. Um, you can still if you're, if you are interested in wanting to be part of the group check in on a weekly basis, you could still do that or we could keep doing like every two weeks, you know, whatever, whatever works. I want to make it easy for you. I don't want to make things harder.

245
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:55.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're going your, you know, your volunteer, you're doing a lot of good stuff. So I want to support you in that

246
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.270
Kasia: Thank you so much.

247
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so let's try and see what happens. Okay.

248
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.350
Kasia: Okay, thank you very much.

249
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:15.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: No problem. And then remember we have services if you want for like individual therapy. So like if you wanted to see a therapist, you're actually assigned one in bright heart.

250
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:24.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you could call the virtual clinic and say, Okay, I'm going to see the doctor in two weeks. But I also want to see the therapist as well. Can I have an appointment, you know,

251
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't. Okay. Um, I guess it depends on your insurance in terms of coverage.

252
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.380
Kasia: That they couldn't figure out my insurance in time. So I paid cash today because

253
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:41.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, oh, wow, okay. Hopefully, they can figure it out. So we can smooth it and it's not that you know too much for you.

254
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.170
Kasia: Okay.

255
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.710
Kasia: Thank you.

256
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:54.660
