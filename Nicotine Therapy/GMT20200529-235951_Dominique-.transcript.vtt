281
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.370
Dominique Pozo: All right.

282
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:20.730
Dominique Pozo: And what are some healthy coping skills that you notice you

283
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.100
Dominique Pozo: Gathered along the way.

284
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:31.770
iPhone: true to myself over the point where I don't want to do anything. It's just one of us.

285
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.910
iPhone: Taking myself out of that situation where I feel like that.

286
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:42.540
iPhone: Going in doing something else or moving to a different room or calling a friend on phone

287
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:08.640
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

288
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.810
Dominique Pozo: And the next question. Who can you call when you're not doing well. It sounds like you have a friend, you can call

289
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.620
iPhone: Yeah, I have a friend. I could call them, talk to them about what's going on.

290
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:24.600
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

291
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:30.720
Okay.

292
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:46.140
Dominique Pozo: And so it sounds like one of those coping skills is like distraction and you know relocating yourself whatever situation you're in. That's, that's a coping skill and then how about any self soothing.

293
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.490
Dominique Pozo: Tricks that you know are self care.

294
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.290
Dominique Pozo: Behaviors that you engage in. Do you have any that

295
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.050
iPhone: Oh,

296
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.380
iPhone: Can you repeat that again, sorry, I kind of lost my train of thought there for a minute.

297
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.720
Dominique Pozo: That's okay so

298
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:29.640
Dominique Pozo: So one of your coping skills that I am hearing is that you you distract yourself you like, you know, you do things to keep you away from the cravings. You're having you

299
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:45.270
Dominique Pozo: Relocate yourself to another space or you reach out for support from friends. Those are coping skills and then a self soothing as a whole different things self soothing can be like taking a walk, taking a bath a warm shower. You have any self soothing or self care behaviors that

300
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.140
Dominique Pozo: You do when

301
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:50.790
Dominique Pozo: When you

302
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.290
Dominique Pozo: get anxious or or have cravings come up

303
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.240
iPhone: Yeah, I go for

304
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.490

305
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.380

306
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.770
