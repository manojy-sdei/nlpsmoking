00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.879
Ethan: Rebecca

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

4
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.630
Ethan: I'm doing alright

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.849
Ethan: How are you doing,

6
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.679
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm doing all right.

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's things going

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.690
Ethan: I'm

9
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.680
Ethan: I think things are pretty good.

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.710
Ethan: I don't know, I still feel kind of tired, I guess, day to day this morning. I had to get, get up.

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.560
Ethan: So,

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.830
Ethan: So I guess.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.690
Ethan: I got some good news today what I as I was finishing and not amazing news but not like, you know, not bad news.

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.500
Ethan: You're my remember as I was finishing my project I was mildly worried that this company might just sort of abruptly. Let me go after

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.060
Ethan: Yeah, once I wrap things up. I wasn't, I wasn't

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:19.830
Ethan: I wasn't really think they do that, but I thought it kind of a possibility. And I hadn't like I didn't talk to my boss or my colleagues or anything for like most of that time when I was working on the things I did just didn't know what was going on.

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.360
Ethan: Right. Um, so one thing I was happy about was they when I finished it, they immediately started asking me to do these 7am training sessions.

18
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.180
Ethan: Well, I was happy about it not happy about it. I'm not a morning person. So this is three times a week. I could get up and be all in

19
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.700
Ethan: And train

20
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.500
Ethan: People who are in Europe since the afternoon for them.

21
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:59.190
Ethan: But I'm happy about it because they're that meeting. I mean, they're still giving me work great. And they're still asking me to do. So it's not like, okay, you know, that's all, that's all we want you to do.

22
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.920
Ethan: And then the good news that I got was that one of the guys, I'm kind of kind of buddies with who, who works in Berlin, who I had mentioned

23
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:27.600
Ethan: My concern about they might disturb roughly, let me go, or let some of us go. He went in and sort of that asked around behind the scenes. And he called me back and he's like, there's no way they're going to do that, you're definitely like there through through the end of

24
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.170
Ethan: June I have my mind, you know, basically, nine months left

25
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know that you're not gonna like be let go early then

26
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.550
Yeah.

27
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.570
Ethan: According to grant, but it that

28
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.690
Ethan: That's kind of the feeling I was getting anyway.

29
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

30
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

31
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.900
Ethan: Yeah, so that's good.

32
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how has your self care been

33
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.040
Ethan: It's been kind of okay, I feel like I'm getting back

34
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.640
Ethan: It's like I I slipped into this. It's

35
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.800
Ethan: Um, I don't know if it's for better for worse. It's like an addiction when when you get that deep into work.

36
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.410
Ethan: Like he just, I don't care if you know I feel like I still do care about stuff. But I don't have the mind space for anything.

37
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.230
Ethan: And so it's kind of like learning to walk again why I'm like, Okay, the first thing I have to do.

38
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:49.140
Ethan: You know, first I make coffee and then I do my like my recovery stuff like today, and another is the same thing happened yesterday and today, we were like,

39
00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:00.330
Ethan: The day you know, actually, except for today. I got up at seven in the morning, but like I didn't, didn't like make the time all more or all day so far to write my journal. So I'm like behind

40
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:13.560
Ethan: You know my I took my met my medication on on the usual schedule. But before I was so good. It's sitting united stop and sit for toilets and you know right every day in the middle of the day.

41
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.180
Ethan: So I'm kind of like

42
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.470
Ethan: So I'm not. I'm I'll be there. I know I can get. I can get my

43
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.570
Ethan: Wiring

44
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.860
Ethan: You know priorities.

45
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.130
Ethan: Real reliance

46
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.620
Ethan: Right, I'm just hasn't it hasn't been like an immediate thing.

47
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.960
Ethan: I feel like I'm like

48
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.600
Ethan: I feel like I'm, I'm tired. I also, especially after that news I got today. I feel like relieved and

49
00:04:50.220 --> 00:05:00.990
Ethan: I don't know. But as you know, or as I also kind of know it's just another momentary calm before the storm with the with the job and interviews.

50
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.150
Ethan: But I almost feel like I'm not as scared as Job interviews as I was of

51
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.440
Ethan: Or as I am this whole weird situation.

52
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.580
Ethan: And job interviews are tough. Remember the last time I have interviewed and especially if you don't get a job, you know, if something doesn't happen in your first couple injuries.

53
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.930
Yeah.

54
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.520
Ethan: Then

55
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.300
Ethan: Then you're like unemployed and just like

56
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.520
Ethan: A huge blow to your self esteem and everything so I'm kind of like mentally

57
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.610
Ethan: Aware that that's a possibility.

58
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.690
Yeah.

59
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.250
Ethan: I have a lot of

60
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.550
Ethan: Sort of introspection about what I want

61
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.210
Ethan: I don't

62
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.120
Ethan: Know it's like

63
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.380
Ethan: You're saying, it'd be good if I had a less stress level. And I think it would be good if I had a less rescue dog.

64
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.490
Ethan: What's being that's your phone telling you something.

65
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.390
Yeah.

66
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how did you work on your resume.

67
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.340
Ethan: No, I hadn't yet this, it didn't end up happening this weekend and I haven't had time this week yet to do it, but that's

68
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.100
Ethan: That's definitely

69
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.830
Ethan: The, the top of the list of personal, personal care.

70
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, it is.

71
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.660
Ethan: For priority stuff.

72
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you and Lily, good to go and do something together.

73
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.880
Ethan: We didn't really but you know we're working on.

74
00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:02.970
Ethan: I guess we can't do it. We found out until early next month. We've always enjoyed enjoyed going to Vegas and she's super excited about.

75
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.670
Ethan: She, she's been poking around. She mainly reads, her, her Russian

76
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:22.800
Ethan: Like news and social media and from her perspective, like all these people are already running off to all these vacations.

77
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:37.890
Ethan: But it's kind of unclear, like what you know what places are sort of open what what places are on the safe side in terms of infection rates and

78
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:48.690
Ethan: All that kind of stuff. So I still haven't really figured out the answer to that, but what I did figure out was especially because like what you mentioned to me about how I

79
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.610
Ethan: I

80
00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:02.190
Ethan: I need some like Lily. Lily is stuck through me through this like really shitty relapse and then this really hard period at work and then we're gonna have a hard

81
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.040
Ethan: Difficult or you know it.

82
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:28.380
Ethan: Maybe it'll be it won't be difficult. Maybe I'll get a, get a perfect job easily, but it's sort of a nun. I know. We don't know what the next six months are going to be like, so it's a really good time for us to sort of sort of have a nice to do something nice to gather and and she so and

83
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.200
Ethan: I don't give her enough attention.

84
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.440
Ethan: Or haven't been given.

85
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:43.860
Ethan: I i really and we're like, totally in love. And I think we're very like affectionate and I show that every day. And I think we're pretty happy but

86
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.080
Ethan: That I definitely want to take, you know, I want to do.

87
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.520
Ethan: Something special so we can like spend

88
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.940
Ethan: Have some higher quality time together.

89
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:57.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

90
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.570
Ethan: It doesn't happen. And it's funny, like

91
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:16.470
Ethan: I guess we get so it's hard to imagine us being in the apartment and not just sinking into our habits like she has her things that she likes to do and I have my computer stuff that I like to do, and I just because what we like to do. So we're not, we you know we don't

92
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.490
Ethan: fit in and pay attention to each other.

93
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.360
Ethan: We do, we just for a little minutes here and there, but it's not like you know we're really focused on each other for like a whole day or whatever.

94
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that'll be cool to be able to do that.

95
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.530
Ethan: Yeah. So we had this idea to drive to Vegas, we both like taking road trips

96
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.380
Ethan: I can kind of get away with it in this next

97
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.470
Ethan: Month of

98
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.080
Ethan: Route, you know, we're going to employment is raining down

99
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:08.010
Ethan: And I can work down there. And then so you can just go sit by the pool on our theory was like, not that many people would be there as he you know those places are huge. So

100
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:18.000
Ethan: We wouldn't be all correct crowded in with, you know, lots of other sick people, so maybe it wouldn't be so scary and I and all the hotels are, you know,

101
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:29.790
Ethan: For good business reasons, you know, they're like, word you know they're saying all the right things. They were like worst triple sanitizing our rooms and

102
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:46.560
Ethan: Doing all this fancy stuff to try to detect that that these like body heat scanners that you walk through to see if if anybody knows suspiciously I temperature, you can't go in and or you go to the nurse's station or something to get checked out.

103
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow. Yeah, I'm sure they had to do, figure out some kind of plan because you know

104
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That whole town's gonna

105
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Shut down, it'll be a ghost town if they don't do something to get people to come back, you know,

106
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.770
Ethan: Right.

107
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.410
Ethan: I mean, eventually, there'll be a vaccine. So it's like the world is going to come

108
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.990
Ethan: The world will come back, um,

109
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:31.380
Ethan: But yeah, places like that like the entire places built around and like Manhattan's crazy to me to to even imagine trying to stay six feet away from anybody you know

110
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.580
Ethan: And yeah, just how would you do that.

111
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.160
Ethan: If that's the if that's the kind of guidance. It's hard enough in San Francisco, like, and this is a

112
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.930
Ethan: You know, not that crowded city there's

113
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:59.460
Ethan: All depends on what part. And if you're in rush hour and stuff like that. But, like, just an in the neighborhood where I live. It's not that hard to stay six feet away from people on the side or you

114
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.770
Ethan: So,

115
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.840
Ethan: Yeah.

116
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:20.760
Ethan: So called one, one of the casino places today. And they said yes book or and they're already putting out videos of all the their, their processes to try to

117
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.790
Ethan: keep the place clean and keep people from spreading any diseases.

118
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.370
Ethan: But they're not opening up until

119
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.980
Ethan: What was it like a week and a half from

120
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.360
Ethan: Eight days from now, I guess they're opening

121
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.380
Now,

122
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.090
Ethan: So yeah, so maybe like

123
00:12:49.380 --> 00:13:00.000
Ethan: Another thing that might happen is they're going to reopen and there's a lot of people that disorder believe this whole thing is hocus pocus. And so maybe that, you know, suddenly, it'll just be jam packed on there. I don't know.

124
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Never know.

125
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that where I'm at the minute that they said that the beaches were open. It was like people just flocked

126
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to the beaches, so

127
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely you know

128
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be on guard and take care of yourselves and I hope you guys get a go.

129
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.350
Ethan: No.

130
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:22.770
No.

131
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Road trips are fun.

132
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:26.550
Yeah.

133
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:40.230
Ethan: Yeah. Anything's possible. So we're working on it right now. That was my commitment to Lily is that we'll figure it out this week because at the beginning of the week. It was like I was still in wrapping things up mode.

134
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.620
Ethan: At work, and we wanted to see how things were going to go for the remaining month

135
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:57.660
Ethan: And I wanted to learn more about the dangers of traveling and all this that stuff. So we're sort of figuring all that out. It's all that's happening.

136
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.810
Ethan: When I still want to give more like hanging out with William or it's tough.

137
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:19.410
Ethan: That we're getting from actually works pretty well. It's like she gets absorbed into what she does. She's either playing video games are doing your social media or

138
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.460
Ethan: You know, watching her Russian TV see like, you know, entertain yourself pretty well.

139
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.940
Ethan: And I just, you know, do I think my computer. So we generally

140
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:34.560
Ethan: It.

141
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:43.260
Ethan: You know, like, I don't know, maybe for a lot of people. The, the shelter in place might have been a huge adjustment.

142
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.160
Me.

143
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:50.880
Ethan: Because a lot of families like you know whatever works is basically not there. Most of the time, so

144
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it has a big adjustment, that's for sure.

145
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.350
Ethan: Although it's funny because of what was going on in my company, you know, we went from like

146
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:12.900
Ethan: Being this huge huge like 200 person, company in San Francisco like 18 months ago.

147
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.920
Ethan: And we're just been scaling down and down and got smart and then we just, you know, let people go and got a smaller office and then

148
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:32.160
Ethan: You know, we work pretty hard in there. And then we sort of scale down from there. And then so by the time code started I was already working from home all the time. Just because that was

149
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.490
Ethan: Easier for me.

150
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:45.330
Ethan: Because that's kind of where everybody's at the time I was, I don't know if you remember, you and I were talking about this at this time.

151
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.460
Ethan: And I basically started sheltering in place. Like, I'm really

152
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah you did.

153
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we were

154
00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:02.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So definitely, which is not a bad thing. So tell me how you've been doing as far as your recovery goes

155
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:06.870
Ethan: I haven't

156
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.710
Ethan: I'm just like everything else. I feel like I haven't been active in it.

157
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:21.120
Ethan: Like when I write in my journal and I get to the like emotional, spiritual, I'm like, I don't really know how

158
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.720
Ethan: I just feel like disconnected from it.

159
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.230
Ethan: You know, so I don't feel one way or the other, like struggling then to

160
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.370
Ethan: You know, not call the guy or or

161
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.870
Ethan: Or fully engaged in it and like in my rhythms or anything. I just kind of feel

162
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.410
Ethan: Just sort of like

163
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.120
Ethan: In never not you know this in

164
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.890
Ethan: spaced out or disconnected mode.

165
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.350
Ethan: Does that make sense.

166
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.350
Ethan: I think it's just it's a little it's

167
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's why

168
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.590
Ethan: Well, I'm just not one of those people that

169
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:31.230
Ethan: I've had periods where I've been in a role where I've been, like, instead of being constantly like one crisis after another and one work problem after another and one relationship problem ever and another relapse and just everything since I've worked with you, for example.

170
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.320
Ethan: I bet I haven't been that way. My whole life hasn't been like that I've definitely had years where it's like

171
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.790
Ethan: You can

172
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:43.920
Ethan: Just grab it.

173
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:55.110
Ethan: Where I've had, I've had long periods where I've been more things have been consistently and getting

174
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.710
Ethan: Either

175
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.860
Ethan: Steady or steadily improving in all those areas. So I just need to

176
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.930
Ethan: Get guys it's like I

177
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.600
Ethan: almost forget what it feels like.

178
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We gotta get reconnected, you know, what about are you calling your friend, your server friend.

179
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.450
Ethan: Yeah, um,

180
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:38.640
Ethan: We we do is we text. So I kind of try to set up a time to go see him, um,

181
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.170
Ethan: But it hasn't happened yet.

182
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.490
Ethan: What do you do, I can't be dizzy.

183
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:58.800
Ethan: I'm gonna go see my mom over in Berkeley tomorrow. And he lives in Berkeley, so I'll send a text message and maybe I can like sitting by his place and hanging out with him.

184
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be cool.

185
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a connection.

186
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if it's possible. So you you've been staying connected to sober support which is important. Right. You know that

187
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so that's a good thing.

188
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

189
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know, if you start doing your journal

190
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if you do it once.

191
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you forget about it for a couple days and then do it again. Eventually, you'll get back in the habit. You might have to be, you know, make it a with a real conscious effort to be able to do it, but

192
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, this is kind of you know how it is. It's like every time we fall. Sometimes, it becomes harder to get back to where we want to be, you know, then

193
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of just leaving things out that we know work and we know you know help us in that area.

194
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.940
Ethan: Yeah, and I want to be there so bad.

195
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:12.330
Ethan: And so simple but it's just like a camp. I haven't quite made that flip where that's the first thing that I think about when I get up and some of its just circle circumstantial, you know, um,

196
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:22.830
Ethan: But I have like I've it's only been a couple days since group and I have done a couple jerk you know journal entries and written all by inch and I'm gonna, you know,

197
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:37.620
Ethan: I'm going to do it today. Again, but like I haven't written anything yet. But so like tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and tomorrow. I don't have a seven, eight do anything at 7am will try to get up kind of mid morning and have a normal like

198
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:39.210
Ethan: You know,

199
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.360
Ethan: I still haven't had a day where I'm like, Okay, get up and having normal

200
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.200
Ethan: You know, morning sobriety routine and then tuning door so

201
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.930
Ethan: So I'll get to it.

202
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, don't put it on the back burner too long.

203
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.250
Ethan: Yeah, no, I mean, I'll get to like that tomorrow or the next day this week.

204
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're ambivalent

205
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.320
Ethan: I have a hard time

206
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.920
Ethan: And I totally know what this is.

207
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:39.780
Ethan: Every single time I try to set an alarm to get myself up I screwed up somehow not not my strong suit in life is getting up in the morning. That was the alarm that I set to get up.

208
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.950
Ethan: At 630 but I just had PM instead of am

209
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

210
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.750
Ethan: Oh, good. Good thing that

211
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.210
Ethan: I happen to just wake up or a little his arm off to her.

212
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You fit. So you're taking your medication as prescribed. You're not overtaking it you're not stayed doing any more 24 hour

213
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work marathons. No.

214
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

215
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.400
Yeah.

216
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.020
Ethan: And I

217
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.040
Ethan: had like one more Klonopin and I have to go to

218
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.620
Ethan: Walgreens to refill the I saw you have to refill for

219
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.010
Ethan: Quantity laundering.

220
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.480
Ethan: And I've been taking the one

221
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.030
Ethan: The one

222
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.880
Ethan: God, I'm so tired.

223
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Adderall.

224
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.190
Ethan: Adderall. I'm taking the one Adderall per day my days have been kind of like

225
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.440
Ethan: Weird like not necessarily morning to evening but

226
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:04.020
Ethan: And then I take and I cut us the steps up and I did that strips three, you know, three times a day.

227
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

228
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. I

229
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.890
Ethan: Think I've been sticking to that pretty good.

230
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. That's a start right there. You know what I mean not over medicating yourself not

231
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, abusing the medication, but actually following directions and doing it. That's the first step of this whole thing and you getting sleep.

232
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.050
Yeah.

233
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it's going to be you'll feel a lot better tomorrow. You know when you've had a good night's sleep and a good meal and water just those basic things make a difference in our mindset, make a difference on how we feel.

234
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.660
Ethan: You know that. Yeah.

235
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.

236
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:56.250
Ethan: Now, but it's this. I love therapy because it's it's it's a time to like deliberately. Think about, like, where am I out with this stuff and and recognize it and think like

237
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:04.290
Ethan: Yeah, it's like, I like the journal thing I've got tomorrow I'll probably be like right back on top of it.

238
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.240
Ethan: Um,

239
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:18.810
Ethan: I like with my friend Chuck told me this guy I know that's been he works at choosing him you know that I think Apple bought them. But it's that apps, it recognizes the song.

240
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.950
The beginning

241
00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:40.500
Ethan: He's been sober for decades, or whatever. And we were like that, you know, in early sobriety at a time like a long time ago. And what he always says is however long it took you to go into the for the forest, it takes you that long to like walk out of the forest.

242
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:48.630
Ethan: So our, our many years or months or whatever that was that you like are going down this path of this of

243
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:55.890
Ethan: You know you're taking your life in their own direction, it takes you sort of that long to like walk back out and I think

244
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:11.250
Ethan: I kind of think of the past like eat you know year 18 months of my life has been like that you know has been on that sort of negative path, then I found bright heart and that's my sort of turnaround point. Now, I'm like,

245
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:19.560
Ethan: So, but I'm ready for that. So it's like a combination of the sort of early sobriety blues.

246
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.780
Ethan: And chaos and some of it. So it's chaotic and some of its boring and then combined with

247
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:37.560
Ethan: Like coven world changing combined with the career changes and everything. So I'm like, I'm totally prepared for it to be like

248
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.850
Ethan: I don't think it's gonna be miserable that it's gonna be like

249
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.110
Ethan: My like not a highlight maybe

250
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.110
Ethan: might not be the best year ever but um

251
00:25:54.270 --> 00:26:01.710
Ethan: I remember one time I had been sober for a little over five years or something and I had this week where it was like

252
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:17.010
Ethan: I like somehow lost most of my money. This is crazy series of things happened to me. I lost my place to live and lost all this money and wrecked the car and the girlfriend broke up with me and

253
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.550
Ethan: And I was active in a the time. So the thing that amazed me about it was, I was like,

254
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.600
Ethan: I was on I was sad and I and

255
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.430
Ethan: I'm

256
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.110
In it.

257
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:49.050
Ethan: Like that, you know, all this all this crappy stuff happened but I kind of knew, you know, you just do

258
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.930
Ethan: roll with it and do the next right thing and feel, you know, I kind of, it's so simple.

259
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:08.820
Ethan: And that was the first room and I remember feeling I specifically felt like I'm like an adult. This is like the kind of thing that happens to adults and it's and they can kind of deal that

260
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:33.420
Ethan: I was talking to us. So that's another greats over that he and he was like, you know, I think part of that is might be age. So over people think they're so special for, like, you know, being able to handle, you know, sort of, not so great.

261
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.940
Ethan: Times, you know,

262
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.340
Ethan: A bad year or something like that in your life, but it's like everybody in your

263
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.770
Ethan: Everybody has this

264
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.040
Ethan: Get better at them less dramatic.

265
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.930
Ethan: Know,

266
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.370
Ethan: And less sensitive

267
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

268
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

269
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your plan is, is to see your friend.

270
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.500
Ethan: Yep.

271
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:08.820
Ethan: See my

272
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.020
Ethan: See my mom.

273
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.690
Ethan: That's gonna be good to you.

274
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.720
Ethan: To I saw her once we

275
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:31.050
Ethan: She was like I was unaware, because I wasn't talking to her much or, you know, I was in that period where I wasn't like being very present sun.

276
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:42.090
Ethan: But she took the coven like the shelter at home, stuff like, way more seriously than I did. I'm pretty serious like you know

277
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:57.420
Ethan: About following all those rules and everything, but she like she has, hasn't even been to a supermarket. She's very strictly like ordered every single thing that she needs. He won't go it like close to the delivery guy when he drops things off and like

278
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.110
Ethan: I think she's being super cautious because she is older, you know,

279
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.270
Ethan: She's a

280
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.310
Ethan: Is 75 or 76

281
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:24.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you know all over the news that's what the President keeps saying to I keep hearing him say you know that we need to protect our, our elderly and they need to really be cautious and on guard and

282
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so if you know that makes sense. You know that she is trying to be careful and that's good. She's trying to be careful because you know

283
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.380
Yeah.

284
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like there's enough that's happened already this year, we don't need any more.

285
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crazy, you know,

286
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.370
Ethan: Yeah.

287
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're close with your mom and I know that you know if anything happened to her. You'd feel horrible.

288
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.760
So,

289
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can thank you mom for being so

290
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: secure and protected, you know, protecting yourself.

291
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:09.480
Ethan: Yeah, she's great. Like that. I remember she has some weird health scare or she had some vertigo episode or something.

292
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:26.160
Ethan: This is like 10 or 1520 years ago even and she just got really into being super healthy like eating really healthy and getting you know she she does her yoga and exercise classes and

293
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.870
Ethan: So I remember talking to her about it and realizing that she

294
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.790
Ethan: For her, it's all about being around for the family, you know,

295
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You

296
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.760
Ethan: And I mean, of course, she doesn't

297
00:30:46.050 --> 00:31:04.080
Ethan: Want to die. Nobody wants to die, but it's like, you know, I need to be around for women for my grandkids or whatever. So she or he or she, she feels like I still need a lot of support in life, though. So yeah, she takes, like, super, super extra good care of herself.

298
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.110
Ethan: Which I think that's pretty cool.

299
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is really cool.

300
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.810
Ethan: She said, that's a good role model not way for sure.

301
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good stuff.

302
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.540
Ethan: Like I haven't

303
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.060
Ethan: I went on this trip about how

304
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.320
Ethan: My, my life.

305
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:49.980
Ethan: Um, I was already like predisposed to be an alcoholic and all that stuff, but I'm definitely was when my father died when I was in my teenage years and so guys

306
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.190
Ethan: I went in this period or my life is just all it's been all women like I'm

307
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:08.760
Ethan: Often friends with women or, you know, or, you know, and I have a girlfriend. And then I have my sister and my mom and my aunt. It's like everyone's female in my family, so I

308
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.590
Ethan: Haven't had a father figure

309
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.890
Ethan: To kind of be the, the one that

310
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.510
Ethan: To be a role model. That's a little tougher something, you know,

311
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.400
Ethan: Yeah, so, and I'm just sort of built though and

312
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.830
Ethan: I kind of a

313
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:37.950
Ethan: I don't, I'm not angry, the world or anything because because of this, but I see and I see this similar similarity and a lot of my friends.

314
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.850
Ethan: Like strong fathers are really you're kind of unusual in the world. It seems like

315
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:54.060
Ethan: Almost. And I don't know if it's because you know people with similar families like at tend to end up being friends with

316
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.220
Ethan: You know, other families, the same so

317
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.860
Ethan: So happens that like most of my friends.

318
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:13.050
Ethan: Don't you know to her like their, their father wasn't around or they're not, they don't have that much of a relationship with their father or Lily. Lily is that way. She doesn't

319
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:21.720
Ethan: another funny thing is, Lily is this liliya and her whole extended family is also women, they're just all women.

320
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:33.330
Ethan: When I heard a Christmas. There's, like, you know, I don't know, there's like a couple of guys on like my sister's wife's side of the family but developed sure a lot of damage.

321
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have great female influence

322
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:48.360
Ethan: Yeah, so I will this great and I really am a total MAMA'S BOY. And I have this great mom. So I had a lot of like

323
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:58.950
Ethan: A great role model and kind of in that what you know what she's given me, which I think is just amazing. It's invaluable like I

324
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:18.750
Ethan: And maybe I'm maybe guys that have a stronger fathers, the live longer, it doesn't make that much of a difference, but it just I I pictured in my mind, all of a sudden, that's the person who I would ultimately feel guilty of that.

325
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:32.220
Ethan: You know, my mom will just forgive me forever. I mean, I hate hurting her and I know and all that stuff. But she's just not going to be the one that's going to that gives me that gives me a talking to you about like being, you know,

326
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.520
Yeah.

327
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:43.440
Ethan: Or currently sort of Curtis career strategy or a baby. One is like investing. I don't know what the hell to do that with investing so like

328
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:55.110
Ethan: I've just as I've been making all this money in the last year. Is it just all goes my checking account like like I kind of know Yeah keep go down visor and but I just like, don't do it with it and nobody

329
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.290
Ethan: Nobody

330
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.550
Ethan: Nobody helped

331
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.980
Ethan: I don't know, blaming it on my environment or whatever but

332
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't have that strong male that can say, hey, you need to invest in this or you need to do.

333
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This or you need to. Yeah, yeah.

334
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:17.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it.

335
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

336
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You, you definitely, I can tell that you are really tired.

337
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:29.790
Ethan: Really

338
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you keep having these pockets of

339
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.150
Ethan: I'm

340
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.690
Ethan: Sometimes I'm

341
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:41.490
Ethan: You know,

342
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.260
Ethan: Or another I might

343
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.340
Ethan: I might be

344
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:54.660
Ethan: Like have a super talkative, then I might have a sleepy day you've also accused me my keys, but you've met you mentioned several times. Like, you know, it's like so sleepy. When I see

345
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This lately, you have

346
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you and I. The first couple months.

347
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're

348
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:08.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, doing things like you're supposed to your, your presentation was a lot more alert. Not a lot more

349
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ethan

350
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

351
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And, but the last

352
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: month or two.

353
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, last month, month and a half, maybe is

354
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it's a lot of it has to do with the stress that you're going through at work. I know that.

355
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the late hours that you work in and how much time you're putting in. And I don't know about you, but I know sitting in front of a computer.

356
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Plays wonders on my eyes.

357
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it hurts after a while you feel like you're bugging out of your head, you're

358
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Heading. You know what I mean.

359
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:51.390
Ethan: And it's Tara, I had all those problems like it for the first time I developed certain wrist pain that you get when you're just sitting and type, type in tune to too much, but it's

360
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:51.780
Like

361
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Carpal tunnel or something.

362
00:36:55.350 --> 00:37:04.050
Ethan: Something, it's not the one in your fingers. And so when that happens like right here in your wrist. I think it's because you're supposed to hold your hands straight instead of like twisting

363
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.870
Ethan: Um,

364
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.110
Ethan: There was an M for you.

365
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.190
Ethan: I was trying to

366
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.720
Ethan: Get back to my

367
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.620
Ethan: Original thought which I totally lost track.

368
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.640
Ethan: Yeah, so the

369
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:44.130
Ethan: The consistent like sleep and energy and everything. Oh, that's right. We're talking about how I haven't been

370
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:55.920
Ethan: Or I can, yeah, I can feel it and Atlanta. It's just exactly like you said for the last couple of months when kind of coming back to sobriety and

371
00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.010
Ethan: I just feel

372
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:08.100
Ethan: Disconnected. I'm like, even wanna I'm glad I'm writing a journal entries and everything, but I don't have the same like I'm

373
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.660
Ethan: So,

374
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:19.470
Ethan: Passionate like attachment to my, you know, how am I doing, emotionally, I can write a bunch about it or whatever.

375
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.330
Ethan: And it's a

376
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feeling that

377
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.880
Ethan: It's it's a work.

378
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.230
Ethan: I think it wasn't really what

379
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:43.050
Ethan: There are people that can do work. Work binges like I just did that where it's more like a healthy sort of Marathon, whereas the way I do it. It's like this punishing

380
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:54.480
Ethan: It's like I i kind of let go of everything else in my life and I just let the obsessive part part of my mind attached to this.

381
00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:06.720
Ethan: Problem and I just totally consumes me. Yeah. And so it's like I'm going through this really intense drug binge, basically. And so that's

382
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.830
Ethan: What I that's what

383
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:19.290
Ethan: That's what you know for better for worse, that's how I got good what I'm doing. Ultimately, a long term goal would be to have passion and to be able to

384
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.810
Ethan: Do work hard and be good at what I do, but but not be

385
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:36.660
Ethan: Like this isn't a first that I've definitely had other, other times where it's like, I don't look at my email for a month and a half, because I'm too absorbed with

386
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.880
Ethan: Whatever it is.

387
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.810
Ethan: Whatever thing is going on at work.

388
00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.960
Ethan: Yeah, it's funny. So there's a fine line between

389
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:57.120
Ethan: Think about Olympic athletes like is that a weird addiction or is that a healthy thing there.

390
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know.

391
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it gets a case by case, you know, basis, really. And if they're balancing. You know what they're doing.

392
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But then you think about it, it's a career. So, you know, we definitely invest, invest a lot of time in our careers and if that's their career. Of course they're going to invest, you know, more into that than anything. So, that makes sense.

393
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:25.830
No.

394
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.210
You know,

395
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.040
Ethan: Yep.

396
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People told me that you need to work smarter not harder.

397
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

398
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not sure how to get exactly do that.

399
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so

400
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One day, maybe I'll figure that that

401
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know gifts out but

402
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.560
I'm

403
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Certainly not something that I can figure out now, that's for sure.

404
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you either

405
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.400
Yeah.

406
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.000
Ethan: My priorities, so like the way I did this project.

407
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:32.640
Ethan: If you were shot. Let's say like this company was stopping for an external contractor to do it and to do it as to do a good, you know, a job, you know, solid job. It's kind of like getting a new roof on the house or something. It's like gave us something that will last for for, you know,

408
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:41.790
Ethan: For 10 years but don't rebuild the whole don't go crazy rebuilding all thing, but my personal priorities in life are to

409
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:55.140
Ethan: Build it build some things build things with like the ideal like the perfect architecture. Right. And they didn't really stipulate that they they allowed me to do that.

410
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.540
Ethan: You know what I'm saying.

411
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:05.400
Ethan: I could have done this and actually in the in the years at my company, there have been

412
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:14.130
Ethan: Very similar projects where it's basically like there's this system that's running in this location, move it to this other location.

413
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:28.140
Ethan: And there's kind of half assed ways that I could have done it in like four or five solid work days and and it'd be like shitty to work with and it wouldn't work quite right. And no one else would be able to and and

414
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.790
Ethan: So that, that's the like duct tape version.

415
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:43.080
Ethan: But, but I fully did this in the lake. So I took this thing from being in sort of poor repair and I made it like

416
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:51.360
Ethan: This year's model, you know, and I mean I like I rebuilt it brand new. It's like a perfect restoration job.

417
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.460
Ethan: But that was, that was my

418
00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:05.070
Ethan: That was my. Those are my require I made it made up those requirements, they didn't tell me to like, you know, build a sleek sports car. They just said like

419
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.670
Ethan: You know, moving from point A to point B.

420
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's your workout, they come

421
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:20.280
Ethan: Well, it's if I didn't get to do that if I didn't get to like build build things. Well, then I would

422
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.310
Ethan: Then it really would be work.

423
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:34.230
Ethan: To me it's not work as much if I'm like building if I'm making this thing that I think it's like that. I'm really passionate about, like, making it

424
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.130
Ethan: Making it all, you know, awesome. Make it work or like

425
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.210
Ethan: Like, you know, building, building nice things.

426
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.720
Ethan: So I don't know.

427
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:55.920
Ethan: I am fortunate to have gotten myself in these in a in a position like I'm in

428
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.960
Ethan: Where I like I have that kind of freedom, but also I can

429
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.370
Ethan: I can figure out

430
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:14.880
Ethan: More compromises, do you some parts of it like the sexy.

431
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.290
Ethan: Well, I already kind of do that I really kind of try my best.

432
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.690
Ethan: These are giant distributed systems. There's like

433
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:29.850
Ethan: I said it's like 800 computers that are involved in our website right

434
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.400
Ethan: Right, and there's like

435
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.770
Ethan: Five that are involved in this system that I moved

436
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:46.680
Ethan: What I did at the beginning was I drew this box conceptual box around like I'm gonna

437
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:55.710
Ethan: Everything inside this box isn't going to change significantly and everything is going to connect to the to the

438
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.800
Ethan: System around it. I'm

439
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.970
Ethan: In a very modern and sleek and and

440
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.310
Ethan: I sort of perfect not perfect but

441
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:20.520
Ethan: Kind of exactly the, the, the best way that I can say. Anyway, I kind of do i i managed it by I'm going to change this. I'm not going to change that. And I'm going to do really well at this one thing

442
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:27.690
Ethan: And so that was like what I was like, I started arguing with that guy in Germany about it. About things because he was just like

443
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:38.640
Ethan: I was insisting on like no I'm not going off into that other he thought I could make this easier by changing those eight other things. And I'm like, no way. And that's like this, this whole other

444
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.830
Ethan: Thing. It's like outside of the realm of what I'm working on.

445
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:49.410
So,

446
00:45:51.030 --> 00:46:00.300
Ethan: I love my work because it's when I'm doing that in a lot of ways. It's not work for me. It's like, that's what I love is figuring that stuff out and

447
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

448
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.280
Ethan: And building it.

449
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:16.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you everything is kind of wrapping up a little bit with your work. So things are back to a normal pace instead of cramming and and working these crazy hours that you were working

450
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, good.

451
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:19.620
And

452
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.890
Ethan: I'm in this interesting position where I can

453
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:32.070
Ethan: I have things that I have to do before my time is up. But I have a lot of freedom for making decisions on like what I do.

454
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.870
Ethan: I have very

455
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.860
Ethan: Very low accountability. Like, I don't have to

456
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.240
Ethan: Do x or y on a day to day basis.

457
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:50.910
Ethan: I'm totally like manage my own time. I have to do these these 7am teaching sessions which are okay, but

458
00:46:53.370 --> 00:47:05.370
Ethan: Yeah, so I'm going to try to be smart about what I invest my energy and my time and that will be good, good for the company and good for my stepping stone like my, you know,

459
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.960
Ethan: Movement to whatever my next job is going to be

460
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Okay, so tell me what you're gonna do this week.

461
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:27.720
Ethan: This week I'm gonna work on my resume. I'm going to take some time, I'm going to do all this stuff that we talked about, like, Mom, and trying to see a date see Dan and

462
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:36.930
Ethan: I'm in a backburner the exercise thing because I keep saying I'm going to do it. And so maybe I'll get inspired, but I'm not going to promise because

463
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.900
Ethan: Because I don't want to keep not doing it.

464
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.900
Ethan: But I want to focus on like the the

465
00:47:51.030 --> 00:48:00.330
Ethan: Finding my adult there. The last resume that I wrote and starting to kind of outline how I'm going to turn it into my my new resume.

466
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:02.760
Ethan: That's my

467
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.300
Ethan: For my for my personal self care.

468
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And sleeping.

469
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.890
Ethan: Yes, sleeping normal as well as normal as possible.

470
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:21.690
Ethan: No more like working to, you know, until I can't keep my eyes open, several times. Like, I'm like,

471
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:29.310
Ethan: You know, falling asleep on my keyboard and liliya like dragging me over into the bed. So no more of that.

472
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. Yeah. Where's your body down here me in system down

473
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.140
Ethan: So,

474
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:35.700
Ethan: I'm glad.

475
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And find time to have fun.

476
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:49.800
Ethan: You know, yeah. Right. Okay. So everything that we already talked about. And then also the the plan. The trip with liliya and even if it turns into like a drive down the coast or something like that.

477
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.040
Ethan: I'd like to do something. And the sooner the better.

478
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:03.960
Ethan: She just said she has pretty much no responsibilities right now because her. She basically

479
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.940
Ethan: That she wants to get a job, but she doesn't know what

480
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:17.640
Ethan: He's sort of starting all over her career in some way with she has her restaurant experience, but they decided to close that restaurant.

481
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.360
Ethan: Then she wants to go to

482
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:31.260
Ethan: As soon as the restrictions are lifted and she wants to go and spend like three weeks with our family and Ukraine, which I'm supportive of him because he hasn't been there and like

483
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.260
Ethan: More than two years.

484
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:40.350
Ethan: And when she comes back. That's sort of, you know, serious job bonding time for

485
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.250
You

486
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.080
Ethan: So we're both in this weird weird kind of limbo period.

487
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.160
Yeah.

488
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will you be going over with her.

489
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.620
Ethan: Yes.

490
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:03.690
Ethan: I am overdue to see her family as well. And I like going to Ukraine. I like going to hear her family.

491
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:13.980
Ethan: The reason I said yes hesitantly is like, I will absolutely go unless for whatever reason the timing, you know,

492
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:23.070
Ethan: It's a high priority for me. But it's not the highest priority. If there's like some some other thing with my family here.

493
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:33.000
Ethan: Job, you know, once in a lifetime job opportunity. I'm like, I like passive vital like good go spend a week in Ukraine.

494
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.970

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

497
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, try to stick to the plan as much as you can and try to, you know, start acclimating and engage yourself and getting back

498
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.140
Ethan: My journal tonight about how I was less like sort of visibly tired when I saw you are or

499
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:05.130
Ethan: Yeah, just sort of burnt out and disconnected. I'm already saying that those kind of things in my journal but it'd be great if over this coming week I can

500
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.510
Ethan: Improve, you know, make an

501
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.010
Ethan: Yeah, make an improvement.

502
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.220
Ethan: And like a noticeable improvement that I can feel I should be able to sort of snap out of it at this point.

503
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, get some rest.

504
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:20.850
