00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.240
Yeah.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.850
Richelle Direny: But I think I may have no, hold on.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.910
Richelle Direny: Hold on one second.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.690
Okay.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.730
Richelle Direny: OK, I see the day these I'm talking to your virtual clinic. They got me second guessing myself making me think I'm a little

12
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.180
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry, I'm getting a little

13
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.470
Jessica Tate: Oh no, you're fine.

14
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:52.440
Richelle Direny: Take your time. You know when you when you don't when your, your name is so prevalent you have like a bunch of people with the same name. And if you don't pay attention to the last name.

15
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.490
Yeah.

16
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.460
Richelle Direny: So,

17
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.440
Jessica Tate: So was it not me.

18
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.010
Richelle Direny: No you're not. You're supposed to be where you are. Oh.

19
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, I did what I did right I think because I don't remember booking you i think i don't know if someone else or you had called into this appointment.

20
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.990
Jessica Tate: Yes, because I was supposed to see you 13th and I missed it. So I called in and they gave me today.

21
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.100
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. So they had me thinking, I'm the one that did stuff.

22
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:32.130
Jessica Tate: No, they, they, my, my phone broke and it took a week to come in. So like as soon as it came in. I called and they said that I would have to go to the virtual clinic so I did and they made it for today.

23
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.210
Jessica Tate: So they did.

24
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.390
Richelle Direny: You see, the thing is I book a lot of my own appointments

25
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:47.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, when I know like I know I know who I booked in who I didn't. Yeah, that's what I saw you on my calendar. I was like okay I guess she called in to book an appointment.

26
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.800
Jessica Tate: Yeah, they, they definitely booked it

27
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.190
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Alright, so now we're on the same page. Everything is golden.

28
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.290
Richelle Direny: Let us know. I can't get into another

29
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.210
Richelle Direny: So how is everything. Um, since the last time was men. It's been like a month, I think.

30
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.320
Jessica Tate: Yeah. Oh.

31
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.740
Jessica Tate: Oh right, it's been kind of stressful.

32
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.540
Jessica Tate: Night. I'm sure you've heard this probably a million times, but my husband hasn't got his unemployment yet and

33
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:33.060
Jessica Tate: It's like our trash is literally thank God they finally did gave us food stamps. So we have food but like in there. They can't shut any of our bills off, thank God.

34
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:43.830
Jessica Tate: But like my electric bills over $1,000 the trash bill. They don't care if it's Cogan or not. If you don't pay and you know you

35
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.970
Jessica Tate: Know he has $3 the bank account. So that's like stressful and he tried to call them and

36
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.880
Jessica Tate: There's so many people call and they won't even let you wait. They just say hey we're having a lot of phone calls, try again later click

37
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.100
Jessica Tate: So today is 38 days and I've called every single day. And I've got to talk to them three times.

38
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:27.060
Jessica Tate: And they've all told us something different. So I don't know, we talked to a supervisor. We talked to some lady like last Friday. She's like, it's perfect, like we got everything. It's good. You're good to go. You should see BC and money and then we open up his account and it says

39
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:42.570
Jessica Tate: The ship was denied. And I'm like, oh my god. So then we talked to a supervisor this Friday. And she was like, I don't know what's going on. But you are approved. And you should you should hear something by Saturday or Sunday and what's today Monday we have heard a thing. So

40
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.320
Richelle Direny: And this is

41
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.430
Richelle Direny: Our employment.

42
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.960
Jessica Tate: Yes, yes. Everyone that he works with has got

43
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.850
Jessica Tate: Their fourth check already and we haven't got one. So,

44
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.340
Jessica Tate: That's literally the only thing stressful in our lives right now because it's getting

45
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.560
Jessica Tate: It's getting

46
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.530
Jessica Tate: I mean, we were stressing about food, but

47
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.710
Jessica Tate: They helped us with that they've got so we do, we do have food now so

48
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.440
Richelle Direny: Let me remove this background.

49
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:25.170
Jessica Tate: But looking at I'm looking at the bills like all my app. It's like starting to scare me because like they're going up and up, like our phone bills like in the six hundreds and

50
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:44.010
Jessica Tate: You know all. It sounds like hey pay if you can, or like we have $3 and like the the stimulus check. We thought we would have his unemployment by now. So what we did. He got 1700 we took 1500 of that and gave it like we're buying this House on land contract.

51
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:54.240
Jessica Tate: So we took me 1500 and just send it to them because we didn't want to get behind them. This now you know like out of everything. We don't want to get behind on this because they're the type of people that

52
00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.910
Jessica Tate: you blink wrong and they will take you to court and take this House and where we let her have two years left on it. So we don't want to mess that up so

53
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.800
Richelle Direny: We kinda you own your home.

54
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:14.640
Jessica Tate: Yes. Yeah, it was five. Five year land contract October we have a little over two years, October will be three years.

55
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.790
Jessica Tate: But since this has been going on. So we are a little bit paid up on that I think like by two months, but we kind of screwed ourselves because

56
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:36.420
Jessica Tate: We were just thinking like, hey, it's going to be easy. Everyone else at his job has got got it. So let's just go ahead and take 1500 and send to them. So we don't have to worry about it and then

57
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:48.300
Jessica Tate: He hasn't got unemployment. So we've been trying to live off you know like $200 for almost two months now. But like I said, they did give us food. So that's just, it's

58
00:06:49.230 --> 00:07:05.790
Jessica Tate: It's starting to and it's making us like argue and fight and stuff because he's stressed out about it and he's not used to be in home so he's getting on my nerves and you know I love him, but I don't want him here 24 seven and he is. I hate to say that, but

59
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.820
Jessica Tate: Yeah, he said, I mean for saying that. But I'm like we just, we have a certain way, like you get up and go to work and I take care of the baby and I do housework and we just have rhythm and then we hang out on the weekends like

60
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.900
Jessica Tate: That or, you know, maybe a little bit when he comes home at night. But he, you know, today's 38 days that he's been home so

61
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.620
Jessica Tate: Yes girl yes yes 30 days today. What's this

62
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.940
Jessica Tate: I'm I'm having a meeting you go down. Okay.

63
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.810
Jessica Tate: I'm gonna put in my earphones because she come in here and

64
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.310
Jessica Tate: They were, they were out there mowing and waiting. But I guess they're done so.

65
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.930
Jessica Tate: Yeah, cuz she has a pool up on she didn't use the bathroom.

66
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.030
Jessica Tate: Hello.

67
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.850
Jessica Tate: Yeah, okay. Yeah.

68
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.210
Jessica Tate: All right.

69
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.710
Jessica Tate: Yeah but besides that, I'm good.

70
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.980
Richelle Direny: I think a lot of it is, it's an adjustment all around in everything.

71
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.660
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, one of the things is remembering it so

72
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.510
Richelle Direny: Like with with anything with anything.

73
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.760
Richelle Direny: It's an adjustment. So let's say if now you guys are home together for six months.

74
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.270
Richelle Direny: And he's

75
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.840
Richelle Direny: You're going to miss that, like, because like you've gotten adjusted to being together all the time.

76
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.730
Jessica Tate: I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I forget, hit the side

77
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.600
Richelle Direny: I think when you reached over you with your hand, probably, click the off button.

78
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.320
Jessica Tate: Yeah, I

79
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.380
Jessica Tate: Think so. So, oh yeah, there's a leave button right there. Sorry.

80
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:18.780
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I think maybe well that so that's that's probably what the thing is, and like you said, a lot of your arguments is probably stemming from the fact that you're both individually frustrated with the situation not necessarily at each other.

81
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and you don't want to argue with each other, but you're frustrated at the overall situation.

82
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.770
Jessica Tate: Yeah and we end up arguing

83
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:39.360
Richelle Direny: With each other. Yeah, because my because my frustration is communicated one way his frustration is community. Another way. Then you have the baby because she dessert she desires a certain time and attention.

84
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you're

85
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.500
Richelle Direny: Able to provide to her because one you're preoccupied with the things that you're losing

86
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.400
Jessica Tate: Alton. Right.

87
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:56.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's um you know and and i think if you guys can come to that place where you're like, Okay, we're really just upset with

88
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.470
Richelle Direny: Over our situation in the circumstances and ultimate

89
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.000
Richelle Direny: And you know what ultimately

90
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.670
Richelle Direny: It's really depending on how you look at how the state is handling this whole

91
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:24.360
Richelle Direny: Thing. It's. There's also the overall frustration with that because it's like there's this new mean that's going around safe bet Cove, it seems to be a little selective on who the businesses that it affects

92
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.010
Richelle Direny: This is our fun grocery stores all these big businesses.

93
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.300
Richelle Direny: But the mom and pops are suffering.

94
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.430
Richelle Direny: Corona

95
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.700
Jessica Tate: Like

96
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.570
Richelle Direny: What you're doing

97
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:47.640
Jessica Tate: New right that that is so true. There's a, there's a business on town like where I get my wax melts, which of course I'm completely out and she sells all kinds of stuff like

98
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:56.040
Jessica Tate: It's all new stuff, but it looks old it it's like primitive like house where and that's where I get a lot of my stuff and she

99
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.780
Jessica Tate: God, I'm so sorry. I don't know why I keep doing that.

100
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.880
Richelle Direny: You are walking

101
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.990
Jessica Tate: YES I YES. That's why I said, Sit down, but um she

102
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.000
Richelle Direny: Hold on, you're muted.

103
00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:08.190
Jessica Tate: It's the daughter pulled like the bottom of them and like they if I'll be watching the video. They'll palsy, or move it to the next video. And I think that's what it's what's known because I will literally wasn't touching anything, it did it again.

104
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.620
Jessica Tate: Though, and everybody okay please

105
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.590
Jessica Tate: Go Go in there. We're done. You need to get cleaned up, go please. Thank you.

106
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:32.100
Jessica Tate: But anyway, she's not willing to be able to open back up shit like it hit her heart, she's not. She's not allowed. That was her whole livelihood and it's not essential what she's selling. So are you guys come out here now.

107
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.530
Jessica Tate: Okay.

108
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.230
Jessica Tate: Here I go.

109
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.510
Jessica Tate: So, yeah.

110
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.170
Jessica Tate: I'm just going back and forth, back and forth, trying to stay away from

111
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.210
Richelle Direny: Hello. You getting exercise. Oh.

112
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.850
Jessica Tate: Yeah, for sure. Um,

113
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.220
Jessica Tate: But yeah, that's

114
00:12:51.870 --> 00:13:03.690
Jessica Tate: That's definitely right about the like the big, big businesses stuff which i think i think it's essential because I'm addicted to my like literally my wax melts i i

115
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.970
Jessica Tate: Probably have

116
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:17.430
Jessica Tate: I mean, if it wasn't for coven I'd probably have at least 50 different kinds. I'm like, when I get up in the morning before I even use the bathroom I switch my burner on

117
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:30.420
Jessica Tate: So I burn them all the time and i'm i'm down real low and I don't trust anyone else's because I've ordered on one line. And they're like, if they're the strongest and you can barely smell him so it just sucks that

118
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.310
Jessica Tate: I talked to her on Facebook.

119
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.480
Richelle Direny: She's losing and you know ultimately a lot of small business owners.

120
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:46.890
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of like that conversation like I've had with many people. And I'm like, you know, some people are saying well stay home stay home and then other people are saying, no, I gotta go back to work and

121
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:57.270
Richelle Direny: You're speaking from in. It's kind of like I say, well, you have to be neutral because the one that saying stay home financially. Maybe you are able to stay home for the next month or so.

122
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:12.390
Richelle Direny: Because maybe you work enough money or you have whatever the situation is or you're working from home, so you are able to stay home. So don't be selfish to the people who their livelihood comes from them, opening up their small mom and pop stores or, you know,

123
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:23.160
Richelle Direny: Because from people need to go out to work. So you can't be selfish in that aspect because they want to go out, not to say that they want to go. Spread the Love or share the love. They're just saying, hey, I want to eat just like you.

124
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's just like you have to find some common ground. And I think that's where

125
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:38.280
Richelle Direny: You know, now you know as much as like I might not necessarily I'm not big into politics or what have you. But the one thing that I can say that, regardless of how idiotic. Sometimes the President wants to sound.

126
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.310
Richelle Direny: Like I think ultimately he's trying to say, hey,

127
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.990
Richelle Direny: We can't keep this up.

128
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.420
Richelle Direny: We can't keep the country shut down forever.

129
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:54.780
Richelle Direny: Right, have to be able to allow people to go back out into work because then what's going to happen is that we all are not going to depend on the government to to give us something.

130
00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:01.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and you know, you know, and the government doesn't want you to completely dependent on them.

131
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.250
Richelle Direny: Right. Oh, I think we, I think the conversation should be

132
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:18.450
Richelle Direny: How can we be there to help each other and not just say people are mean and wanting to go out to work. I mean hell. I'm sure if you pay somebody to go clean up a beach or go clean up apart. They'll do it.

133
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.980
Richelle Direny: Because it's money.

134
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:31.770
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Um, so, you know, and like you said, you know, the electric companies are not saying, well, you know, do too cold. Good, we're going to, we're going to provide you electricity and we're not going to charge you and make your bill keep running.

135
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.100
Richelle Direny: You're going to say after that is over. Here's a payment plan.

136
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.300
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's

137
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.380
Richelle Direny: The same

138
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.690
Jessica Tate: Yes. Yeah. So yeah, they're

139
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.800
Jessica Tate: They're saying like

140
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.670
Okay.

141
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:53.610
Jessica Tate: Pay what you can to try to get it down lower. It says, it says something like that, you know, because as soon as the government says, hey, you don't have to provide them electric seconds later.

142
00:15:54.270 --> 00:16:07.380
Jessica Tate: notices that will be sent out like we are. When a Schecter shut off so you know they which that's their business, they have to make money too. So they're, they're not. I mean, I'm sure they're probably getting some type of help.

143
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:21.090
Jessica Tate: You know, whoever owns you know my my electric company. So it just, I don't know. It just sucks. It's, it's affecting everybody and I thought it said we're supposed to our

144
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:32.640
Jessica Tate: Ohio was supposed to open back up may 10 and then the governor Skylar just heard that the governor said they're extending it until

145
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.160
Richelle Direny: The end of

146
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.150
Jessica Tate: The end of May.

147
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:44.910
Jessica Tate: Yeah, may 29 so like he was all excited that he was going back to work. And so I don't know. It's a stressful.

148
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:51.390
Richelle Direny: If they're if they're if they're um, because like in Florida, they're slowly opening up back parts of it.

149
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.830
Richelle Direny: They have

150
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.880
Jessica Tate: Been here too.

151
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.270
Jessica Tate: But not like all of it.

152
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.180
Richelle Direny: What was, what did he, what was he doing

153
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.740
Jessica Tate: He is a

154
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:15.540
Jessica Tate: He's a commercial electrician like he's building. Well, they were supposed to have it done by like the 15th of May, which is like what happened, but they this hill. Sure. Clark.

155
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:27.990
Jessica Tate: It's like an electric company. Anyway, they're building these big very expensive condos on high street in Columbus, Ohio, which is like a main street and in Columbus,

156
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:42.810
Jessica Tate: And so like he's putting all the electric in those and the of course they were already paid for that the company that he works for and they had to be shut down so I don't

157
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:53.250
Jessica Tate: They said, when the governor because he talked to him the other day and they said, when the governor says that like the whole states backup and that's when they'll start again.

158
00:17:53.730 --> 00:18:04.980
Jessica Tate: So they're not unlike his, his brother works for a place here and actual town we live in, because Skylar works two hours away from here, but he started back work today.

159
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:17.460
Jessica Tate: And I forget, I forget what he does. They make like parts like the business. It's from Australia, but they have which is weird that they'd have one in our little town, but they have a business and our little town.

160
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:29.640
Jessica Tate: But he's one of the head people. And I guess they started 50% people back to work. And since his brothers, like a boss. There he got to start my talk today.

161
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.170
Richelle Direny: So that's even more like, Oh, your husband started back work today, he said.

162
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.250
Jessica Tate: No, his brother.

163
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.600
Richelle Direny: Oh,

164
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.070
Jessica Tate: It's funny because a lot of people they

165
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.660
Jessica Tate: Get some because they're identical twins.

166
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:54.240
Jessica Tate: And so they're like, No, we like, Hey, I saw your work and like no you didn't. That's my brother, because you can't tell them apart. I mean, I can but like if you were to say, um, you wouldn't know. Like, which is when they're identical in every way.

167
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.710
Jessica Tate: But he has yet his brother started back today.

168
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.860
Richelle Direny: I mean, it definitely I'm sure it's very hard to

169
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.640
Richelle Direny: You know, to figure out in these hard times and

170
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.890
Richelle Direny: You know, you have to at the end of the day, it kind of, you have to have faith.

171
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.180
Richelle Direny: In something higher than yourself to to help you to maintain your sanity to get through it all.

172
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:45.660
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's what it is. You just have to help you to maintain your sanity that you just don't give up and know that this is one day closer to them coming up with some type of solution as to how we can get back out there to some type of you know functionality or something.

173
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.200
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

174
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.810
Richelle Direny: I mean, it is it is, you know, I mean, there is a lot that you can learn out of it.

175
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.190
Richelle Direny: And while

176
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.010
Richelle Direny: You try to

177
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:03.570
Richelle Direny: Make the best of the time spent because what like in all of everything that's happening, what is one good thing that you can say

178
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.820
Richelle Direny: That is coming out of it for you with

179
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.320
Richelle Direny: All of you being home.

180
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.490
Jessica Tate: I'm a lot of shifts getting fix that would not have our grass is not

181
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:25.500
Jessica Tate: To my waist. It's, it's done like once a week now and used to was not so he does which i mean i i couldn't blame him you know you were

182
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:38.700
Jessica Tate: You drive two hours to work. Work 12 hours sometimes eight to 10 to 12 hours and then two hours home, you don't feel like doing anything but eating. Take a shower and go to sleep. So that is one good thing.

183
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:45.060
Jessica Tate: Got a lot of stuff fakes. I don't know. Last time I talk to you. I don't know if I got my water back on or not, but it's back

184
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:51.450
Richelle Direny: Well, no, no, no. You said that you. I remember one of the frustration, you had was the fact that your water was oh

185
00:20:51.480 --> 00:21:14.460
Jessica Tate: Yes, it is back on. It's broke down twice since then, but the guy came like immediately and fixed it. So that's been good. Um, so that's actually really good. Um, that we have water and we've had it. I think almost a month now we've had it back on. Um, another thing like

186
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.560
Jessica Tate: Scholars like he's really like impatient and

187
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:29.340
Jessica Tate: He. I don't know. He's not understanding. Like there's hundreds of thousand people hundreds of thousands of people in the same boat as us.

188
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:36.180
Jessica Tate: So he thinks by yelling at these people that they're going to say, sir, you are absolutely right.

189
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.140
Jessica Tate: Thank you.

190
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.400
Jessica Tate: For calling me a comment. I will give you your money in two seconds. I'm like,

191
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:50.430
Jessica Tate: No, you cannot do that. It's going to make them put your shit on the bottom of the pile, like you, like, I know you're frustrated. So am I. But you can't

192
00:21:50.760 --> 00:22:06.270
Jessica Tate: Like talk to it. I've met I've worked in customer service. Maybe that's why I'm like that, but that's how does like fighting to because he will like yell and scream at them and he thinks that's going to make stuff better and it's not so i i like the last week, I'm

193
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:21.420
Jessica Tate: Like it even if he does get ahold of someone I like immediately just take the phone and Hill off to go again another part of the house because it will be yelling and stuff out him because he liked thinks they're purposely doing that.

194
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.240
Jessica Tate: They're purposely not doing it, but I'm like, it's not like five or 10 people Skylar like I know

195
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:37.110
Jessica Tate: He was like, but they work specifically for a while. And I'm like, and there's hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio that lost their job and they're in the same same position like these people

196
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:44.160
Jessica Tate: weren't ready for that and what they've done is they've hired like outside agencies absolutely no nothing. They don't

197
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:53.760
Jessica Tate: They're called contractors, but they don't know, they were just hired in there to answer the phone. So most of the people will like when you finally do get through. They can't

198
00:22:54.330 --> 00:23:02.970
Jessica Tate: They can't open up your file. They can't do anything. They can't transfer you it's just to try to like, man, the phones and he doesn't understand that.

199
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.730
Richelle Direny: Either and I'm like that much more frustrated

200
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:11.730
Jessica Tate: Yes. Yeah. And he and he was like whoa should be different because the covert. I'm like, yes, but you have to understand these people

201
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:22.470
Jessica Tate: They were trained in a certain way and just because code. Come along, doesn't mean all automatically just overnight learn their training, they do have to do new stuff but um

202
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:34.170
Jessica Tate: They they're gonna have to like train as they go if they do implement there they're going how they've always. I mean, they're still going unemployment. Oh, it's always been done, they can't just

203
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:47.280
Jessica Tate: You know, we're hundreds of thousands or however many employees, say, hey, we're doing it different, like each person asked retrained it he just he doesn't understand he's getting he's getting scared because he's like the provider and

204
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.870
Richelle Direny: I was just gonna say that.

205
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:51.990
Richelle Direny: voice of reason.

206
00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:01.350
Richelle Direny: And that's good. So like you're being that supportive understanding wife that like I'm frustrated. Just like you but like I get where they're coming from. So you kind of had

207
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:19.500
Richelle Direny: And I think what's happening right now. And I think this is where maybe some, some of your own. You would have to probably swallow some of your own pride in this moment, but it's more so finding to Stroke his ego, because what's happening is his manhood is coming into question he

208
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:27.030
Richelle Direny: He cannot provide like how can I be a man. If I can't even provide for my wife and child.

209
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.750
Richelle Direny: And he's like that that exact words about 10 times

210
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.250
Jessica Tate: He said that his words.

211
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:42.270
Richelle Direny: And he's not, he's not computing it as okay you're nobody is defining your manhood. Nobody is saying you're not a good husband and father

212
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:49.890
Richelle Direny: It's simply the reality of what everyone is faced with. But because as you know men are so conditioned

213
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.820
Richelle Direny: To think that what defines their manhood is them going out and working all these hours and bringing home all this money.

214
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:05.130
Richelle Direny: Because now you know what, Jessica, you're going to be happy because I worked all these hours and I paid your bills and you have food and the babies. Okay.

215
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:13.170
Richelle Direny: And he, it's not coming to him. Like I married you for you because I loved you not. How much money you can make us

216
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:31.290
Richelle Direny: And it's he has the understand and it's finding a way to communicate that to him and slowly keep it's almost like you're nursing it to him every day because he's going to need that constant assurance, because in his mind, his manhood is in straight questioning

217
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.250
Richelle Direny: If something happened. He's going to look at it as it's his fault.

218
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.010
Richelle Direny: He's not looking at it as this is a bigger issue way completely out of your control.

219
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:55.380
Richelle Direny: Right looking. It's his fault. Yeah, it is. It's a personal attack on him. And God forbid if you get frustrated or even you order a word of frustration to him. The world is coming to an end something wrong.

220
00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:06.510
Jessica Tate: Yeah, I mean I think it's time to like when I met him, he was in between dogs. He had just got laid off and he, he was like

221
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:21.840
Jessica Tate: Like I like you. Before a long time, but I didn't have anything to offer you, he, he had wrecked his cars. It was all busted up and looking crazy, which is setting out there, he still won't get rid of it, that's a whole nother topic. I don't even go there, but, um, he

222
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:39.840
Jessica Tate: He was in between jobs. I was like, I don't like i'm not i think like women that he dealt with in the past it was how much money like all that. I'm like, No, that's just, I, I have my I have my own so like this is

223
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:46.980
Jessica Tate: I was working, and he wasn't. And of course, when I got pregnant. We talked about me staying home.

224
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:57.210
Jessica Tate: And all that. So I think, um, and, like, oh, a lot of people was like he's not gonna keep a job. He's not going to hold a job. I don't know why they tell me that, because he's

225
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.880
Jessica Tate: literally two weeks before I found that was pregnant, he got a job.

226
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:14.190
Jessica Tate: And he's like, he didn't even have time to get unemployment from getting laid off but he's had a job sense. So, I hope, I hope he doesn't think like

227
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:26.610
Jessica Tate: Because it has nothing to do with money. I mean, he makes good money, but where we bought this house we live check to check and he makes really good money for the town we live in. He makes 20 started out

228
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:34.230
Jessica Tate: But it still makes us live check the check because we decided to buy this house so

229
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.060
Jessica Tate: We don't get extras. We haven't in a long time. I just want to make sure that our lights are our heat snot out and we can take care of her baby. And I think that's still kind of like hard

230
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.070
Jessica Tate: Because the women. He's been with in the past like they want to get their nails done.

231
00:27:53.670 --> 00:28:09.810
Jessica Tate: He was like you asked me to like, get your nails done once. And I'm like, No, chin. I got like 100 things and nail polish up I do my own nails. That's not. I'm like, I'm not a high maintenance person. I don't know if it's where I was a cosmetologist and I just do all my own stuff but

232
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:16.470
Jessica Tate: I don't know. I think just many years of being with those type of women. I think that's what it is.

233
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:24.510
Richelle Direny: Do you think he. It is a conditioning of a lot, especially of what they see, or maybe people are hanging around.

234
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:32.970
Richelle Direny: So then the question is if something was supposed to happen to him. He's taking care of the family now right

235
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:45.300
Richelle Direny: And you're happy with whatever. And because we talked in the past and you talked about how like with your history of addiction and all of that you know that if you were supposed to relapse. You knew, you're about to lose him and

236
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.050
Jessica Tate: You don't want to

237
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.650
Richelle Direny: Because you love him that much and you want your relationship to go into y'all sitting in a rocking chair. Oh.

238
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.740
Jessica Tate: I'm sorry, let me let me end this sorry my mom.

239
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:26.160
Jessica Tate: I'm so sorry. I thought I hit and I hit end and accept and I meant to hit the other one.

240
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.530
Richelle Direny: Oh, that's okay. So if the question is for you.

241
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:44.190
Richelle Direny: Do you love your husband and want it to work so much that if anything happened to him and he wasn't able to work, would you be willing to flip the role where you go work and take care of your family.

242
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.930
Jessica Tate: Oh yeah, I actually, I actually well he was still working. But I actually did for about three months.

243
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.960
Jessica Tate: Missy, she was born in June of 2017 and

244
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.200
Jessica Tate: I worked from like

245
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:12.750
Jessica Tate: September until December of 2017 and it was kind of working with the job that he had but he's very strong against

246
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:32.250
Jessica Tate: Daycare unless it's a family member and when and he got the job that he's at now, he got it there was literally no way except to go to daycare. So I basically had quit because I just had a minimum wage job working out a little mom and pop

247
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:47.640
Jessica Tate: Kind of like a gas station, but with no gas kinda like a little sore. And so it was either picking his job or mine. And of course, I wasn't minimum wage and it was over 20 so um

248
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:58.950
Jessica Tate: But yeah, I definitely what I work wherever I could, and he noticed that I try. Now, I think, I mean not during this covert the, I think it would

249
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:19.500
Jessica Tate: Because we live check to check. I think it would be easier if I worked, but he's like if I told you this, but he was abused by his mother really bad like really bad, like she should be in prison, when he was little and he's very afraid of that for her. So, so I don't

250
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.360
Richelle Direny: approve it taking care of

251
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.670
Jessica Tate: Yeah, really where

252
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.720
Jessica Tate: He's traveling

253
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.550
Richelle Direny: Yes, PTSD, then

254
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:38.460
Jessica Tate: He doesn't he says it doesn't bother him, but it does, it does. She did some really I've tried to getting to talk to people, but he, like, I don't know, it's weird, like his mother.

255
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:57.270
Jessica Tate: When she was pregnant, she just thought she was pregnant for his brother. So when his brother came out. The doctor said, Oh, there's another one. So he was like he was much, much smaller and kind of hidden behind him and he had to have like a blood transfusion and she refused. She said, No.

256
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:07.680
Jessica Tate: Letting die basically no he's not gonna hurt my baby. That's what she said, and that his dad was like, yes, he will give him blood. And what are you talking about

257
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:20.610
Jessica Tate: So they thought about it for a couple hours she she wasn't going to let him. She's gonna let him die. And I think because of that she abused him like she was like, You almost killed me and my son, like, I hate to like she's

258
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.280
Richelle Direny: When they're both

259
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.380
Richelle Direny: Pretty much have the same exact split

260
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:31.740
Jessica Tate: They yes and they're identical, you cannot tell them apart. Except, of course, when he was born. He was way much smaller but

261
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:50.160
Jessica Tate: He, you know, because he was he was so little. And I think a chi, which is his brother. He got most of the nutrients and stuff. But then as they grew identical in every way you can tell them apart of is she, I think she never bonded or whatever. I don't know.

262
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.520
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, it sounded like

263
00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.440
Richelle Direny: He is one of those things where, and part of the reason why I asked that question.

264
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.610
Jessica Tate: It's because it's that good like

265
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.310
Richelle Direny: I said it's that reassurance of

266
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.890
Richelle Direny: You know, just sharing like regardless. I'm here.

267
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:17.700
Richelle Direny: For us, I'm not here for how much money you make. It's kind of like no matter what happens, we're always going to be together so we can get through this together.

268
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:23.400
Richelle Direny: No matter how the going gets tough because the reality is you both have your own individual stories.

269
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:34.320
Richelle Direny: You have your own individual path. So you have two people who have been hurt and abused and had different experiences or what have you. That comes together, and now

270
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:44.100
Richelle Direny: Is making life work. You're making it where I'm not going to allow my passing the hurts and everything that I've experienced to define us. And so you're saying

271
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:53.040
Richelle Direny: It's not about material things, but it's about you. He's saying it's not about whatever he's faced in the past. It's about you and your daughter.

272
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's sometimes, sometimes with men. They do need that reassurance.

273
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:12.630
Richelle Direny: Even though. Yes, they know it, but sometimes like when I said their manhood is getting threatened and sometimes a lot of that that's built in the back of their mind outside of like society, making it like what defines a man

274
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.310
Richelle Direny: Even through

275
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:25.890
Richelle Direny: his upbringing, with his mom and maybe the mom showing the brother more love or more attention all of that sits in the back. Oh, you'll never amount to anything. You're worthless, you're this so now

276
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:38.370
Richelle Direny: He probably works to prove himself to you which inadvertently it's not you, that he's trying to prove himself to his, his mother because he needs her to accept him and show to evaluate him.

277
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:44.370
Richelle Direny: But he does it for you. So then he'll overcompensate for you and your daughter, simply because

278
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:54.120
Richelle Direny: He's still looking for that validation and even though maybe sometimes I'm not saying that for him. Sometimes people feel like, Oh no, I don't need it. But you do because of how you're acting with me.

279
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.110
But again,

280
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.100
Jessica Tate: That sounds like 100% what

281
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.140
Jessica Tate: You got to pay

282
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.590
Jessica Tate: You put the tell daddy you especially as the potty says

283
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:25.230
Jessica Tate: The word every time we put a pull up on her. She just thinks okay. It's free for all, I can just use it in my pants. We only put it on her at night and when she's outside blind but um but yeah that sounds like that. That sounds right. I mean, because

284
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.380
Jessica Tate: Like there's literally no. The reason why he would think that we've been together.

285
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.520
Jessica Tate: I'm almost four years now, and like help sometimes he'll like

286
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:46.320
Jessica Tate: Have to make me buy shampoo. I'm like, where we can just get that cheap shit now in my hair is going to be an afro, but I'm just like, Hey, that's cheaper.

287
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:57.780
Jessica Tate: And so he'll be like, Why don't you like go to Sally's and get like the you know the shampoo that you use, or the conditioner and i'm just like No, that's okay. Like, we can just use suave, and

288
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:11.130
Jessica Tate: names like I hear you in there saying your hair Afro it out because this cheap shit. And I'm like, Yeah, but I'm not going anywhere. It's still cleans my hair like it's fine. So he knows that sound.

289
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:19.260
Jessica Tate: That's probably is why he's like that because, I mean, I could see in the beginning, but he knows me now. Like I'm

290
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:34.320
Jessica Tate: I'm for this from that and I've never said that stuff and like his brother was was favorite is still favored. You know, like they're, they're both Marines, his mother.

291
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:43.860
Jessica Tate: His mother went to his brother's graduation didn't get his. He didn't have anyone any family out there, you know, he just graduated with no family and

292
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.750
Jessica Tate: And the thing. So it's still when he he tells me stuff in the sense, it doesn't bother but it does so that probably is why

293
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.870
Richelle Direny: They were bolted to the reason they were both in the same place and mom only acknowledged him but didn't know

294
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:12.030
Jessica Tate: Well, they didn't graduate, the same day was like it was like six weeks apart. But she. Yeah. Like if you go to her Facebook it's his. It's his brother and his sons and

295
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.710
Jessica Tate: Just

296
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.680
Richelle Direny: Did he feel she's still treating like he doesn't

297
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.810
Jessica Tate: Oh, yes, yes, yes, she

298
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.620
Richelle Direny: Is that

299
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:33.600
Jessica Tate: She, she doesn't like on on Christmas show can't well like good was grandmas and like, chill, chill, try to talk to my daughter, my daughter don't know her. And she's like, Who are you, but like if we see them out in public.

300
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.170
Jessica Tate: She won't even look our way and

301
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.840
Jessica Tate: I think that it doesn't bother me quite now but when she gets older.

302
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:56.370
Jessica Tate: She's going to be like, Why does a slightly, talk to me when the doors are shut, but she won't talk to them outside like and I told him I'm like she lives are going to be in her life where she's like, nah, and he was like I told you this, how would be and

303
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.510
Jessica Tate: I think a lot of his stuff comes from

304
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.030
Jessica Tate: From that

305
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.400
Richelle Direny: Wanting to be validated or the

306
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.050
Jessica Tate: Yes, from her.

307
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:17.070
Richelle Direny: From her and that will always be there until he comes to face that that hurt and those demons like he's still that he stuffs, or he says it's okay.

308
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.960
Richelle Direny: But I think for you.

309
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:30.120
Richelle Direny: It's being aware of it all and not to save that you're going to suppress certain things that you're seeing or feeling because you may think it will be a direct reflection.

310
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:40.500
Richelle Direny: But at the same time, I think some of that and how he tries to overcompensate with you where you think it's even a bit much.

311
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:50.820
Richelle Direny: It may be because it's being displaced because it's really how he feel because he wants. Because, you know, boys. Boys are. I don't know if you do you have this is your only child. Right.

312
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.620
Jessica Tate: Now, no I have 18 year old.

313
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.270
Richelle Direny: daughter or son.

314
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:59.310
Richelle Direny: Son so you know boys tend to they're drawn to their mothers. Yeah.

315
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.280
Richelle Direny: Hi.

316
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.960
Jessica Tate: He is still a mama's boy.

317
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:04.830
Jessica Tate: Yes.

318
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.810
Richelle Direny: And yes, boys are

319
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:23.760
Richelle Direny: If they're unbelievable with their, their like their super protective super so when you don't. When you're looking for that love and affection and it's given and maybe she has her own issues as to why she treats him, particularly that way. But when it's all said and done,

320
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:37.950
Richelle Direny: You know, a lot of sometimes you have to sit back and try to figure I think about like with your daughter or even in your son when he was younger. Sometimes when they get mad and they act out, you have to ask yourself where

321
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:48.660
Richelle Direny: Parts of this anger coming from what is causing is what is the catalyst as your behavioral action doesn't necessarily match.

322
00:39:49.260 --> 00:40:01.470
Richelle Direny: What the real issues are so like, you know, speaking about it, like, because we all have this external there's a force that drives us to feel a certain way to think and to act a certain way.

323
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.400
Richelle Direny: So like

324
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:08.310
Richelle Direny: Talks about if you financially you're strapped for cash and you don't know where the next meal is going to come from.

325
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:17.790
Richelle Direny: Then we start arguing. It's not because I'm mad at you. It's because i want i want to eat, and I don't know what to do. I don't. And so my frustration.

326
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.020
Richelle Direny: Is being taken out on us simply because I don't know what to do. So now we're speaking in two different ways. In two different languages and

327
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.650
Jessica Tate: The same

328
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.790
Richelle Direny: That with him. It's. That's why I said it's

329
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:39.150
Richelle Direny: How to see as women. I think that there's a bigger responsibility on us when it comes on to not just how we deal with our children, but how we deal with our partners.

330
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.610
Richelle Direny: Yeah, like constant

331
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:47.580
Richelle Direny: Feeding of the ego stroking the ego or that constant encouragement and saying it's okay like

332
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:59.040
Richelle Direny: I'm here with you, no matter what, like I would I say I do and I love you and I want to be with. It's like that constant reassurance that, you know, like, I'm happy that

333
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:03.600
Richelle Direny: You're home and you're able to take care of this. I'm happy that even though, like you said,

334
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:12.480
Richelle Direny: 38 days now you need to go back to work. It's because I've got loose to it. I've gotten used to you being out of the house for so long, maybe

335
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:29.070
Richelle Direny: You mean I probably had an issue with you being gone for so long. But now I've gotten used to you being away. So now when you come in, have my structure and my routine. When you come and try to mess that up. I get frustrated

336
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:31.260
Jessica Tate: Like

337
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:41.700
Richelle Direny: You have a set thing for your daughter dress today. He's home now. All of that goes through the door. You don't put a whole lot of time and energy into getting that shirt, T.

338
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.580
Richelle Direny: Through all of it.

339
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.160
Richelle Direny: Not frustrated because it was a lot of work. The one that

340
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:56.790
Richelle Direny: Right. You're not showing the respect, like let's continue to maintain that. So that's where my frustration comes from. So I say you need to go back to work. It's because

341
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:57.960
You're not respected.

342
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:12.900
Richelle Direny: And just what it is in. So it's addressing it in that way as to in this time, I think it's just learning how to encourage each other.

343
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.170
Richelle Direny: It's learning how to

344
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:31.950
Richelle Direny: hear him speak understand understanding what he's saying. And knowing how to respond to that piece of communication. I think that's what that is in this time we have to value.

345
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.370
Richelle Direny: Each other.

346
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:40.410
Richelle Direny: Is valuing that life is really short, honestly.

347
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:55.770
Richelle Direny: That is that and jobs are temporary. It's a, it's a temporary. It means to an end. But it's very I actually read this, I saw this on Facebook, which is so true. It says

348
00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:02.070
Richelle Direny: Life is short jobs are temporary health is wealth.

349
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.980
Richelle Direny: And the fourth one was you need God to survive.

350
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.240
Jessica Tate: I like that.

351
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.950
Richelle Direny: I use when I saw that I was like, wow, that's like all four statements are so powerful.

352
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:14.880
Jessica Tate: Yeah, they are.

353
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:20.550
Richelle Direny: The truth health right now is wealth not jobs health is

354
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:36.300
Jessica Tate: Yeah, that is, that's so true. That's so true. Um, I don't know how much longer we have, but I wouldn't ask you real quick. Um, when I talked to the doctor, she was talking about some lady doing some kind of

355
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.180
Richelle Direny: Thing with lightning. Dr.

356
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:52.830
Jessica Tate: Yeah, what is that because I talked to Skyler about it and he was not like I and I, it kind of scared me because she said it takes memories, you still have those memories, but it takes them and hide them and

357
00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:06.240
Jessica Tate: He just popped his head out was like it's not good shit, dude. I told you he was a Marine. He just, it's like is that mine, like what is that is that mine.

358
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.710
Richelle Direny: So this is

359
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:08.250
Jessica Tate: Salt.

360
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.280
Jessica Tate: How would you take a memory out of my head.

361
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.380
Richelle Direny: Oh, this is the thing.

362
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:21.180
Richelle Direny: I did talk to Josh Dr. Joe, because she did say she referred it. I did send out an email to her.

363
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.570
Richelle Direny: To inquire about it because basically my understanding of it.

364
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:29.640
Richelle Direny: It's

365
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.480
Richelle Direny: Let's use your husband's situation for a moment.

366
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.450
Richelle Direny: Even the issues. Doesn't bother him.

367
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.480
Richelle Direny: If somewhat like I it seems like it's somewhat like a trance that I'm putting you when it's

368
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.520
Richelle Direny: It's waking up those deep dark buried memories.

369
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:56.610
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and you're forcing it to come out to be able to deal with it because the reality is how we are and what we do a lot of times stems from those deep rooted

370
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.660
Richelle Direny: things that happen.

371
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:58.530
Jessica Tate: Yeah, we

372
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:05.700
Richelle Direny: Keep in the forefront of our minds. So it's like you're bringing it out and you're coming to terms with things and you're working through it.

373
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.570
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

374
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:12.270
Richelle Direny: The only thing that I know of is doing it this way.

375
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.220
Jessica Tate: Is what

376
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:24.180
Richelle Direny: It's doing it this way. That's the only thing I'm not sure about. It's not like we're sitting in an office that if anything happens you're sitting in your house with your daughter.

377
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:36.960
Richelle Direny: And let's see, there's a memory that comes to light and there's you have an intense emotional reaction towards it. How do you deal with that. How do you handle that over computer screen. Yeah.

378
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:48.060
Jessica Tate: See him, she was talking about. Because like in my wrath. I don't remember it. And I don't know if I want to. It was just like I was driving and then the next minute some

379
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.340
Jessica Tate: Big Fat white man that's, that's all I know he man was trying to put a sheet over my head.

380
00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:03.900
Jessica Tate: That's what I thought he was trying to do is trying to wrap me up because I was in shock, trying to get me off the highway into an ambulance, so I don't remember any of that. And she was saying that like it could

381
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:20.160
Jessica Tate: It could bring that up but take it away. And I don't know if I went over it like I don't know if I want to remember a semi slamming into me because I cannot remember that at all. It's, it's like that part is cut out. I do not remember that he at all and I

382
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.950
Richelle Direny: Go back to the question would then be what is the purpose of you remember that specific events I

383
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.020
Jessica Tate: Because that's what

384
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.910
Richelle Direny: She said, What does she say what does she say when you ask, did you ask her, like, what would be the purpose

385
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:42.510
Jessica Tate: And I remember when I didn't ask. I would just told her, because I was diagnosed with PTSD from that because like when I'm driving it still bothers me.

386
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:58.530
Jessica Tate: I won't pass a semi if I am on the highway and I have semis on either side of me. Like, I will hyperventilate like literally I cannot it freaks me out. I'm okay. If they're ahead of me, or like way behind me, but I just, I don't

387
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.480
Jessica Tate: I don't

388
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:10.950
Jessica Tate: I didn't say like, what is the purpose, but I was like, I wouldn't want. I don't know if I'd want to remember that. And she was like, but they could she could move it.

389
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:22.350
Jessica Tate: In another part of your brain and Skyler is very against a he's like thinking it's my mind control, and I just like, because I have trouble sleeping.

390
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:35.430
Jessica Tate: Which. Oh my god, she gave me. What is this pill. She gave me. I have never been so high in my entire life. And I dumped the bottle I refill one. What is it tries it down. Oh my god.

391
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.400
Richelle Direny: Who gave you that medication prescription

392
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:45.030
Jessica Tate: Dr. Jamison because I take over the counter sleeping pills. I take these I've took them since my wreck.

393
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.100
Jessica Tate: Just a

394
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.290
Jessica Tate: Just a sleep aid and

395
00:47:50.910 --> 00:48:01.950
Jessica Tate: They sometimes like they make before I take my drug test. I will not take them. The night before, because it will show up met methadone and oxy

396
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:15.750
Jessica Tate: In in my system. So I was like, What can I do because like literally the night before I take my drug tests I don't take these and then I'm up all night. I'm just so used to taking them, you know, for almost 11 years now. And I was like, is there.

397
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:26.640
Jessica Tate: Something maybe you could suggest because like you know if if you're drunk caster like that so many times you have to, and I

398
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:34.350
Jessica Tate: You have to go drive somewhere. And I was like, What can I do so she gave me tries it and I waited took them like a dummy. I took them.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:53.610
Jessica Tate: Saturday night because I forgot about them. And the next day was Easter. We were one up to his grandma's I they didn't make me go to sleep, but they may make high as hell all day. The next day I was sitting there like, I mean, I felt like I was drunk. I was falling into walls and everything.

400
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.950
Jessica Tate: I know for me.

401
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.500
Jessica Tate: You to the know I dumped those I

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:00.420
Richelle Direny: Sleep better

403
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.960
Richelle Direny: You said that you can sleep is it you say you got a bad accident from

404
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.180

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.390
Richelle Direny: That's what started going somewhere.

407
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.850
Richelle Direny: Huh. You were just going somewhere.

408
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:31.890
Jessica Tate: I was I was living in Columbus, Ohio, which is two hours from here and I was headed home. I was headed to my mom's house for Christmas. It was Christmas Eve. It was like 11 o'clock in the morning and a semi hit me and I end up spending like 15 days and grant hospital.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:46.620
Jessica Tate: broke my neck and back the admin on life support. I have messed up really bad dislocated my shoulder broke my leg like I got fucked up basically bad and ever since I can't sleep.

410
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:48.480
Jessica Tate: And

411
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.000
Richelle Direny: Because of the fear of you.

412
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.770
Richelle Direny: Getting hit

413
00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:04.230
Jessica Tate: I don't know. I don't know if it is I just I just couldn't sleep after that, I just, and I thought it was because of the pills, um,

414
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.060
Richelle Direny: Do you hear like the sound of a semi sometimes or like maybe

415
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:16.050
Jessica Tate: Sometimes I do, sometimes I do. It's kind of hearing beings it of getting hit because of because of the trauma attached to

416
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:24.930
Richelle Direny: Getting him. That's what it sounds like to me. It's just the trauma of you getting hit. So it's kind of like think about it like if you're a

417
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:32.730
Richelle Direny: Bell and like or something, she got hurt. And it's the screen that they make you will always be here, the screen is so distinctive

418
00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:52.230
Richelle Direny: That you're always going so any little thing. It's always going to bring you back to that event is it traumatic. Yes. Is it a life altering could be because it's a squeal. That is very distinctive that made you feel helpless in the moment. Yeah.

419
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.480
Richelle Direny: Because there's nothing you could have done about it.

420
00:50:55.050 --> 00:51:01.200
Richelle Direny: Now, when you talk about the summary. It isn't as if like the trauma is

421
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:03.570
Richelle Direny: Like

422
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.700
Jessica Tate: A movie and all here.

423
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.570
Jessica Tate: A semi and it brings you back when you got into the accidents.

424
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:17.160
Jessica Tate: Not all the time. But sometimes, I'll just jump up and know semis what by a scholar, look at me like I'm crazy. That happens

425
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:29.820
Jessica Tate: I'll know two or three times. I'm not all here in or or what we drive in and I'll be like, slow down and let it like go around do. And he's like, What are you talking about, and it's a little Ass Truck behind this.

426
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:39.180
Jessica Tate: That happens sometimes. But I'm in my dream. Sometimes I'll go back to their but not really like when I hear

427
00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:53.850
Jessica Tate: Hear stuff but like if I can, if I'm so so tired, just like throughout the day and I can't stand I can fall asleep. But if I don't take these, I will not sleep. I will be setting up

428
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.420
Jessica Tate: I got in to what is it

429
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:05.130
Jessica Tate: It's the they have all the videos on YouTube. The sounds scholar thinks that's where to ship.

430
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:06.690
Jessica Tate: As Mr.

431
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.490
Jessica Tate: Do you heard of it.

432
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:24.300
Jessica Tate: At you you should look it up sometime, but it just it's stuff. It's weird. It sounds and all kinds of stuff just to help you sleep and it relaxes you and all that. So I've gotten that. So that helps a little bit but like just getting to sleep. I can't

433
00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:29.340
Richelle Direny: It's the if you are very anxious person prior to the accident.

434
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.540
Jessica Tate: No, never.

435
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.610
Richelle Direny: Know, now you're very anxious

436
00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:33.960
Jessica Tate: I yeah

437
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.270
Richelle Direny: Yeah, some time and I just got

438
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:46.830
Richelle Direny: It, you have a lot of anxiety from it. So the least little sound and it's the fear because you're talking about for a period of your life, you have no control. You almost died.

439
00:52:47.070 --> 00:53:00.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and you, you know, so it's like that fear of dying. It's that fear that sound that's associated to, you know, the end of life. It's kind of like how your mind computed. So it is a lot of anxiety.

440
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:13.620
Richelle Direny: Now, what is she fixing. I really don't know. Honestly, I know that I wanted to have a meeting with her, just to understand it because, I mean, I don't know.

441
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:19.320
Jessica Tate: When maybe after you have the meeting and I talked to you because that that like

442
00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:19.860
Richelle Direny: I don't know.

443
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:23.460
Jessica Tate: I don't know. I don't know how all react if I remember that because

444
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:30.900
Jessica Tate: I don't, I don't want to remember getting hit by some i don't i don't know why i don't remember that. You know, I wasn't

445
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:42.240
Jessica Tate: At that time I didn't do drugs I smoked weed. Occasionally, and it had been like three months since I had smoke weed side no drugs in my system whatsoever. I didn't start going through

446
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:52.110
Richelle Direny: The fear the anxiety of dying. It's the fear of dying because that's what that's associated with and those noise. It's kind of like if you think about

447
00:53:53.670 --> 00:54:03.000
Richelle Direny: Dream underwater and you can't breathe and you keep jumping off right like as you're about to pass out. It's kind of like this jolting anxiety thing is the best thing I could compare it to

448
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:08.040
Richelle Direny: It really is a lot of it is like this fear of dying and

449
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:22.440
Richelle Direny: I'm not that we all should embrace death, but it's, that's what it really sounds like it's the fear because again the trauma is not comparison on who through a

450
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:38.160
Richelle Direny: Trauma like an abusive per person who is abusing or whatever their, their trauma is, this is one that's a little bit different, you gotten to the bad car wreck. You really truly could have died, you have

451
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:45.780
Richelle Direny: No control. I mean, the reality is, I mean, I'm to a car. I've never gotten hit. I personally am not trying to them things

452
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:48.750
Richelle Direny: About this big thing a steel.

453
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:59.430
Richelle Direny: Coming next to you and it's just or or being sandwiched in between it either got it or stop like you have to go in front of me, or stay behind me.

454
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.340
Jessica Tate: Yeah, the cops told me that

455
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:15.600
Jessica Tate: It was basically trying to get around me and it went in the fast lane and when it pulled over. It just pulled over to soon so like it didn't hit me head on it kind of

456
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:25.080
Jessica Tate: Was like, hey, move the, however, and just slung they enrolled me because when it tried to get back in the regular lane. That's when it hit me. But I like I said, I don't remember that.

457
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:31.290
Jessica Tate: Now I'm afraid I don't want to remember that. I mean, I don't know if it would do better or not, but I don't, I don't know.

458
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.520
Richelle Direny: I mean,

459
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:33.270
Jessica Tate: Do you have a

460
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:44.430
Richelle Direny: Talk to her. I did say because if someone else wanted said. I said, Well, I'm just saying I don't have to talk because i don't i personally don't know about it. So I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I just don't understand it.

461
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:52.470
Richelle Direny: I don't understand it, how it applies to all things are memories.

462
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.500
Richelle Direny: I would say that

463
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.340
Richelle Direny: You know with any trauma.

464
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:08.970
Richelle Direny: I would think that you would have to be at a place that you're ready to work through it. You can't get over it. It's, you have to be at a place to work through it.

465
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:20.190
Richelle Direny: You have to be at a place where you have made that decision to not allow what has happened to you in the past to control you today.

466
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:33.090
Richelle Direny: And to be or an impact, where you it's it's stopping you from moving forward. You understand need, but you have to be in that place with anything, whether you have PTSD or and you have to be at that place.

467
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.040
Jessica Tate: How do you know if you're at that place.

468
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:41.760
Richelle Direny: I mean I think with like with anything, you will know once it's no longer

469
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:53.490
Richelle Direny: You're not having heart palpitations, you're not getting anxiety. The moment you start thinking about it, you're able to breathe free and get through it because in everything. You can never get over something and for someone

470
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:53.580
Jessica Tate: Else.

471
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.430
Jessica Tate: You would think after 11 years I wouldn't still be doing that. That's

472
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.510
Jessica Tate: Crazy like it.

473
00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:03.630
Richelle Direny: Is things we suppress things, not realizing that we do, because we don't like what you just said. You don't want to deal with the emotion.

474
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.470
Richelle Direny: That is associated with it. You don't want to be

475
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.980
Richelle Direny: Are you afraid of dying.

476
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:17.400
Jessica Tate: I actually am so bad, like I i will watch

477
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.610
Jessica Tate: It on YouTube that I have no business watching, but I can't help it. About like death and

478
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.920
Jessica Tate: It freaks me out. It freaks me out, but I was still watch it. I don't know.

479
00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:36.720
Richelle Direny: So that's your fear. It's your it's the idea of dying. It's the idea of leaving behind

480
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:50.220
Richelle Direny: Other others it's that's what that's what your fear is. And maybe that's why just the whole noise and everything associated to the semi it's that this fear, maybe that you've had.

481
00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:00.870
Richelle Direny: It could have been from the past, something that you've experienced from the past and the you getting in the accident woke it up. I don't know, but it's the. It sounds like you're you're very fearful of time.

482
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:02.010
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

483
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.710
Richelle Direny: I mean, the reality is

484
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.190
Richelle Direny: I mean, we are all going to die one day.

485
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.390
Jessica Tate: Yeah, how to go out

486
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.250
Richelle Direny: Right. You have no idea.

487
00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.350
Richelle Direny: Mortality is not

488
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.680
Richelle Direny: An option like we can't live forever. Amen. Right.

489
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.270
Richelle Direny: But then you have to come to terms as to why do you fear dying.

490
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:26.220
Richelle Direny: Because this is how you know that it's this is how

491
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:40.860
Richelle Direny: It becomes diagnosable the fear, the PTSD, anxiety, but how it becomes diagnosable it's as it has had such an impact on your life. It is disrupting different things in your life.

492
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.260
Jessica Tate: I never got to be way till the rap. I didn't

493
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:57.030
Jessica Tate: Like I was never liked that I was never, I never. I mean, I don't know if I was afraid of dying and never thought about it. It never but i i do think about it a lot. I, I think about at least once a day, I think about it.

494
00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.600
Richelle Direny: Well, what about dying is so fearful. It's like

495
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:06.060
Jessica Tate: I think not knowing, like how or when like because I can't control it.

496
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.430
Richelle Direny: And you know, I can control it.

497
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:19.170
Jessica Tate: Well, I know. I mean, well you can I, my best friend did, but I would never do that. But I'm just like my kids like I don't know.

498
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.070
Jessica Tate: Leaving your kids behind you don't want to leave them behind

499
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.260
Richelle Direny: The people that you love.

500
00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:32.310
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, you can't really control it. Yes. There's people who commit suicide if that's what you're talking you're referring to. Yeah, my best friend.

501
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:38.340
Richelle Direny: Some people are successful and some people are not. I remember there was one time we were meeting and you had a neighbor who did

502
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.930
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah. So it's, you know, some people are successful. Some people are not if it's your time, it's your time. If it's not, it's not

503
00:59:46.290 --> 01:00:00.180
Richelle Direny: You know, that's kind of and it sounds like it just rolls off of my tongue. But the reality is we really truly have no control of our end because hey, I might say, hey, I want to die today and the man upstairs says no, it's

504
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:11.430
Jessica Tate: Not try I I tried to do, and I thank God I didn't because I wouldn't be I think God. It didn't work because I wouldn't have her and I wouldn't be where I am. That was just like when I was

505
01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:27.300
Jessica Tate: I was out I was rock bottom with my addiction and I had enough by thank God every day that I didn't. I mean, I would never do that. I guess I was just really low. At that point, and I that was down with me to do, but

506
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:28.740
Jessica Tate: Um,

507
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.340
Richelle Direny: Do you think that you have haven't lived

508
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.030
Richelle Direny: Out your life to its fullest.

509
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:44.850
Jessica Tate: I don't know if it's that or I just spent so long, getting high. And I could be so much further than I am.

510
01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:46.200
Richelle Direny: That's like

511
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:52.950
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you haven't lived your life to the fullest. And now you've been given a new lease on life and I

512
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.390
Richelle Direny: Want to enjoy.

513
01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:00.000
Richelle Direny: I don't want to die. What you mean dying. That's not an option. I want to now live. Yeah.

514
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.740
Richelle Direny: And so this semi

515
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:14.280
Richelle Direny: Injected that fear because now I've gotten to this place. I have a husband. I have a child. I'm living my life I'm doing so well without these drugs.

516
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.800
Richelle Direny: And so now I can really live

517
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.260
Richelle Direny: And I can just enjoy this life.

518
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:25.470
Richelle Direny: And the accident happen. So while you're while now, you're

519
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:39.780
Richelle Direny: Looking at life from a different angle. Outside of drugs, something came along the way to stop you from focusing on what can be and what you can be happy with.

520
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:40.620
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

521
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:56.490
Richelle Direny: And maybe that's what the whole fear with the accident has kind of put in you is this fear that you're petrified of dying because if I die, I won't be able to enjoy what can be. Yeah.

522
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:06.270
Jessica Tate: I think that is it. I think that is it because before that she never crossed my mind. I mean, I know we all are going to die. That's just how it is.

523
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.170
Jessica Tate: You live to die. Basically, but I

524
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.720
Richelle Direny: Was in the process, while I was living

525
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:24.510
Jessica Tate: Yeah, I say that I spent like 10 years getting high and doing nothing. That was dumb I wasted 10 years and life is way too short. Yeah. Wasted 10 years getting

526
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:25.830
Jessica Tate: It for no damn reason

527
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:32.520
Richelle Direny: What would you like to do in the next six months. That is fulfilling to be able to enjoy life.

528
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.420
Um,

529
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.270
Jessica Tate: I don't know, um,

530
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:43.620
Jessica Tate: Well, sleep without drugs and then eventually start

531
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.280
Jessica Tate: Like weaning off this medicine because my, my goal is to sleep without a drug and live without a drought.

532
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.810
Jessica Tate: I don't know, but I'm

533
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.930
Richelle Direny: Not weaning off of them. The medication, not

534
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:06.630
Richelle Direny: Not thinking about as it's drug related. What would you like to do to enjoy life in the next six months.

535
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.090
Jessica Tate: I don't do what I'm doing, raising my baby.

536
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:14.190
Richelle Direny: I mean occasion.

537
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.790
Jessica Tate: How

538
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.950
Richelle Direny: was the last time you went on vacation.

539
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:23.670
Jessica Tate: Oh, never. Wow. When I was a kid when I live with them when I live with my parents. Yeah.

540
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.820
Richelle Direny: So you don't know how to enjoy life.

541
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.910
Jessica Tate: Know my, I mean,

542
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.370
Jessica Tate: For the 10 years I like I said I was getting high like this is

543
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:43.470
Jessica Tate: I guess this was kind of vacation but where I've been clean for two years. It does get kinda. Oh, that would be nice to go

544
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:55.710
Jessica Tate: go on vacation. Well, I guess we did have kind of a little vacation when I went and met Dr. Malik because we stayed in a hotel. And that was kind of cool. But that's, I mean that's that's pretty much it.

545
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:56.850
Jessica Tate: But that's

546
01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:58.710
Jessica Tate: How

547
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:00.330
Richelle Direny: That's a doctor.

548
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.640
Richelle Direny: Yeah, became and so

549
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:12.480
Richelle Direny: So maybe when we meet again will speak specifically about that. And I want you to the next time we meet, I want you to really think about

550
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.770
Richelle Direny: What is it something that you would like to enjoy with your family, even with your daughter. Like here we have Disney we have like Disney World.

551
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:28.920
Richelle Direny: I would take my kids to Disney. Now it's ridiculously expensive dangle no doc on this.

552
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:36.060
Richelle Direny: Let's say we go to Disney, you have the princesses, you have this you have that you have the rides. You're living it up.

553
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:53.940
Richelle Direny: I think until you experience that and you get a taste of what life can be I think it will shift your focus on enjoying life then to focus on not enjoying life because right now. You have nothing to preoccupy your mind.

554
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.330
Richelle Direny: Because you're kind of a part of the mundane, you're just doing

555
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:07.860
Richelle Direny: Hey, I get up every day. I take care of my daughter. I do my duties. If I gotta go somewhere. I go, my the highlight of my life is if I drive an hour down the road to go see a doctor. That's the highlight

556
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:12.900
Jessica Tate: Yeah. Yeah, basically. That is the truth that's 100% true

557
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:18.540
Richelle Direny: So I think, between now and the next time we meet, let's talk about

558
01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.010
Richelle Direny: What are some things that you would like to do

559
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:29.220
Richelle Direny: weaning off the Suboxone it's a goal, but it said

560
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.020
Like it's yes

561
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.890
Jessica Tate: That's my ultimate goal like

562
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:35.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

563
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.070
Richelle Direny: That's why I'm at right now because

564
01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:39.480
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

565
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.460
Richelle Direny: Um,

566
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:52.890
Richelle Direny: The other thing about like sleeping is identifying. Is there anything medical going on that's that's that's disrupting your sleep. You have to be able to identify that could be something going on your

567
01:05:53.250 --> 01:06:04.470
Richelle Direny: Gift and met you have to rule out anything medical that could be causing that not popping another pill. Now granted, if you need a medication. Hey, but it's identify. Is there anything underlining medically going on.

568
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:10.830
Richelle Direny: Now once you read those things out. I think there is there something inside of you.

569
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:19.320
Richelle Direny: That wants to go experience. Think about when you sit there and watch TV, and you see all these wonderful things on the TV and you're like, man. That would be nice. I would love to do that.

570
01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:30.810
Richelle Direny: I think once we come up with an idea. What is it that you would like to do try to attain at least one of those things come back and let's talk about how it makes you feel

571
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:45.990
Richelle Direny: And then we move from there, because then it would decrease your anxiety around dying because you you look at for the last 10 years of my life. This is what I was doing. Now, I've been given a new lease. But what is there to do

572
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.670
Richelle Direny: Excitement was when I was hot because I was doing things

573
01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.020
Richelle Direny: I was excited

574
01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.440
Richelle Direny: Right now I'm not high life is pretty boring.

575
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.750
Jessica Tate: It is is very boring.

576
01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:17.910
Richelle Direny: It's very so we, but we have to find a way to not make it boring and there are plenty of ways. The thing is, you have never really truly experience what life can be with out any kind of additives. Yeah, and that's what it is. You just don't know what life is without a

577
01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:25.740
Richelle Direny: You have a little girl. There is so much she dressed up like a princess. I don't know if they have Chucky Cheese. There are the little things there and go

578
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.440
Jessica Tate: We have Family Dollar and Dollar General

579
01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:32.280
Richelle Direny: Will try to cheese's the little place with the guy that

580
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:33.000
Jessica Tate: Yeah, we

581
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.030
Jessica Tate: We have Chucky Cheese. But it's a two hour drive

582
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:42.270
Jessica Tate: Either north or south, but like in our actual town we have Family Dollar, Dollar General so we go

583
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:43.860
Jessica Tate: Oh, and that

584
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.890
Jessica Tate: And that's moving on. That is having that stuff.

585
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:59.820
Jessica Tate: So yeah, so if we were to, I would love to take her there actually because I I had one of my birthdays there. But yeah, it'd be I'm pretty sure there's one in Columbus, and that's about two hours away from here.

586
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.950
Richelle Direny: And even if you decided to one day plan a trip.

587
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:06.360
Richelle Direny: To Chuck

588
01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.440
Richelle Direny: Experience that she will

589
01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.100
Richelle Direny: Have enjoying that as a mom.

590
01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:16.200
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

591
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:34.470
Richelle Direny: You're seeing that I think will make your wheels start turning to say, Man, I really need to find other things that we can't do it. That's how you take out a new lease. That's how you start wanting to now enjoy life more you do that the less you think about dying. Yeah.

592
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.870
Richelle Direny: Dying is going to come, we have no control over it.

593
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:42.900
Richelle Direny: There and ponder on the fear of time. Yeah.

594
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:44.730
Jessica Tate: And I do and I do need to stop that.

595
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:52.020
Richelle Direny: But you can't stop it things either don't just stop because something very real happened to you that created this emotion.

596
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:52.980
Jessica Tate: You got into an

597
01:08:53.250 --> 01:09:02.880
Richelle Direny: Accident so it's not we're not going to get over it. We're going to work through it. We're going to understand the emotion and why understanding the emotion, you're going to work through it.

598
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:17.070
Richelle Direny: We're understanding that fear of dying is what's your real cost right now. It could be something else. But right now we're going to identify the fear of dying. So how do we get through it. How about I learned how to live and not worry about dying.

599
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:23.370
Richelle Direny: Because the more I learned how to live the less I think about dying because that dying is gonna come

600
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.500
Richelle Direny: Pitchfork guys going to whatever the picture that

601
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:42.120
Richelle Direny: That right, one day when it comes, we don't know, but instead of me worrying about that. I'm going to now think about how I can live. And that's what we'll do throughout our next thing or next

602
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.780
Jessica Tate: Alright, well, we'll end our thing.

603
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:47.760
Richelle Direny: I'll let me find out before

604
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.170

Richelle Direny: Okay.

606
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.290
Jessica Tate: I really like I said scholars very against it.

607
01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.730
Jessica Tate: And I just want to know more about it because I make the final decision on that.

608
01:09:58.170 --> 01:09:58.560

Hannah Gunter: go that direction, sometimes

772
01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:05.670

773
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:09.420
Hannah Gunter: Focus on and that's

774
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:11.490

782
01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:58.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah and outside of wanting to do it no matter how much you want to do something, you still have to get like a first dose of motivation every day, especially if you're frustrated with something

783

Hannah Gunter: Right, and that's what I'm saying. You know, I wanted you know those are my goals and I will achieve them. It's just putting a timeline on it.

784
01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:11.790
Richelle Direny: Okay. When did you start your GED program.

785
01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:19.470
Hannah Gunter: Um, I've been studying for my classes, probably, or maybe a couple months now.

786
01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:25.590
Richelle Direny: Okay, so it seems like even though you're saying that you don't have motivation or your

787
01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:26.700
Hannah Gunter: Oh no, I

788
01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:32.850
Hannah Gunter: I mean I have motivation. It's just some days it's harder for me to, you know,

789
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.610
Hannah Gunter: motivate myself.

790
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.410
Richelle Direny: To stay motivated

791
01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:38.310
Right.

792
01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.810
Hannah Gunter: And that's what bring and then, you know, Brandon helps me with that.

793
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, sometimes when you look at those GD books and everything that you have to review that will make anybody get unmotivated.

794
01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:57.390
Hannah Gunter: I just depends on you know I guess my mood.

795
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.660
Hannah Gunter: I'm I'm trying to, you know,

796
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.500
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And also depends a whole lot on

797
01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:15.810
Richelle Direny: Your medication because sometimes some medication, depending on how it makes you feel at certain times of the day.

798
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:25.590
Richelle Direny: You know, it's not meant to lose motivation, but maybe could it be that like you get tired and you lose focus. You can't stay focus

799
01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:26.250
Right.

800
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:34.830
Hannah Gunter: Right, and that's what was happening. You know the last time we met, like I said, Dr. Jamison kept my dosage like

801
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.280
Hannah Gunter: A lot. And she did it really fast.

802
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:46.530
Hannah Gunter: I mean, personally, I just feel she kind of has a grudge against me and for what reason I have no idea.

803
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.760
Hannah Gunter: And that really sucks because it makes me, you know,

804
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.160
Hannah Gunter: Question, you know,

805
01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.770
Hannah Gunter: Everything about my treatment.

806
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.530
Hannah Gunter: I don't like feeling that way you know she won't even schedule a one on one with me.

807
01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:07.950
Richelle Direny: In what way when you say

808
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.630
Richelle Direny: You feel you're saying you feel it's personal.

809
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.340
Hannah Gunter: I do. Yes, most definitely.

810
01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:37.170
Hannah Gunter: I mean I you know I do everything I'm supposed to do. I've passed every single one of my drug test for the whole year and a half. I've been with you guys, you know, and honestly, she's just a bitch to me.

811
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:42.240
Richelle Direny: Well, what I mean have you been going to your groups weekly

812
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:49.980
Hannah Gunter: Yes, yes I have. I go to group every Tuesday at 1030

813
01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.900
Hannah Gunter: And you know she's supposed to be my doctor. She's not supposed to make me feel like she's against me.

814
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.930
Richelle Direny: Have you and that alone is hard.

815
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.960
Richelle Direny: I have you spoken to her about

816
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:27.750
Hannah Gunter: No, she won't speak with me. She will not speak with me. The only thing that women says to me is when we're in group when she goes around after you know she's talking to everyone else she tells me you need a refill.

817
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:33.000
Hannah Gunter: That's the only thing she says to me, that's it.

818
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.200
Hannah Gunter: What would you what so but and I tried to schedule a

819
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:45.480
Hannah Gunter: ONE ON ONE WITH work. Hold on, I tried to schedule a one on one with her. And when I was trying to scam. Oh.

820
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.200
Hannah Gunter: You're breaking up on told that she has no longer

821
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.300
Hannah Gunter: Going to keep our do a one on

822
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:56.820
Richelle Direny: Me.

823
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:58.260
Richelle Direny: You're breaking up.

824
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.760
Hannah Gunter: So going to hurt.

825
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.410
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

826
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:11.640
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, I can hear you.

827
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:14.850
Richelle Direny: Oh, yeah. So you were breaking up, you were working on

828
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:16.590
Hannah Gunter: Okay. Can you hear me now.

829
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.980
Hannah Gunter: Yeah okay that that is very discouraging, you know, having your doctor.

830
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:27.180
Hannah Gunter: Not even want to meet with you.

831
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:31.080
Hannah Gunter: You know, it's just

832
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:35.010
Hannah Gunter: It's wrong.

833
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.210
Hannah Gunter: I have not ever done anything to that woman, for her to treat me the way she does.

834
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:44.850
Richelle Direny: OK. One moment.

835
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:55.230
Hannah Gunter: And of course that would set you know anyone back

836
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:02.070
Hannah Gunter: She's a very judgmental person.

837
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:09.630
Richelle Direny: Well, again, it comes down to, you know, what are your expectations on here it is.

838
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:13.080
Hannah Gunter: Magic that patients are to have a doctor.

839
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:20.460
Hannah Gunter: Who does care about myself and more than just giving me medication.

840
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, well let me look at

841
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.260
Richelle Direny: The calendar, because I know that

842
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:42.540
Richelle Direny: You know, one of the things I know for me, because we have to communicate in terms of your

843
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.500
Richelle Direny: Okay, look, I see that you had an appointment.

844
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:50.160
Richelle Direny: You have an appointment with her. You've had

845
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:55.650
Richelle Direny: Just said, Yes, I have. But every time that I couldn't make it.

846
01:31:56.730 --> 01:32:08.100
Hannah Gunter: I called into the clinic and told them I couldn't make it. And I've only had that I recall up to a point to one on one appointments with her within months.

847
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:11.610
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, I heard

848
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.350
Hannah Gunter: It isn't my fault.

849
01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:21.180
Richelle Direny: But her calendar room and I'm just listen, I'm just looking at the calendar and

850
01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:30.510
Hannah Gunter: I understand that, but like I said people in the admissions and then the virtual clinic. They have no idea what they're doing, like,

851
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:35.730
Hannah Gunter: I don't know, it's just it frustrates me

852
01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:42.480
Richelle Direny: And then when you also cancel it. Did you call to cancel it that day.

853
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:46.200
Hannah Gunter: I do believe it was a day or two before

854
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:52.350
Richelle Direny: You know you have three you have three no shows in one missed appointment last

855
01:32:52.380 --> 01:33:00.510
Hannah Gunter: Year, and honestly, Rochelle. I'll be honest with you. The reason I didn't show is because I feel the way I do with about her.

856
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:02.970
Hannah Gunter: But that's true because in a row.

857
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:04.710
Richelle Direny: You had one on the

858
01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:11.040
Hannah Gunter: Right. And I skipped I reason I called in and cancelled my appointment every time.

859
01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:21.420
Richelle Direny: Okay, but then to cancel. Okay. Now, if you're saying that and and understand this for just a moment.

860
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.570
Richelle Direny: You are the physician.

861
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.440
Richelle Direny: And I am the patient and

862
01:33:28.530 --> 01:33:30.570
Richelle Direny: We never played hard. Uh huh.

863
01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:31.980
Hannah Gunter: I would never

864
01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.420
Richelle Direny: Know, okay, I'm

865
01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:41.130
Richelle Direny: Here what I'm saying. Because remember how you feel about something is how you feel about any could be a person

866
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:49.980
Hannah Gunter: It could be many wrong and I get that, Rochelle. But I never felt that way until she made me feel that way and I, then you better align your feeling

867
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:57.870
Richelle Direny: A certain way. Here it is. You're saying that you're feeling a certain way and then three weeks each week, back to back.

868
01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:01.740
Richelle Direny: You are there, you call to cancel the appointment.

869
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.970
Richelle Direny: And you're saying it's not your fault, whatever. But then you just said.

870
01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:06.750
Hannah Gunter: Whoa, I

871
01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:08.820
Richelle Direny: Was of how she makes you feel

872
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.350
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean,

873
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:14.190
Hannah Gunter: You want to see a doctor who made you feel that way. Well,

874
01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:19.170
Richelle Direny: Listen what I'm saying to you, Anna. If a person is making you feel a certain way.

875
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:32.610
Richelle Direny: It's coming a meeting with them and saying, Hey, I have to have a conversation with you because every time whether I mean group or whatever the situation is, this is we need to address this got the communication.

876
01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:45.270
Richelle Direny: Because then if you don't, then I'm just left to it as you just keep not showing up to the appointment. I can't, I'm not a mind reader. I don't know how you feel, until we have this conversation.

877
01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:56.340
Richelle Direny: Once we have this conversation. And now you're continuing to meet you continue feeling this way, then at that point. It's not making that informed decision to say hey you know what

878
01:34:56.610 --> 01:35:09.000
Richelle Direny: I want to see. It's kind of like, okay, I'm a therapist, and if I make you feel a certain way and we have this conversation that you say, you know, Rochelle. Every time I meet with you if you come off very judgmental. You're very whatever the feeling is

879
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.600
Hannah Gunter: You do.

880
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.950
Richelle Direny: Not I'm not. I'm giving you an example. And if whatever that feeling is you're identifying those feelings. If you're saying this to me.

881
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:21.960
Richelle Direny: You came and respectfully you, you say, Rochelle. This is how you're making me feel

882
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:34.560
Richelle Direny: And if after we have that conversation. The next session or the next session. You're, you're continuing to feel that way and you feel that I'm not changing the community. The way of communication and

883
01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:40.170
Richelle Direny: Then at that point, you're saying, Okay, I still want to be a part of the program. I just don't want to meet with you anymore. Michelle.

884
01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:51.660
Richelle Direny: You have that choice, but not showing up and then now saying, I feel like you're being mean to me. But then if I don't know that this is how I'm making you feel

885
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:54.870
Richelle Direny: Do you understand, but then I

886
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.820
Hannah Gunter: I do understand

887
01:35:56.850 --> 01:36:05.340
Richelle Direny: That but then move every week. Now then, this is the other piece, you go to group every single week, your medication is filled

888
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.470
Hannah Gunter: Even like

889
01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:15.840
Richelle Direny: Even in the group encounters. If I'm still making you feel a certain way, you still have to make the appointment and at least show up to one of those appointments

890
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:26.010
Hannah Gunter: And have that conversation. I understand that. But why I canceled my appointment is due to how she makes me feel

891
01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:34.620
Richelle Direny: But it's still having the. Okay, here it is that you have your husband, he makes you feel a certain way. Do you think that

892
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:51.210
Richelle Direny: He may not have no he may have no clue that maybe the way he talks to you. Or maybe he just he has no clue how your he's making you feel. Do you think he deserves the right for you to come and have that conversation with him so he can, whether it's you or him what

893
01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:54.240
Hannah Gunter: Does he know he. I mean, that's a relevant

894
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.300
Hannah Gunter: To what we're talking about my marriage is irrelevant to

895
01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:57.630
Richelle Direny: That

896
01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:02.580
Hannah Gunter: But he knows exactly how I'm feeling because he knows me, he's not a judgmental person.

897
01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.060
Hannah Gunter: Okay.

898
01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:07.080
Hannah Gunter: My judgment on me before he knows who I am.

899
01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.990
Richelle Direny: And I'm okay. Before your what I'm saying.

900
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.570
Hannah Gunter: I gave you an example here. You hear me.

901
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.070
Please.

902
01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:18.990
Richelle Direny: I am hearing you. And I'm helping you to process it.

903
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.900
Hannah Gunter: And that's why I was processed it plenty

904
01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:34.830
Richelle Direny: Again, not showing up to your appointments and then saying it's because of how you're feeling and the person is not in, you're not having it's if it's your doctor you have

905
01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.960
Richelle Direny: To have a conversation with your doctor.

906
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:42.030
Hannah Gunter: I don't feel comfortable enough to have that conversation is what I'm trying to tell you

907
01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:46.200
Richelle Direny: But I ok but then you you attend the group every week.

908
01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.490
Hannah Gunter: Yes, I do. And I don't like putting my business out there in front of everyone.

909
01:37:50.940 --> 01:38:04.530
Richelle Direny: But you in that group. You can send a message and say, Dr. Jamison, I really have a lot of strong emotions to work and I want to have a conversation with you. Is that possible, but then not showing up to that conversation.

910
01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:23.850
Hannah Gunter: And I understand that, Rochelle. But I've rescheduled. Well, I'm not even rescheduled I canceled my appointment. Every time the last three times and now it's she will not schedule a one on one with me. She doesn't want to speak to me. I mean, how would that make anyone feel

911
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.850
Richelle Direny: Did she tell you that she's not what she does not want to speak.

912
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.280
Hannah Gunter: That, yes, that's what people that receptionist in admissions told me

913
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:34.890
Richelle Direny: I mean, I don't know what

914
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:36.060
Hannah Gunter: I'm not a lawyer.

915
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:39.750
Richelle Direny: I'm I again, as I said,

916
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.900
Richelle Direny: It all comes I I can't speak.

917
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:48.330
Richelle Direny: For Jason I can't speak for Dr. Jamison, but what I am saying you

918
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.760
Hannah Gunter: Know you can't speak for me.

919
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:58.980
Richelle Direny: I'm not speaking for you, Anna. But right now, you're getting defensive right now you're getting defensive and I'm just helping you to be for a

920
01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.760
Hannah Gunter: Hug I

921
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:02.100
Hannah Gunter: Because I feel

01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:05.790
Hannah Gunter: That every I just

923
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.330
Hannah Gunter: I feel like it doesn't matter how I feel.

924
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:16.080
Hannah Gunter: She has put judgment on me from day one.

925
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:24.480
Hannah Gunter: And no one time did I ever deserve it. No wonder I would cancel my appointments

926
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:28.170
Hannah Gunter: And I think I'm done with this appointment today.

927
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.930
Hannah Gunter: I would like to just pick it up another time.

928
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.400
Hannah Gunter: That's why I reschedule and cancel my appointments

929
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.590
Richelle Direny: But then if I

930
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.010
Hannah Gunter: Just

931
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:53.250
Hannah Gunter: I just like I said no one time. Have I failed a drug test nor Mr growth in the past year.

932
01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:00.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, but you don't miss the groups and you don't feel your drug test. But Anna again.

933
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:08.610
Richelle Direny: Just for a moment just stopping because I know you're getting really emotional but just for a moment. Let's

934
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:10.770
Hannah Gunter: Get really pissed off. Oh.

935
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:29.190
Richelle Direny: Again, as I said, it's having the conversation with the person. It's not just not showing up. But it's having that conversation because then you're left with these emotions that are unresolved because you don't want to meet with the person

936
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.910
Hannah Gunter: You understand what where I'm coming from.

937
01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:40.470
Richelle Direny: I understand where you're coming from. But, I'm, I'm asking you if you hear what I'm recommending

938
01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.040
Hannah Gunter: I hear

939
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:42.960
Hannah Gunter: You. Yes, I hear you.

940
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.350
Richelle Direny: CAN'T. WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD. If you

941
01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.150
Hannah Gunter: Tell her that

942
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:53.130
Richelle Direny: Not when I can't speak for you. I can't speak for you. It has

943
01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:54.270
Hannah Gunter: I don't want you to

944
01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:57.360
Hannah Gunter: So that is not yet American for

945
01:40:58.230 --> 01:41:08.580
Hannah Gunter: Pardon. That's not what I'm asking him for I'm just, I don't know, I feel like you're missing my whole point, and I don't want to get off on a bad note with you.

946
01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:23.430
Richelle Direny: I mean, it's not. I mean, again, it comes down to an emotion and how you're feeling about something, but it cannot be resolved and you're not going to be in a better place if that conversation is not had

947
01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:27.000
Richelle Direny: If you don't have the conversation.

948
01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:27.600
Hannah Gunter: I'm

949
01:41:27.690 --> 01:41:30.600
Hannah Gunter: Trying to have a conversation with you not getting nowhere.

950
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:33.750
Hannah Gunter: rest my case.

951
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:41.550
Richelle Direny: I mean, I don't know, again, it comes down to what are you wanting me to get that I'm not getting because I hear you.

952
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:43.500
Hannah Gunter: I hear everything you're saying is

953
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:44.640
Richelle Direny: Back to you.

954
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:52.710
Hannah Gunter: It don't matter. I just, I, I would like to schedule another appointment with you. I think I'm done for today.

955
01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.940
Richelle Direny: I mean, if you want to end it, you can and

956
01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:06.990
Hannah Gunter: I i mean i just like I said I would. I'm just, I'm aggravated and I you know I don't want to say something. I'm going to regret. So, yeah.

957
01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, when you're ready to

958
01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:13.350
Richelle Direny: Get another appointment.

959
01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.570
Hannah Gunter: We can go ahead and schedule right now.

960
01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.840
Hannah Gunter: A bad person.

961
01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:51.990
Hannah Gunter: can hit that cigarette, please.

962
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:20.910
Richelle Direny: My next appointment is on the 18th and

963
01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:27.270
Hannah Gunter: When

964
01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.090
Hannah Gunter: Do you have any evening time available.

965
01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:47.940
Richelle Direny: Thursday evening 6pm

966
01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.610
Hannah Gunter: Oh, I didn't hear you say that. I apologize.

967
01:43:53.730 --> 01:43:54.930
Hannah Gunter: Did you say six

968
01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.310
Hannah Gunter: Yeah 661 my phone. Mr. Cut out. I did not hear you.

969
01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.910
Hannah Gunter: Okay, great. I'll see you then.

970
01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:04.230
Okay.

971
01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:17.820
Richelle Direny: Hi, how are you

972
01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.190
Jen: Good. Sorry, I just kind of fix my hair.

973
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.800
Richelle Direny: No, you're fine.

974
01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:27.300
Jen: With a backup. It was a little, little low.

975
01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.290
Richelle Direny: You're off today.

976
01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:33.090
Yes.

977
01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.340
Richelle Direny: So how was it

978
01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:36.480
Jen: How am I

979
01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:53.970
Jen: It is, it is very strenuous for that working in six months and having my back problems, but I've been taking my medication.

980
01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.500
Jen: And it's actually not too, too bad.

981
01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:13.110
Jen: I mean, I'm on my feet for 10 hours, but it's not in a constant one place you walk around, you know, on a little five foot area. And then if you need to get boxes or whatever you walk down the hall.

982
01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:18.180
Jen: But it goes by pretty quick. And I just think of it as

983
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.800
Jen: They're paying me to work out because it's hot in there and I sweat. You know, so I'm working out.

984
01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.860
Richelle Direny: That's a good way to put a spin on it.

985
01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.210
Jen: Right, right.

986
01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.660
Jen: Because I need to lose a little weight I gained

987
01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.370
Jen: But

988
01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.350
Jen: Yeah. Other than that, I mean, I like it. I do.

989
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:49.680
Richelle Direny: You do. So, um, how was it like the commute to and from work. I mean, I know you have to take the bus. You said right

990
01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:59.940
Jen: On the way there. It's about an hour and 15 minutes, which I don't mind but on the way back. It's two hours and

991
01:46:01.050 --> 01:46:13.080
Jen: What actually one of the, one of my co workers. We were just talking and she's all happened to, you know, we still happen to talk about, Oh my gosh, you know, I don't get home, till 830 from work and

992
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:31.680
Jen: You know I gotta eat go to bed and get up at four in the morning and do it all over again. She's like, Well, where do you live, I'm like, you know, West Side, blah, blah. She's like, I'll give you a ride. I'm right by you. So she's literally off a 71 two exits away.

993
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:38.730
Jen: So she is getting me and taking me home from work.

994
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:41.100
Richelle Direny: I'm

995
01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:49.080
Jen: So that's really nice. And I'm but I'm giving our gas money and she's like, I don't want your gas money. I'm like, take the gas money, you know,

996
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:50.910
Jen: Though

997
01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:53.670
Richelle Direny: It's all working out like coming together.

998
01:46:53.970 --> 01:47:10.500
Jen: Yeah. And then probably within a couple weeks I'll be able to put a down payment on a car or buy a car out right so because I got you know the stimulus Chuck money and I had a little money saved up so

999
01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.070
Richelle Direny: You're gonna be able to go in and get

1000
01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:22.950
Richelle Direny: I know I know one of your goals was to like within the next six months, you're going to try to start saving up once you get your stimulus money you're gonna put some money aside and

1001
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:27.600
Jen: Right, right. It's going a little quicker than expected.

1002
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:38.700
Richelle Direny: That's good, that's good. I mean, I don't know that rumor has it, which I don't know how true the rumor is because I personally didn't hear it about

1003
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:42.720
Richelle Direny: Maybe there might be another stimulus. I don't know.

1004
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:52.380
Jen: See, I heard something about that too about us getting that every month or like a monthly check in. So, this thing's over

1005
01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:54.360
Richelle Direny: I don't know. That would be nice but

1006
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:55.620
Jen: That would be

1007
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:57.090
Great.

1008
01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:13.230
Jen: You know, because I'm not getting food stamps like this past three, four months. I haven't been getting food stamps now working because they have a hold of, like, a block on my food stamps, because

1009
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:26.580
Jen: They wanted me to go down town to St. To some office office superior or something to go like do work or whatever. And I said, well, I take care of my mom.

1010
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:47.730
Jen: You know she had breast cancer. This that the other. And it's I've never had a problem but whoever I had on the phone to renew the food stamps every six months or a year didn't want to do it that way. So, you know, I wasn't doing too well before this job.

1011
01:48:49.680 --> 01:49:02.580
Jen: And everybody's like, we should be getting food stamps. I'm like, no, they have a block. I tried to go down there to talk to somebody and there's nobody there to talk to. So, um, but yeah.

1012
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:05.130
Jen: I could buy food down

1013
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.140
Jen: With my job.

1014
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:19.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's good. I mean, something will work out. I don't know. I mean everyone kind of has a different you know story in terms of, you know, their journey with this whole

1015
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.000
Richelle Direny: Situation, but hopefully

1016
01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.030
Richelle Direny: I mean, it would be nice. It really

1017
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:28.110
Jen: Would

1018
01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.870
Richelle Direny: It would help. I'm not even monthly but another one.

1019
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:32.430
Richelle Direny: Right, right.

1020
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:33.840
Richelle Direny: Question is do I have to pay it back.

1021
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.520
Oh, are you going to go

1022
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:55.800
Jen: Right, they said, we didn't have to pay this one back. But I don't know. Yeah, that's one thing I have to do I have to check on because I did all my paperwork, you know, on my phone for for Amazon and I did my W tues or fours, whatever they are.

1023
01:49:56.190 --> 01:49:59.310
Jen: And usually I claim myself I claim one

1024
01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:11.550
Jen: So I get more money back now than at the end of the year, and I really don't know how to do that. But I claimed single so I don't know if that's zero.

1025
01:50:13.230 --> 01:50:15.600
Richelle Direny: I think it's one. I think it's one when you

1026
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:24.840
Richelle Direny: Think you could either claim zero or you clean yourself something like that, you know, honestly, I'm not even gonna lie to you. I will never I don't ever know how to fill out those things I always have

1027
01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.960
Jen: I've always had help with it because

1028
01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:42.180
Jen: I don't know how to do it. And then I had to do it on my phone by myself because they had a single and then they had a couple of more other ones and then they had head of households and I'm like, should I put head of household to

1029
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:45.600
Richelle Direny: You both had a house household, because it's just you alone right

1030
01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:50.880
Jen: Yeah, but what would be zero, then you know what I'm saying.

1031
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:58.350
Richelle Direny: I believe so. My understanding, the more than number, the less they take out of your taxes.

1032
01:50:58.920 --> 01:50:59.580
Jen: So I think

1033
01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:02.400
Richelle Direny: If you, the more they take out

1034
01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:14.100
Richelle Direny: The chances of you own them in the end of the year is slim and then I think when it's all said and done, they take out more. What if they took out too much, then that's what they reimburse you

1035
01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:31.680
Jen: Right. I've always claimed one I've always claimed myself and I got in more money or less money taken out, but I've never had to pay me back. I just rather have more money now that at the end of the year for tax season and get more money for taxes do you

1036
01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:34.830
Richelle Direny: Know that means you have less money now.

1037
01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:40.800
Jen: And more drawn. Yeah, no, I want more money now and last at taxes.

1038
01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:47.460
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, and it can be understandable because I understand that sometimes

1039
01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.150
Richelle Direny: I mean, we need to live today. I can't worry about next year.

1040
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:52.440
Jen: Right, right.

1041
01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.490
Richelle Direny: I knew LIVE TONIGHT.

1042
01:51:54.150 --> 01:51:55.770
Richelle Direny: And I want to today.

1043
01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:56.730
Y'all

1044
01:51:58.230 --> 01:51:59.490
Jen: Yeah, um,

1045
01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:02.940
Jen: Oh, and then I got a new couch yesterday.

1046
01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:17.040
Jen: That's me. Oh, yeah. So, yesterday was my first day off. And it's weird because usually I'm just so lazy in this that and the other. Well, I was up at 10 in the morning because

1047
01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:27.810
Jen: I moved into this house, a while ago and it has a walk in closet. But there's no like rods to hang the close

1048
01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.920
Richelle Direny: Date. So what is it like beer wall. Yeah.

1049
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:40.110
Jen: It's bare as a big huge room but bare walls. So I told my landlord. I'm like, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're getting quite a bit of money.

1050
01:52:40.590 --> 01:52:54.930
Jen: You know over $700 place. I want a closet. So yeah, the, um, the maintenance guy came over at 11 o'clock, put in my rods in my everything else.

1051
01:52:55.410 --> 01:53:05.490
Jen: So now I have a closet. I can hang my clothes because my clothes have been laying everywhere in here. And then I got a new couch. So, yesterday was a good day.

1052
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:23.010
Jen: There's no way I was ready to go. And I'm doing things. I'm like, wow, it's my day off. I just spent four days straight 10 hour days on my feet and haven't worked in six months in here. I'm still raring to go. You know,

1053
01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:29.130
Jen: So what today. I'm a little lazy.

1054
01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:32.190
Richelle Direny: Tomorrow,

1055
01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:39.600
Jen: No, I have Sunday Mondays and Tuesdays off and then I work Wednesday through

1056
01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:42.330
Richelle Direny: Four days, four days on three days off.

1057
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:43.200
Jen: Uh huh.

1058
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.960
Richelle Direny: Well, you get your 40 hours in four days.

1059
01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.160
Yes.

1060
01:53:48.210 --> 01:53:49.950
Richelle Direny: Because there are 12 hour shifts, right.

1061
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.590
Richelle Direny: 10 hour. Okay. Oh.

1062
01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:54.990
Jen: I could have done the

1063
01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:57.090
Jen: But

1064
01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:01.230
Jen: I didn't know how my back was gonna feel with that so

1065
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.240
Richelle Direny: I mean 312 is nice because then you're all four days.

1066
01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.830
Jen: Right, right.

1067
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:09.870
Jen: But I know

1068
01:54:10.230 --> 01:54:14.580
Richelle Direny: Changing shift like like whatever shift you have is you're stuck with it or

1069
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:31.920
Jen: Um, I think we're stuck with it for 30 days and after that we can change what we can ask to see if we can change, but I don't know what hours, it is, you know, I don't know if it's third shift or I don't know how it goes. So

1070
01:54:34.110 --> 01:54:38.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, so then it would be nice. Then to

1071
01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:42.120
Richelle Direny: Continue with the shift.

1072
01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:43.050
Richelle Direny: Does your

1073
01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:57.600
Richelle Direny: Um, you see how it's what it's all about. And then, you know, your body is now it's your reactivating have to just going out and you know whatever strain on you know associated with the job.

1074
01:54:58.170 --> 01:54:58.860
Jen: And right if you

1075
01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.800
Richelle Direny: Go, you know what, maybe it's better to do an extra two hours for three days.

1076
01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:05.880
Jen: Right, and then

1077
01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:08.700
Richelle Direny: You're letting your body recoup for four days.

1078
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:09.510
Jen: Right.

1079
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:12.270
Jen: And then I can get stuff done around here.

1080
01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:30.090
Jen: You know, do my doctor appointments do what I gotta do, but I'm going to do this until at least I get a car, you know, because I don't know, like I said, I don't know how the 312 are with the hours.

1081
01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:43.200
Jen: I had number I said I have somebody picking me up and take me home now. You know, so that cuts out, you know, a good almost four hours a day, you know, commuting

1082
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.630
Richelle Direny: Yeah of course worse.

1083
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So what are you going to do

1084
01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:59.850
Richelle Direny: I shouldn't say what are you going to do. I mean, I think overall, it seems like you have a pretty good thing going. I have a question. So with Amazon, you're in the warehouse. Right.

1085
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:03.690
Richelle Direny: Yes, so you're packing the boxes or

1086
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:12.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So what I'm so like to become a driver. That's why you have to apply specifically for that.

1087
01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:26.220
Jen: Yes, I think you you do because a wall acquaintance of mine is a driver and he only works part time but I think that's a whole different

1088
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:38.430
Jen: You know section or will it might even be in a different city because I know there's one in where I'm in in Cleveland, Ohio. There's one in warrens Ville, Ohio.

1089
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:44.790
Jen: There's, there's quite a few, but there's, you know, spread out quite a bit.

1090
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:47.280
Richelle Direny: You know, you mean

1091
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:50.160
Richelle Direny: So there are different locations that does the driving

1092
01:56:50.850 --> 01:56:51.330
Jen: Right.

1093
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:57.240
Richelle Direny: I mean, does the different things like there's one that packs and distributes and then the truck comes and picks up everything.

1094
01:56:57.750 --> 01:57:11.640
Jen: Yeah yeah and i mean i don't know how everything works yet, you know. All I know is my area is we packed. But then again, there's other areas. I mean, it's a huge warehouse, it's three floors.

1095
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:29.220
Jen: Um, I mean, it's huge. It's huge. So there's so many different things going on there that I'm just a little teeny tiny person, you know, in one area, you know, compared to this big, huge you know hat.

1096
01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.110
Jen: Warehouse.

1097
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:36.030
Richelle Direny: No, that's good. I mean, listen when it's all said and done,

1098
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:43.470
Richelle Direny: You as a teeny tiny person or as the ends on a cake gets a still get a bite of the cake right

1099
01:57:43.800 --> 01:58:03.900
Jen: That's right. Hey, we're, we're, like, one of the most important people because we packed those boxes and how we packed them you know we like put that bubble wrapping, you know, so the stuff don't break you know if the stuff breaks. It's our fault. Pretty much, because we didn't pack it correctly.

1100
01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:20.100
Jen: You know, or we did it. We could have put in scanned a different box when it was supposed to be this box. But we scan this barcode instead. So we're might be little bow are very important and

1101
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.250
Richelle Direny: Everyone on the bottom of the totem pole makes everything go

1102
01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:27.360
Jen: Because if you if

1103
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:33.870
Richelle Direny: You if you're not there. The oil is it like everything is a part of the oil rig, you know,

1104
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.500
Jen: Oh, yeah.

1105
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:40.230
Richelle Direny: Kind of like the Andy Oh you the answer is not insignificant because he's a part of the food chain.

1106
01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:41.520
Richelle Direny: Because

1107
01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:43.920
Jen: The food chain. Right.

1108
01:58:45.270 --> 01:59:03.060
Richelle Direny: It's very, it's very important, but that's that's that's good that you're able to get something and you know you're part of, you know, the part of the population that now is getting work because there's still people who still waiting on unemployment, there's still people who is struggling

1109
01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:11.700
Richelle Direny: You know me. So, or has a family to support and you know has to go out there to get any little thing.

1110
01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:14.700
Richelle Direny: Julia supporting that family so

1111
01:59:16.050 --> 01:59:23.100
Richelle Direny: That's definitely good that you're able to do that. Um, did you ever look into the chiropractor.

1112
01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.530
Jen: No, I

1113
01:59:27.690 --> 01:59:51.900
Jen: talked to my doctor my my doctor and she put me on what was it Cymbalta for my back pain to with my, you know, and I really liked it and helps my back out with the pain a lot, but I don't know if it was interacting with the Suboxone

1114
01:59:52.950 --> 02:00:02.100
Jen: But it was making me really jittery, um, it felt like. I'm like, I was up all day. I couldn't sleep.

1115
02:00:03.150 --> 02:00:07.410
Jen: So I only took it for about five days because

1116
02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:17.580
Jen: I mean I it was funny because my uncle picked me up and I'm just talking, talking, talking, talking, and I felt like I was on drugs like on speed or something.

1117
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:20.520
Jen: Made me like all

1118
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:36.270
Jen: Hyper hyper and stuff, but it was hell of a good thing on my back. So I meet with her and I want to see if maybe she could, you know, half the dosage because she only gave me like 10 milligrams to start

1119
02:00:36.930 --> 02:00:39.840
Jen: Um, a room, but it was crazy.

1120
02:00:40.050 --> 02:00:42.360
Richelle Direny: She knows you're on Suboxone

1121
02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:53.880
Jen: Yeah, I told her I told her, I'm because I usually the thing was I was taking effect, sir, a long time ago and I liked how that worked with me.

1122
02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:12.210
Jen: Through my different doctor and then she put me on select saw just recently, a few months ago and I didn't like that because it made me nauseous. I'm just, it didn't make me feel right. And she's like, okay, well with your back pain.

1123
02:01:13.530 --> 02:01:23.430
Jen: Because it's chronic every day. It's not like oh I slept, wrong one day and then I'm fine. No, it's it's every day, she said, Okay, well, since you know

1124
02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:38.550
Jen: You're like, anxiety, depression type thing. Sometimes I'm going to put you on the Cymbalta with your back pain and see how that works and it works. Believe me, with my back pain. I was cleaning my house, you know,

1125
02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:41.310
Richelle Direny: When the medication were off.

1126
02:01:42.330 --> 02:01:45.000
Richelle Direny: Like you have excruciating pain or

1127
02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:57.810
Jen: No, like, whoa, like after at my back to normal. It hurt because I told her. I'm like, you know, the Gavin pen really isn't working.

1128
02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:12.870
Jen: The muscle relaxers I mean everything she gave me. I'm like, it's not really working as much as it should. But I'm actually taking everything now that I'm you know actually working at a job and it's helping out a lot.

1129
02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:26.040
Jen: So, but I don't know. I'm going to talk to her and see what maybe else she can give me for my for my pain that's not going to make me feel like a mind like Adderall or something.

1130
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:38.580
Jen: You know, were some crazy. I don't know. It was just weird because I would just talk and talk and talk and I'm like, I'm a chill person and it just, it was making me

1131
02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:41.010
Richelle Direny: Recognize that something right

1132
02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:47.940
Jen: Yeah, and I was like my hands were shaking a little bit and my eyes. I felt like my eyes were like thing.

1133
02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:50.190
Jen: You know, and I couldn't go to sleep.

1134
02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.570
Jen: Like it was it was weird. So

1135
02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.100
Richelle Direny: Did you um

1136
02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:01.650
Richelle Direny: Did you, what did she say when you told her you talk to her about like the

1137
02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:16.320
Richelle Direny: So like identifying the source of your back pain she decided to just give you some bolts, just to try it out before even looking to see, like, what's going on, or that she refer you to like a chiropractor. She said, That's not necessary.

1138
02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:31.560
Jen: No, she hasn't referred me to anything because the main reason I went to her, um, a couple weeks ago is because like six months ago, I don't know if I told you this, about six months ago.

1139
02:03:32.130 --> 02:03:47.790
Jen: I like I woke up and it felt like I was like six months pregnant, my stomach was like sticking out bloated. It was hard, and on my left side under my ribs. There was like a

1140
02:03:48.990 --> 02:04:03.990
Jen: Like an annoying something there. And then I would have very sharp pains coming from my like left ovary, all the way up under my rib under my breast. On my left arm I'm

1141
02:04:05.850 --> 02:04:16.590
Jen: Like, I don't know what was going on. So I talked to her about it and I had to give her a stool sample to see if I had some type of bacteria in my guts.

1142
02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:33.930
Jen: She wanted me to go on this like not die yet but you know restricted foods that might be irritating my stomach or something. But there was no bacteria found and then the nurse goes

1143
02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:42.960
Jen: There's no bacteria found and the doctor said, if you have any problems if you keep having problems come back. I'm like,

1144
02:04:43.890 --> 02:05:00.600
Jen: I've been having constant problems on my left side like there's something under my ribs on the left side that it's just irritating. It won't go away. It's not. I mean, I don't know what it is, you know, so

1145
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:02.880
Jen: I don't know.

1146
02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:06.120
Richelle Direny: So that was a movie been

1147
02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.600
Richelle Direny: Huh, and the sheet. Check it out.

1148
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:20.220
Jen: No, that's what I'm saying. I got negative for that bacteria and she told the nurse to tell me too. Oh, if it persists come back.

1149
02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:32.010
Jen: Well, it's been a constant for at least six months, you know, like there's something under my ribs. That's irritating. You know, it's not like painful, but it's just you know it's there, it's uncomfortable.

1150
02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:51.630
Jen: So I got a call and make an appointment to see her because it feels like she's just blowing me off. And then I have to talk to her about my back. Because if I can't take any narcotics, what can I take what's the source of the problem. What are you going to recommend for me to do you know

1151
02:05:53.310 --> 02:06:03.600
Richelle Direny: C and C and C. And that's the thing you have to advocate for yourself. Because by no means am I suggesting that you don't want to take whatever medication that prescribing to you.

1152
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:15.150
Richelle Direny: At the same time as having that, like, all right, I don't mind taking a medication but you popping another pill on me without identifying the source is not the solution.

1153
02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:25.440
Richelle Direny: Right, so you know if it means that, you know, hey, if I need, what do well in Ohio. I don't know how it is. But do they have you have Medicaid right

1154
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:31.950
Richelle Direny: Yes. So with Medicaid. I know like here with Medicaid, oftentimes, you have to do.

1155
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:36.570
Richelle Direny: You got to get a referral.

1156
02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:48.420
Jen: Yes, we get referrals. She said, I wanted to do a colonoscopy because sometimes I'll have blood in my stool. I had that a lot when I was using

1157
02:06:48.990 --> 02:07:04.200
Jen: But sometimes I still have it. But I think I only get it when I have like maybe a bigger you know bowel movement, but she referred me to get that eventually, but that's not

1158
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:08.310
Richelle Direny: Enough to be doesn't say what sticking with underneath your rib.

1159
02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.680
Jen: Right. That's what I'm saying. Like I

1160
02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.880
Richelle Direny: Gotta be your room is not

1161
02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:13.020
Right.

1162
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:15.540
Richelle Direny: I've got a medical professional I

1163
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.510
Richelle Direny: Don't think your intestine is appointed meet your rib.

1164
02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:30.600
Jen: Right, I know law. I'm not understanding what's going on. So I was actually I was going to call it a day. And I totally forgot. So I'm going to call in the morning and try to make an appointment.

1165
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:41.640
Richelle Direny: Put a reminder on your phone. So you can remember to call and just say, Hey, and if you feel like you know it's the next time you're going and you feel like they're blowing you off, just find another doctor, sometimes you got to get a second opinion.

1166
02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:47.670
Richelle Direny: Right. Let them know because at the end of the day, the only person who's going to advocate for you is you

1167
02:07:48.150 --> 02:07:50.550
Jen: Right, exactly. You don't want to

1168
02:07:50.670 --> 02:07:58.260
Richelle Direny: A person to say, you know, here's another pill. Like, it's not a problem. You know, it's not you have a history of taking pills, because sometimes

1169
02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:08.250
Richelle Direny: Some doctors can look at it like that. Here's another pill. Maybe that will what will work. But then you have to say.

1170
02:08:09.450 --> 02:08:22.350
Richelle Direny: It's not that I have a problem in taking on the pill. But why give me another pill and after the pill wears off. The problem is still there. Yeah. Well, the medication does is mass. The problem. It covers it up.

1171
02:08:22.770 --> 02:08:40.860
Richelle Direny: Right. But then it's there. If something is having me and my side, taking a pill only stops the pain but if there's something there jabbing me. How about you go with the paint the source of the pain because I'm sure if you with that, then I will have to pop another pill.

1172
02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:42.450
So, yeah.

1173
02:08:44.010 --> 02:08:54.480
Jen: Maybe go see a specialist in a hospital because hey, you never know. There might be a little tumor or something there that you know I mean not saying but

1174
02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:59.040
Richelle Direny: No, no, but you know you you again, it's all about ruling out

1175
02:08:59.670 --> 02:09:00.300
Jen: Things I may have

1176
02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:20.160
Richelle Direny: You know I've heard of stories where, you know, you go to the doctor. You're having the real medical issues and you're saying, Okay, well, give me something for it and I've heard Dr. Say no, I'm not going to give you. So I have to first identify what is that's causing this.

1177
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:22.560
Richelle Direny: And then I can treat it appropriately.

1178
02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:27.450
Richelle Direny: Right but prematurely giving you something is not going to solve your problem.

1179
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:46.500
Richelle Direny: Right, so definitely you know call her and just say, Hey, you know what, this is how, number one, the medication made me feel though it though it ease the issue, it didn't get rid of it. It only ease the issue, but in easing it this is what happens.

1180
02:09:47.970 --> 02:09:50.220
Richelle Direny: And if she then she could just simply say

1181
02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.380
Richelle Direny: I'm going to lower the, the, the, the medication. I'm gonna look

1182
02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:02.190
Richelle Direny: When you go just tell them I feel something here. And this is what's happening. Say no more. Right.

1183
02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:22.560
Jen: Right. But there's two issues going on my back. And then my side, so she gave me the something for my back and then tested, you know, for my side, but said, Okay, no, it's not the bacteria. So, blow it off you know this.

1184
02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:26.910
Richelle Direny: There's when you touch it. You like well you palpitating you feel something they're

1185
02:10:27.570 --> 02:10:40.860
Jen: Like it's like when I touch it. I mean it's, it doesn't bother me, but like sometimes if I sit the wrong way. Like if I sit on the couch with my knees Indian style. I'm okay.

1186
02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:51.300
Jen: But if I lean one way. It's annoying. So I kind of got to move lean the other way, I don't know, something is there, it feels it doesn't feel right. That's what I'm trying to

1187
02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:51.900
Richelle Direny: Tell

1188
02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:54.420
Richelle Direny: You something is sticking

1189
02:10:54.780 --> 02:11:04.710
Jen: Yeah, but it's it's like it's an annoying feeling it doesn't like hurt to the point where I'm in tears or anything like that. It's just

1190
02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:23.040
Jen: Annoying like maybe I have an inflammation of something under there because I mean I don't eat a lot. I'll have like, let's just say one piece of pizza and my stomach will be bloated like I'm six months pregnant. That shouldn't be happening.

1191
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.200
Richelle Direny: This is what I would suggest

1192
02:11:26.610 --> 02:11:32.580
Richelle Direny: Call her see. But in the meantime, you can speak to Natalie, not in group.

1193
02:11:33.450 --> 02:11:37.230
Richelle Direny: Right call Natalie. That's a private conversation not out you

1194
02:11:37.230 --> 02:11:37.950
Richelle Direny: Know, probably

1195
02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:49.200
Richelle Direny: Call Natalie and or see if if they can order some tests. I don't know to what level or what capacity. I don't know if they're going to probably refer you out.

1196
02:11:50.580 --> 02:12:01.770
Richelle Direny: Just like hey listen this is what's going on and let them to see if they can order test because when it's all said and done, there's only two things they can do blood tests.

1197
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:03.900
Richelle Direny: Or ultrasound.

1198
02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.490
Jen: Ultra. That's what I was thinking.

1199
02:12:05.730 --> 02:12:13.710
Jen: Ultrasound and see if something's inflamed not supposed to be there twisted, you know,

1200
02:12:14.010 --> 02:12:14.460
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

1201
02:12:14.850 --> 02:12:15.360
Richelle Direny: One of the

1202
02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:30.840
Richelle Direny: I mean, sometimes, like if if depending on the insurance and with the ultrasound. Sometimes they blow it off. Maybe because but you know that's one thing but blood test and then you remember it's not every, you know, they have to specify the blood tests.

1203
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:34.620
Richelle Direny: They don't like because hey, doing maybe a regular CDC.

1204
02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.300
Richelle Direny: Or CBC

1205
02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:55.530
Richelle Direny: Is not going to do it if you're just testing for blood in the stool. That's not going to give you if that was related but if specific blood tests. That's when if there are some norm if there's some abnormalities. That's where

1206
02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:06.510
Richelle Direny: You'd have to do. So I will put a reminder on your phone, just so that you can know for your next, I'm just like, listen.

1207
02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:09.480
Jen: This is what's happening.

1208
02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:15.540
Richelle Direny: When I leave to my side. I feel just tell them I feel like something stabbing

1209
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:17.460
Jen: Yeah yeah

1210
02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:21.090
Richelle Direny: Just tell them that I have gotten results.

1211
02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:23.880
Jen: Mm hmm.

1212
02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.770
Richelle Direny: I just beefed it up a little bit.

1213
02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.000
Jen: Right, right.

1214
02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.010
Jen: I'll do that.

1215
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:34.590
Jen: Because seriously, I shouldn't be looking like a nine month or six months pregnant when I eat.

1216
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:42.390
Jen: Like the way I eat. I should be 100 pounds, you know, not with my guts sticking out the way it is.

1217
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:44.670
Jen: So I don't know what

1218
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.140
Richelle Direny: It is I've

1219
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:47.880
Landed

1220
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:54.330
Richelle Direny: The solution to problems just by beefing things up a little bit.

1221
02:13:54.330 --> 02:14:04.110
Richelle Direny: Right. And sometimes you're not intentionally like because you wanted attention, but you're doing it because maybe you blew me off the first time. So let me be a

1222
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:09.810
Richelle Direny: tad bit and the when, when I beefed it up you muted yourself.

1223
02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:12.990
Richelle Direny: What did you say

1224
02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:17.130
Jen: Sorry. Somebody was calling me anyway. Why did you

1225
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:18.510
Jen: Know,

1226
02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.210
Richelle Direny: I said, sometimes when you be things up a little bit.

1227
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:26.790
Richelle Direny: What I mean you're given the description, but you're no

1228
02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:33.210
Richelle Direny: Right, friends, it's a doctor is as wise as you make them.

1229
02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.460
Jen: Yeah yeah

1230
02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:45.120
Jen: And like I said, and then maybe the order a couple extra tests to see and it could be those, you know,

1231
02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:50.430
Richelle Direny: I've seen on more than one occasions where someone

1232
02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:53.580
Richelle Direny: Push the issue.

1233
02:14:53.970 --> 02:15:08.790
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. And a doctor responded the exact way. The doctor responded to you. But in the end, only appease the person just so they could feel satisfied that there's nothing wrong. And guess what happens

1234
02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:10.800
Jen: Hmm, they

1235
02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:12.690
Richelle Direny: Opened up Pandora's box.

1236
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:13.800
Oh,

1237
02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:17.100
Jen: Oh geez.

1238
02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:27.120
Richelle Direny: So that's the reason why I mean, listen, you just have to advocate for yourself. Because when it's all said and done, I mean you know a lot of people have back pains. But as I said,

1239
02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:30.390
Richelle Direny: You know, I really truly recommend

1240
02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:31.710
Richelle Direny: That you

1241
02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:46.170
Richelle Direny: To advocate for yourself means to identify the source and that's part of your treatment plan because one of the things was supposed to be. You were to speak to your medical provider.

1242
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.860
Jen: Right.

1243
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:59.340
Richelle Direny: And to find the source of your back pain, but I don't. So now you're at that point where this is going on. So you're going to do that, it's continuing to find out you know what's going on.

1244
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:12.420
Jen: Right. So now I have two things I have to figure out and fix one being maybe a chiropractor. The other one, maybe starting with an ultrasound, who knows.

1245
02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:17.280
Richelle Direny: Well, um,

1246
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:29.280
Richelle Direny: It is the the back is issue, but I think if you're feeling something in your side as the comfort is there and you're saying if you're eating, like you said, if you're eating one

1247
02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:35.760
Richelle Direny: If you're really truly eating one thing and in eating that one thing you're becoming really bloated.

1248
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:41.340
Richelle Direny: And all these things are going on, you do need to talk to the doctor.

1249
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:52.860
Richelle Direny: All right about that. And sometimes it is going to a specialist, but with Medicaid, you can't go to a specialist with Medicaid, your, your, your primary has to refer you out.

1250
02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:54.120
Jen: Right, right.

1251
02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:58.950
Richelle Direny: Um, so it's definitely um you know

1252
02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.680
Jen: Having a problem. I'll figure it out. I'll definitely figure it out.

1253
02:17:07.170 --> 02:17:12.240
Richelle Direny: So it seems like you're on, you're, you're really on the road of working your program.

1254
02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:24.810
Jen: I'm trying. But, well, you know what, funny thing is, um, well, it made me a little upset because I just took the drug test right and I passed.

1255
02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:33.840
Jen: But the last shark test. I took it came up negative for Suboxone and I was like what the hell.

1256
02:17:34.530 --> 02:17:41.610
Jen: I'm like, why is it negative and I'm thinking maybe it was because of those two days that I didn't get my meds because

1257
02:17:42.090 --> 02:17:52.200
Jen: Of the problems that I was trying to connect with you guys to get the doctors, whatever. But I'm like, Oh, great. I'm like,

1258
02:17:52.710 --> 02:18:02.730
Jen: They're going to kick me out because I don't have anything in my system, you know, and then right after that they sent me another one right

1259
02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:09.390
Jen: Out right after that, like, a week and I just did it. And it came back, you know, negative except for the

1260
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:23.250
Jen: Suboxone and I told the like receptionist and she was like, well, maybe it was a faulty drug test. I'm like, Oh God, I hope so, because I know what I'm doing. And I know what I'm not doing

1261
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:43.770
Jen: You know, and I didn't want you guys to think anything. I mean, I don't know what you would think. But, oh, she's not taking her Suboxone but I have to, or else I won't be feeling well. So that kind of scared me a little bit. So, but other than that.

1262
02:18:47.130 --> 02:18:47.850
Richelle Direny: I mean,

1263
02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:55.110
Richelle Direny: I think even. It's like the second time like you've had a hold on a thing with the drug test.

1264
02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:02.760
Jen: Know, I had the first one I took was fine, I believe, because I took it at

1265
02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:14.250
Jen: The quest with my blood work. Um, and I believe that was fine. I think I had a glass of wine or something. But I told the doctor.

1266
02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:23.610
Jen: I told her, I'll have a glass of wine here and there, but it's not, you know, because she did my liver tests by blood tests.

1267
02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:46.260
Jen: But that came out negative for everything. That's when I first started, and then the first test I got here was the one that came back with no Suboxone. But then the second test that I just took it was the Suboxone so I don't know. It was weird. I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

1268
02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:49.050
Richelle Direny: No, no, you're, you're fine.

1269
02:19:49.320 --> 02:20:02.670
Jen: I just don't want you know you have any problems to like get kicked out of the program or, you know, because I know I'm not using and I know I need my Suboxone every day so

1270
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:09.540
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean this program is not designed to put you out of the program.

1271
02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:24.150
Jen: Okay, I just, I didn't know cuz you know I don't want I'm not, I'm not the type of person to, you know, like Miss meetings like with you. I did last week because I never gotten taxed and

1272
02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:27.570
Richelle Direny: Oh, you don't get because you didn't get the text last week.

1273
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:38.700
Jen: Oh, I did it. That's what I'm saying. That's why I didn't text back and say anything because yeah I was waiting for you to say hey that's make it whatever day preserve your work.

1274
02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.170
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I swear. When you look at your text message when I sent today.

1275
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:46.080
Richelle Direny: Above that you didn't see a text.

1276
02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:55.200
Jen: I didn't look but nothing popped up on that text last week, so I don't know.

1277
02:20:56.370 --> 02:21:01.140
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yeah, I figured it was your first day. And that's why, that's why I said don't worry about it.

1278
02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:03.270
Richelle Direny: Because, um,

1279
02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:08.550
Richelle Direny: I did, I did know that you were starting work that day.

1280
02:21:08.850 --> 02:21:09.270
Jen: Yeah.

1281
02:21:09.330 --> 02:21:14.100
Richelle Direny: And I remember saying to you. You're sure you want to meet for a session. And you're like, No, no, it will be fine.

1282
02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:24.960
Richelle Direny: And so that's why in it. I said, Do you want to reschedule. So when I didn't hear back from you. I figured maybe you were in a place in the building where you probably wouldn't be able to get it.

1283
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:45.060
Jen: Yeah, we're actually not allowed to have our phones at all on the floor, but on Thursday I made sure I had it with me to at least start the meeting. When I was in the building and kind of, you know, wait until I left out because that building. It's very, very loud in there.

1284
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:53.220
Jen: But yeah, I didn't, I didn't get that because you seem today how fast I text back you know

1285
02:21:53.250 --> 02:22:00.240
Richelle Direny: I changed. I changed it because I didn't want, I don't want it to go against you because I know that that particular day

1286
02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:03.060
Richelle Direny: You um

1287
02:22:04.470 --> 02:22:08.970
Richelle Direny: I know that particular day, I know you were starting your job. Yeah.

1288
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:17.730
Richelle Direny: And I, that's why I was like, I didn't, because I remember when I was, I said, that's why I didn't give it to you. Like how would send the regular text. And I'm like, You sure you want to meet for our session.

1289
02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:18.960
Jen: Okay, yeah.

1290
02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:25.650
Richelle Direny: Um, I didn't want you. Because sometimes your first day you can either leave earlier, you can leave late, it just hold on one second. It's getting

1291
02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:47.970
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, I know that it was your first day of work and just the stress of that. And then I know you said that you commute home on the bus.

1292
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:53.730
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so you know what, maybe what we can do is let me schedule you

1293
02:22:55.260 --> 02:23:01.350
Jen: Yeah, so now I work Wednesday through Saturday. So, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I'm free.

1294
02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:15.090
Jen: And then I can still make the meetings on Thursdays, to be able to get my prescription. But I might not be able to join. And so about 10 or quarter.

1295
02:23:15.090 --> 02:23:16.770
Richelle Direny: After next

1296
02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:19.680
Richelle Direny: Monday the 11th.

1297
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:22.800
Richelle Direny: We're going to have a 12 O'clock group.

1298
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:25.650
Jen: I'll be working

1299
02:23:26.310 --> 02:23:27.540
Richelle Direny: No, not on Monday.

1300
02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:32.010
Jen: On Monday. Okay. Yes. MONDAY THE 11th. Okay.

1301
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:36.660
Jen: I'll do that fun. Hold on, I'm writing it down.

1302
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:40.410
Jen: Okay.

1303
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:44.880
Jen: Yeah, that's that would be perfect.

1304
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:49.980
Jen: Monday the 11 you said at noon or 11

1305
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:52.110
Richelle Direny: At noon.

1306
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:53.010
At noon.

1307
02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:55.500
Meeting.

1308
02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:04.140
Richelle Direny: So instead of coming to group on Thursday or trying to make it on Thursday, you could just come on Mondays.

1309
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:06.720
Jen: That's perfect, that's perfect.

1310
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:23.850
Jen: Yeah, there were so many people in that meeting on Thursday that was ridiculous. That's why I had to. I was on the bus. That's why I had to say, hey, my phone's dying. It was on like 20%. I was like,

1311
02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:28.650
Jen: Just Hello, my phone's dying. I'll talk to you soon.

1312
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:36.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it is. It is. That's why we're opening up the meeting on Thursday I mean on Mondays.

1313
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:41.910
Richelle Direny: Right, it's, it's, it was in that meeting was super big. That was a lot of people

1314
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:44.460
Jen: Yeah. Are we are you still doing the

1315
02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.560
Jen: The 12 o'clock meeting on Thursdays to

1316
02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:53.460
Jen: And there's a lot of I'm sure there's a lot of people on there until

1317
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.140
Richelle Direny: There's a lot of people in there too.

1318
02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:55.560
Yeah.

1319
02:24:56.670 --> 02:25:08.820
Richelle Direny: That's why I said, that's why I made the announcement that it's because if the group becomes too big on Mondays. Then I'm going to have to open up another one.

1320
02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:11.970
Jen: That's crazy.

1321
02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:19.500
Richelle Direny: It does. I think it just gives people the opportunity to have options to attend group in that way.

1322
02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:20.700
Jen: You have

1323
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:38.010
Richelle Direny: Like so let's say for you. Now you're going to come, you could start coming because you're off on Mondays. Now that you have a job. So on Mondays at noon. You can attend once you're in 30 days. Once your schedule switches. If you're off on Thursdays. If you're on three or four

1324
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:41.880
Richelle Direny: And you could you could choose whatever day

1325
02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:42.870
Right.

1326
02:25:51.150 --> 02:26:09.180
Richelle Direny: So what I'm going to encourage is, you know, make set an appointment for your to speak with the doctor just letting her know like you know whatever is going on, tried to explain to her the best you can not share too much information.

1327
02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:28.110
Richelle Direny: In fence that because a doctor is only as wise as you tell them you want to get the answer, but then sometimes when we share a whole lot of information we present the information to the doctor and the doctor says, oh, that's just the simple solution. Just go take this in your fun

1328
02:26:28.650 --> 02:26:38.460
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. But that it's because we're trying our best to explain the information where we make them think that, oh, it's just as simple as this.

1329
02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:52.890
Richelle Direny: But if you're saying no, I feel something in my side by sticking me when I lay at a certain angle. I mean, it could even be a guest bubble. Who knows but it's, you know, because gas mobiles can do the craziest craziest things

1330
02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:56.790
Jen: Yeah, but against bubble for six months in the same spot.

1331
02:26:57.930 --> 02:26:58.620
Jen: You know,

1332
02:27:02.130 --> 02:27:02.460
Richelle Direny: And then

1333
02:27:05.310 --> 02:27:22.380
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so you know definitely you know just let her know or who and it honestly in this is, you're right. If you feel that in explaining yourself or sharing whatever it is a new feel that you're being blown off.

1334
02:27:23.850 --> 02:27:25.710
Richelle Direny: There is a thing called second opinion.

1335
02:27:26.130 --> 02:27:45.390
Jen: Yeah, I want to buy other doctor. I mean, they're in the same you know neighbor her family practice, but my other doctor. Um, I love her to death. You know I'm saying she would fix everything. You know, so I'll just go to her and talk to her about it.

1336
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:55.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I would. I would. I would agree with that as well. I would definitely agree with that because it wouldn't. Um,

1337
02:27:57.330 --> 02:28:10.830
Richelle Direny: You know, you just want to ensure that it's nothing more than it is. And that they can because, I mean, they need to touch the area they need to do a whole lot of things. So, but it is something any could be also

1338
02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:20.100
Richelle Direny: Maybe something that is also contributing or adding to the back pain because even though your back pain has been there before. It could be something added to the back pain.

1339
02:28:20.490 --> 02:28:23.640
Jen: Right, and it's never been this band before

1340
02:28:24.270 --> 02:28:34.260
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So, if it is, and if so, if they recognize whether they do an ultrasound blood tests and everything. And it's nothing then now you can move to your chiropractor.

1341
02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:50.250
Richelle Direny: And then work with the chiropractor and they put you on a plan because if your ultimate goal. And the reason why I labor on this because I mean I'm not, I'm not a nurse. I'm not a doctor. I'm not any of that stuff. But if it is that your goal one of your goal is to later on. Be

1342
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:58.080
Richelle Direny: To be able to function and be independent of the Suboxone if that's something you want to do like a year or two.

1343
02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:08.250
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. You will never be able to get to that goal successfully because you have never really address the real the reasons why you started taking it.

1344
02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:16.140
Richelle Direny: If you're taking it because you know what, I have a lot of pain or whatever, like I remember you know i watch. There's people who would they felt

1345
02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:35.010
Richelle Direny: They got they got hurt. They got an accident or whatever the situation is and that's why they're taking it. They got addicted to pain meds because of that. But then, did you ever really go down the road with a medical provider to work on a treatment plan to manage that pain effectively.

1346
02:29:35.310 --> 02:29:35.880
Richelle Direny: Because

1347
02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:50.250
Richelle Direny: If that based on that treatment plan. The goal is, you're never going to be able to get off the Suboxone maybe they can lower the doses and and and at different times increase it. Maybe that's not a realistic goal for you.

1348
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:53.460
Richelle Direny: Man, that's the reality of it, you have to

1349
02:29:53.970 --> 02:30:00.300
Richelle Direny: Identify. Would that be a realistic goal for you because you don't want to work towards something that you're never going to be able to achieve.

1350
02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:08.910
Richelle Direny: I want to become an artist. I know that I don't have the vision for i'm gonna i'm working towards becoming an artist, but that's not just that's never going to be your reality.

1351
02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:09.750
Richelle Direny: Right.

1352
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:17.130
Richelle Direny: I want to disappoint yourself and end up frustrating yourself because you're working towards a goal that if a medical professional says, well, I mean,

1353
02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:19.290
Richelle Direny: I mean, good luck with that.

1354
02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:25.980
Jen: Yeah, I'll figure it out.

1355
02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:31.830
Richelle Direny: Yes, my dear, so I have you all set for that. The 19th at four.

1356
02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:35.160
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. And I will see you

1357
02:30:36.090 --> 02:30:46.500
Richelle Direny: Thursday. I'll see you try to make it on Thursday. I'm like, even if you check in. Just try to make it on Thursday, even if you stay for a little bit, because of the commute or whatever the situation is and

1358
02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:50.220
Richelle Direny: Then, and then next week, you can just start coming on Mondays on

1359
02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:51.690
Jen: Monday. Okay.

1360
02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:54.000
Richelle Direny: And I'll make the announcement again in group.

1361
02:30:54.270 --> 02:30:54.750
Richelle Direny: Because I'm going to

1362
02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:58.830
Richelle Direny: Be announced in both groups again. So to remind people that were

1363
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:00.540
Jen: All right.

1364

Richelle Direny: All right, Jennifer, I have a good one.
