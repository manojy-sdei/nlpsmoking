Joan Kandel: Okay.

75
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.520
Justin’s iPhone: I'm pretty much I'm on it for pain management.

76
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:47.670
Justin’s iPhone: I was in a bad. Well, I've time heroin and stuff like that in when I was younger. But, and I knew about Suboxone but pretty much I just needed Suboxone to

77
00:05:48.180 --> 00:06:02.460
Justin’s iPhone: help with the pain because you know pain medicine and all that other stuff just wasn't working for me. And I mean, the doctors are voting me okay because I was crushed by 150 2000 pounds. We had a

78
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:12.270
Justin’s iPhone: Caller sort of slip and it was holding 10,000 feet of pipe and the pipe drew me into another piece of pipe and so it messed up.

79
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.030
Justin’s iPhone: My wrist and most of my shoulder, my back.

80
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:29.820
Justin’s iPhone: And so, as they were just taking a lot of pain medicine at the time. And then one of my daughters, like, Well, why don't we try out the box and see how that goes. I was Dr. Watson and actually actually helped a lot.

81
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.580
Justin’s iPhone: helped a lot and

82
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.310
Justin’s iPhone: Made a world of a difference.

83
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.050
Justin’s iPhone: I wasn't so much looking for other stuff and just doing a fast so it worked out really good.

84
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.080
Joan Kandel: Haha

85
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:56.100
Joan Kandel: And before you switch to this of awesome, were you when you say you were looking for other stuff, were you taking more than prescribed and kind of misusing the the

86
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.580
Justin’s iPhone: Media. I mean, I was getting was getting plus i was

87
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.800
Justin’s iPhone: Trying to find more because I'd always

88
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.970
Joan Kandel: Got it.

89
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.770
Joan Kandel: Haha

90
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.430
Justin’s iPhone: Right.

91
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.940
Justin’s iPhone: And then when I come at it and once you switch to Suboxone that didn't happen.

92
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:24.420
Justin’s iPhone: Now wasn't having that issue. It's just I guess like Laura tab and stuff like that. Because I mean, when I was younger, I did heroin. You know I injected I've done all my blood work and stuff so clean but but

93
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:34.140
Justin’s iPhone: Okay, I just never, you know, like, more tabs and stuff like that. Just never really did anything after that situation.

94
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.620
Joan Kandel: Haha

95
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.180
Got it.

96
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.920
Joan Kandel: What's your dose of Suboxone

97
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:57.630
Justin’s iPhone: When I was at Dr. Watson. Before Dr. Watson retired, he was giving me he was giving me three a day but then when I went to Dr. P. Dr. Dr. Pepper wallah

98
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:09.450
Justin’s iPhone: He was like, well, I don't ever prescribed anybody that much and and I'm only going to give you two. And now with with him giving me too. It was like a major cut back for me.

99
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:21.540
Justin’s iPhone: And so like for the last few months, I've been like, I'm all, I feel like I'm always going like a couple days early for my script, because I'm trying to make it, you know.

100
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.030
Joan Kandel: Haha

101
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.720
Joan Kandel: When did that switch happen.

102
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.090
Justin’s iPhone: From 2014 to

103
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:42.810
Justin’s iPhone: 16 happened, what happened like about six months ago when Dr. Watson, like he retired. I guess I mean he just told us all of a sudden like you guys are going to need to find a new

104
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.880
Joan Kandel: drummer.

105
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:58.740
Joan Kandel: Alright, so it's been about six months and have. Do you feel like you've adjusted at all to the to the lower dose.

106
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:19.050
Justin’s iPhone: No, I feel like I'm constantly running down like thing is is when they took out when they took out my proximity row like they didn't just take out three bones ended up taking out 42 pieces when they didn't my, my back. I've got, I've got multiple I've got multiple steroid injections.

107
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:32.520
Justin’s iPhone: And that's still like they still think that we just need to do surgery on it. And honestly, like whenever I've tried to do real good. I'm taking two a day. I feel like it's just

108
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:46.290
Justin’s iPhone: By by nighttime when it's time to go a bit. I feel like I'm waking up in the middle of the night, I take a half or take a quarter or take something just to help me get through the night because I have a hard time

109
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.020
Justin’s iPhone: Trying to get comfortable. Turning back and forth.

110
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.840
Justin’s iPhone: Haha mixing

111
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:01.920
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. It does. Um, and how are you taking the the Suboxone do you take it all at once in the morning, or do you take it.

112
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.550
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah i said before I take a full strip. When I wake up.

113
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:16.320
Justin’s iPhone: And then I take another full strip like around one or two o'clock. And then, you know, then by the time I'm about to go to bed like around 10 or 11 o'clock.

114
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.830
Justin’s iPhone: You know, usually I start, I feel like it's wearing off. I mean, maybe it's because I've been on the Pro. The Suboxone for so long.

115
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:38.940
Justin’s iPhone: I guess maybe, but I just feel like, you know, that's why I always felt like it was perfect, because then right as I went to bed. It was able to relax my back enough for for me to get a full night's sleep.

116
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:49.350
Joan Kandel: So you've been taking a strip in the morning a strip around one and then just toughing it out through the night, or actually taking

117
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.510
Justin’s iPhone: That wall. And I mean, I've been. I've been.

118
00:10:52.020 --> 00:11:04.590
Justin’s iPhone: I've been some like if depending on how much I have left like at the end of the month, like, I'll just tough it out but like during the beginning of the month, you know, I usually take a quarter.

119
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.050
Justin’s iPhone: Just because it

120
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.490

Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, they got some really good pawns in that order.

173
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:58.620
Justin’s iPhone: But yeah, that's pretty much that's pretty much it, I guess, I guess. Other medications that I take right now I do get Fioricet for for my migraines.

Justin’s iPhone: Jump on that. You gotta jump on that real quick.

179
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.840
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

180
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.930
Justin’s iPhone: But yeah, so

181
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.330
Joan Kandel: Where do you get those kids. What's your

182
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.200
Joan Kandel: What's your plan to

183
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.400
Joan Kandel: Fund those meds.

184
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.250
Justin’s iPhone: Right now.

185
00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:01.290
Justin’s iPhone: We want to sound like oh and I get testosterone, because I had a low testosterone count when I did my blood work.

186
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:01.860
Joan Kandel: Okay.

187
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:16.020
Justin’s iPhone: And my genetic tests I had really low testosterone count so they gave me 200 milligrams of testosterone. A week injection. And then, okay, I get a furious.

188
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.290
Justin’s iPhone: I rural America.

189
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.780
Justin’s iPhone: And

190
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.600
Joan Kandel: And you're going to find a local doctor

191
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.000
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, end up finding

192
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.230
Justin’s iPhone: That I could find me a family practice doctor prescribing here.

193
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.600
Joan Kandel: Yeah, okay.

194
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.650
Joan Kandel: Alrighty, so, um,

195
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:59.880
Joan Kandel: Let's talk a little bit. I'm going to go into a little bit more about your, your history and stuff. But let's talk about your, your dose of Suboxone before we kind of move away from that.

196
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.630
Joan Kandel: So it seems like you've been at 16 milligrams for about six months.

197
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.840
Joan Kandel: But it's not quite holding you

198
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:22.290
Joan Kandel: What I would propose that we that we do is is move your dose up to 20 milligrams, which is two and a half strips today and just

199
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.330
Joan Kandel: To see if that you know is

200
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:32.130
Joan Kandel: Is a happy medium between going all the way up to three strips a day because it's true that most people don't require three trips a day.

201
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.740
Joan Kandel: But it sounds like the two strips.

202
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.200
Joan Kandel: Today is not is not cutting it for you.

203
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.310
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, so

204
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.250
Joan Kandel: Do on two and a half.

205
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:52.830
Justin’s iPhone: Do you think, do you think also because of my size like I'm 693 hundred pounds. Like, do you think that has anything to do with that or do you think it's honestly I just been on and

206
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.630
Joan Kandel: You know, shockingly

207
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.450
Joan Kandel: Shockingly, it doesn't make that much difference in terms of size,

208
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:15.570
Joan Kandel: Because I've had little tiny human beings who've needed much higher doses than big huge human beings. So it's really it's just hard to predict. It just has more to do with your own metabolism, then how big or small, you are

209
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.280
Justin’s iPhone: It's interesting that way.

210
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.260
Maybe some chia

211
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:39.450
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it is interesting because it really, it has effects on the receptors in your brain and your brain, frankly, is about the same size as most other people. So it has more to do with the with the effect on your brain than it does on on you know the rest of your the size of your body.

212
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.780
Joan Kandel: Which is different than other medications that act you

213
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:52.020
Justin’s iPhone: Know the body. I think that's, I think that's the one main reason why I really do like Suboxone I feel like it. It's clear in my mind for a lot of other things.

214
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.660
Justin’s iPhone: I don't feel like a month.

215
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.790
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah.

216
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.510
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it helps. Yeah, right.

217
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.060
Joan Kandel: Well, yeah. Two and a half makes a lot of sense.

218
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:16.230
Joan Kandel: Okay, well let's do that. You know, I think that you may find that, especially since you've been on 16 milligrams for for six months that you're going to feel like being 20 milligrams is going to be like the sweet spot.

219
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.900
Justin’s iPhone: Okay, awesome. I appreciate that.

220
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.930
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah.

221
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.650
Joan Kandel: Yeah, no, I think that that's going to be better. So, um,

222
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.380
Joan Kandel: So with the bright heart health program, we're all online.

223
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:40.440
Joan Kandel: As you know, and what the way the program works is that we have group meetings once a week.

224
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.330
Joan Kandel: And we have individual counseling meetings as well.

225
00:19:46.380 --> 00:20:03.000
Joan Kandel: And that that can be as often as once a week or slightly less often, depending how you know stable, you're doing and stuff like that. But the group meetings are definitely once a week, and we'd so we do our prescriptions every week when people show up to group that's when we did the prescriptions.

226
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:11.460
Joan Kandel: Well done, which is different than what you're used to, but it's nice because you don't have to go to an office. You just have to be on a folder.

227
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:12.780
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, exactly.

228
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:22.980
Justin’s iPhone: So, so would I be able to go to a group, a group. This week, or like today, possibly because pretty much I'm out of the box.

229
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:34.080
Joan Kandel: Oh, yeah. So I'm going to prescribe you just from this meeting, and then we'll set you up for a group. So yes, you're going to get your meds today. Oh.

230
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:34.740
Joan Kandel: Awesome.

231
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.500
Justin’s iPhone: You're going to get your Suboxone today. Appreciate it.

232
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:42.810
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so, but let's talk. Yeah, you bet. So let's talk about groups.

233
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.550
Joan Kandel: Would you be able so that so we have

234
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.850
Joan Kandel: Tuesday groups.

235
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.840
Joan Kandel: at 7am or at noon. Would you be able to do either one of those

236
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.430
Justin’s iPhone: I'd rather do the seven

237
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.200
Joan Kandel: Then

238
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.270
Joan Kandel: Because then that's before work.

239
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.010
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, exactly. And

240
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.730
Justin’s iPhone: Then do a new

241
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.180
Justin’s iPhone: Cuz I'm pretty busy through the

242
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.740
Justin’s iPhone: Day. So seven, etc.

243
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.610
Joan Kandel: And that would actually be a good time for you.

244
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.010
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, that'd be better.

245
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.070
Joan Kandel: Good. Okay. Okay, good. So, um, so what we'll do is

246
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.180
Joan Kandel: I'm going to get you in the group which is

247
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.820
Joan Kandel: Steve, so obviously you're not going today two groups.

248
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.810
Joan Kandel: Because it already.

249
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.580
Joan Kandel: happened this morning. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get you eight days of

250
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.290
Joan Kandel: Medicine.

251
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.750
Joan Kandel: To get me through

252
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.220
Joan Kandel: To next Tuesday and then

253
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.140
Joan Kandel: You still there.

254
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:02.430
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah, I'm here.

255
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.170
Justin’s iPhone: Sorry about that.

256
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.340
Okay.

257
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.450
Joan Kandel: That's okay, that's fine. Just want to make sure you're still there.

258
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.970
Joan Kandel: So it so you'll have enough for a week and then

259
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:25.170
Joan Kandel: What we ask is that when you like about a half an hour before your group you check in with the virtual clinic, which is what you did this morning and then they will

260
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:36.360
Joan Kandel: They'll have you fill out a questionnaire about how you're doing and how things are going and then they'll give you the number of the zoom room number to call in it, which changes every

261
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.580
Joan Kandel: Week. So it's a different number every week. So they'll give it to you at the time, so call in about a half an hour beforehand.

262
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.750
Joan Kandel: And and that group is going to be with

263
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.690
Joan Kandel: With

264
00:22:50.220 --> 00:23:04.380
Joan Kandel: Gwen affair is the therapist. So every group has a therapist and a doctor in it. And that one's going to be whenever it's going to be the therapist and she'll get in touch with you for a one on one individual counseling probably sometime later this week.

265
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:17.520
Joan Kandel: For you to meet with her. And then Dr. April is going to be the doctor and she's great. She's, she's been doing this for a long time and she will be the doc in that group.

266
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.140
Joan Kandel: And so we'll, we'll kind of go from there.

267
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.730
Joan Kandel: Good. And then, did they tell you about labs. They want you to get some lab work done.

268
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.050
Justin’s iPhone: No, no you so. So where do we need to go to do this.

269
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:44.370
Joan Kandel: So what you'll do after you're done after we're done with the call is you'll call over to the virtual clinic and

270
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.010
Joan Kandel: Tell them that you need to get set up for

271
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.540
Joan Kandel: Your labs and they'll look up where you are in Santa Fe and they'll find the nearest

272
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.500
Joan Kandel: Lab that you can go to and they'll give you the information about that.

273
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.500
Joan Kandel: And then

274
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:06.900
Joan Kandel: They'll also have you fill out a an ace questionnaire which is it's just kind of a questionnaire about your

275
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.700
Joan Kandel: Childhood and how you were

276
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.820
Joan Kandel: Raised and and stuff like that. So they'll do both those things. So you can do that right after we get off the phone.

277
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.110
Joan Kandel: And then which pharmacy or am I going to be prescribing to

278
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.180
Justin’s iPhone: Go Walgreens on serious route.

279
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.630
Okay.

280
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:28.680
Joan Kandel: Got it.

281
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:40.380
Joan Kandel: So when I prescribe. I'm going to be prescribing you like I said eight days worth of the Suboxone at 20 milligrams. So, two and a half strips a day and

282
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.770
Joan Kandel: The other thing is I'm going to prescribe naloxone for you, Mark, can do you have any of that.

283
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.020
Justin’s iPhone: No, I'm actually

284
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.720
Justin’s iPhone: I think the

285
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.350
Justin’s iPhone: Major. What's your son evil beta give us the nasal spray that gave us

286
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.070
Justin’s iPhone: He gave me the pill for but I don't have

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.550
Justin’s iPhone: Oh, from my old

288
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:06.930
Justin’s iPhone: Texas. Yeah.

Justin’s iPhone: Give me the

290
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.930
Justin’s iPhone: Nasal spray

291
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:17.040
Joan Kandel: Yeah, the nasal spray is that is that that's where the money is that it's going to save a life.

292
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.710
Joan Kandel: Okay, so we'll get you that

293
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.430
Joan Kandel: Yes, so I'm getting you both of those things.

294
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.950
Joan Kandel: And then

295
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.450
Joan Kandel: The other thing I wanted to tell you about Reinhard which may which you may find helpful.

296
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:42.210
Joan Kandel: Is have in addition to Dr. Gabriel who you'll be seeing she'll be the one who does ongoing prescriptions of the Suboxone

297
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.370
Joan Kandel: But we also have Dr. Jackson, who's a pain specialist

298
00:25:47.790 --> 00:26:02.520
Joan Kandel: And she doesn't prescribe medicines for pain, but she she has a lot of really helpful self help sort of pain management strategies different tools that people can learn

299
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:14.160
Joan Kandel: Whether it's mindfulness meditation or yoga or positioning or stretching or different things that that people can use to really help with their pain with their chronic pain.

300
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:21.180
Joan Kandel: Instead of just taking pills for it. So if in the future, you're interested in getting an appointment with her. She's available to

301
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.650
And she's pretty awesome.

302
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.170
Justin’s iPhone: Okay. Well, I appreciate that.

303
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.580
Joan Kandel: So something to think about.

304
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.080
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah.

305
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:35.070
Joan Kandel: So if, if at some point you want to meet with Dr. Jackson, just ask Dr. Gabriel to get you an appointment with her.

306
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.890
Justin’s iPhone: Okay yeah well right away.

307
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.360

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.790
Joan Kandel: You an appointment with her.

311
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.390
Justin’s iPhone: Said something I didn't. Yeah, I do, I do, actually. Yeah.

312
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.020
Justin’s iPhone: If you can, that'd be very just

313
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.810
Justin’s iPhone: Because I checked my emails all the time. So pretty much, if you just want to shoot me an email.

314
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.670
Justin’s iPhone: I'll get back to race within like at least two hours.

315
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.180
Joan Kandel: Okay, for you. That's great. So what I'm going to do is as

316
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.300
Joan Kandel: Part of the virtual clinic, which is kind of the hub of

317
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:31.590
Joan Kandel: Bright heart health, we have we have care navigators who kind of take care of all of the the patient's needs. And so I will tell that your care navigator Angelina that you're interested in an appointment with Dr. Jackson and so she'll try to coordinate that with you.

318
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.820
Justin’s iPhone: Good. Can I ask you another question is

319
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:52.710
Justin’s iPhone: So after like about a month and do do his own group and personal meetings every week or is after like a month or two months as it sort of comes back to like two weeks or or anything like that.

320
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.180
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so it takes a little bit

321
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.770
Joan Kandel: Longer than that to

322
00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.700
Justin’s iPhone: To get

323
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.950
Joan Kandel: You know, kind of like privileges or or longer, longer prescriptions and time between meetings.

324
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.770
Joan Kandel: So we keep people on weekly groups at least

325
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:24.900
Joan Kandel: For a long time, like, you know, six months or so that the therapies, the individual therapy sessions, you can talk with your therapist about how often you feel like you need that that does not need to be every week, usually

326
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.620
Joan Kandel: At least once you get established, but the group's, you know, that's kind of part of the process. So,

327
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.800
Joan Kandel: There are

328
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:49.830
Joan Kandel: Pain Management groups as well that Dr. Jackson does. So if you're doing her groups then like you could do her groups every other week, and the and the group. So Dr. Gabriel every other week so that you

329
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.820
Joan Kandel: Don't have to do like

330
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.290
Joan Kandel: Two groups, a week, but with the pain medicine, the pain management groups can substitute for a another group.

331
00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.520
Justin’s iPhone: And good

332
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.640
Joan Kandel: So that's how that works. Yeah.

333
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.060
Joan Kandel: Okay, so

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:11.850
Joan Kandel: The bit. When you meet with Dr. Jackson, that might be helpful for you to like really focus on if there's something that you can do for your migrants, that wouldn't require you

Justin’s iPhone: Custom tended

438
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.490

439
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:56.310
Justin’s iPhone: If I goes way over here. If I goes way over here and it's not, it just

440
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.260
Justin’s iPhone: Floats now.

441
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.750
Justin’s iPhone: So after really concentrating

442
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.230
Justin’s iPhone: So sometimes it just floats offices.

443
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.290
Justin’s iPhone: But before it was like, cool.

444
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.220

Justin’s iPhone: Actually put you out for it. So they did that. And then I did actually have

449
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.780
Justin’s iPhone: That's pretty much it.

450
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.940
Joan Kandel: That's enough already.

451
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.820
Um,

452
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.950

570
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:28.350
Joan Kandel: Well, it makes sense. However, they're, they're probably not going to be able to send you an email every week.

571
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:40.380
Joan Kandel: As a reminder, I mean they'll probably send you an email as to when your first appointment is for therapy and maybe your first appointment for Dr. Jackson, kind of like they did for this appointment.

572
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.240
Justin’s iPhone: And then I have a reminder

573
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.850

577
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.150
Joan Kandel: That's the way to do it. Yes.

578
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.740

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:21.270
Justin’s iPhone: Yeah. Hold on one second one I asked her, you lose your ID number, you

589
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.780
Justin’s iPhone: If you lose your ID number to call the to join the first group, group to get the, the doctors number

590
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.610

591
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:47.910
Justin’s iPhone: Of like the

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.550
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so every, every group.

593
00:46:51.840 --> 00:47:01.680
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so the so the main number for you to know is the number and you can put it in your phone is the number for the virtual clinic, which I think it's a 408 number because

594
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.440
Joan Kandel: They're the ones who you're going to check in with and the end the meeting.

595
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:17.550
Joan Kandel: Room changes every week. So each group is going to have a different meeting room. So when you call in a half an hour before your group that's when they're going to give you a new meeting number so

596
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:26.820
Joan Kandel: That like this number. You don't have to remember it because it won't exist. Again, and then every group, you won't have to remember it. Beyond that, that group.

597
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.650
Justin’s iPhone: So the only number you

598
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.870
Joan Kandel: Really need to remember is that

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.060
Justin’s iPhone: That's one. That's what I think it starts with 408

Justin’s iPhone: You have that number. Yeah, we do.

605

606
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:57.900
