00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.130
Richelle Direny: Hi Brittany.

2
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.140
Richelle Direny: Hello.

3
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.400
Hello.

4
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.040
Richelle Direny: Hey,

5
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.010
Richelle Direny: I was about to give it to you, but I know yesterday. I did that because someone was waiting a long, long time.

6
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.380
Brittany Dingess: And I guess they weren't too happy. Yeah.

7
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.340
Brittany Dingess: The second I'm having a problem with my audio.

8
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.780
Brittany Dingess: Okay.

9
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.400
Brittany Dingess: For some reason, every time I get a phone call when I'm using zoom in. So, some with the audio.

10
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.660
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, tonight.

11
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
Richelle Direny: Yes, we asked when you do get a phone call. It does. I think it kicks out your, your audio.

12
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.020
Brittany Dingess: And does something

13
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.690
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

14
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
Brittany Dingess: Just to get to get someone in the virtual clinic.

15
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.290
Richelle Direny: Are you can you can you hear my

16
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.610
Richelle Direny: Goodness. Now,

17
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.200
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

18
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.490
Yeah.

19
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.830
Okay.

20
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.540
Richelle Direny: All right then. So today's session is our session that we're doing today. It's really just an intake session.

21
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:52.950
Richelle Direny: Today is just an intake session. So it's just mostly going to be in on like just asking interview more than your history and that's and then at the end, we'll talk about like what we will do in terms of scheduling moving forward. Okay.

22
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.000
Brittany Dingess: Okay, okay.

23
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.310
Richelle Direny: Um, so he pretty much just general in terms of the check in process what you've been doing for group, it's it's generally the same

24
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.260
Richelle Direny: You know,

25
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:21.120
Richelle Direny: I sent you that message. If you ever have to change your appointment or you need to reschedule or whatever the situation is, you can always respond to me so you can save that number. And you can always respond to me. Okay, times I'll send

26
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:34.560
Richelle Direny: A reminder of your appointments. I know that I had just started to you yesterday, so I will send you a reminder, either the day before or the day off. I find sometimes that it's better to do it the day of because then it's fresh in

27
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.700
Brittany Dingess: Your mind a

28
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.920
Richelle Direny: In comparison to the day before.

29
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.870
Richelle Direny: So,

30
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.690
Go ahead.

31
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.630
Brittany Dingess: I was gonna say, yeah.

32
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.340
Brittany Dingess: I have so much going on. Normally, forget pretty easily. Yeah.

33
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:05.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I've been. I've been pulling it this the date of because I just find that I get a better response when I look I remind people that the same day that their appointment was is that day at whatever time

34
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.790
Richelle Direny: Because, like, I'll get distracted or what have you, but I generally try to make the send out reminders, um, then

35
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:28.920
Richelle Direny: When we're meeting individually. I know the rule of bright heart is always having the headset in but when we're meeting individually. I'm not necessarily the biggest stickler because it's your information that you know we're

36
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.490
Brittany Dingess: Talking about

37
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.780
Richelle Direny: I often ask, when were together.

38
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.590
Richelle Direny: In I often asked one where you know group setting. There are other people that's there.

39
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.550
Richelle Direny: That's sharing

40
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.880
Richelle Direny: Yes, so I definitely really asked

41
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
Richelle Direny: To to always keep your headset in

42
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.190
Hold on one second.

43
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.550
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry. Usually we have like a message for them that they send us messages as to what's going on. So I just needed to see that but

44
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:34.920
Richelle Direny: Either way, um, so again, like I said, today. Today it's more just the information. I'm just going to get your history.

45
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:47.310
Richelle Direny: Moses go over that and then towards the end was out, you know, meeting floor individual will have to like another a follow up session after that within you know we for two or not, it's gonna be like a couple weeks and then

46
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.990
Richelle Direny: Then

47
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.060
Richelle Direny: there on out. We'll just make it accordingly based on, you know, we go over today. Okay.

48
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.000
Brittany Dingess: Okay.

49
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.120
Richelle Direny: All right, so in getting started. If you could just tell me what, how did you hear about bright heart.

50
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:17.280
Brittany Dingess: Um, I actually found it online. I was curious if what with how prominent till a Medicine Hat and become

51
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.560
Brittany Dingess: I actually found it several months ago or not it was last year I found

52
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.070
Brittany Dingess: That you guys were offering

53
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:43.050
Brittany Dingess: Substance Abuse Treatment through telemedicine and I thought you know how convenient because the doctor that I have three and he's still my family doctor but when I originally started on Suboxone

54
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:55.860
Brittany Dingess: Even when I first started. He was one of the only doctors in my area that took my insurance or took any insurance really or substance abuse treatment and

55
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:07.680
Brittany Dingess: It was when I first started to see him, which has been like four and a half years ago, it was like a 40 minute drive each way. And then we moved

56
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:19.110
Brittany Dingess: In May of last year and it became almost an hour and a half each way, which is, I mean, it's fine. Like if it's all in my day off or something but

57
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:32.760
Brittany Dingess: The factory where I work, they sometimes run, seven days a week and it's hard to fit in an extra four or five hours, you know, to get there. And in the weight and be seen and

58
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:45.540
Brittany Dingess: You know, and get hot, pick up a prescription or whatever and then get home. So I had started looking into something that was more convenient and I stumbled across. You guys are actually

59
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:56.370
Brittany Dingess: Right when I signed up with bright heart. There's another company that's doing something kind of similar. I'm not real sure the details, but

60
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.630
Brittany Dingess: So yeah, man. I just, I found it on my own on, you know, using Google

61
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:17.280
Brittany Dingess: Search and if, if anything, I mean, I didn't know if that was even possible, because normally the telehealth companies don't prescribe you know controlled substances, so

62
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.960
Brittany Dingess: I didn't think it would even be possible.

63
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.990
Richelle Direny: What to do this town to do the telehealth.

64
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.910
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, to do only tell hill.

65
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:50.730
Brittany Dingess: But still be able to prescribe this the box on. I didn't think it would be possible. Most places require a, you know, at least by a couple of am person in office visits before they can refill, anything like that. And I know like my

66
00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.140
Brittany Dingess: Other my old Suboxone doctor, you know, like they couldn't call even calling a refill, even though I've been a patient

67
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:10.770
Brittany Dingess: For years, they couldn't call in a refill like I had to come in and physically be seen and drug test and they were saying

68
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.860
Richelle Direny: Well, I do know that I'm you're in Tennessee. Right.

69
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:29.730
Richelle Direny: Yeah I know in the other states like other states that they do require that you, you do have a face to face and visit with the

70
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:44.820
Richelle Direny: With the doctor so you know it didn't, especially now there as telemedicine is getting a little bit more popular and people are being more open to do it. So I think that that's kind of

71
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:53.520
Richelle Direny: Been a big hole on me, especially now with this whole pandemic that's going on the floodgates has

72
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.870
Richelle Direny: just opened up.

73
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.260
Richelle Direny: So yeah, you're taking on

74
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:14.580
Brittany Dingess: Well, I know I was reading. They actually ever the DEA is temporarily similar restriction. So now any ill health provider can technically

75
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:37.350
Brittany Dingess: Calm and even schedule to narcotics, they're allowing opiate opioid prescriptions through telemedicine because of the pandemic and doctors offices closed down and just, you know, I guess, in, in general, where they're trying to curb the spread of the virus, they're allowing

76
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.590
Brittany Dingess: Any telemedicine provider.

77
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:53.280
Brittany Dingess: You know, as long as they conduct like a thorough concert, you know, be it has to be a video. Video consultation, it can't be just by phone, but

78
00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:13.500
Brittany Dingess: They're allowing out which I mean I would imagine to the more popular telemedicine providers like MD live and doctor on demand and stuff probably still won't do it because the potential for abuse and you know in a situation like that is pretty tremendous

79
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.850
I think

80
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:30.030
Richelle Direny: What come down to as well the individual and the relationship that a doctor. I'm had with the patient. So, you know, if you've been meeting with a patient for a long time. Um,

81
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:41.460
Richelle Direny: I think like at this point, um, you know, I think you not to say that you could swear for someone, but I'm guessing it would just depend on the person who was

82
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:53.730
Richelle Direny: Writing the prescription to say, okay, you know, they won't necessarily abuse it, or what have you, but I think it just depends on the relationship and the record that you have with that person. That's just writing

83
00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:03.690
Richelle Direny: So if a new person comes on you. You might be a little bit leery in terms of whether or not you want to. And then I'm sure there's a lot of questions. It's a very

84
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.510
Brittany Dingess: Our

85
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:24.870
Richelle Direny: The assessment to the assessment. I'm sure you get more tedious, then if it was just a regular medication, but on so that's good that you did find right heart. It definitely is a little bit more convenient, you're not having to stress, especially I know in Tennessee and like you know I'm

86
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:36.780
Richelle Direny: In other states that, you know, sometimes the distance between where you live, to where you have to go to the to see the doctor or to whatever treatment program. It's a long commute.

87
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.490
Brittany Dingess: And some people

88
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:48.270
Richelle Direny: Can't you know commute financially. So having this platform has been a tremendous help for a lot of people, and I've heard people saying that it works really well for them.

89
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:57.510
Richelle Direny: Have you been in treatment program like have you been getting an inpatient treatment program before

90
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.670
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, one time.

91
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:26.190
Brittany Dingess: It was a cadence and Chattanooga in 2014 I actually had gotten my second DUI and I had asked the district attorney for a furlough to finish my 45 day mandatory sentence in rehab because I wanted to go to rehab and I had never i mean i hadn't I didn't have insurance.

92
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:38.640
Brittany Dingess: So I didn't really, you know, going on high, and for it out of pocket or whatever wasn't an option. So I hadn't had the opportunity to go even I'd wanted to go

93
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:57.090
Brittany Dingess: But, and that provided may not only the opportunity to get out of jail for 28 days of that 45 sentence, but also, you know, it gave me the chance to go and I graduated I did. I mean, I loved it.

94
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.490
Brittany Dingess: I absolutely loved it.

95
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.700
Brittany Dingess: And

96
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.650
Brittany Dingess: That was in 2014 thing.

97
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.940
Richelle Direny: Well, and that was the last time you've been in a treatment program.

98
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.140
Brittany Dingess: Impatient, yeah. I've been

99
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:37.590
Brittany Dingess: At when I got out, I got out in the beginning of June 2014 from the inpatient program and I stayed just totally clean with no medication management or anything for about six months and I had some dental work done and I had to have the dental work done in

100
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:46.920
Brittany Dingess: Several different appointments, because I was paying for out of pocket and I had to have some teeth extracted

101
00:14:47.370 --> 00:15:09.960
Brittany Dingess: Solid basically having I've done war to time because that was all that I could afford that was each direction came a prescription of like hydrocodone or whatever. And that kind of reignited my addiction and I started just you know snowballing again. So by the end of 2015 hours.

102
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:22.650
Brittany Dingess: I had been going to, I started going through Methadone clinics in like the middle of 2015. And that was an email over an hour each way every single day.

103
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.910
Brittany Dingess: And then when I get there. It was like 20 something dollars a day, Sammy. Sammy on SEBI take

104
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:38.640
Brittany Dingess: So it was like $27 a day for my nose and I wasn't getting to go every day because I didn't have the money. I was working at a restaurant.

105
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.970
Brittany Dingess: A couple of other

106
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:53.940
Brittany Dingess: People that I knew that we're going to the same clinic. So we would kind of colorful, but still it was, you know, oil and gas and a lot of time and

107
00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:08.640
Brittany Dingess: Money and it wasn't really working for me, long time. And so I finally found a box and doctor I got insurance and then I found the box doctor that took insurance.

108
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:21.180
Brittany Dingess: And it took me like a month and a half to get in and I was with that same I'm still with that doctor. I mean, you know, he's just my primary care doctor not

109
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:33.060
Brittany Dingess: He's not doing my box and treatment of addicts at well they switched me last year they switched me from Suboxone to the sub okayed shot.

110
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:41.010
Brittany Dingess: And that I've been on and I had to bring them over and over that I felt

111
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.680
Brittany Dingess: And I had expressed to them that it wasn't really working.

112
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.110
Brittany Dingess: And

113
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.030
Brittany Dingess: They

114
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:06.720
Brittany Dingess: He refused to negotiate. You know, like putting me back on the Suboxone or anything so

115
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:21.420
Brittany Dingess: I'm close like I've been. I just have a had problem after problem was my insurance not want to cover, they'll cover didn't. I don't want to cover the Shaw and they'll go over it again, I don't want to cover it so

116
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:31.320
Brittany Dingess: I called and told him after I got my last shot that I had thought about and then I wasn't gonna, you know, I just didn't want to take the shot anymore.

117
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.160
Brittany Dingess: Till

118
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.130
Brittany Dingess: Then the name of what

119
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.590
Richelle Direny: What was the name of that program.

120
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.540
Brittany Dingess: Mean, it was just

121
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.390
Brittany Dingess: Kinda like what this is.

122
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:48.960
Oh,

123
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.580
Richelle Direny: OK.

124
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:58.770
Richelle Direny: OK. So you said so. Go ahead. So you said you was you were on the shot or you didn't

125
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.390
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

126
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:07.890
Brittany Dingess: I just didn't. I mean it didn't work my cravings increased, and I felt like it wasn't

127
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.330
Brittany Dingess: Where it you know wasn't dissolving like it's supposed to.

128
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:24.600
Brittany Dingess: And they, I don't know. I mean, they never they never, I don't have a thyroid anymore. I had to have my thyroid surgically removed a couple years ago.

129
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:39.000
Brittany Dingess: And I've had problems, taking the replacement hormone. So my metabolism has slowed a lot. And there's a lot of medicines that that I just my body doesn't break down like it's supposed to.

130
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.650
Richelle Direny: And I

131
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:46.140
Richelle Direny: Guess before the salt that's before getting the thyroid removed or after

132
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.650
Brittany Dingess: After I after I got my thyroid removed in 2017

133
00:18:53.310 --> 00:19:06.810
Brittany Dingess: I also saw in like a April or May of last year and I immediately noticed that my cravings increased and I tried to give it some time, you know, to work.

134
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:26.160
Brittany Dingess: And I just continued to express that I felt like my body wasn't dissolving the medication like it was supposed to. They never checked the levels of buprenorphine and my board or any urine or anything.

135
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:42.570
Brittany Dingess: To see if it was dissolved and correctly. However, I have independently researched the shot and found that it's a common issue for it to not dissolve as quickly as its intended to

136
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:51.870
Brittany Dingess: So the those that get with it is like significantly lower than just taking it every day.

137
00:19:52.380 --> 00:20:07.320
Brittany Dingess: And I am. I mean, they're still trying to get it refilled. And I've called and told them that I'm not going to take it anymore, but they're still trying to get me to take it and I'll tell them you know it's not working.

138
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:19.800
Brittany Dingess: You know I'm I've moved on. I've found, you know, I've got to do something that's going to work better for me. I haven't. And I've been when I got sick last

139
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:30.990
Brittany Dingess: About 10 days ago I was, I had told him you know that I would give them all the details, but my next appointment. Well, I didn't get to go to my next appointment, which would have been

140
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.790
Brittany Dingess: Monday, I think this week was when I was supposed to go for an in office appointment.

141
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:52.620
Brittany Dingess: I didn't get to go because I guess that that office is not really even seeing patients right now because of the buyers. So they just call and tell me that they moved the appointment out there. Will we

142
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.830
Brittany Dingess: And my doctor hasn't even been in the office so

143
00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:09.720
Brittany Dingess: When I go and talk to him. I'm gonna give him. You know, like all the details of Bret Hart Hale, so they can coordinate is

144
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.910
Richelle Direny: just your regular primary doctor right

145
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:24.210
Brittany Dingess: When he started out as just my Suboxone doctor. And over time, I may not develop a good, a good relationship with them. So he

146
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.440
Richelle Direny: If you have a Suboxone doctor and then now you're working with Dr. Jamison

147
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.570
Richelle Direny: Can you have two different DOCTORS PRESCRIBING you

148
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.970
Brittany Dingess: Know, I mean he's not he's no longer prescribing it to me is what I'm saying.

149
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:42.690
Okay.

150
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:56.940
Brittany Dingess: He gave that I got that last shot and then I was able to get in here. I got a walk. I had submitted my insurance and everything to bright heart and I hadn't heard anything back from them.

151
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.450
Brittany Dingess: So I've gone ahead and gone to my appointment in February, with them and got the shot.

152
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:13.560
Brittany Dingess: And then like a couple weeks later I heard back from Breitbart, and they were able to get me in, like, a few weeks after I had the last shot.

153
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:24.780
Brittany Dingess: So I called his office and told him that I wasn't going to be taken. Michelle anymore and you know for because it just wasn't working for me.

154
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:45.720
Brittany Dingess: And there's issues with the insurance. I mean, it's just, you know, it's the hassle all the way around. Mm hmm. And it's not, you know, it wasn't working for me if it's not on the level that you know i needed personally and since he wasn't willing to put me back on just Suboxone

155
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:55.560
Brittany Dingess: You know, I've moved on to other treatments. And I said, I just told him I still want them to be my primary care doctor but just not

156
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.120
Brittany Dingess: You know prescribe

157
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.160
Richelle Direny: Yeah, to treat me. Okay.

158
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:11.550
Richelle Direny: Okay. What was the name of the treatment program that you were going to prior. The one when you did. Were you did you served out your, your time from your DUI wasn't able to inpatient program.

159
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.330
Brittany Dingess: cadence its counsel for alcohol and drug abuse services.

160
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.220
Brittany Dingess: I think

161
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.210
Richelle Direny: And how long and you only did you only start 20 days in there. You said right

162
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.300
Brittany Dingess: 28 yeah

163
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:34.860
Richelle Direny: 28 and you said that you did like groups and you met with an individual counselor.

164
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:44.280
Brittany Dingess: I only met with an individual counselor, like one it was group therapy every day and just different why

165
00:23:46.410 --> 00:24:00.720
Brittany Dingess: They have different like skill building classes like meditation like learning how to meditate and breathing exercises and just different, different things. The majority of it was a shooting outside

166
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:13.230
Brittany Dingess: And it gives zeebo waiting to go to the next class, there'd be like an hour class and then a two hour break in an hour class and then a two hour break. You know, so

167
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:24.810
Brittany Dingess: The majority of it was just like being able to interact with other adults without there being drugs involved kind of learning how to just

168
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:34.020
Brittany Dingess: Have friends again without drugs being involved, which is, you know, something that I hadn't had in a long time.

169
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:46.980
Richelle Direny: Okay. So pretty much learning affecting called coping skills in the absence of alcohol or any types of substances, I'm

170
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.670
Like

171
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:54.090
Richelle Direny: Okay. Now, have you when. How old were you when you start when you

172
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.070
Richelle Direny: got addicted to what is it your drug of choice is alcohol.

173
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.710
Brittany Dingess: No other choice was opioids.

174
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.360
Richelle Direny: Okay. And when did you first got introduced to the old ones.

175
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.200
Brittany Dingess: The very first time I tried them.

176
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.950
Brittany Dingess: Like recreationally

177
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.960
Brittany Dingess: I was probably

178
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:32.190
Brittany Dingess: 15 or 16 my grandfather had cancer and he had about like they would give him Percocet and stuff and he would keep them all in the refrigerator for a reason.

179
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:49.110
Brittany Dingess: And I like every once in a while. And I'm I mean like every single month. I would take one and you know go to school and I'd be all you know like hyper and social and I just felt good and then

180
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:55.080
Brittany Dingess: What, what, really, I think, or may what really did it for me.

181
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:07.500
Brittany Dingess: Was when I was 17 after he passed away. I was saving saying I was in a really bad car accident. So like I was prescribed them.

182
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:16.710
Brittany Dingess: For legitimate medical purposes I'm I didn't break anything other than I had stress fractures in my collarbone. But

183
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:29.370
Brittany Dingess: I took a lot of ligaments muscles and stuff in my shoulders and in my neck from the whiplash. And so, ours is for prescribe darvocet and Tramadol and

184
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:41.940
Brittany Dingess: By couldn't and you know it. And then the injuries that are sustained in that car accident calls my spine to start to degenerate.

185
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:52.980
Brittany Dingess: And like the twit from my thoracic if the end of the cervical spine and so Santa has a car accident in 2004

186
00:26:53.580 --> 00:27:12.450
Brittany Dingess: I was just always put into pain management or I was given Percocet and had her coat on. And Tramadol you know this all the time, constantly increasing the doses and it got i mean i'm because I actually liked the way that it made me feel

187
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:34.140
Brittany Dingess: That exacerbated. You know, I would take it because I physically hurt. And then I learned pretty early on that I could take it if I hurt emotionally or files anxious and it helped so I learned. You know that. And I guess I felt comfortable like

188
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:43.830
Brittany Dingess: You know, I wasn't having the doctor shop or anything, because I had legitimate physical reasons to be prescribed pain medicine.

189
00:27:44.460 --> 00:28:00.900
Brittany Dingess: So it was just, I mean, I always had it and until it got like my diction got so out of control that I was I was taking a month's worth of pain medicine in two days. I don't know how I didn't overdose on the acetaminophen.

190
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.960
Brittany Dingess: Thank God I didn't, because I was. I mean, it was, it had been

191
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.220
Brittany Dingess: I mean, it was probably upwards of like

192
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.930
Brittany Dingess: Oil grams of acetaminophen on Sundays that I would say

193
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.500
Brittany Dingess: Wow. Yeah. And

194
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.560
Richelle Direny: So you're hearing

195
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.570
Richelle Direny: Your parents are you so you grew up with your grandparents or with your parents.

196
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.700
Brittany Dingess: With my grandparents.

197
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.590
Richelle Direny: And he didn't. They didn't know that the pills where someone was going

198
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:54.750
Brittany Dingess: I would only literally only take like one every couple of months at first, and then he passed away. So I went, you know, a good like year was really out without, you know, having any I didn't bother to think about trying to find any illegally.

199
00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:15.030
Brittany Dingess: The night car accident kind of reminded me. You know why I would sneak them every once in a while. And because I certainly had access to them and you know no one was counting them and see how many I had, I mean it just, it got out of control, really, really quickly.

200
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:25.350
Brittany Dingess: You know, fast forward like four years and I actually was Dr. Shopping.

201
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:31.980
Brittany Dingess: Get more and more and more prescriptions, because I was taking them so fast and then

202
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.500
Brittany Dingess: I mean I'll and I will go through periods where

203
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.260
Brittany Dingess: You know I would.

204
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.080
Brittany Dingess: Kind of slow down.

205
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:54.330
Brittany Dingess: I went to college right out of high school, and I did really well in school, but the anger, like the social anxiety that go into a big university calls

206
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:13.890
Brittany Dingess: Calls mean you know where I was taking up more and more and I had. There's a whole an hour is not nearly all I love to try to tell you all the details that have led me to this point, I had an eating disorder when I was a teenager.

207
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.780
Brittany Dingess: I mean,

208
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:22.200
Brittany Dingess: I anxiety issues and depression. I started cutting myself when I was 14

209
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:35.970
Richelle Direny: All of that because all of that is going to go into each section of this. And, you know, like you said, an hour is really truly not enough time and that's why we schedule other sessions but um

210
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:44.280
Richelle Direny: So you're saying now before we go into because that will I will capture that when we talk about your mental health history of mental illness.

211
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:52.050
Richelle Direny: Now, did you know you did say that you are so the only time you were incarcerated was for DUI.

212
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.200
Brittany Dingess: No, I'm

213
00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.140
Brittany Dingess: So I went to when I

214
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:10.920
Brittany Dingess: Finish three years when I originally wrote enrolled in college right out of high school, I made it to the end of my third year of college and I had like a

215
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:20.730
Brittany Dingess: I guess it was related to my eating disorder, but I'm not. I mean, I'm not hundred percent sure. But anyways, I started having a lot of health problems.

216
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:31.980
Brittany Dingess: So I ended up having five surgeries in one year and I was on a full academic scholarship and because I missed clients like

217
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:41.610
Brittany Dingess: I had to had to have an emergency appendectomy my gallbladder stopped working. I had like probably 40 or 50 kidney stones.

218
00:31:42.120 --> 00:32:00.240
Brittany Dingess: Within a few months and I had to have one of those surgically removed, and then I had a punch the wall broke my hand. So all that happen from like January 2007 all the way to think the last, the last surgery was October.

219
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.190
Brittany Dingess: 2000

220
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:10.950
Brittany Dingess: Or January. Yeah. Is all those surgeries were in 2007 so I lost my scholarship

221
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.810
Brittany Dingess: In 2000 the beginning of 2008

222
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:17.010
So you

223
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.740
Richelle Direny: Seven.

224
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.930
Brittany Dingess: I started college in 2005

225
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.610
So you never

226
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:41.520
Brittany Dingess: Know, but I am i mean i i re enrolled in college in 2014 and I'm in my senior year of college again for a different different major but

227
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.730
Brittany Dingess: I'm there. I mean, I'm still, you know, I'm doing well, and I really, I had to take some leaves of absence, but

228
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.810
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I'm I'm currently a student so

229
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.330
Richelle Direny: Did you so so what were you studying at the time.

230
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.620
Brittany Dingess: Okay ministry. Okay.

231
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.100
Brittany Dingess: And be a medical examiner

232
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:06.960
Oh well.

233
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.060
Richelle Direny: That's that. That's that people right

234
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:19.650
Brittany Dingess: Yeah. Originally I wanted to be a pediatric cardio pulmonologist, but that's just

235
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.020
Brittany Dingess: I feel like I just

236
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:32.760
Brittany Dingess: I don't know. I felt like my emotions would get in the way, all asleep dealing with babies and small children and stuff.

237
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:52.500
Brittany Dingess: Figured you know dealing with. I wanted to be a doctor regardless enough figure deal with their people, you know, will be the easiest way to bypass any emotional attachment and just try to be professional my used to. I used to think that my diction.

238
00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:05.160
Brittany Dingess: I never considered myself an addict during that time until recent. More recently, but I used to be so resentful because I thought

239
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:19.290
Brittany Dingess: I became an addict, because I lost my scholarship and, you know, basically we're at after I lost my scholarship. I thought a fail on a drug charge is another story but

240
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:32.160
Brittany Dingess: So essentially, you know, I could never go back into that degree program because I have a felony. And I was so resentful always because I thought that all that happened because I lost my scholarship

241
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:39.210
Brittany Dingess: That I became an addict, because I lost my scholarship. But I mean, now I know I would have been an addict, regardless

242
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.960
Richelle Direny: So you're saying that you can't go into a medical program because of it.

243
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:49.980
Brittany Dingess: Right, and I think the laws have changed. Now I could go into like nursing or something but

244
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.990
Brittany Dingess: If

245
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.550
Richelle Direny: You want to be in the medical field.

246
00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.100
Brittany Dingess: Um,

247
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:08.400
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I may not always want to either be in the medical field or in like friends like crime scene things

248
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.150
Richelle Direny: Like a CSI like you go and you do

249
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.570
There.

250
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.570
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, that's very ambitious of you, you can use

251
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:39.270
Richelle Direny: You definitely until you until you no longer have a life, you still there's there's always a hope they can still do it. You could still do when I was in college, I had people that could have been my grandmother in my, in my class. So are great almost great grandma, they were

252
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.790
Richelle Direny: Seniors. So there's still hope so go after it.

253
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:59.850
Richelle Direny: Now do you now let's go into your family history in terms of. I know you said you were raised by your grandparents. Was it your parents were uninvolved. What was the dynamics. Do they have a history, my sense to me.

254
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:06.660
Brittany Dingess: My mother, my biological mother has always been in my life. It was when I was born.

255
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:17.190
Brittany Dingess: My biological father was abusive towards her August, and so she placed me in the custody of her parents

256
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:31.770
Brittany Dingess: And they adopted and raised me, AND WHEN I WAS REALLY SMALL. They always tell me that she was my sister, because I guess they thought it was easier for me to call for him than trying to explain the true

257
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.110
Brittany Dingess: My biological father. I do know him and I

258
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:48.330
Brittany Dingess: When I got in trouble when I was 21 I moved to he lived that entire partner half of my family. Pretty much lived in Indiana.

259
00:36:49.050 --> 00:37:10.680
Brittany Dingess: And I moved up there to kind of get away from all the people you know had associated with one I got arrested and or like six months. I tried to forge a relationship with him, and I've got step brother and two sisters and because of my stepmother.

260
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:30.690
Brittany Dingess: She, she would lie about me like I was working two jobs working 90 hours a week, and she told that my sisters and sisters. The reason that I wasn't around is because I was out doing drugs and running around and doing this, man. I wasn't, I really wasn't. But

261
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.370

268
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:25.140

280
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.590
Brittany Dingess: I did.

281
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.810
Richelle Direny: And what about

282
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.660
Richelle Direny: What else in terms of you, depression, anxiety,

283
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.010
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, when I was 14 I started

284
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:51.180
Brittany Dingess: Cutting myself and I did that.

285
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.010
Brittany Dingess: Up until I did it for like room.

286
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:07.320
Brittany Dingess: Or 13 or 14 years I would cut my I've got scars all over my arms and white photography

287
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:17.460
Brittany Dingess: And I'll cut myself and I wouldn't as I when I got into my early 20s, I started punching and yeah like kind of like

288
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.290
Brittany Dingess: Migration, but that was

289
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.030
Brittany Dingess: Pretty. I mean, it was pretty short lived, honestly.

290
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.590
Brittany Dingess: I was never really angry growing up.

291
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:47.700
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I was a good kid. I had straight A's all through school. You know my birth and you know I had always growing up always because I'll, I'll be the first college graduate in my family.

292
00:40:48.900 --> 00:41:09.390
Brittany Dingess: So always growing up, you know, like my grandparents, put a lot of pressure on me to perform well academically and pursue a career where I would never have to worry about money and that kind of thing. So that, and I wanted to help people. So that's where the, you know, I wanted to be a doctor.

293
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:30.300
Brittany Dingess: So when I lost my scholarship and then I got that failing. Ah right after that and I couldn't go back, be a doctor. I didn't have a backup plan at all. And I had never thought about like what if this doesn't work out, and I have to, you know, come up with something else.

294
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.730
Brittany Dingess: So,

295
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.680
Well, you could still do.

296
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.470
Richelle Direny: Examiner, I mean, people are always dying, they still need to get examined for the cause of death.

297
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.830
Brittany Dingess: Yeah. And now that enough time has passed since the failing.

298
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.770
Brittany Dingess: April.

299
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.470
Brittany Dingess: April 20

300
00:41:53.610 --> 00:42:01.290
Brittany Dingess: Of this year, will my 10 years since I was convicted and 11 years since I was charged with it.

301
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:15.090
Brittany Dingess: So now that enough time is tired Yeah, okay, I can definitely going at least go into nursing or something. But actually, the degree that I'm pursuing now is the human services with the concentration in addiction.

302
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:26.190
Brittany Dingess: I want to get my masters in clinical social work basically quite here, then that's what I'm in school for now.

303
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.220
Richelle Direny: Let's talk about it on the sideline and

304
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.580
Brittany Dingess: See if you still want to do

305
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.030
Richelle Direny: It. Okay.

306
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:47.220
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, but, I mean, it sounds like you, you just have a heart to want to help people and that's good. And I think that's what it comes down to is going to help people.

307
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:56.310
Brittany Dingess: I've had so many things happen. I've been sexually assaulted. I've been in abusive relationships.

308
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:07.170
Brittany Dingess: I grew up with an alcoholic grandfather. They never ever hit me. I was never like right or molested when I was little. It was situations.

309
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:17.610
Brittany Dingess: That I kind of put myself into being around people, you know, like being, you know, we're a lot of people doing drugs and stuff. When I got arrested.

310
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:34.230
Brittany Dingess: At a college I had actually had lost my apartment. So I had to move back home and I was kind of running around with some people on a new from high school and started doing math. And I did that for about six months. And that's what led to that fail on me.

311
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:36.570
Brittany Dingess: So you

312
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:48.990
Brittany Dingess: Didn't even look. Yeah. Well, there was a meth lab in the hotel room where I was visiting and I had an ex boyfriend, follow me there and call the police. Why didn't know anything was in there.

313
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.620
Brittany Dingess: Anything on me but

314
00:43:54.270 --> 00:44:00.870
Brittany Dingess: I had stopped by to see your friends that used to be when he was attached to, or is that I had known for a while.

315
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:20.160
Brittany Dingess: And stopped by to see him about some tests to work and, you know, lo and behold, the police come right behind me and knock on the door and my charge. Both of us with the same, even though I wasn't in possession of anything. And then when it comes when it came down to

316
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:32.100
Brittany Dingess: Me pleading guilty to something. There was also stolen loaded gun in the room. They told me that I had the choice of pleading guilty to either the

317
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:50.100
Brittany Dingess: Gun charge or the drug charge. So I took the drug charge because I didn't, you know, I didn't want like a you know figures a drug charge was like violence over fail on me if I had to have a felony. You know, I mean, no.

318
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:52.110
Richelle Direny: No.

319
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.330
Richelle Direny: Children.

320
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.730
Brittany Dingess: No.

321
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.370
Brittany Dingess: As far as

322
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:10.650
Brittany Dingess: My husband had testicular cancer when we got married. And as far as we know, he can't. I mean, he became have to learn

323
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.330
Brittany Dingess: And

324
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.540
Brittany Dingess: I had always wanted to adopt.

325
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.230
Brittany Dingess: Because I carry

326
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.180
Brittany Dingess: A rare blood disease, a rare genetic blood disease.

327
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:35.490
Brittany Dingess: It's it's a dominant type of disease. So it wouldn't matter if he carries it or not. If I have a child. It's going to have that disease and

328
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.710
Brittany Dingess: It's similar to with this. It's called balancing Mia.

329
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:54.030
Brittany Dingess: It's not a common one is it runs into like a lot of Middle Eastern bloodlines, but that's not where I got it from. I got it from my great grandfather was 100% Native American

330
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.650
Richelle Direny: He

331
00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:03.930
Brittany Dingess: And it runs the Native American bloodlines. And most of the time, children that are born with it. Don't live past infancy.

332
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.580
Brittany Dingess: So,

333
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.910
Richelle Direny: Well, here you are full grown adult

334
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:28.740
Brittany Dingess: I carry it. But my mother has it and she is. I mean, she's had I mean so many health problems. It's ridiculous. And like they told my grandmother when my mother was little that she wouldn't live past 10 years old. Wow, you

335
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:33.450
Richelle Direny: You say you have siblings.

336
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.370
Richelle Direny: You say you have siblings, I

337
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:35.850
Know,

338
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.870
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

339
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.430
Brittany Dingess: My family. I'm an only child on my mother's side.

340
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.410
Brittany Dingess: My siblings.

341
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.060
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

342
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:55.440
Brittany Dingess: Just, I don't think I could deal with like mentally and emotionally cope with losing a child.

343
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:06.840
Brittany Dingess: So that's why I'm not ever plus that I was, you know, even though through like the worst part of my addiction and promiscuity and everything else.

344
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:17.100
Brittany Dingess: I did always at least have like I was in the frame of mind that you know realized that I was not capable caring for a child in the state that I was in.

345
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.290
Brittany Dingess: So I always stayed on birth control, just so I wouldn't get pregnant because

346
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:32.220
Brittany Dingess: You know, I know, in the worst part of my addiction. I was an IV drug user and everything else. And I just, I knew even through

347
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:44.640
Brittany Dingess: You know the haze of the drugs. I was on. I still always knew that I definitely didn't, you know, I could kidney care for myself. So I definitely knew that I couldn't care for child.

348
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.260
Richelle Direny: Okay.

349
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:47.760
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

350
00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:53.730
Richelle Direny: You have to have you have any history of substance of suicide attempts.

351
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:56.460
Brittany Dingess: Um,

352
00:47:59.220 --> 00:47:59.730
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

353
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:01.920
Brittany Dingess: Why

354
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:03.420
Brittany Dingess: But

355
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:09.450
Brittany Dingess: The two times I mean I legitimately tried was

356
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.060
Brittany Dingess: The end result of some issues with

357
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:29.940
Brittany Dingess: Some anti the antipsychotics, they had me on at the time, which was that correct, sir. And they me on Xanax and their fur coat and it was those I purchase or just didn't never

358
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.580
Brittany Dingess: It something in it would make me. You know, I'd be fine. Most of the time.

359
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:49.980
Brittany Dingess: Everyone wants in a while, I would just totally, like, I wouldn't remember doing it, but I mean I just cut myself or I would kind of like freak out. And that's what happened. The two main times where I had to go get else I'll stitch.

360
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.330
Brittany Dingess: They never they didn't keep me or anything, because I was a huge had a history of cutting anyway.

361
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.910
Brittany Dingess: But you know it'd be like for a few minutes. I would just

362
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:13.530
Brittany Dingess: It felt like the whole world was caving in on me and I didn't know how to deal with it. And I would want to kill myself and try and I'll get myself up and then they were

363
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:29.190
Brittany Dingess: The one time I was on the phone with the suicide crisis hotline and they GPS where I was at and came and kick my door down and took me to the emergency room and they sold me up and get me back home.

364
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:46.830
Brittany Dingess: Because I'd be like that for a few minutes and then I'd be fine. Again, you know, I wouldn't really been remember do, and most of it. So I was on for except for a few years and then I was on Sarah will for like four or five years.

365
00:49:48.420 --> 00:50:01.710
Brittany Dingess: And it just got to the point where it didn't really work anymore. Like I don't take it and it just just stopped working and I had me on the max max out at 800 milligrams a day. Yeah, so

366
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.390
Richelle Direny: Um, were you, you were born and raised in Tennessee.

367
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:17.820

443
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.990
Blowing up your

444
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.030
Richelle Direny: Individually

445
00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:50.670
Richelle Direny: I'm saying it's a, it's a, it's been a while since we've met in the

446
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:52.080
Chris Padrutt: I'm sorry.

447
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.830
Richelle Direny: I'm just looking at to go over

448
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:14.760
Richelle Direny: You haven't been outside, outside of bright heart do you are you going, where are you ever going to

449
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:16.860
Richelle Direny: outside groups.

450
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:23.550
Chris Padrutt: I tried that.

451
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:31.350
Chris Padrutt: For this, it was more for the sleep thing. I started looking for a psychiatrist and

452
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.380
Chris Padrutt: The way my insurance covers

453
00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.110
Chris Padrutt: The people around you know just

454
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.880
Chris Padrutt: Just wasn't working for me so

455
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.110
Chris Padrutt: But my anxieties gone down a lot.

456
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.830
Chris Padrutt: Being able to sleep sublet now so

457
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.580
Chris Padrutt: Seroquel that she gave me

458
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:01.920
Chris Padrutt: I've been playing with a yeah that was a dread on it and

459
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:09.090
Chris Padrutt: It puts me out for a good three or four hours and

460
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.860
Chris Padrutt: But I still, you know, have the same problems with my shoulders and

461
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:24.720
Chris Padrutt: So I'm still going through the insurance crap with that you know they want me to do a bunch of physical therapy before they're doing my eyes and all that crap so

462
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.660
Richelle Direny: You're right.

463
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.290
Richelle Direny: And that's been under control, for the most part.

464
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:41.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and given that your anxiety is decreased on a lot now that you're getting sleep. Do you feel that your diabetes has is also under control, you

465
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.190
Chris Padrutt: Know, less stressful, you know, stress that to it so

466
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.060
Chris Padrutt: Stressed out that

467
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:52.530
Chris Padrutt: Helps

468
00:58:55.950 --> 00:59:01.980
Richelle Direny: And I also know, this is what I also knows. Remember, the one thing that I always talk to you about our say to you when we would meet

469
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.550
Chris Padrutt: What about smaller than

470
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.520
Richelle Direny: What after the other.

471
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.640
Chris Padrutt: I picked it up a couple times, but

472
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.430
Richelle Direny: It was one after the other. And I'm like, my god, are you anxious

473
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.660
I

474
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:31.680
Chris Padrutt: I have a habit of doing it when I talk to people. Anyway, I'll always my son actually copies me doing it like when he gets on the phone, they'll, they'll go outside and walk back and forth on the

475
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:45.540
Chris Padrutt: wraparound porch White House people on the phone. Same thing I do. But I don't know it's just something being on the phone or doing this or something. I'm always smoking or want to walk around.

476
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:51.630
Richelle Direny: You never you weren't really even because there were times where we were. And we were in a session you are outside

477
00:59:52.590 --> 01:00:01.230
Richelle Direny: But I noticed when you sit down, you were always smoking number like he hasn't picked up a cigarette yet. And so, so that is definitely

478
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.640
Richelle Direny: A sign that you are getting some sleep and things are are

479
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:22.920
Richelle Direny: going a little bit better. Now let me ask you now, given that it's been a while. And I know like now that work is picking up and at least you being able to help around because I know back then you were kind of try and try and for yourself, find different ways to

480
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:38.040
Richelle Direny: generate some type of income because I know your girlfriend was the one mainly working and having the issues with the insurance company and what have you. Now, do you have you gotten in contact with your kids or no, or that's still kind of the same.

481
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.200
Chris Padrutt: My still kind of the same.

482
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.450
Chris Padrutt: She does a lot of shit, every time.

483
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.580
Chris Padrutt: I'm a contact show pretend to play nice but

484
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.790
Chris Padrutt: She does. She had to affect the kids.

485
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.290
Chris Padrutt: That

486
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:03.450
Richelle Direny: I just

487
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.360
Richelle Direny: Saying that in the last six months you've tried reaching out

488
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:09.540
Chris Padrutt: No, not, not, not in the last six months, but

489
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.810
Chris Padrutt: I've gone through periods, you know,

490
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:19.380
Chris Padrutt: Weight loss. Try it again, wait six months, try you know it was five years ago, you know,

491
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.760
Chris Padrutt: Six or seven years of doing is now so

492
01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:25.920
Chris Padrutt: This

493
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:33.720
Chris Padrutt: Is the same you know therapists help when I do talk to them, you know, but

494
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.030
Richelle Direny: I've been a bit

495
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:41.970
Chris Padrutt: Like your court systems, you know, ain't real helpful, you know, of course.

496
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:57.120
Richelle Direny: I mean, you know, like you said, end of the day, it is her call or her choice or in terms of what ultimately happens to some degree. Anyway, or choice. But now, did you ever find you. Have you been following up with the psychiatrists

497
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.320
Now,

498
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:04.680
Chris Padrutt: Around it, you know, it's Medicaid. So they're sending me a bunch of holes in the walls that

499
01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:11.130
Chris Padrutt: The people don't even want to be there. So they pay no attention.

500
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:17.970
Chris Padrutt: To two sessions that are my guide and I've tried somebody else and

501
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:26.010
Richelle Direny: I know I don't I don't know when. But I do know that is something that

502
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:40.350
Richelle Direny: I've even spoken to do right hard about the idea of bringing on, you know, the idea of having a psychiatry is only because you know there's a lot of people who have co occurring.

503
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:54.390
Richelle Direny: Disorder with the substance abuse and mental health issues. And so to make that a little bit, you know, easy or, you know, more accessible, especially when patients have issues with trying to

504
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.870
Richelle Direny: Find a psychologist in the community.

505
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:15.810
Richelle Direny: You know having someone here and my heart. So, you know, we have, you know, the medical doctors been having a nurse practitioners now. So a psychiatry, but I guess, you know, everything has to go through the regulation of each state so

506
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.100
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, that's a yes no

507
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.250
Richelle Direny: You got to state.

508
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.880
Chris Padrutt: You go to go to the nurse practitioner before they even talk

509
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.250
Chris Padrutt: To a psychiatrist.

510
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:32.880
Richelle Direny: Exactly so. But now that and I think that be maybe more people will be more

511
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:37.050
Richelle Direny: Willing to of course with the telemedicine.

512
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.620
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, I think, I think that would be perfect for that, you know,

513
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:52.110
Richelle Direny: Yes, because you have you have so many. I mean, now that they opened the floodgate I would think that this is one of the things that you may have psychiatrists, because the thing is with psychiatrists

514
01:03:52.560 --> 01:04:00.390
Richelle Direny: Outside of medical doctor. I mean, well, they are medical doctors, but the thing with psychiatrists in comparison to your general practitioner.

515
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:06.930
Richelle Direny: You're really just sitting there having a conversation. Okay, my medication is this. This is what's new. You know, it's just the conversation.

516
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:14.100
Richelle Direny: And then they say, okay, well I'll prescribe you this, and then you go on your way. So I would think that this is a

517
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:30.180
Richelle Direny: And again, you know, that's just what I will do that. This is a great platform to do it through telemedicine and maybe once in a while they do look at impatient visit if or not impatient in office visit me if needs be,

518
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:40.920
Richelle Direny: But hopefully, especially what psychiatry, you will get more psychiatrists that's more willing to come on board to do this.

519
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.140
Richelle Direny: To at least make it a little bit more convenient for the patients who

520
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:55.350
Chris Padrutt: I'VE SEEN I'VE SEEN A TV commercial for they already have some great medicating don't take don't take Medicaid

521
01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:15.510
Richelle Direny: With all with all of this Medicaid seems to have been they have lifted certain things are met again. Every state is very different because Medicaid is based on the state. It's not based on it's not federal it's, it's, you know, it's local government each state. So, um,

522
01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:27.600
Richelle Direny: So hopefully, I would think that it would be a good thing to do, but I mean, for right now you're saying that the circle has helped. It's that it helps with sleep.

523
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:37.350
Chris Padrutt: So, at least as it leaves me a little groggy, like I really hate the next day grogginess and it's a lot harder to get you up in the morning.

524
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.000
Chris Padrutt: But

525
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.780
Chris Padrutt: You know, I have gone to see psychiatrist and I've tried probably

526
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.820
Chris Padrutt: 10 to 15 different antidepressants and stuff.

527
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:52.950
Chris Padrutt: Man.

528
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.530
Chris Padrutt: Nothing's ever

529
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.660
Chris Padrutt: Worked for

530
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:02.910
Chris Padrutt: Getting any kind of sleep, then this the first time.

531
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:11.400

610
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:58.860
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's that that's a bit much, because then you don't want to get sick, you're, you're going to get sick when you're doing that, you're going overboard with it.

611
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:10.080
Richelle Direny: I mean, that's good that you're not necessarily overly fearful or you're not, you know, overly stressed over

612
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.240
Chris Padrutt: Stuff, we should

613
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:19.710

614
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Chris Padrutt: The old days, I'm sure. Like, that's what this will happen.

615
01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:40.110
Chris Padrutt: You know, ask that corporations. Hey, I know you don't build ventilators, but you want to try it, see if you can build some for us. I mean, it's some stupid shit. I mean, I'm glad to try to help, but there should be a government for spots, you know,

616
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:49.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yeah, no, I definitely, I definitely hear that and I, I have to say that I agree with you know

617
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:54.510
Chris Padrutt: Employ the unemployed people, you know, put them in factories, build a chip. I mean,

618
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.600

619
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:11.010

620
01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.750
Richelle Direny: No real stressors, nothing like that you're

621
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:23.070
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of maintaining now you do go to group what once we still come to group once a week, or did not

622
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:26.880
Richelle Direny: Okay. She won't lose you to every other week.

623
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:32.010
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, she's got me on a month on the refill. But coming every other week.

624
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.390
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. I think she did say that she's not necessarily

625
01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:50.100
Richelle Direny: The monthly she just feels like to stay connected. I believe she said you know she really prefers like the every other week. And you know, I think that I think overall, we can meet

626
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:51.510
Chris Padrutt: Know whether it's once a

627
01:15:51.510 --> 01:16:04.710
Richelle Direny: Month for, you know, maybe once every other month we can just check into just kind of see how everything is going, you know what, let me say once a month, because I think Dr. Jason really truly likes just the just getting that extra support.

628
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.860
Richelle Direny: You know, especially when you're on.

629
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:17.340
Richelle Direny: Especially when you're on the Suboxone treatment.

630
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.460
Richelle Direny: You want you the

631
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:22.290

634
01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.780

Chris Padrutt: Just about put me in tears, is that it gets that bad.

640
01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.430
Chris Padrutt: And it's weird because I can stand up and it'll go away.

641
01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.640
Chris Padrutt: Well, totally go away, it'll just go away. But as soon as I laid back down.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:57.960
Richelle Direny: I mean, listen, I you know I know some people are not the biggest fan of physical therapy.

649
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.830
Richelle Direny: Because they're like, it puts you in more pain than you know you came in with by well

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.890
What's yeah

01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:06.930
Brittany Mount: I came over here to do my meeting and help my daughter with their homework and sleeps killer to see my parents.

775
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:14.520
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, now. So tell me what has been different in terms of after we have met the last time.

776
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:21.960
Richelle Direny: I know that your medication had gotten stolen by your daughter's father and

777
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:27.990
Richelle Direny: It kind of have caused a little bit of rift between you and your boyfriend, because he was at your house.

778
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:41.790
Brittany Mount: Yet he hasn't been back around and we everything. I mean, things have been one pretty smooth like he can understand like it wasn't really my it was my fault because I let him go, but

779
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:49.410
Brittany Mount: Like, I don't know. We're getting along now like everything's fine there and everything's pretty much back to the normal

780
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:55.260
Brittany Mount: I just me and maybe that don't speech or I haven't talked to him.

781
01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:01.170
Brittany Mount: Yet, I'll call your kid or nothing. So he's out there.

782
01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:08.700
Richelle Direny: Now one of the things that we talked about during that little session, we had was that, um,

783
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:27.360
Richelle Direny: Because you and you would went out to go you know purchase it, you know, outside or what have you. Because of the fact that you had just gotten the film had gotten stolen. And so we had talked about kind of the sequence of events that led up to it and I kind of, you know, asked

784
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:41.730
Richelle Direny: If your goal is to eventually taper off of it. What is different now in terms of the time that you've been sober. What is different. What was different. Now, in conjunction

785
01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:59.820
Richelle Direny: Like how is it different in terms of how you sought after getting the medication in comparison to your time in active addiction and you said, Well, you know, you were able to kind of correlate the two. So, you know, did you have time to process that to me.

786
01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:02.070
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I'm

787
01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:18.000
Brittany Mount: I mean, I'm like back to like my normal like schedule eight like my out, you know, running the streets are none of that like everything's pretty much back to normal.

788
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.940
Brittany Mount: I don't know the whole

789
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:28.440
Brittany Mount: I don't even know like

790
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.510
Brittany Mount: Everything's just going to

791
01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:30.990
Brittany Mount: Say like

792
01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:42.120
Richelle Direny: It's not to say that you're running the streets. I'm just talking about in terms of you taking an introspective look about you know

793
01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:42.900
Your

794
01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:56.010
Richelle Direny: And kind of what was, what was the thoughts and the feelings surrounding you being a difficult situation and being able to pull yourself out of it.

795
01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:01.890
Brittany Mount: My anxieties definitely back down. Like, I'm not stressing and I'm

796
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:05.970
Brittany Mount: Like freaking out, you know, I mean, all that stuff like

797
01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:16.380
Brittany Mount: It was bad, like that will two weeks was rough and I did not like it at all. But like, Yeah, I know.

798
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:21.180
Brittany Mount: I want to, like, I want to be off the I want to get off Suboxone like

799
01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:25.020
Brittany Mount: Probably within a year.

800
01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.240
Brittany Mount: Yeah. So yeah.

801
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.240
Richelle Direny: But, but

802
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.500
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of were you diagnosed with anxiety disorder.

803
01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:38.040
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I got it and depression.

804
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.010
Brittany Mount: Do you take medication for the

805
01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:58.380
Brittany Mount: Writing. Now, I used to like when I went to prison. I see a psychologist and their stuff and they like prescribed me stuff. And whenever I came home, I went, seeing the doctor, a few times but like I stopped taking it all and

806
01:37:00.570 --> 01:37:14.640
Brittany Mount: I haven't took it for a while, really. I don't know what they was given me in prison health when I came home, I didn't want to give me what they give me their first. I don't know. Do you want to put me on um

807
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.390
Brittany Mount: I forget the name of it.

808
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:21.570
Brittany Mount: I was on it until about

809
01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:32.850
Brittany Mount: Last summer, probably, it's probably been almost a year since I've been on it and I'm really haven't had a whole lot of like

810
01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:38.160
Brittany Mount: I haven't had like many bad panic attacks or anxiety or anything.

811
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:57.270
Brittany Mount: Until like the last like few months, like I've noticed a lot like here recently, last couple months that like it's picking back up again that for a while. Like I was fine, like I'm doing good. And didn't really need it or didn't think I needed it. But now it's like kicking back in

812
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.180
Richelle Direny: And

813
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:10.380
Richelle Direny: OK, so maybe what we need to start doing is that each time we meet, we kind of started talking about like certain

814
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.710
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of going over the

815
01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:23.580
Richelle Direny: Your sequence of events of the days or of the week, kind of like talk about and, you know, any kind of anxiety provoking events and how you were able to

816
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:28.590
Richelle Direny: You know, what was the source of the anxiety and how

817
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:50.220
Richelle Direny: Were you emotionally and mentally able to get through it. What was some thoughts going on through your mind. So because, I mean, until you do that to successfully say that you want to come off of medication is going to be hard because your, your, your active way of coping with it is through

818
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:55.170

Brittany Mount: Awesome. Yeah, down. I don't know. It just like

832
01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:07.200
Brittany Mount: Took over me for a minute. Like I wouldn't your five minutes like I didn't usually talk to her. And I was like, What is wrong with you and I don't know.

833
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:09.660
Richelle Direny: What down

834
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:11.010
Yeah.

835
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.630
Brittany Mount: How long does it look like I couldn't breathe and all this. I'm like, Oh my gosh, what is going on, I'm Dan

836
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:28.800
Richelle Direny: And then you, you enter somewhat of a confrontational relationship where you guys get confrontational.

837
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:40.020
Brittany Mount: Yeah, cuz she stays on the schema and LIKE SHE JUST ONCE YOU TALK TO YOU, she when she talks to me. She's always just got like this attitude like

838
01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:56.370
Brittany Mount: I run her wife and I did all you know i mean she can't she won't let the past go at all and just started up in your face 24 seven yeah I don't come over here much, but when I do

839
01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.270
Brittany Mount: We don't stay long. A couple hours tops.

840
01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:01.440
That's

841
01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.600
Richelle Direny: Someone who

842
01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:15.330
Brittany Mount: I mean, yeah. Well, usually it's like I see here that long LeBron like other people here to it kind of keeps the distraction away from me and her

843
01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:32.040
Brittany Mount: He brings his kids over like on Sundays to see one long some, like, not every weekend but here every other weekend will say something like that.

844
01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:48.720
Brittany Mount: And that's usually when I come over when everybody else is here. So the distractions. It's not between me and her, you know, I mean, there's other people and it keeps the competition between me and her down just she just i don't know i i guess i run her whole life.

845
01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:53.580
Brittany Mount: For the last 10 years or 17 years or however

846
01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:14.610
Richelle Direny: I mean, and I'm sure that that's years of, you know, different things in terms of the relationship that you have with her that's years of that. And so I'm gonna take a while for you to be able to work through it and

847
01:42:14.610 --> 01:42:16.260
Brittany Mount: understanding and knowing that

848
01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.750
Richelle Direny: You know you have control of what

849
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.040
Richelle Direny: You say,

850
01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:25.800
Richelle Direny: Or

851
01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.270
Brittany Mount: You know,

852
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:33.600
Richelle Direny: When to walk away when to say when to say something and when not to say something and

853
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:49.590
Richelle Direny: Being able to good be a good assessor of your the fireman in the situation and knowing when it's not going to the interaction is going to go in a way that's going to give you increased anxiety.

854
01:42:50.430 --> 01:43:11.190
Brittany Mount: Right. Yeah. Well, when I first like dot clean and what's going on over here, different stuff like I it was bad, but I kind of learned. Yeah, I had to learn to walk away from or just get away from or just go outside, do something, anything to take the tension now between us.

855
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:19.710
Brittany Mount: If I have to leave or whatever. But I mean it's gotten easier. Over time, but there's still days that

856
01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:23.160
Brittany Mount: Still not good.

857
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:28.320
Richelle Direny: You said you're still there. So days when it's still not good.

858
01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:30.570
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

859
01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:45.120
Brittany Mount: When she's super drunk and I come over and not knowing that she's like, I'll usually call before I come, and I can tell her voice like how drunk. She is. But sometimes I underestimated and come over, anyway.

860
01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.540
Brittany Mount: She's gone to the land and soon as I walked through the door. It's

861
01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.290
Brittany Mount: Starts just anything

862
01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:02.850
Brittany Mount: How her day was so hard and she's gonna come home and do take out my grandma's

863
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.760
Brittany Mount: With she's got a lot on our actual

864
01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:12.870
Brittany Mount: But my dad put extra my mother and she's got a lot on her shoulder stuff but

865
01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:30.180
Brittany Mount: I try to help as much as I can. But whenever I come over and y'all should want to do is dog me and say, you know, I mean, just, I cannot. Why, hello. Why, why to come over and help her, and I'm just being treated like crap. Hold on, I'm here. So,

866
01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:39.660
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, you know, and like I said, you know, when it comes out to your parents. It's a little harder.

867
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:41.160
Brittany Mount: Because you have a little bit more

868
01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.930
Richelle Direny: Compassion for them, you know, yes you are frustrated

869
01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:47.550
Richelle Direny: Yes, you do. They get you're

870
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:48.420
Brittany Mount: Really angry.

871
01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:48.990
Yes.

872
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:56.520
Richelle Direny: Simply because of the role that they play in our lives.

873
01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.680
Brittany Mount: And right one.

874
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:12.210
Richelle Direny: And I know the importance of, you know, still wanting to stay connected with your dad and the relationship that your daughter has with them.

875
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.370
Brittany Mount: Right, maybe

876
01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:17.310
Richelle Direny: So you know what

877
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.540
Richelle Direny: It's all about

878
01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:01.740
Brittany Mount: It took me back to the screen. Hold on.

879
01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:03.540
Brittany Mount: Okay.

880
01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:20.970
Richelle Direny: You're breaking up. I know, since you moved you started

881
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but you, you start to hear me.

882
01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:31.560
Richelle Direny: I can hear you now. When you move

883
01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.670
Brittany Mount: Back in the same spot.

884
01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:36.990
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I had to walk in the door.

885
01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:41.010
Brittany Mount: I had to walk inside real class to grab the charger and I was trying to plug it up and

886
01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:50.280
Brittany Mount: There's a port outside right here so sharp look it up and it's like face. I don't know the opposite direction.

887
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:55.020
Brittany Mount: I had the code base that way. So it cut out for a minute.

888
01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:05.190
Richelle Direny: No, that's fine. You're okay. So, yeah. So I think we have a little bit more compassion and, you know, we're a little bit more tolerant of certain things because of the fact

889
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.270
Brittany Mount: Of the role that they play in

890
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.750
Brittany Mount: Our lives.

891
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:07.470
Like

892
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:16.590
Richelle Direny: You're more tolerant of your parents and, you know, the things that they do, then you would be of your siblings, because of the rule.

893
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.170
Brittany Mount: Or the significance that they have

894
01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:31.890
Brittany Mount: You're a lot more. I know I put her through hell like and I you know I mean like I i feel bad for a while. So if I have done so I tried to, like, come over and do as much as I can for and help her out and

895
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.870
Brittany Mount: It's just some days. Yes, yes.

896
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:41.160
Richelle Direny: Sometimes, where it's a little bit more difficult than others.

897
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.970
Right.

898
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.380
Richelle Direny: So,

899
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:49.290
Brittany Mount: Are you going to children place to where you're at.

900
01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:50.760
Richelle Direny: How

901
01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:57.660
Brittany Mount: Are you like you guys like in a shelter in place or anything like that home order.

902
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:04.020
Richelle Direny: Not quite. I mean, they asked that because this is this is not my I have another job.

903
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.100
Richelle Direny: So,

904
01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.570
Brittany Mount: What I do they consider me

905
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:09.300
Richelle Direny: So I still

906
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.860

920
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:22.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, but I've been making adjustments as people change or whatever the situation is

921
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.150
Brittany Mount: Right, making

922
01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:36.870
Brittany Mount: Yeah, it's been a little hectic with that stuff going on like my boyfriend who works at a power plant, and they tried to mandate them to get like

923
01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:48.450
Brittany Mount: I don't know, firstly was going to make them stay at the plant like daddy campers or whatever. Stay there. And then they change that and told him that I would just go home will call you when it's all this is over.

924
01:49:49.050 --> 01:50:04.050
Brittany Mount: Well, then they call this morning and trying to pack, his bags, he was going to Chicago, and he's like, I can't go to Chicago, like I got, I just didn't want to go because all this going on and all that and

925
01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:15.930

926
01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:33.600
Brittany Mount: Different stuff with that. But he shut down right now. My mom, she works at the hospital so everything's been kind of crazy trying to help with my grandmother and making sure everybody's straight and not getting sick and trying to stay away from everybody as much as possible, but

927
01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.940
Brittany Mount: Parents house live in cabinet come here more often than I normally do.

928
01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.090
Brittany Mount: I mean, here we got polar

929
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.570
Brittany Mount: What are you going

930
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.720
Richelle Direny: For your own self care.

931
01:50:55.020 --> 01:51:12.210
Brittany Mount: Well, they are still having our na na meetings, they're still doing her in a meetings. We're just doing it outside and like staying six feet apart and all that, like, we still are doing our groups. I don't know if we're supposed to be, but we are and

932
01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:24.030
Brittany Mount: Then doing that and just like journaling or just taking a walk or like a man walking down the store every day just to like, get some fresh air, you know, house.

933
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:28.500
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay that's good now.

934
01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:36.930
Richelle Direny: Let's go to me taking walks up, there's not a whole lot of people on the road, walking, because for the most part, everybody is shut in right

935
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.810
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah. Yep.

936
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:46.650
Brittany Mount: Okay. I mean, you will. What will have to go out and like people's love to go out and like walk their dog or

937
01:51:47.190 --> 01:52:02.640
Brittany Mount: You know, I mean, there were a lot of out but it's like it's not a, like a mandatory. You have to stay in shelter, but they're asking us basically like if you do have stay in. If you don't have to go out like that needs to be essential, and

938
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.810
Brittany Mount: There's no mean if you have to go out, try to stay six feet apart from everybody and all that stuff.

939
01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:13.410
Richelle Direny: Okay.

940
01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:20.250
Brittany Mount: My mom, she works at the hospital. So like when she comes in, she strips down

941
01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:31.920
Brittany Mount: Before she walks in, like walks in the door and likely cut like she has stuff out like our bet my dad's back porch closed in, and

942
01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:39.810
Brittany Mount: She has like to put everything she needs for after work out there before she goes and then like, you know, I mean,

943
01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:42.540
Brittany Mount: yourself up.

944
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.680
Brittany Mount: Comes in and takes like straight to the shower.

945
01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.860
Brittany Mount: Yeah, she would like to work in right there with us.

946
01:52:54.780 --> 01:53:10.020
Brittany Mount: If we only had one case that are like positive case come up in our town or county and like we live out in the country. So it's going to probably be later before it hits the like World boards that

947
01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:22.410
Brittany Mount: hasn't hit us yet, but they've had a lot of people coming in like test and like to see if they have it or whatever, like possibility cases or whatever, but there's only been one confirmed case.

948
01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:28.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Well that's, I mean, that's good.

949
01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.340
Brittany Mount: It's good. Yeah.

950
01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:34.830
Richelle Direny: Areas, but it's not a whole lot of cases, then, you know, that's good.

951
01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:38.190
Brittany Mount: For people are I mean little listen for the most part.

952
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:47.010
Brittany Mount: Trying to, you know, stay away from everybody gets the inside so hopefully this all just flows over

953
01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:49.530
Brittany Mount: What is it

954
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:51.630
Richelle Direny: Your daughter is being homeschooled.

955
01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:54.390
Brittany Mount: Yeah, they're out I think

956
01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:01.200
Brittany Mount: They said the last week of April. Now, so they probably aren't going to go back to school.

957
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:04.200
Richelle Direny: You said the last week of April, May move it.

958
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:05.550
Yeah.

959
01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:21.420
Brittany Mount: That's what I heard today, I don't. I haven't heard anything from the school yet, but somebody told me that they moved it out till April, like the last week of April, I guess for Ohio, unless you're genuine

960
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:24.510
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, might as well just

961
01:54:25.590 --> 01:54:26.400
Richelle Direny: Stay working

962
01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:34.740
Brittany Mount: The rest of the yeah yeah cuz we don't want to have like two, three weeks of school if they do go back, might as well just do it at home.

963
01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:38.040
Richelle Direny: So how was your daughter on adjusting to

964
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:43.200
Brittany Mount: She wants to play alive.

965
01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:58.350
Brittany Mount: She bucking a lot that I mean she does it. But you just got to get her in the mood and just take it slow. Don't push her too much like I told us talking to her teacher calls once a week and checks loner and

966
01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:16.680
Brittany Mount: They like call it like they they're sending food home to the kids if they needed and like the schools are really helping out a lot around here for the kids like there if you need something you can text them or call them and they'll like guide you through it help you

967
01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:26.130
Brittany Mount: Some stuff, but I'm like, I can't, I don't even know if he's only in fourth grade. I don't know what order.

968
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:32.340
Richelle Direny: Let me look to see when I can schedule you for next month. Right.

969

Richelle Direny: Okay. So then let's do Wednesday at six o'clock.

974
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.230

Richelle Direny: April 15th.

01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:08.010
Okay.

Richelle Direny: Okay.

You

984
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:24.780
Richelle Direny: And hopefully everything will be almost close to normality by then.

985
01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:26.070
Right.

986
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.770
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I'm praying

987
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:35.940
Richelle Direny: Next, yes, yes, we all need to. All right, then I have another person coming in for a session. Okay.

988
01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:36.780
Brittany Mount: Okay.

989
01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:37.950
Brittany Mount: All right. Thank you.

990
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.540
Richelle Direny: You're welcome. Bye bye.

991
01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:48.300
Richelle Direny: Hey, Josh.

992
01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:01.860
Richelle Direny: I'm good. I'm guessing you're seeing something real nice outside

993
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:06.300
Joshua Polkow: No, I was talking to a buddy, I'm at the grocery store.

994
01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:11.760
Joshua Polkow: Or all under quarantine so

995
01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.490
Richelle Direny: How are you at the grocery store.

996
01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:26.880
Joshua Polkow: Now, it's not really quarantine. They're just we're under like government, the governor said nine essential travel is prohibited.

997
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.900
Joshua Polkow: And grocery stores are okay.

998
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:33.000
Richelle Direny: That's essential and I

999
01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:42.960
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, that's essential and I still have my job because apparently one time we made a part for an ambulance or something. So we're we're exempt.

1000
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.220
Joshua Polkow: When you empty, empty.

1001
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.930
Joshua Polkow: Phone call I lost you for a second. What did you say

1002
01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.390
Richelle Direny: I said you you're a paramedic.

1003
01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:04.320
Joshua Polkow: Volume

1004
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:08.070
Joshua Polkow: One more time, please.

1005
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.230
Richelle Direny: I think when you get a call it kicks.

1006
01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:11.370
Richelle Direny: Off your volume.

1007
01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:14.550
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, it did. I'm back. I'm back on track. Now,

1008
01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.520
Richelle Direny: No, I said, you said that you, you still work. So you're a

1009
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.440
Richelle Direny: paramedic.

1010
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:25.320
Joshua Polkow: No, I'm not. I work in a factory.

1011
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:26.700
Richelle Direny: Oh,

1012
01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:36.750
Joshua Polkow: Remote automotive parts and apparently at one time. I don't know if we still do, but at one time we made parts for some emergency

1013
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:40.140
Richelle Direny: Just let you know I'm looking at

1014
01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:42.030
Joshua Polkow: You got us they gave us

1015
01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:44.310
Joshua Polkow: But

1016
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:46.200
Richelle Direny: I'm looking at you upside down.

1017
01:58:48.930 --> 01:58:51.150
Joshua Polkow: Is that, now I'm looking up not there it goes.

1018
01:58:52.290 --> 01:58:53.970
Joshua Polkow: Oh my gosh, I'm still upside down.

1019
01:58:58.170 --> 01:59:00.450
Joshua Polkow: As soon as it flips you over it flips meal.

1020
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:02.550
Joshua Polkow: Let's try like this.

1021
01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:12.420
Richelle Direny: So you said that you you work.

1022
01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:17.070
Richelle Direny: The kind of work you do you make what what is your company make

1023
01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:30.300
Joshua Polkow: We make automotive parts I work in a forge so we forge parts big heavy duty steel parts for cars like tie rods or

1024
01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.780
Joshua Polkow: I don't know, different kinds of things like that.

1025
01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:42.900
Joshua Polkow: But they thought they were gonna have to shut us down, and then they got an exemption, because we made

1026
01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:46.440
Joshua Polkow: Some part for an emergency vehicle.

1027
01:59:47.490 --> 01:59:48.960
Joshua Polkow: A Chrysler.

1028
01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:51.660
Joshua Polkow: emergency vehicle.

1029
01:59:54.930 --> 01:59:55.440
Richelle Direny: What kind of

1030
01:59:56.970 --> 01:59:59.610
Joshua Polkow: low bar is what our memo said

1031
02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:13.800
Joshua Polkow: But I don't know if that's something that we make on a regular basis or if because the quality people my fiance works there too. And she asked the quality people if they knew what parts. Those were

1032
02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:22.320
Joshua Polkow: And none of the quality people knew anything about it. They couldn't tell what parts. It was so I don't know if we even really make those things.

1033
02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:44.940
Joshua Polkow: I mean, I'm sure we probably did it one time, but there's been a lot of like small orders stuff that we've had, you know, over the years that we don't really make, but we have made. So it was probably something like that where we just had to make a run of like 1000 parts one time.

1034
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.870
Joshua Polkow: I don't know.

1035
02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:50.670
Richelle Direny: What

1036
02:00:52.050 --> 02:00:52.290
Richelle Direny: Your

1037
02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.820
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, I'm very good.

1038
02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.530
Joshua Polkow: We were not prepared for any of this, and with my probation and everything.

1039
02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:14.940
Joshua Polkow: Pretty much a month in advance.

1040
02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:17.700
Joshua Polkow: All the time.

1041
02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.800
Joshua Polkow: So probation with a

1042
02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:27.480
Joshua Polkow: I don't know. I wouldn't have been in good shape. If I really would have got laid off.

1043
02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:49.350
Joshua Polkow: Well, my tether. For one, I have to pay $70 a week to have my alcohol monitor on and even if I were to get unemployment, I wouldn't get that for you know a couple weeks anyway.

1044
02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.060
Joshua Polkow: So I

1045
02:01:56.970 --> 02:01:57.990
Richelle Direny: Worked out

1046
02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:09.570
Joshua Polkow: I, I imagine. So they took it out of my paycheck today so

1047
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.390
Joshua Polkow: I don't think there's

1048
02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:16.710
Joshua Polkow: I don't think you're waiving the fees for that sort of thing.

1049
02:02:19.650 --> 02:02:20.130
Richelle Direny: I mean,

1050
02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:25.860
Joshua Polkow: I could be wrong. Maybe if I was really awkward if they would have, you know,

1051
02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:27.480
Joshua Polkow: Kind of

1052
02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.990
Richelle Direny: Proof of it that you're not working, but

1053
02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.680
Richelle Direny: One thing that I did suggest to someone else.

1054
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:36.030
Joshua Polkow: Is looking into

1055
02:02:40.050 --> 02:02:40.350
Joshua Polkow: Know,

1056
02:02:40.410 --> 02:02:43.110
Richelle Direny: In light of everything that's going on and working

1057
02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:45.330
Joshua Polkow: So uncertain is

1058
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.440
Richelle Direny: That you can do, whether it's a lower the, the amount that you're paying

1059
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:51.120
Joshua Polkow: Or what is it that

1060
02:02:51.210 --> 02:02:51.870
Can be done.

1061
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:53.730
So,

1062
02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:57.540
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, they might have

1063
02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:00.510
Joshua Polkow: All my other work with me on that.

1064
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:12.840
Joshua Polkow: I don't know. I've wasted a trip to Adrian today, which is like 30 miles from where I live, because I'm supposed to go and have my other downloaded once a week, and they're all closed.

1065
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:21.150
Joshua Polkow: But I asked the guy last week when I was there, if he was going to be closing down or if he was going to stay open. And he said, no, he'll stay open.

1066
02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.450
Joshua Polkow: But now, everything's

1067
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:26.760
Joshua Polkow: Everything's closed down.

1068
02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:31.920
Joshua Polkow: Everything is our jobs.

1069
02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:37.590
Joshua Polkow: There was a little disappointing.

1070
02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:49.170
Joshua Polkow: But I mean, I'm happy that we're not shut down because it would have put us in a financial pickle. What it would have been nice to have Capri software to

1071
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:51.030
Joshua Polkow: Like

1072
02:03:53.970 --> 02:04:00.510
Richelle Direny: It, you know, it's like there's so much there's it will be nice to get a couple weeks off of work with pay with day

1073
02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:01.620
Joshua Polkow: Yes.

1074
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:03.540
Richelle Direny: You got to say that part with thing.

1075
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:10.980
Richelle Direny: Now the soul, Josh. Listen, I haven't seen you in group. I've seen you once in group.

1076
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:21.270
Joshua Polkow: Price. I just missed the last one on the first of this month because the first was like the first Tuesday was like the third or something.

1077
02:04:22.170 --> 02:04:33.870
Joshua Polkow: And I just forgot all about it because it was early in the month and then I was, I was going to try and catch up with you. The next week. But they said that you you don't do it every week like like God did.

1078
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:39.390
Richelle Direny: I was sitting in that my my lonesome.

1079
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:41.490
Joshua Polkow: Really the second Tuesday.

1080
02:04:43.710 --> 02:05:02.370
Joshua Polkow: What the heck yeah the guys that in the main office administration or whatever admissions, whatever. I told him I missed the first one, and I was just going to make up for the next week. And they said, Oh, no, you'll have to wait until the last Thursday or the whatever today is

1081
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:03.960
Richelle Direny: Oh,

1082
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:16.170
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Wow. Well, thank you for letting me know that because I'm going to address somebody about how I sat for two, three or two different weeks that I sat by myself for 30 minutes waiting for someone to show up.

1083
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:17.220
Really

1084
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:21.750
Joshua Polkow: Well, yeah, that's a bummer. I wish I would have known that.

1085
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:25.950
Richelle Direny: Now the what I am going to say

1086
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:31.320
Joshua Polkow: Because I'm having an issue with people coming Tuesday.

1087
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:39.660
Richelle Direny: I guess Dr farago can do the evenings. So I'm wondering if

1088
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:43.140
Joshua Polkow: He could schedule.

1089
02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:47.400
Richelle Direny: On Mondays. When you guys meet with him anyway.

1090
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:52.800
Joshua Polkow: That's not gonna work. I'm at work that I'm at work at that time. Everybody that works.

1091
02:05:53.850 --> 02:05:55.980
Richelle Direny: So the 630 time works better.

1092
02:05:56.850 --> 02:06:03.480
Joshua Polkow: Well for me and probably URL. I don't know if URL is going to be able to take an hour off during lunch you okay

1093
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:12.270
Richelle Direny: Well, I know he just comes once a month, but I, and I know that there were a lot of people just come once a month. And again, I know that I took over from God and it was it was

1094
02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:32.970
Richelle Direny: Different in majority of everyone, you know, they're kind of on a different schedule majority seems to do the once a month. Um, but, you know, I, I am running the group's monthly. I mean, our monthly, weekly at 630 and it is, you know, I get a flood of people on the first

1095
02:06:32.970 --> 02:06:34.290
Joshua Polkow: Tuesday and

1096
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:41.550
Richelle Direny: Then one or two people in between. And then there's some weeks that no one shows up. So if that

1097
02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:50.730
Richelle Direny: Everybody is being told that I don't have group every week that I need to address that because I do have to every single week.

1098
02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:59.010
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, that i mean i don't know if they specifically said that you don't do it every week, but I said that I was just going to catch up with you next week.

1099
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:07.530
Joshua Polkow: Because my scheduled week is the first Tuesday and I missed it. I just forgot all about it that week and I was going to do it. The following week

1100
02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:18.450
Joshua Polkow: Because I had called him to do my drug test or something and I'm they said that. Yeah, they're gonna have to, I'm going to have to wait until today.

1101
02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:30.330
Joshua Polkow: And it's going to be at seven instead of six 630 and so I was under the impression that you didn't do it every week. I wonder if that's what everybody's been told.

1102
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:39.600
Richelle Direny: I'm wondering, wondering because like I said there were two weeks in a row that not be the second this Tuesday and

1103
02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:42.780
Richelle Direny: This time Tuesday. No one showed up.

1104
02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:45.900
Joshua Polkow: No one showed up.

1105
02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:46.590
Oh,

1106
02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:58.560
Richelle Direny: And I know like I sent a list to kind of speak to Dr farago to, you know, just as but I'm gonna from an administrative standpoint, I'm just going to try to follow to

1107
02:07:59.010 --> 02:08:13.680
Richelle Direny: Follow up to see what's going on, why someone would have thought. But yes, I know, I know that God I think for groups. I'm on Mondays, or whatever day she does group. It's a little bit different. So I don't know if they were mixing that up with

1108
02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:22.710
Joshua Polkow: Yeah. Maybe she she she used to do it like Mondays. I think Mondays at

1109
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:32.640
Joshua Polkow: 530 and then she also did a an afternoon, one for people that you know work different shifts or whatever but

1110
02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:32.880
Joshua Polkow: Yeah.

1111
02:08:33.450 --> 02:08:36.870
Joshua Polkow: I don't recall what what that day was or what time that was

1112
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:38.910
Richelle Direny: Well done, yes.

1113
02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:49.860
Richelle Direny: Um, so next so Tuesday. So yes, you know, you can catch up for your next schedule group. Now I did have you scheduled actually

1114
02:08:51.030 --> 02:09:03.990
Richelle Direny: They had you on my calendar as for a medication follow up. So what I had can visit because I'm like, to the medication and follow up. Now, that was your intention was to for a medication.

1115
02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:07.590
Joshua Polkow: No, I know.

1116
02:09:08.250 --> 02:09:17.640
Joshua Polkow: But maybe they because I missed my first one. And so I know if you miss counseling, you know enough times, they won't give you your prescription

1117
02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:24.210
Richelle Direny: Were you meeting with me when you did meet with her.

1118
02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.800
Joshua Polkow: Just once a month.

1119
02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.150
Joshua Polkow: I was on

1120
02:09:27.690 --> 02:09:40.980
Joshua Polkow: I was on once a week for a lot of new know like the first six or eight months I was in the program. But at that time I was on Medicaid and everything was covered by my Medicaid insurance.

1121
02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:54.630
Joshua Polkow: And then I switched over to Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is supposed to be like the best freakin insurance in Michigan, and now I've got a $20 copay for all my stuff on here and a $30 copay for all my prescriptions.

1122
02:09:55.380 --> 02:10:14.700
Joshua Polkow: Even I was paying a $30 copay for eight or seven, eight, a week, and now I'm paying a $30 copay for 14 tues a week, so it doesn't even make a difference. Like how many milligrams. I'm on it. It's just a $30 copay no matter what.

1123
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:17.040
Joshua Polkow: Which is. Oh.

1124
02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:26.730
Richelle Direny: Well yeah, I do see you have a $20 copay doctor and a $20 copay for therapy. So what I guess, go back on.

1125
02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:31.890
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, we think, right.

1126
02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:35.280
Joshua Polkow: That's crazy. I can't

1127
02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:39.750
Joshua Polkow: Hear

1128
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:42.870
Richelle Direny: You started freezing sun.

1129
02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:35.700
Richelle Direny: I guess you drove through a bad patch.

1130
02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:40.050
Joshua Polkow: Yeah. Second, did you hear any of my story.

1131
02:11:43.410 --> 02:11:47.910
Richelle Direny: No, you said you said that, um, what was the last thing that you were saying.

1132
02:11:49.230 --> 02:12:01.890
Joshua Polkow: My insurance got screwed up. I had my job for a couple months and then my mom passed away and I quit my job. So my insurance got canceled and I went back on to Medicaid

1133
02:12:02.970 --> 02:12:06.480
Joshua Polkow: And then I was on Medicaid for like a year.

1134
02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:20.640
Joshua Polkow: And got my job back that same place. I was at before and went back on to Blue Cross Blue Shield well for that whole year. They were charging me billing me as a cash patient

1135
02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:33.630
Joshua Polkow: Because my insurance from the job had lapsed, and they'd never updated hopefully back on my Medicaid thing and never told me about it never was like hey you're

1136
02:12:34.170 --> 02:12:44.820
Joshua Polkow: You know, you're getting the bill. We're billing you you're up to, you know, $100 $200 so fine yeah after a year they sent me a 1600 dollar bill.

1137
02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:49.080
Joshua Polkow: And I was like, whoa, what you know what the heck I talked to Darby

1138
02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:57.600
Joshua Polkow: I talked to Darby, I said I was on Medicaid, he

1139
02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:17.100
Joshua Polkow: Has any problems to let me know because I picked my plan I Medicaid plan specifically for this program because Molina covered everything for this program and he never let me know never seen any cloud, all of a sudden they sent me a sick.

1140
02:13:19.050 --> 02:13:19.980
Joshua Polkow: In my email.

1141
02:13:21.570 --> 02:13:27.000
Joshua Polkow: And I finally got it all straightened out but it took months and then

1142
02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:47.670
Joshua Polkow: You need they were billing me for counseling every week and saying that, you know, you owe us $40 a week and I was like, No, I don't know $20 when they see a doctor and $20 when I do my counseling.

1143
02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:52.140
Joshua Polkow: There I was seeing the doctor every week.

1144
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:59.430
Joshua Polkow: Or but I was still only doing counseling once a month in

1145
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:17.910
Joshua Polkow: Oh man, it was just a bunch of nonsense. I got it all straightened out and now I don't even a through bright heart I pay on that Curio patient portal.

1146
02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:18.990
Yes.

1147
02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:23.910
Richelle Direny: You ended up paying to 1600 dollars.

1148
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:37.980
Joshua Polkow: No, I got that all wiped out because they they contacted my Medicaid and found out that I was covered and I had all the emails and stuff. When I told Darby that you know I am covered if there's any problems, let me know.

1149
02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:43.170
Joshua Polkow: And so I was able to prove that you know that was a mistake on their end

1150
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:53.880
Joshua Polkow: And then I had to fight with them about all those co pays. They said I owed for counseling every week when I wasn't doing counseling every

1151
02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:04.830
Joshua Polkow: Lead and then they charge my card my credit card one time without me checking in.

1152
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:12.480
Joshua Polkow: I didn't check in for a doctor. I checked in for a doctor's visit, but I didn't check in for counseling because I

1153
02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:25.560
Joshua Polkow: Have counseling and they charged my card and it ended up overdraft in my account. And so I just told them, take all my cards on file. I'll just deal with it through that patient portal thing.

1154
02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:45.510
Joshua Polkow: That's it. So I don't. They don't have any of my card information now because they're just, I don't know if it's probably just because everybody's in a different state everybody's, you know, it's everything so spread out that it's hard to keep things straight but

1155
02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:48.390
Joshua Polkow: It was a nightmare for a long time.

1156
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.030
I'm happy that you

1157
02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:05.610
Richelle Direny: My I do agree, sometimes report on something because they have that automatic withdrawal and then next, you know, they started

1158
02:16:07.110 --> 02:16:08.760
Richelle Direny: System error and then are

1159
02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:10.380
Richelle Direny: Coming out of your account.

1160
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:19.590
Joshua Polkow: Home immediately. I've got like a mobile banking app. So I was able to see that it happened right away and

1161
02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:30.120
Joshua Polkow: I contacted them. And I was like, Hey, you guys charge me. I did not authorize that charge. I did not have group today. I need a refund like right now because

1162
02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:46.920
Joshua Polkow: If this, you know, pending transaction goes through. I'm going to get charged $35 and then $5 a day, every day after that and they never did. Or they finally called me back like two days later and was like, oh, we can read week and refund your money.

1163
02:16:48.480 --> 02:17:01.320
Joshua Polkow: But by then, it was you know it was you know I already got charged overdraft fee so it didn't really matter then now it's just like just forget it. Just put it towards my next visit and take all my cards off the file.

1164
02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.740
Joshua Polkow: I don't know. I never did get the overdraft fee paid for but

1165
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:16.410
Joshua Polkow: Because you can't get ahold of billing nobody I can't contact billing, I can send them an email, but they don't ever respond, unless I owe money.

1166
02:17:17.430 --> 02:17:30.210
Joshua Polkow: By all money, they don't email me twice a week. But if I have a complaint or something I don't hear from them at all. I'm trying to call I've tried to know go through admissions or whatever and

1167
02:17:31.350 --> 02:17:38.220
Joshua Polkow: They're just like, Oh, you just got an email Krista at such and such like. Yeah, that's what I did. Five times now.

1168
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:49.140
Richelle Direny: They enter their messages for for for you or your own thing. But anything else.

1169
02:17:51.210 --> 02:17:51.960
Joshua Polkow: Pretty much.

1170
02:17:53.250 --> 02:17:56.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm looking at your notes from the last time you met with

1171
02:17:58.050 --> 02:17:58.620
God

1172
02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:13.740
Richelle Direny: Well, you said that you mean, even in light of everything going on right now. Do you still go to local support groups.

1173
02:18:16.470 --> 02:18:21.390
Joshua Polkow: Cancelled. I just tried to go tonight. Just, just before I got on with you and

1174
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.570
Joshua Polkow: We

1175
02:18:37.650 --> 02:18:37.950
Joshua Polkow: Are here.

1176
02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:39.780
Joshua Polkow: So,

1177
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.390
Joshua Polkow: Oh,

1178
02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.110
Richelle Direny: I mean, I could I could try to

1179
02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:49.020
Richelle Direny: Hear you through it's it's crackling

1180
02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:50.370
You

1181
02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.200
Richelle Direny: How'd I I know now, my understanding is a lot of these

1182
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:57.600
Richelle Direny: April, everything is going online.

1183
02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:35.610
Joshua Polkow: Okay, I'm back. Can you hear me now. Yes. Yeah.

1184
02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:38.010
Richelle Direny: Thank you. I know that a lot of

1185
02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:39.540
Richelle Direny: You go to

1186
02:19:41.850 --> 02:19:43.800
Joshua Polkow: Yes, three times a week.

1187
02:19:44.610 --> 02:19:47.190
Richelle Direny: Now, my understanding is that going online.

1188
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:49.800
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, that's what I was just told

1189
02:19:51.150 --> 02:20:00.480
Joshua Polkow: I ran into somebody at the grocery store, and that's what they said was to go online and then they have instructions or whatever to do it online.

1190
02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:05.580
Joshua Polkow: I haven't had a chance to do that. Yeah, but that's the plan.

1191
02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:12.840
Richelle Direny: And i think i think you know with with this whole thing of everything that's going on. I think that you're going to find a lot more people

1192
02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:15.630
Joshua Polkow: That way.

1193
02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:20.040
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, it seems like

1194
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:30.540
Joshua Polkow: It would be a lot more convenient for people, but I'm required by probation ago so I don't know how I'm gonna get my papers signed

1195
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:37.920
Joshua Polkow: I have to have a, you know, an attendant blog signed by somebody at the meeting.

1196
02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:39.360
Richelle Direny: What I would

1197
02:20:40.110 --> 02:20:41.190
Joshua Polkow: Encourage you to do.

1198
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:44.460
Joshua Polkow: This is what that's the only issue that I'm concerned.

1199
02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:48.990
Richelle Direny: Well, this is what I would encourage you to do because I had someone, and I was talking to someone

1200
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:58.890
Richelle Direny: That I would encourage like you make a list and maybe tomorrow, calling your probation officer, because remember, you're doing what you're doing is being

1201
02:20:58.890 --> 02:21:00.960
Richelle Direny: Proactive you're saying, Listen, I know I'm on

1202
02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:01.590
Joshua Polkow: Probation I

1203
02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:10.560
Richelle Direny: Have my probation. I know everything that I have to do so, um, you know, in light of everything that's going on everybody, you know,

1204
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:13.110
Richelle Direny: Pretty much self quarantining they're closing now.

1205
02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:16.440
Richelle Direny: Is it possible for

1206
02:21:16.470 --> 02:21:18.990
Richelle Direny: If you have a sponsor having your sponsor sign in.

1207
02:21:19.050 --> 02:21:19.620
Richelle Direny: Or

1208
02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:20.790
Joshua Polkow: If there's like a

1209
02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:27.390
Richelle Direny: timestamp or some creative way that you can prove that this is what you are doing three times a week that you are logging on

1210
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:48.240
Richelle Direny: Or you can have if you if you log on, you can have someone said, like the group leader kind of send a little, you know, email to the probation officer saying to confirm that you aren't you weren't actually young. In fact, at the group or the meeting.

1211
02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:56.760
Richelle Direny: Hello.

1212
02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:24.510
Richelle Direny: Josh

1213
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:28.230
Joshua Polkow: Can you hear me. Yes, I can hear you know

1214
02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:39.840
Joshua Polkow: Yeah, I got the gist of what you're saying, I think. And there was a guy at a meeting that said

1215
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:54.480
Joshua Polkow: Even if they do close down and they don't come up with like an online solution. I could just call him, you know, three times a week, we can just talk for an hour or whatever. And he would be willing to sign my paper.

1216
02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.970
Joshua Polkow: That way, at least.

1217
02:23:58.950 --> 02:24:06.930
Joshua Polkow: I have something to show them and he's like the treasurer. So he's like the only person in a that had to like forego their anonymity.

1218
02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:14.160
Joshua Polkow: Not. I mean, he had to have like a background check and a credit jack and all that stuff done to be the treasurer.

1219
02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:23.640
Joshua Polkow: So he said he has no problem doing that, but that was before, you know, they came up with the solution. So,

1220
02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:26.820
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1221
02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:29.400
Joshua Polkow: Now, such

1222
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:31.770
Richelle Direny: It won't be. But I think just

1223
02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:42.510
Richelle Direny: Keeping the police officer in the loop just kind of talking to them and just like and granted I didn't. I've never dealt with adult probation. I've always dealt with on

1224
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:50.070
Richelle Direny: Probation Officers with for us. And I think it's just keeping them in the loop letting them know

1225
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:58.470
Richelle Direny: You know what it is that you're doing. And, you know, seeing if they would work with you and like what it is that you're doing.

1226
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:02.400
Joshua Polkow: To me reading the terms.

1227
02:25:02.430 --> 02:25:05.310
Richelle Direny: Of your permission, what, um, how long are you on formation.

1228
02:25:10.050 --> 02:25:11.640
Joshua Polkow: Until June 20

1229
02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:16.680

1239
02:26:09.210 --> 02:26:13.110
Joshua Polkow: And then I got my DUI. On May 5 of 2018

1240
02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:20.340
Joshua Polkow: Oh,

1241
02:26:20.490 --> 02:26:24.300
Joshua Polkow: I didn't just get a DUI totaled my car.

1242
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.590
Oh,

1243
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:28.230
Joshua Polkow: Did you ever know I did.

1244
02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:29.880
Joshua Polkow: I mean, I

1245
02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:51.330
Joshua Polkow: Know I was seeing Jody at the time. And we did some individual sessions like because of that, but I never went to like a specific concert. And then I started seeing addiction like drug because of my probation. I started seeing a counselor about, you know, drugs and alcohol do

1246
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:55.140
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1247
02:26:56.250 --> 02:26:58.050
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um,

1248
02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:01.200
Joshua Polkow: So I kinda doubt lecture.

1249
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.260
Joshua Polkow: Me.

1250
02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:12.960
Richelle Direny: Know what was the last thing that you said

1251
02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:20.760
Joshua Polkow: I said I never really went to a grief counselor, but I did.

1252
02:27:23.250 --> 02:27:34.830
Joshua Polkow: Talk about it like work through a little bit of the grief. I guess with I call counselors, because I've had like three councillors over the past couple years.

1253
02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:43.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, and how long, so you. How long have you been maintaining your sobriety for the two years since you've been on probation.

1254
02:27:47.370 --> 02:27:54.000
Joshua Polkow: No, I was in the program for like a year. I'm in my alcohol sobriety. Yeah, I got off of

1255
02:27:55.350 --> 02:28:03.600
Joshua Polkow: got off the off of opiates in like 2016 but I was just buying Suboxone on the street.

1256
02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:08.130
Joshua Polkow: And then I decided to join this program. When I found out about

1257
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:08.790
Joshua Polkow: So what I was saying is, I've been in this program for, I think, a little over three years.

1258
02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:11.550
Joshua Polkow: And then I've been

1259
02:30:12.810 --> 02:30:14.100
Joshua Polkow: I quit drinking

1260
02:30:15.810 --> 02:30:21.450
Joshua Polkow: The Friday following the accident. I got into so it was May 11 of

1261
02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:23.550
Joshua Polkow: 18

1262
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:33.660
Joshua Polkow: And I've been completely sober since then. Well, actually I smoked weed, a little bit after that.

1263
02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:38.970
Joshua Polkow: Until like July I think I was smoking pipe to like July.

1264
02:30:40.290 --> 02:30:43.680
Joshua Polkow: But then, I've been completely SOBER SINCE JULY OF 2018

1265
02:30:46.290 --> 02:30:47.580
Joshua Polkow: And

1266
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:51.510
Joshua Polkow: Well, yeah, other than my Suboxone obviously

1267
02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:54.510
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1268
02:30:54.570 --> 02:30:57.660
Joshua Polkow: And then I also before I quit drinking

1269
02:30:59.730 --> 02:31:00.030
Joshua Polkow: I

1270
02:31:01.050 --> 02:31:10.290
Joshua Polkow: quit doing math. I'm July 28 July 30 July 31 of 2017

1271
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:13.350
Joshua Polkow: Because I got

1272
02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:19.410
Joshua Polkow: strung out on that again for like a year and a half.

1273
02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:28.230
Joshua Polkow: I thought that I could handle. I thought things would be different. The next time.

1274
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:43.830
Joshua Polkow: And they never were even drinking. You know I quit drinking for a while and I was like, Oh, well, since I could quit for a while, maybe this time I'll be able to be responsible and no it doesn't work out, I'm an addict. So

1275
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:47.430
Joshua Polkow: I can't use anything responsibly.

1276
02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:50.220
Richelle Direny: But then this is the

1277
02:31:51.330 --> 02:31:52.530
Joshua Polkow: It's good to know.

1278
02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:55.470
In addition to that,

1279
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:59.670
Richelle Direny: I know you said that in over the years, you've had about

1280
02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:00.390
Joshua Polkow: Three counts.

1281
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:03.960
Richelle Direny: How much have you ever worked

1282
02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.530
Through

1283
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:10.260
Richelle Direny: underlining the Court issues of why the relapse was

1284
02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:11.820
Richelle Direny: Patient

1285
02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:24.420
Joshua Polkow: During obviously

1286
02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.100
Richelle Direny: None of. No, I know that.

1287
02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:30.840
Richelle Direny: Was I started seeing a counselor and stuff. I haven't had any relapses

1288
02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:36.240
Richelle Direny: So you're saying, well, I guess that's not true because I started this book.

1289
02:32:39.210 --> 02:32:40.590
Joshua Polkow: You say, Yes, I started this

1290
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:41.520
Program.

1291
02:32:43.530 --> 02:32:44.460
Joshua Polkow: I'm sorry, go ahead.

1292
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:48.570
Richelle Direny: No, I was asking you started this program, three years ago.

1293
02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:59.070
Joshua Polkow: Yes. And then I was continuing to do mass for like the first

1294
02:33:03.330 --> 02:33:04.830
Joshua Polkow: Six or eight months maybe

1295
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:07.440
Joshua Polkow: While you were in the program, then

1296
02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:08.490
Finally,

1297
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:14.100
Joshua Polkow: Yes, while I was in the program, but I never, I never admitted that

1298
02:33:17.970 --> 02:33:20.790
Joshua Polkow: I don't know my fiance things differently.

1299
02:33:22.350 --> 02:33:25.590
Joshua Polkow: I'm not sure. Can you find out when I started this program.

1300
02:33:27.390 --> 02:33:29.340
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I can tell you

1301
02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:33.600
Richelle Direny: What in the. But then that time that you were

1302
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:36.120
Richelle Direny: In the time that you were in the

1303
02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:37.470
Joshua Polkow: Program. You said that

1304
02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:40.440
Richelle Direny: Are few months in the program, you were still using

1305
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:47.040
Joshua Polkow: I thought so. But my fiance doesn't think so.

1306
02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:58.230
Joshua Polkow: Well, yeah, maybe, maybe I was just using

1307
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:03.480
Joshua Polkow: Maybe I was just buying the Suboxone on the street at that point.

1308
02:34:05.490 --> 02:34:13.710
Joshua Polkow: And I wasn't really in the program because I've never failed a drug test program. So, I mean, I couldn't

1309
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.180
Joshua Polkow: I couldn't have been, you know, doing math daily during that time.

1310
02:34:20.910 --> 02:34:28.590
Joshua Polkow: So maybe I was just because I've been on Suboxone for a really long time. When I was buying it on the street.

1311
02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:32.220
Richelle Direny: Wasn't did you

1312
02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.040
Richelle Direny: Know you start in July.

1313
02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:38.430
Joshua Polkow: 11

1314
02:34:38.850 --> 02:34:46.320
Richelle Direny: Thought it was in 2016 2017 July 25 2017

1315
02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:47.520
Joshua Polkow: Oh,

1316
02:34:53.490 --> 02:34:55.230
Joshua Polkow: That's what your stuff says

1317
02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you started in 2017

1318
02:34:57.780 --> 02:34:58.440
Joshua Polkow: Okay, yeah.

1319
02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:13.380
Joshua Polkow: Well then, yeah, that makes sense. That was right. That was the same time I quit doing math, then I stopped doing math on July 31 of 2017 was the last time I did that.

1320
02:35:15.330 --> 02:35:18.210
Richelle Direny: From when you started to when you special. You started

1321
02:35:34.050 --> 02:35:35.010
Richelle Direny: So you started

1322
02:35:36.390 --> 02:35:43.080
Richelle Direny: You started on the 11th of July and you stopped. About two weeks, two and a half weeks later.

1323
02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:03.180
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

1324
02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:24.420
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

1325
02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:40.680
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

1326
02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:52.410
Richelle Direny: I can't hear you.

1327
02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:25.710
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

1328
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:30.630
Joshua Polkow: Yes, I can hear you now. Goodness gracious.

1329
02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:33.570
Richelle Direny: Well, let me let me look at

1330
02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:36.540
We've had a very

1331
02:37:37.770 --> 02:37:40.140
Richelle Direny: Individual session was a very rough one,

1332
02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:49.200
Joshua Polkow: Sure was. Now, with five minutes remaining in the hour.

1333
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:51.810
Joshua Polkow: Let me just, let me look at my

1334
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:54.180
Joshua Polkow: showed up late so day over

1335
02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:56.370
Richelle Direny: No, no, you were actually you were

1336
02:37:56.370 --> 02:37:57.390
Richelle Direny: Okay cuz

1337
02:37:57.870 --> 02:38:01.800
Richelle Direny: Everybody was kind of having to be pushed back a little bit. So you're okay.

1338
02:38:04.890 --> 02:38:12.810
Richelle Direny: Let me, let me look at my calendar and schedule you out for a month and I will stop this very painful session right now.

1339
02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:16.980
Joshua Polkow: Hold on. Okay.

1340
02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:25.110
Richelle Direny: What days are better for you.

1341
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:48.390
Joshua Polkow: Tuesdays are actually. Well, I mean, now it doesn't really well. Everything's supposed to go back to normal. So Tuesdays would be best because I don't have a on Tuesdays, or I don't I don't usually go to a on Tuesdays. Okay. I like it. Also do like Fridays. Let's

1342
02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.400
Richelle Direny: Let's do the 21st at five.

1343
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:56.130
Joshua Polkow: Okay. Is that a Tuesday.

1344
02:38:56.730 --> 02:39:04.200
Richelle Direny: That's a Tuesday. And if we do the 21st at five that date you even if you miss like the first week of

1345
02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:14.010
Richelle Direny: The first the first Tuesday of the month for group, you just won't be able to do group on the same day that you and I meet individually.

1346
02:39:21.450 --> 02:39:23.550
Joshua Polkow: So you want to keep doing individual

1347
02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:25.560
Richelle Direny: Well, no, that's

1348
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:26.280
Joshua Polkow: That group.

1349
02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you do group once a month, right.

1350
02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:35.670
Joshua Polkow: Right. And you're going to do.

1351
02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:39.870
Richelle Direny: We meet into we kind of just check in. Once a month.

1352
02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:48.360
Joshua Polkow: So now I have to do group twice a month or counseling twice a month.

1353
02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:57.660
Richelle Direny: No, no, no. Individually group is different group is different from individually when you were meeting with Jody, how, how was that scheduled. How did you meet with God.

1354
02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:05.910
Joshua Polkow: I just just did once a month on the third Monday of the month.

1355
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:08.070
Joshua Polkow: And that was it.

1356
02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:09.960
Joshua Polkow: And

1357
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:12.450
Joshua Polkow: So what about, I guess I did a couple individuals.

1358
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.600
Joshua Polkow: No. So yeah, that was the group.

1359
02:40:16.050 --> 02:40:19.410
Richelle Direny: So you just met with her just for group. You didn't do individuals with her.

1360
02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:27.480
Joshua Polkow: Not regularly. I mean, I did a couple of times. But no, it was not not regularly.

1361
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.380
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1362

02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:39.270
Richelle Direny: Okay. So then we'll just whenever you feel that you need that extra support, then we'll schedule individual session.

1365
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:44.670
Joshua Polkow: Okay, cool.

02:42:17.010 --> 02:42:18.090
Richelle Direny: You're breaking up very

Jasie Crotinger: Bad. He gave me a headset from go get it. Please hold on a minute.

OK.

1396
02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:21.240
Richelle Direny: I can hear you.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:53.970
Jasie Crotinger: Okay. Is it right now. So, though.

1398
02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:55.920
Richelle Direny: No. Okay.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.920

1400
02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:07.650
Richelle Direny: No, you're, you're okay, you're okay. So how is how is how is everything. How's the homeschooling going

1401
02:44:08.490 --> 02:44:20.520
Jasie Crotinger: And I mean, it's okay. The boys don't really want to do it because they're playing on a games all day, all the time. So it's harder to get them to do it while I'm trying to work at the same time.

1402
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:24.600
Jasie Crotinger: I like I worked both jobs from home now. So

1403
02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:41.790
Jasie Crotinger: I can't really don't have time today to get them on the computer and walk them through a year. I mean, to try to get money coming in the jobs. I have are difficult right now because of the coronavirus not very many people are trying to like find things or you know advertisers, or even

1404
02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:45.210
Jasie Crotinger: Like one of my jobs, like so.

1405
02:44:46.410 --> 02:44:48.660
Jasie Crotinger: Pretty much. I get them to redo the resume.

1406
02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.990
Jasie Crotinger: Or not going to want to do is 37 is

1407
02:44:53.370 --> 02:44:56.070
Jasie Crotinger: Relatively high now or depending on the type of games off.

1408
02:44:59.310 --> 02:45:01.290
Jasie Crotinger: But yeah, not very many people want

1409
02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:06.960
Jasie Crotinger: To buy resumes and stuff. So it's really hard. And then when the work and

1410
02:45:08.490 --> 02:45:17.430
Jasie Crotinger: And Florida and all that was me and like down to like a lot of the companies aren't there. So when I'm calling them to get them to buy spots on prescription bags.

1411
02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:24.960
Jasie Crotinger: Like they're not there for me to get ahold of them back to ain't all this shit down before I can even though with that is is really frustrating.

1412
02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:34.560
Jasie Crotinger: Because every day. I'm trying to get ahold of people and it's like hit or miss. In some people, I can get ahold of it is just depends on if they're in the office, though.

1413
02:45:35.850 --> 02:45:45.690
Jasie Crotinger: Some people are ours in there which identify where it sounds like insurance agencies. I don't see why they would be like that necessity or I mean

1414
02:45:48.570 --> 02:45:49.800
Jasie Crotinger: Like I don't see why that would be

1415
02:45:53.010 --> 02:45:55.440
Jasie Crotinger: Putting me to say open during this time. You mean

1416
02:45:56.550 --> 02:46:00.960
Jasie Crotinger: By this is the one people, the only people really I've been able to get older.

1417
02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:09.630
Jasie Crotinger: Than trying to get it done. But it's been annoying so easy, tell him to stop.

1418
02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:11.520
I'm sorry.

1419
02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:16.110
Jasie Crotinger: I sent her. The one I'm listen. He's been a frickin threat.

1420
02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:20.460
But yeah

1421
02:46:22.050 --> 02:46:24.060
Jasie Crotinger: It's been a difficult

1422
02:46:26.370 --> 02:46:29.160
Jasie Crotinger: Man, it's my son's birthday.

1423
02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:31.290
Jasie Crotinger: So,

1424
02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.300
Jasie Crotinger: More not today, but it will be

1425
02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:48.930
Jasie Crotinger: Saturday version. So I don't want that too. And he's wanting to go to like Sky Zone, but I keep thinking this is their, their clothes, now

1426
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:53.700
Jasie Crotinger: That kind of affect everything with these kids, it's very annoying but

1427
02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:55.950
Jasie Crotinger: I have to deal with it.

1428
02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:00.180
Jasie Crotinger: Man, I can really do about it. Yeah, I mean,

1429
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:04.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because you can't go to Sky. Sky Zone is closed down, isn't it.

1430
02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:05.130
Yeah.

1431
02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:09.600
Jasie Crotinger: Right. And I sorry. Hold on.

1432
02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:14.430
Jasie Crotinger: Because he asked why I told him, I said, well, we'll have to make it up to you but

1433
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:29.220
Jasie Crotinger: You know what this stuff I've had my kids in the house. I've even been in the house, since they said that there is what actually before that, before they said they were locked down you know happening. I've been in a half so as human been really an issue for me.

1434
02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:44.850
Jasie Crotinger: But the kids. On the other hand, they're always like to go do something go out area. There's one mistake somewhere else. The time so only time I actually happen as like to be a cigarette or disappointment in my partial

1435
02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:48.960
Jasie Crotinger: By like I went out really, other than

1436
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:51.810
Jasie Crotinger: My parachute and stuff happening.

1437
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:54.840
Jasie Crotinger: Kind of prepared.

1438
02:47:57.030 --> 02:48:03.630
Richelle Direny: So, so both what I'm sold that you're both jobs. One of them is you you sell resume. It's like, get it.

1439
02:48:03.690 --> 02:48:06.510
Jasie Crotinger: Updated and if I do like I do.

1440
02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.100
Jasie Crotinger: Like I tried to explain. I do like

1441
02:48:12.450 --> 02:48:13.200
Jasie Crotinger: Interviews

1442
02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:24.630
Jasie Crotinger: And it kind of sounds like basically it's like a step play by they just pretend to interview stuff. It's not like that. We do interviews for jobs ever actually like doing roles for

1443
02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:30.960
Jasie Crotinger: But we offer them services and we get Commission out of it, basically.

1444
02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:39.810
Jasie Crotinger: But I'm all Commission like I'm not working out. I really, I have to sell right and they get any checks coming because I'm working from home.

1445
02:48:40.350 --> 02:48:54.810
Jasie Crotinger: So I'm kind of screwed because I'm not gonna have to check if they don't buy and then was other one, like I said, a lot of these are open, get them to buy on like the acne. I mean advertise opposition bag doesn't have to be in the office for a week or two weeks.

1446
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:58.050
Jasie Crotinger: Because a lot of places told me to call back

1447
02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:05.670
Richelle Direny: So, so it's like hit or miss. How much you will you will generate how much income you will generate, week to week

1448
02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:07.050
Yeah.

1449
02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:09.030
Richelle Direny: And you're a sinner.

1450
02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:10.590
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah.

1451
02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:26.190
Jasie Crotinger: I get child support from one of my head is bad on a regular and then I don't want doesn't pay child support. Eat it helps everyone, so I will close and shit. You don't really handy over money is like for building anything. And then the other one.

1452
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:30.390
Jasie Crotinger: He doesn't do anything, really, to be honest with you.

1453
02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:33.240
Jasie Crotinger: Right here, you know,

1454
02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.880
Jasie Crotinger: The mind during the summer. Anyways, he doesn't

1455
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:42.930
Jasie Crotinger: He doesn't help. Like he said basically

1456
02:49:44.610 --> 02:49:48.630
Richelle Direny: So, so what what support system do you have

1457
02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:53.280
Richelle Direny: Outside of you just trying to work to take care of them. And the one

1458
02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:56.280
Richelle Direny: Involves clockwork.

1459
02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:57.540
Jasie Crotinger: And do I have, you said

1460
02:49:58.890 --> 02:49:59.550
Jasie Crotinger: I'm

1461
02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:05.730
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, I'm on house whenever I need it.

1462
02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:12.600
Jasie Crotinger: But other than that, I mean, I really don't.

1463
02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:15.780
Jasie Crotinger: Have anybody else. I really have

1464
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:18.810
Unfortunately,

1465
02:50:23.430 --> 02:50:27.810
Jasie Crotinger: That kind of sucks really famous lesson.

1466
02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:35.700
Jasie Crotinger: To figure it out, which I do. I mean I eventually do figure it out. But it's annoying.

1467
02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:43.890
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, just happening. Last time, don't get into that the phrase, get up into the juice is just afraid I'm not gonna tell you again.

1468
02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:53.340
Jasie Crotinger: Um, it's annoying though, because by the time I tried to save money up. It's time for another building a month, year. I mean, it's like it's new. It's like

1469
02:50:54.450 --> 02:51:03.000
Jasie Crotinger: Irritation to me but I mean everything's been all right right now, but I know doing it should be easier for me because I'm not really making that much money like I was

1470
02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:12.660
Jasie Crotinger: Now so much covering just the bare minimum, like any written stuff. But now it's like I know when my next check is like I'm in, you know, I mean,

1471
02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:22.170
Richelle Direny: But then I mean, have you tried calling like I'm like say for your, your landlords. Are you renting from like an apartment complex. I mean,

1472
02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:24.510
Jasie Crotinger: Hold on.

1473
02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.930
Jasie Crotinger: Let me stop them.

1474
02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:32.580
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I'm actually probably get help, but I just feel like

1475
02:51:33.690 --> 02:51:39.690
Jasie Crotinger: They're not really gonna they're already going to be helping some of the other people you're. I mean, so I don't know.

1476
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:42.450
Jasie Crotinger: Why these organizations.

1477
02:51:44.310 --> 02:51:49.560
Richelle Direny: To think about, you have to think about it for a moment, like you said, you know, they're helping so many other people

1478
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:52.650
Think Like if it's something that

1479
02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:59.340
Richelle Direny: You know, if money is running out. You don't know when your next paycheck is coming in.

1480
02:52:04.410 --> 02:52:12.180
Richelle Direny: So it's just, you know, exploring, you know. How can what you can you do to save the little that you have to be able to

1481
02:52:13.980 --> 02:52:17.220
Richelle Direny: Until you're able to fully go back all

1482
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:19.290
Right.

1483
02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:22.110
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah.

1484
02:52:25.350 --> 02:52:29.460
Jasie Crotinger: I've been. I've been trying to save up as much as I can, I can

1485
02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:34.020
Jasie Crotinger: have money in the bank that I've been saving, but it's just like

1486
02:52:35.430 --> 02:52:43.200
Jasie Crotinger: That I mean I'm the type that I budget, like I tried a budget as best I can, but they might not have in the bank. I don't count that as happy or I mean

1487
02:52:43.740 --> 02:53:00.690
Jasie Crotinger: There's just for like when something happens, I need it, getting, like, for whatever situation, I can have it, but I don't want to have to use that if I can do something about it. Yeah. I mean, if I can bring money in that side. It's just about trying to do to avoid having to spend that money.

1488
02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:02.790
Jasie Crotinger: So,

1489
02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:08.790
Jasie Crotinger: That's, I mean I I'll figure it out, obviously.

1490
02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:21.930
Jasie Crotinger: I know it works on expenses checks or whatever they are. So I'm assuming, those are for that. But I don't know, like all the specifics of it. They even approved in on that. Yeah, I mean,

1491
02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:26.850
Jasie Crotinger: That's like a day, maybe I don't have. I don't know.

1492
02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:29.370
Richelle Direny: How was everything.

1493
02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:38.730
Richelle Direny: I know the last time that we met. We talked about like trying to maintain boundaries with your, your youngest child father

1494
02:53:40.530 --> 02:53:43.680
Richelle Direny: Or more. Have you been to maintain those boundaries.

1495
02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:45.120
Jasie Crotinger: That I know like

1496
02:53:46.050 --> 02:53:48.690
Richelle Direny: I said, Have you been able to maintain those boundaries.

1497
02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:51.840
Richelle Direny: Solid dependent upon him.

1498
02:53:53.250 --> 02:53:53.880
Jasie Crotinger: I'm

1499
02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:57.510
Jasie Crotinger: Not running

1500
02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:02.340
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, kinda has any you drive the car Academy

1501
02:54:03.540 --> 02:54:10.170
Jasie Crotinger: And I like hearing me. I don't really answer all the time like

1502
02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:15.960
Jasie Crotinger: I don't want entertain it pretty much as i mean like I don't

1503
02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:24.960
Jasie Crotinger: Sometimes I like tell I'm busy or something. I want to talk to them is where I used to answer every call you know me and talk to him for a long time.

1504
02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:39.690
Jasie Crotinger: And now that I have this or like now that. It's crunch time as far as making money. It's like it gets aggravating so I mean I think I'm really into the boundaries as far as that goes. I mean, I call them and i want to i didn't have. I don't really

1505
02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:44.220
Jasie Crotinger: I don't really entertaining here. I mean,

1506
02:54:45.690 --> 02:54:51.300
Jasie Crotinger: Like I talked to every once a while. Um, let's talk about Omari, or something. But other than that, I mean we really haven't been talking about.

1507
02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:59.730
Jasie Crotinger: Me and then but just the fact that you talk to me every day. It seems stupid because it's like you're married, you know, I mean, to me because of my everyday life.

1508
02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.440
Jasie Crotinger: It's been different, like I really haven't been entertaining it, to be honest.

1509
02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:12.630
Jasie Crotinger: I try not to.

1510
02:55:16.020 --> 02:55:32.910
Richelle Direny: Know, I mean as as things and like I like to. I've been kind of reviewing with everyone their self care routine as you're going through as you're going through everything with, you know, with the lockdown is shutting let me limited income.

1511
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:39.720
Richelle Direny: Know, I've been, you know, checking in with everybody. What is your self care routine. What is because

1512
02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:43.980
Richelle Direny: You know they predict that things may get a little bit harder.

1513
02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:47.070
Richelle Direny: You're not at the worst of it.

1514
02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:55.080
Richelle Direny: And so in in such case, you know, it's really thinking about what is

1515
02:55:57.210 --> 02:56:00.630
Richelle Direny: What is your self care routine daily to

1516
02:56:01.410 --> 02:56:03.870
Richelle Direny: Be able to maintain your own mental

1517
02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:10.680
Richelle Direny: Where you don't feel overwhelmed, where you're making irrational unwise decisions.

1518
02:56:10.770 --> 02:56:15.630
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right. Um, I don't know. I really

1519
02:56:19.230 --> 02:56:19.830
Jasie Crotinger: Don't know.

1520
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:28.560
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, I'm trying to think.

1521
02:56:32.010 --> 02:56:43.500
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, I've been I'm never gonna do the same name. Anyway, so like the change in like having to sit at home. That's what I've always done that. It's not nothing new for me so out stop every once a while I would

1522
02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:52.200
Jasie Crotinger: I would go to like a store and go shop or something. If I wanted to go out. Yeah. I mean, if I was to stuck in the house or too much or whatever.

1523
02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.890
Jasie Crotinger: But i mean i don't i don't know i really like thought about that as far as like

1524
02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:08.610
Jasie Crotinger: I guess it really hasn't been stressing me out too much besides just the word thing indicated trying to have them on schedule but that's about it here. I mean,

1525
02:57:10.350 --> 02:57:14.010
Jasie Crotinger: So, I mean, I guess that I should have some set up those

1526
02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:18.450
Jasie Crotinger: Stress, it does cause stress.

1527
02:57:20.610 --> 02:57:22.260
Jasie Crotinger: So much. I just really haven't

1528
02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:24.930
Jasie Crotinger: Happen. Yeah, I mean,

1529
02:57:26.730 --> 02:57:27.870
Jasie Crotinger: Anything else, but just

1530
02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:32.130
Richelle Direny: I think it's very important to pay attention to yourself in

1531
02:57:33.330 --> 02:57:43.440
Richelle Direny: Pickens because if you don't, you, um, you know, everything will eventually catch up to you because you're so focused on being able

1532
02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:45.030
To

1533
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:48.900
See what you are

1534
02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:58.800
Richelle Direny: When you become you know just overwhelmed with just thinking about them. If

1535
02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:04.260
Richelle Direny: I can see you talking about, I can't hear you. I can't hear you either

1536
02:58:10.890 --> 02:58:11.940
Richelle Direny: Okay, should be better.

1537
02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:14.280
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I can hear you better now.

1538
02:58:15.090 --> 02:58:18.180
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I think it was my internet connection. Sorry.

1539
02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:27.030
Richelle Direny: No, that's why I mean, as I said, I'm saying, you know, when you're you and yours. You're super focused on being able to maintain everything that you have

1540
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:39.540
Richelle Direny: Neglect your own needs and your own self care able to, you know, remain at a homeostasis, to be able to have a balance and you first have to be balanced with it.

1541
02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:51.930
Richelle Direny: Like we do everything. It's kind of like the analogy of. Have you ever traveled on a plane. No. Okay. Like when you travel or have you ever gone

1542
02:58:56.340 --> 02:58:57.150
Jasie Crotinger: I'm sorry, hold on.

1543
02:59:02.310 --> 02:59:02.730
Okay.

1544
02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:10.470
Jasie Crotinger: No.

1545
02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:14.670
Wonder, you're not

1546
02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:18.240
Here.

1547
02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:19.980
Jasie Crotinger: You are

1548
02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:21.660
Yeah.

1549
02:59:23.310 --> 02:59:24.750
I'm not going to get all night.

1550
02:59:27.270 --> 02:59:27.660
Jasie Crotinger: Sorry.

1551
02:59:28.590 --> 02:59:29.370
Richelle Direny: No, you're good.

1552
02:59:33.270 --> 02:59:42.150
Richelle Direny: And this because this is your life all day long. You have to analogy. Right now it's going to tap into. And this is for everyone.

1553
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:52.620
Richelle Direny: Right when you're home, especially with younger children and it's just like, you know, I'm surprised. They're not coming and say, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Mommy, I'm surprised there.

1554
02:59:54.210 --> 02:59:55.560
Jasie Crotinger: Weren't any game.

1555
02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:12.840
Richelle Direny: So, and you know what, as much as, as long as the game can entertain them once that no longer entertains them, then it's going to be mommy, mommy and the longer you stay close indoors, you have to become creative on how to entertain them so they don't drive you out of your mind.

1556
03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:16.830
Richelle Direny: Because that's the reality of what can happen. It's kind of like

1557
03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:26.100
Richelle Direny: Think about it as a marriage or a relationship in the beginning of the relationship. Oh, everything is so wonderful, you're kissing each other. I love you. I this, I bet.

1558
03:00:26.490 --> 03:00:38.490
Richelle Direny: And then eventually, it's just like, Whoa. Oh, and that's kinda you have we haven't gotten to that. Oh my god, I'm pulling out my hair moment because we're still in the honeymoon phase of it all.

1559
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:42.060
Richelle Direny: So that's the reason why you have to kind of

1560
03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:50.250
Richelle Direny: start implementing your own self care routines and the reason why I asked you if you ever flown or

1561
03:00:50.940 --> 03:01:02.190
Richelle Direny: You know, if you've ever been on a boat because they go through that I'm in the event of a crisis if anything happened is the ship was about the same core. The plane was about to fall out the air. They have these

1562
03:01:03.390 --> 03:01:15.570
Richelle Direny: These protocols that they go over and they tell you it's you. Take care of yourself first. They pull you you put on your mask your vest. You get all suited up first. Naturally, we would want to take your

1563
03:01:16.410 --> 03:01:24.630
Richelle Direny: First that's naturally, but they tell you you take care of yourself first. Why do you think that they tell you to take care of yourself first.

1564
03:01:26.370 --> 03:01:26.910
Jasie Crotinger: And

1565
03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:33.660
Jasie Crotinger: He said that they say nothing here, you can try the next person.

1566
03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:45.780
Richelle Direny: Know they tell you to take they tell you to put on your, your life best your mat. Your, your mask everything. Why do you think they tell you to do it first to yourself before doing it for the children.

1567
03:01:47.430 --> 03:01:50.010
Jasie Crotinger: To protect yourself. I guess because

1568
03:01:53.370 --> 03:02:01.230
Jasie Crotinger: I guess because the frantic and, you know, causing chaos. I guess you're there cause inducing panic.

1569
03:02:02.370 --> 03:02:09.540
Jasie Crotinger: It makes it, you know, sexy kids too and it's like a whole big ass you know i mean incident situation.

1570
03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:16.290
Richelle Direny: That's not why did. Why did they tell you to do it first, because if

1571
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:25.230
Richelle Direny: Everything goes protective gears on them first and you pass out who's going to take care of them.

1572
03:02:26.010 --> 03:02:26.430
Right.

1573
03:02:27.810 --> 03:02:42.000
Richelle Direny: So if you do it first, then you will be around to be able to care for them and to assist them with everything if they're drowning. They can't help themselves because you understand, like, or if

1574
03:02:43.470 --> 03:02:45.000
Richelle Direny: They can't help you, you

1575
03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:47.910
Jasie Crotinger: First, and I was like, I don't know.

1576
03:02:48.330 --> 03:02:56.670
Richelle Direny: Yes. So that's the reason why they tell you, you always take care of yourself first. So you are around to be able to care for them. Right.

1577
03:02:57.420 --> 03:03:04.410
Richelle Direny: That's how you have to even think about even now the situation now your, your circumstance that you're in now is that

1578
03:03:05.490 --> 03:03:26.670
Richelle Direny: You have to think about your own mental health, um, you know, what are your coping skills. What is it that you're doing in light of everything that's going on around you. Um, I think now's the time to be more creative, given that you have

1579
03:03:28.350 --> 03:03:30.210
Richelle Direny: You know you're on the internet, all day.

1580
03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:31.440
For the most part, because

1581
03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:36.330
Richelle Direny: What you can do

1582
03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:37.950
Richelle Direny: Is

1583
03:03:38.430 --> 03:03:43.470
Richelle Direny: You can, um, you know, look at different things i one person just told me

1584
03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:50.970
Richelle Direny: One person just told me they started making money by

1585
03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:54.540
Richelle Direny: Shopping for people through Instacart.

1586
03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:56.010
Jasie Crotinger: Uh huh. Hmm.

1587
03:03:57.300 --> 03:04:10.020
Jasie Crotinger: Yep, Buzzy My thing is is I just don't want to expose that Aaron has asthma, as it is alarming that the that coronavirus is more favorable to them than it is Ashlyn my oldest

1588
03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:18.510
Jasie Crotinger: And me. I mean, I know, I know of. I don't have any underlying issues that my health issues for diabetes, high blood pressure or anything like that.

1589
03:04:18.930 --> 03:04:25.620
Jasie Crotinger: But you never know if there could be, you know, you never notice of the night. You never found out about yourself that could cause an issue here. I mean,

1590
03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:33.120
Jasie Crotinger: I really I don't want to have to make tonight. I've heard that they have stores pairing and stuff too as well.

1591
03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:38.580
Jasie Crotinger: Like progresses hiring for our for 17 hour for stopping in

1592
03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:45.810
Jasie Crotinger: This we're doing other things there. You know, I mean the lobby weren't trying to work their way with this stuff going on.

1593
03:04:46.470 --> 03:04:57.180
Jasie Crotinger: So they've been real super busy. So a lot of these stores around here and we're hiring. I just don't want to be around people interacting. Here I have no one to expose myself and my kids to that buyer so

1594
03:04:58.470 --> 03:05:11.490
Jasie Crotinger: I guess it all figured out one way or another. If I saw the my landlord, like, hey, are you a little bit. Now, there's a little bit later. Yeah, man, what's going to happen. I mean, people need to be understanding and watch it again. I mean,

1595
03:05:12.690 --> 03:05:29.190
Jasie Crotinger: I was going on right now is you can't force somebody to go out there and and overexuberance do but with something like this happening, you can't force somebody to go put ourself in harm's way just to you. I mean, like, that's ridiculous to ask for me that I've been

1596
03:05:30.720 --> 03:05:35.190
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, I'll get money coming in. Eventually, somebody will end up again something

1597
03:05:37.350 --> 03:05:42.090
Richelle Direny: I mean, they said the stimulus package past. So there's a there's something where that's concerned.

1598
03:05:42.210 --> 03:05:50.580
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah so me as that happens. That happens to but they're saying that in May, like I said of word stream is coming of that.

1599
03:05:51.780 --> 03:05:54.060
Jasie Crotinger: Of that that coronavirus

1600
03:05:55.080 --> 03:06:08.340
Jasie Crotinger: So like you said, the worst thing ever. So I'm assuming it's nice. It's packed April, May and be into June, July, you're i mean i don't think that the buyers, really good. I doubt and she'll probably June or July.

1601
03:06:09.810 --> 03:06:14.250
Richelle Direny: Right, yeah. Yeah, I think that's what I heard them say more.

1602
03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:14.880
Jasie Crotinger: What

1603
03:06:15.450 --> 03:06:18.960
Richelle Direny: I think I heard that as well. I mean, there's everyone speculates

1604
03:06:19.470 --> 03:06:23.820
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, they're all guesses as never been messing around before like that.

1605
03:06:25.350 --> 03:06:25.890
Jasie Crotinger: But

1606
03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:38.550
Jasie Crotinger: I've been paranoid. I got a whole bunch of cleaning supplies I bought hand sanitizers best loved about that man I got all kinds of stuff. I got fever. She called pass

1607
03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:49.920
Jasie Crotinger: The hash numbers like their, their friends defer to something or frigid something. It's like a cold pack you can on the forehead. It takes your fee or down along with whatever you give up.

1608
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:56.550
Jasie Crotinger: I want you got Tylenol ibuprofen. So if I back which I was rushing Ashley to give because I guess it makes it worse. But

1609
03:06:57.570 --> 03:07:03.570
Jasie Crotinger: Um, yeah, I've been over prepared so I'm I guess you could say stress me out a little bit.

1610
03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:15.360
Jasie Crotinger: Just because not not knowing you. I mean, the unknown. What's going to happen when it's going to go back related is how it's going to affect everybody you know my graph or older, my sister, my mom, my house here so

1611
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:25.290
Jasie Crotinger: They did nothing home day of working had it. My mom got sick, right, like on her ship when she went back after all this stuff came out.

1612
03:07:26.580 --> 03:07:31.470
Jasie Crotinger: She took care of a late in the night before my sister as well because they both were going to the same place.

1613
03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:43.110
Jasie Crotinger: They both took care of somebody that that supposedly had it, but they had to check them first. Well, I'm, I'm sorry to get a high fever and shortness of breath, and I told her, go home.

1614
03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:54.360
Jasie Crotinger: You know, you need to go home, go get checked and then come back if you don't have anything wrong. But if you do need to be off so. Thank God she ends up actually getting read written off by the doctor that

1615
03:07:55.950 --> 03:07:56.340
Jasie Crotinger: That

1616
03:07:58.170 --> 03:08:08.460
Jasie Crotinger: Senior that day and my sister as well because my sister had no issues too. So, I mean, she probably wouldn't work but

1617
03:08:09.690 --> 03:08:16.170
Jasie Crotinger: I don't know man is not like if they see nothing but people are dying from having underline issues and

1618
03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:23.670
Jasie Crotinger: Being out earlier. I mean, they haven't really seen success stories, we will not through the front of ours. Why put yourself in that situation. Yeah, I mean,

1619
03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:32.430
Jasie Crotinger: I can say if you're not, you don't have issues and you're young, or whatever. And I get it, but I don't know but they they were exposed to it.

1620
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:43.080
Jasie Crotinger: So I don't know, I've been trying to isolate myself from that. But I have an older rambles it's not stressful. Really, really just been a really stressful.

1621
03:08:44.580 --> 03:09:00.960
Jasie Crotinger: Thinking about often. What is and stuff like that. Like if someone walks in. I have like I spray the floor because they say it spreads to like drop us off for the flower disinfection offered like where they were standing like it's ridiculous. For me, I guess.

1622
03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:07.530
Richelle Direny: I think it's the, it's the fear of the unknown. And that's why we do it. It's like the fear of the unknown.

1623
03:09:09.390 --> 03:09:24.720
Richelle Direny: And so we tried it, we become overcautious but then in becoming overcautious all we're doing is tearing down our own immune systems. What we're doing is weakening our own natural defenses. That's what we're doing when we do that, um,

1624
03:09:25.980 --> 03:09:27.690
Richelle Direny: So you have to just be

1625
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:33.000
Richelle Direny: Mindful of how much more

1626
03:09:35.730 --> 03:09:39.900
Richelle Direny: You know how like are you going are you doing too much.

1627
03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:44.610
Richelle Direny: I think all of it just drives fear unnecessary fear.

1628
03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:55.650
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, maybe for this. I really, I didn't, I didn't use like the air. Air swap can have lights on, like we ran the air and it goes around

1629
03:09:56.070 --> 03:10:03.000
Jasie Crotinger: And ever used that before, like I've used like cleaning supplies that disinfectants like for sure, like the bathroom, kitchen stuff like that.

1630
03:10:03.540 --> 03:10:17.580
Jasie Crotinger: But I never really worried about it before and use typically when I didn't shake. I don't even after I get through it. Yeah, I mean, unless I'm like really really sick rag. I feel like I need to go the hospital, rather than I would get through it. So you have to like

1631
03:10:18.750 --> 03:10:29.250
Jasie Crotinger: This situation. I don't know. I think everyone's different. Everyone's making it worse or having their own. I don't want it is or how serious it is. Or when you're i mean

1632
03:10:29.790 --> 03:10:37.230
Jasie Crotinger: How it's going to affect people and then they of course like have you seen that video. What I'm sure you're in Florida. Right.

1633
03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:49.560
Jasie Crotinger: There was a video on Facebook that was from like our areas. I live in Troy, but it was a big there's this boy which there was a fake one. I know. It was so nobody can find the Facebook profile and I

1634
03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:53.040
Jasie Crotinger: posted something that's not

1635
03:10:54.780 --> 03:11:01.590
Jasie Crotinger: Someone says about God told me to. I got, I woke up with a fever.

1636
03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:10.620
Jasie Crotinger: And say God told me to go touch everything and help you guys out basically saying that if he gets everyone else sick their immune system will fight it off.

1637
03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:18.600
Jasie Crotinger: And God's once I do that. So you said already, hit toy Walmart toy Kroger's stick with stick with it within different areas. He hit them to run

1638
03:11:19.530 --> 03:11:27.780
Jasie Crotinger: Well, you know, people can make fake poker. So if I that I didn't know what it was, but the panic you something making something like, hey, that's what's really going on. But there is a

1639
03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:30.750
Jasie Crotinger: Group.

1640
03:11:33.690 --> 03:11:34.110
Jasie Crotinger: Okay.

1641
03:11:35.610 --> 03:11:36.600
Jasie Crotinger: Let me get up.

1642
03:11:37.710 --> 03:11:49.890
Jasie Crotinger: I'm sorry. But anyway, like they said there's some teenagers that are out of town like out of Ohio that are running around like touching things and spin on things because they're trying to be smart ass of the body. I mean, they're younger

1643
03:11:50.340 --> 03:11:59.070
Jasie Crotinger: They really don't have a handout, so you should just have the ability and stuff. So there's just people around here. Toby inconsiderate and rude about the situation and just just

1644
03:11:59.820 --> 03:12:09.210
Jasie Crotinger: Really like they need to be educated, they need to have parents to educate them on talking about that is as like it that causes the issue to with like

1645
03:12:10.470 --> 03:12:16.410
Jasie Crotinger: Say, but for me is for someone else it could have been something that set him off the weather like panicking gaining

1646
03:12:18.780 --> 03:12:30.360
Richelle Direny: Some of the stuff I think it's fake. I've even seen where people are going around going into the stores, um, you know, but I saw someone open up ice cream and lick it, and then put it back.

1647
03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:31.350
Richelle Direny: But then

1648
03:12:32.010 --> 03:12:41.310
Richelle Direny: But I've seen them post it as its as its recent but it's really something that when you look at when the actual thing occurred. It was long ago.

1649
03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:45.210
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, you just have to

1650
03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:59.430
Richelle Direny: Listen in everything. Naturally, we become fearful of everything and you have to answer it. You have to ask yourself the question, what are you fearful of what exactly are you fearful of

1651
03:13:01.380 --> 03:13:03.660
Richelle Direny: And that's what you just have to really think about

1652
03:13:05.970 --> 03:13:06.480
Yeah.

1653
03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:09.300
Jasie Crotinger: I am yeah I think

1654
03:13:10.380 --> 03:13:12.360
Jasie Crotinger: I don't know. I think my fear is my kid.

1655
03:13:14.610 --> 03:13:15.060
Them.

1656
03:13:19.770 --> 03:13:24.630
Jasie Crotinger: Again, sick with her then have an admin. I just, I don't want to see them suffer here. I mean,

1657
03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:27.150
Jasie Crotinger: That's my baby bear

1658
03:13:29.580 --> 03:13:30.120
I think

1659
03:13:32.220 --> 03:13:36.600
Jasie Crotinger: Oh, nothing. That's my problem really I don't really care too much about myself as much as I do them.

1660
03:13:37.290 --> 03:13:49.110
Jasie Crotinger: And as I went to their kid gets sick and you know I need have issues you know saying like breathing and possibly die. And that's actually something that happens like there's no state. There's no medication for it.

1661
03:13:49.980 --> 03:13:56.160
Jasie Crotinger: hasn't yet so you pretty much have to watch your kids die. You know, I mean, if they do have an underlying issues and then

1662
03:13:57.330 --> 03:13:59.820
Richelle Direny: Then there's no real medication for the flu virus, either.

1663
03:14:00.300 --> 03:14:04.890
Jasie Crotinger: Know, but yeah, I mean, you're right. But, oh, no.

1664
03:14:06.390 --> 03:14:14.610
Richelle Direny: We so definitely afraid of the flu virus as we are this I mean granted that they say that this is more respiratory. But isn't the flu virus also respiratory

1665
03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:24.870
Richelle Direny: Isn't the food can't find risk kill you. Just like how this can so you have to. So that's what I'm saying. You have to sometimes you have to stop and just be logical and just say, hey,

1666
03:14:25.380 --> 03:14:33.180
Richelle Direny: I mean, I hear what you're saying, but everything that you're describing really truly seem to mimic the food.

1667
03:14:34.140 --> 03:14:45.330
Richelle Direny: Right, a regular flu. And do you do you are you over protective when it's a flu virus. And remember the flu is airborne it's contact

1668
03:14:45.690 --> 03:14:58.410
Richelle Direny: Droplet all this different stuff. So if I come to your house and I'm coughing or sneezing. Are you going to spray me down the same way of of me knowing that I have the coronavirus. Are you going to treat the two situations.

1669
03:14:59.250 --> 03:15:05.100
Richelle Direny: Are you going to be extra vigilant, or a person with the corona. You understand, yeah.

1670
03:15:06.570 --> 03:15:10.980
Richelle Direny: I think it's just the degree of fear that all of it just imposes on everyone.

1671
03:15:12.180 --> 03:15:18.150
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, I didn't. Yeah, I think it's just the fact that the President stepping in a lobby for every acting clean

1672
03:15:18.510 --> 03:15:19.500
Richelle Direny: The president than what

1673
03:15:20.010 --> 03:15:27.840
Jasie Crotinger: After the president stepping in and having a lot that I'm on the phone or on the saying I'm not even about me. So if you want something to drink, you go to get it in a cup.

1674
03:15:28.980 --> 03:15:32.670
Jasie Crotinger: Is outside. Yeah, and it being like that.

1675
03:15:34.140 --> 03:15:45.030
Jasie Crotinger: So a national lockdown or whatever. And so it makes everyone's like makes me feel like it's a serious more serious than your. I mean, the flu. Do I mean because

1676
03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:55.980
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, what's the flu. We never really have that many people's I'd be cautious, but it was definitely an incident where I was like oh my god you stay in the house to bring it says checks or something. I mean,

1677
03:15:57.030 --> 03:16:07.080
Jasie Crotinger: Like I know someone said Obama send a check out before, since this check and I know are not census. But whatever it is, stimulus or something like that.

1678
03:16:07.590 --> 03:16:15.630
Jasie Crotinger: But I remember that. I remember because I was younger and and you just drink happens when I just told you not to. I told you earlier, natural gas.

1679
03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:29.100
Jasie Crotinger: Oh my god, Lord. Help me right yeah I remember that. But I mean I guess I don't know much about different outlooks on it. I just one guy said we had each one in one

1680
03:16:29.730 --> 03:16:39.900
Jasie Crotinger: The blue on so the stuff he said it this is basically the same thing before every, every IP and then I had said that the flute kills more than a quarter buyer says

1681
03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:54.870
Jasie Crotinger: And then we see numbers where people are dying in 1000. So how is it. Yeah. I mean, it can't possibly be that if it kills more than this year. I mean, like the flu are the solutions, one in their coronavirus it is showing like that. It's not, that's not true.

1682
03:16:56.970 --> 03:17:10.860
Richelle Direny: But then again, again, without over and I think what we're doing is over thinking over rationalizing it or were like sitting on the news watching all this stuff. Remember the thing with the coronavirus and even with the flu.

1683
03:17:11.460 --> 03:17:19.470
Richelle Direny: It's all of it is respiratory. A lot of people majority of the people are people who have underlining health problems.

1684
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:30.180
Richelle Direny: So they're all people who have underlining health problems. So if you have an underlining health issue, I mean,

1685
03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:40.830
Richelle Direny: You know, of course, because the a flu virus all that if you have asthma. Okay, if you're if you're a smoker.

1686
03:17:42.510 --> 03:17:49.680
Richelle Direny: What happens and if you YOU'VE BEEN SPOKEN FOR YOU HAVE COPD, and then you get the for coronavirus. What do you think is gonna happen.

1687
03:17:52.620 --> 03:17:53.670
Richelle Direny: Why do you think so.

1688
03:17:54.180 --> 03:17:56.400
Jasie Crotinger: Because this action lungs and the CBD.

1689
03:17:57.450 --> 03:18:02.370
Jasie Crotinger: damaged tissue. So you're damaged tissue on top of it, you know, healthy and money to breed.

1690
03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:09.990
Jasie Crotinger: So that's my fear to because I do smoke. Again, it's like I just overworked myself.

1691
03:18:14.850 --> 03:18:16.230
It is a fear of not knowing

1692
03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:20.040
Richelle Direny: Look, you have. So you have this thing that

1693
03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:34.290
Richelle Direny: You know, you will be okay. You have COPD. Um, but yet we engage in things that will put us in respiratory failure without recognizing them. We go decide, oh, let's go run a half marathon.

1694
03:18:35.220 --> 03:18:55.710
Richelle Direny: To kill yourself, your lungs are not that good. So why would he does. I mean it. The reality of it is because of how it's been publicized that's what scares us because listen, if it's really how people think practice for caution.

1695
03:19:00.990 --> 03:19:06.600
Richelle Direny: Practice precaution. I'm just saying that you just have to be mindful.

1696
03:19:07.890 --> 03:19:23.640
Richelle Direny: You think that watching it, watching the news and listening to all the stuff and people who are sending these different articles that you know you know you're questioning whether the validity of it. It puts more anxiety on you like I remember my husband sent me

1697
03:19:25.140 --> 03:19:30.540
Richelle Direny: A. I think it was an article that said that it was, um,

1698
03:19:31.980 --> 03:19:33.150
Richelle Direny: Please let me

1699
03:19:33.660 --> 03:19:33.960
Know,

1700
03:19:34.980 --> 03:19:36.630
Jasie Crotinger: Limit hot water with lemon

1701
03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:40.830
Jasie Crotinger: It gives you like a vitamin C. When you heat it up.

1702
03:19:41.370 --> 03:19:45.240
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, I saw the big lemon in it.

1703
03:19:47.280 --> 03:20:11.700
Richelle Direny: But, um, it's like he sent me this article, and it should. I don't know if you've seen it or it's been circulating it's it shows like a lion walking around in an alley. And the thing is saying that this is what they're doing in Russia to ensure that people are staying indoors.

1704
03:20:13.200 --> 03:20:16.350
Richelle Direny: And I'm like, and I'm sitting here thinking, There's no way

1705
03:20:18.660 --> 03:20:21.570
Richelle Direny: Hold on, I don't know if you can see it. Can you see this

1706
03:20:23.010 --> 03:20:24.840
Jasie Crotinger: I can see the alleys.

1707
03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:37.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, so basically what it is, it's a it's a lion. That's just walking around some like there is no way of government is going to let out 500 lions in a town just to ensure that people stays locked in.

1708
03:20:38.370 --> 03:20:45.060
Richelle Direny: Hmm. It was like, All right, let me go read because now you have to pick sense out of nonsense because you see this you get nervous and

1709
03:20:45.630 --> 03:20:58.530
Richelle Direny: Really rush to thinking rationally. So my. There is no way so I wouldn't google this and when I googled it. They said, number one, this is a picture from out of someplace in Africa.

1710
03:21:00.990 --> 03:21:07.260
Richelle Direny: And I'm like really am pretty much all it was. It's they Photoshopped. The lion in this

1711
03:21:08.040 --> 03:21:17.340
Richelle Direny: Right, and I think the lion that they, the way they photoshopped with the lion, I think, was walking on a safari like in there, you know, the zoo or whatever, and they read it.

1712
03:21:18.210 --> 03:21:36.000
Richelle Direny: And now you're reading this insane. I'm the President or the prime minister or whatever of Russia, he released 500 lions to ensure the people stay quarantine any my mind, I'm like, first of all, if you do that, how are you going to keep track of 500 lines right

1713
03:21:37.050 --> 03:21:43.560
Richelle Direny: And then you're putting people's lives at risk or whatever because you're going to have some chatter. So what lions are got now we're feeding lines human being.

1714
03:21:44.220 --> 03:21:45.750
Richelle Direny: Right, so

1715
03:21:46.110 --> 03:21:51.210
Jasie Crotinger: You have to be in Atlanta are homeless. Not everybody has a place to go. Very nice.

1716
03:21:52.230 --> 03:22:00.390
Richelle Direny: You have homeless people that's out there and not all homeless people as you know people that are homeless, not all of them want to go into a shelter so

1717
03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.460
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, now I'm talking five to 10 times as long as a game. Right.

1718
03:22:11.610 --> 03:22:22.320
Richelle Direny: So, um, that's, that's pretty much what it is you have to, when someone shows you something, or they're sending you pretty much what they're so now. Like there's these new things that saying

1719
03:22:22.740 --> 03:22:35.820
Richelle Direny: Um, I think there's a new one that come out that says that all the new faces in there's so many new cases in China. So now you hear, Oh, China is bracing themselves for the, the second

1720
03:22:37.320 --> 03:22:47.700
Richelle Direny: You have to go check the validity of that. How true is that because listen, remember this whole thing called came from out of China supposedly right

1721
03:22:48.690 --> 03:22:55.590
Richelle Direny: If it really does come out of China if there was a second wave of it. Don't you think the news would have been telling everybody about it.

1722
03:22:57.030 --> 03:22:57.480
Yeah.

1723
03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:01.710
Jasie Crotinger: I guess it was the governor, the governor

1724
03:23:03.540 --> 03:23:04.920
Jasie Crotinger: Never Ohio.

1725
03:23:06.810 --> 03:23:19.800
Jasie Crotinger: Wherever he is on the now I'm playing usually typically I'm watching that any other time but he said that he's the one that said that there was me a second strand in May, but that's what I'm questioning, because I was going to be a second stream.

1726
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:24.360
Richelle Direny: Stream and

1727
03:23:24.540 --> 03:23:25.650
Jasie Crotinger: That's I'm saying, like,

1728
03:23:27.450 --> 03:23:32.700
Jasie Crotinger: That's I'm saying I don't understand, because that's my question. I'm like, wait a minute, so

1729
03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:39.750
Jasie Crotinger: I understand how that I mean because China obviously didn't have enough. A second stream because there should there should lasted, you know, a couple months.

1730
03:23:40.110 --> 03:23:45.240
Jasie Crotinger: And then it finally died down here. I mean, they, they have, they weren't here with section numbers may

1731
03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:51.690
Jasie Crotinger: You know, I mean they were down they eat dead snakes and is freaking whatever else a bath, whatever you want to call it.

1732
03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:57.450
Jasie Crotinger: Which I think is freaking ridiculous, but whatever. I think they need to be in that now because I think that's why a lot of their stuff.

1733
03:23:58.020 --> 03:24:12.990
Jasie Crotinger: Like their affections of are coming from wild animals that they're eating down there. I think they need to have like a law and kind of where they tell eat number Snake number this year. I mean, I understand you don't see what, what's a happy time be about that said it's nasty.

1734
03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:15.000
Richelle Direny: Well, you know,

1735
03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:16.650
Richelle Direny: Listen.

1736
03:24:18.570 --> 03:24:23.640
Richelle Direny: What country might say you eat chicken. That's nasty. So, you know, every country they eat.

1737
03:24:23.940 --> 03:24:40.680
Richelle Direny: Animal like like, what is it, there are some Spanish. I was telling my sister. Today I'm like your Spanish people that you want us. And she's like, hold up, really. And I'm like, yeah, my evil, but he basically wanted Chinese people are known to eat pretty much every animal that

1738
03:24:41.790 --> 03:24:54.270
Jasie Crotinger: I see on Facebook. They had a video this one girl eating a healthy life stuff and like testicles, like it was a whole whole thing is you just eating it was hot sauce on like how you eat that.

1739
03:24:55.980 --> 03:25:08.040
Jasie Crotinger: Even she's buying into and it was just so nasty. Like it was ridiculous. Like, I don't know why they would watch it. But why are you eating it as if you haven't had nothing to eat for days like she was literally devouring it like it was

1740
03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:12.720
Jasie Crotinger: It was ridiculous. I was like, disgusted by it.

1741
03:25:13.080 --> 03:25:16.530
Richelle Direny: But then, but then I mean if you think about, I don't know if you've ever seen.

1742
03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:21.120
Richelle Direny: You know, maybe you're too young to watch. Remember Indiana Jones from back in the day.

1743
03:25:22.500 --> 03:25:24.630
Jasie Crotinger: I don't know, I probably did watch it, but

1744
03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:33.630
Richelle Direny: Joe Lewis from way way way back in the day, like in Africa when they go and they eat all the sudden the monkeys I that popped up in the soup and they were

1745
03:25:34.740 --> 03:25:36.720
Richelle Direny: You and I would look like this disgusting.

1746
03:25:37.260 --> 03:25:37.650
Jasie Crotinger: But then

1747
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:48.090
Richelle Direny: In that culture. It's a delicacy is great. And I'm sitting here looking like that's just like so I i'm I'm from Jamaica and we eat, go to

1748
03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:55.170
Richelle Direny: Now, I personally don't like I just eat the Bronx, because all that other stuff in there. I wanted

1749
03:25:55.770 --> 03:26:00.150
Richelle Direny: Like they have like the hope that it's called the head of the golden they use it to make a soup.

1750
03:26:00.660 --> 03:26:05.970
Richelle Direny: I choose not to like I just like the bras and taste of the bras with everything else. I'm like, I don't want that.

1751
03:26:06.420 --> 03:26:18.150
Richelle Direny: But no one might look at that and be like, oh, that's disgusting. But you know, it's the culture. I grew up in. And that's what they eat, whereas in another culture they eat different things.

1752
03:26:18.210 --> 03:26:18.630
Right.

1753
03:26:19.890 --> 03:26:26.820
Richelle Direny: But we all China. I mean, listen. Right. Eat Roshi and they made they eat they eat.

1754
03:26:27.900 --> 03:26:29.670
Jasie Crotinger: They dogs animals.

1755
03:26:31.170 --> 03:26:37.560
Jasie Crotinger: And I get one my does I get like that. I mean, I understand the Doug delicacy thing because me. I get that.

1756
03:26:38.040 --> 03:26:45.030
Jasie Crotinger: In a way, because you know before we started having more things we were eating. You know what we could like analyze your i mean

1757
03:26:45.600 --> 03:27:01.140
Jasie Crotinger: Obviously, so like say back in. Back in the day, like before restaurants or anything came about, you're like me and hear me, they said like animals, where they can find. I get that. But I just don't get the other stuff. I just, I don't

1758
03:27:02.430 --> 03:27:20.220
Jasie Crotinger: I mean, if you know if you're now and you know you're educated about the diseases that can come from these animals, like I said, like they probably would. I don't know, I feel like they knew about the current advisor still a fish it and they knew the river. Right. Yeah. And I don't know.

1759
03:27:20.670 --> 03:27:27.090
Richelle Direny: I honestly I think that I, you know, that's a whole nother conversation about, like, because this stuff has been around for so long.

1760
03:27:29.580 --> 03:27:39.960
Richelle Direny: You know, everybody has a theory of radical thought. But these people have been eating bad snakes rack mounts Roach, they've been eating it for you for centuries. Why all of a sudden the issue.

1761
03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:44.550
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right. All of a sudden, they're dropping benefit in there getting sick.

1762
03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:46.020
Richelle Direny: Why all of a sudden

1763
03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:54.300
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, that does make sense, a lot of people said population control and they're trying to enforce martial law and provide that

1764
03:27:56.070 --> 03:28:04.770
Richelle Direny: Think about it. It's like I say, I'm from Jamaica down, they may go head to that's been something that's been going on for centuries. Why all of a sudden, people are dropping dead for me.

1765
03:28:05.700 --> 03:28:07.110
My son.

1766
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:20.580
Richelle Direny: Same dorm anatomy all the, the, the, the chemical makeup, whatever it is. Right. Why all the sudden it's becoming deadly to me.

1767
03:28:21.390 --> 03:28:34.110
Jasie Crotinger: Right. Yeah, there's something going on. I believe it because I believe I could have stopped him from doing international travel because I remember reading stories and I came to the United States I resorted to my iPhone. I. That's why I went out and got

1768
03:28:35.220 --> 03:28:46.410
Jasie Crotinger: The all the hand sanitizer, I could I got 20 million bottles of it because that's when it started right now the stores, I knows overkill, but it didn't have it Kroger, they didn't have it at Walmart. So I'm like, Okay, I gotta roses.

1769
03:28:47.520 --> 03:29:03.600
Jasie Crotinger: Roses. And I finally my Bible. I grabbed him. That's your identity. No, but I didn't even that like everyone else. Of course I didn't keep off with one of them, but I just grabbed them and then I got, I was already talking about it and I know my my kids is bothering

1770
03:29:05.130 --> 03:29:06.450
Jasie Crotinger: Friends flash brother.

1771
03:29:07.890 --> 03:29:11.610
Jasie Crotinger: He was on my martial law. We're like, no, we don't think so, whatever.

1772
03:29:12.090 --> 03:29:21.570
Jasie Crotinger: But it does make sense because now, a lot of other people are talking about it because there are you trying to stay in the house, you know, they're saying that there's a second stream coming out. They don't know how long it's gonna last

1773
03:29:22.020 --> 03:29:26.250
Jasie Crotinger: You know they got so many cases in the United States. It's ridiculous it is

1774
03:29:27.870 --> 03:29:37.950
Jasie Crotinger: I don't know, like I said, I think Trump had the time to. You did have the time to stop international travel and he could have for it to not get into the United States. You know, I mean,

1775
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:41.790
Jasie Crotinger: So I feel like he did that on purpose.

1776
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:54.150
Richelle Direny: I mean I, you know what, I know that everything is a theory. Everything, everything is a conspiracy theory, we don't know, and what the more you focus on that, the more you overwhelm yourself.

1777
03:29:54.690 --> 03:30:06.240
Richelle Direny: And the more like you said, buying 21 bottles or 10 bottles of pants sanitizer. If it's going to cost you $50 was that $50 well spent, is the question.

1778
03:30:06.840 --> 03:30:23.310
Richelle Direny: You understand, cuz that $50 have been spent on something else. It is the reality is, instead of buying all of that hand sanitizer, especially now that your home. It's utilizing soap and water now because to me, they they've always said outside of the hand sanitizers so

1779
03:30:25.140 --> 03:30:38.700
Richelle Direny: It's the best thing that you can use. I personally, I've used hand sanitizers and I still wash my hands, my hands dirty. So in the end, you're just kid with all this alcohol content and you're just rubbing it up. I mean just wash your hands.

1780
03:30:40.530 --> 03:30:49.410
Richelle Direny: You know you're killing your good bacteria is your body's made up of bacteria is your calling it the more you do if you do it like it's overkill. So that's what I'm saying. So then

1781
03:30:49.860 --> 03:30:58.560
Richelle Direny: I'm scared of getting sick right they tell me. Oh, wash your hands. So now I go over. I go overboard and I start washing my hands wash my hands wash my hands in the end I got sick.

1782
03:30:58.860 --> 03:31:15.480
Richelle Direny: But I don't understand how did I get sick. I'm doing everything that they told me, because now common sense says you had your natural bacteria with all of this that you were doing. You killed your natural bacteria. So what you did was open up yourself and invited the virus.

1783
03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:17.730
Jasie Crotinger: Right. Right. Yes.

1784
03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:18.600
Richelle Direny: Everything that

1785
03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:28.050
Richelle Direny: Helps to build your immune system right Washington all the way. Now you are beer. And now, guess what.

1786
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:42.360
Richelle Direny: Now you're now you're really exposed. So that's what I'm saying this, this doing everything is overkill. So now you're wondering well, how is it that these people they're healthy, they're getting sick, they're the one may be

1787
03:31:43.140 --> 03:31:54.690
Richelle Direny: Doing the most in the hygiene, you're doing them. Like if you go pay 10 times for the day. What's going to happen, isn't it, not going to dry out your skin is going to dry out natural oils.

1788
03:31:56.790 --> 03:32:00.420
Jasie Crotinger: Yeah, that's true, that's, that's

1789
03:32:00.750 --> 03:32:05.040
Richelle Direny: You have to look at it, but no one is stopping to think like that because they're so busy.

1790
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:16.860
Richelle Direny: Here, make sure nothing about that anxiety makes you not think about that and it's stopping and saying, hold on, let me make sense of this. I already don't think it makes sense, but then fear is because it's

1791
03:32:17.430 --> 03:32:22.710
Richelle Direny: Fear is growing bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger that it's not allowing you to stop and see

1792
03:32:24.180 --> 03:32:27.390
Richelle Direny: It's like we teach our children think before you talk, think before you

1793
03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:32.790
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right.

1794
03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:41.640
Richelle Direny: So that's just kind of the reality of of what is it's like I learned that

1795
03:32:42.360 --> 03:32:48.210
Richelle Direny: Long before I had kids, when I started college coach. Someone told me a professor said that he was like, don't do that.

1796
03:32:48.660 --> 03:32:54.300
Richelle Direny: He said, because your hands have natural bacteria. If you keep washing it away.

1797
03:32:54.660 --> 03:33:02.460
Richelle Direny: You're killing your natural flora. And when you do that now you are not building up your immune system cannot handle

1798
03:33:02.730 --> 03:33:14.490
Richelle Direny: Whatever this whatever foreign matters that comes towards you, it cannot handle it, because whatever natural occurring soldiers, you have. It's kind of like they say you have your good soldiers and your bad soldiers.

1799
03:33:14.490 --> 03:33:14.790
Right.

1800
03:33:15.810 --> 03:33:19.080
Richelle Direny: You're good soldiers you leave room for your bad soldiers to take over.

1801
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:20.130
Right.

1802
03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:21.900
So,

1803
03:33:23.010 --> 03:33:35.280
Richelle Direny: It's just being mindful. I think more than anything else. It's just for you. I will encourage you to, you know, do what you can to think about creative ways you can generate money right

1804
03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:40.200
Jasie Crotinger: I'm going to figure it out. So

1805
03:33:41.430 --> 03:33:44.520
Jasie Crotinger: Your dashboard data because my background, they won't let me do it.

1806
03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:47.460
Richelle Direny: What about Amazon. Amazon is hiring.

1807
03:33:48.720 --> 03:33:56.010
Jasie Crotinger: Oh yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, I forget who said the Amazon somebody working for Amazon making money.

1808
03:33:58.350 --> 03:34:00.090
Richelle Direny: And I'm

1809
03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:02.670
Jasie Crotinger: A MOM I think she saw me.

1810
03:34:04.050 --> 03:34:09.270
Richelle Direny: Yeah, there's different ways that you can even if it's temporary right now it's temporary. So think about

1811
03:34:11.310 --> 03:34:12.030
Richelle Direny: Every week

1812
03:34:13.380 --> 03:34:14.070
Jasie Crotinger: I say what

1813
03:34:15.270 --> 03:34:16.860
Richelle Direny: Do you go to groups every week.

1814
03:34:17.160 --> 03:34:18.180
Now, once a month.

1815
03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:20.160
Jasie Crotinger: Okay.

1816
03:34:20.220 --> 03:34:20.730
Richelle Direny: And one

1817
03:34:21.810 --> 03:34:25.800
Richelle Direny: One once a month, one on the first one second.

1818
03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:31.830
Jasie Crotinger: Let me see what my next group and I forget.

1819
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:59.790
Jasie Crotinger: The 14

1820
03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:05.850
Jasie Crotinger: Car Joplin choir and I'm honest.

1821
03:35:06.900 --> 03:35:11.160
Richelle Direny: Okay. So then let's meet in a month then. Let's check back in in a month.

1822
03:35:12.390 --> 03:35:12.750

Richelle Direny: On the 23rd at I have you at seven o'clock.

1824
03:35:17.430 --> 03:35:21.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, if we need to make changes, just let me know. Okay.

1825
03:35:22.140 --> 03:35:22.530
All right.

1826
03:35:23.970 --> 03:35:36.090
Richelle Direny: All right then. Have a good evening. And like I said, you know, just be safe, be mindful. Just think, does this make sense. And that's just kind of how you do things.

1827
03:35:36.180 --> 03:35:36.960
Jasie Crotinger: Right, right.

1828
03:35:39.270 --> 03:35:40.140
