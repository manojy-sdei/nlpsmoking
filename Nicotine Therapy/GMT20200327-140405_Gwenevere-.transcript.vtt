Gwenevere Abriel: I'm having everyone I'm have a very separate zoom

6
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.920
Because

7
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It just works better for for zoom that they're separated versus one continuous session because I meet with people back to back.

8
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm breaking them up so I didn't mean to hang up on you. It's

9
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.740
Freezing

Gwenevere Abriel: Went out my plan is to go out the this Saturday. I'm the designated shopper. So I'll go out again, I'm not looking forward to it.

19
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.120
Magan: Or you like masking up and stuff.

20
00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I MASK up yeah and I leave everything I actually do it much the way you do it. Everything stays in the garage. It doesn't come in. If I can transfer it from one thing to a ziplock none of my clothes, my shoes. Everything stays out there three to four days before it comes in, um,

21
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.070
Yeah.

22
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.440
Magan: Yeah.

23
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody is like, Oh, you're, you know, you're over the top and slowly. They're getting the information and they're like, oh yeah, you're right, it is on the floor with your shoes. And I'm like,

24
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.190
Magan: Yeah, it is.

25
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.550
Magan: You track it through everything.

26
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the dog. So the dog.

27
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Eats off the floor. The kids kiss the dog and I kissed the dog and right so

28
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.970
Magan: Against to me, even though

29
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, just the dog. So I'm like, no, we can't track this stuff in.

30
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:51.570
Magan: Yeah, I completely get it the dog. We let him stay outside I'm letting the kids go in the backyard, they're going, they're going insane going insane. Yeah. No, I get it.

31
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.460
Magan: But

32
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:04.560
Magan: I am I woke up yesterday and well the last few days I've been running a fever. So I have. Yeah.

33
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.570
Magan: Yeah, I was running a fever and then hey, it's low grade the highest I got was

34
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.890
Magan: And then

35
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.940
Magan: I've just been I think it's allergy symptoms but like I woke up and my voice was worse.

36
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.090
Magan: And

37
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No dry cough. No.

38
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:49.110
Magan: No, okay. No, nothing like that. And I think it's just stressed has gotten has caught up. That is what I think has happened. And so I called into work last night, just to make sure, because if I go into work and I sound like that people are going to freak out. So, but

39
00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.090
Magan: I because I called in and I spoke to one of my co workers, she answered it, I was like, hi. Megan She was like,

40
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.230
Magan: And I found it worse than this, but she was like, oh my god.

41
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's something about having that voice that the believability is high, you know, they're like, Okay. Yeah, I can hear the sound force.

42
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah alright so

43
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But what was it like for you. Let's talk about your calling out that that is does not happen very often. So what came up for you around. I'm going to call out, given all of what's going on in your work life.

44
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: what that was like.

45
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.590
Magan: Well, I don't like calling out because I like to be held accountable.

46
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.020
Magan: But so

47
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.510
Magan: A situation happened last week, which really really really pissed me off.

48
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.590
Magan: I was lead in the room.

49
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:07.500
Magan: And I had a very new employee with me. He hasn't even been there for six months, yet so I wasn't charged because there was no supervisor there because it was their day off.

50
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:26.790
Magan: So I was the one who is handling it. And we had an inflated emergency and so I dispatched officers on it. I just touch 4355 and the call is happening. So the symptoms are gentlemen were respiratory symptoms.

51
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.590
Magan: And he passed out in the airplane.

52
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.910
Magan: And he was coughing and he had a low grade fever.

53
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.940
Magan: So they don't

54
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.780
Magan: Pee pee and they went in and

55
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:52.350
Magan: Out. So when I called up 60 which is like the manager of the airport that night. That's on call. I told them, they're donating their gear.

56
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.010
Magan: But they, I didn't say p, p, and because I said that I got in trouble.

57
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:09.000
Magan: And I was like, well, wait a second. The call did turn out like an hour and a half later, the officers and the ambulance people

58
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.770
Magan: Said, they're treating it as a code case possible the case right and they sent him to the hospital.

59
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.960
Magan: And then shit you're not in that call in the middle of that call another call 43 in flight emergency happens in the same flight.

60
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:33.180
Magan: 18 year old kid is having seizures. So all that is happening at one time and I'm trying my best to handle it like a boss.

61
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:48.900
Magan: And meditating to James, what you need to do what I need to do a cover all my bases I notated everything, but when I relayed that information to up 60. The next day I came in and I got pulled into the office with the big boss.

62
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.010
Magan: And the big boss tells me

63
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:07.200
Magan: You should not have said coated you cause chaos. Is it. No, I didn't cause chaos. I didn't see it on the radio. I didn't say it to the public. I sent it to a supervisor within my chain of command and that's exactly what they were doing. Yeah.

64
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, aren't your calls recorded campaign just cross A.

65
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:19.110
Magan: Look there sure this your word and he plays it back and he said you said the word coconut. I was like, okay, so you're upset with me because I treated a covert calls a coven call

66
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:27.330
Magan: And he goes, Well, we just need to be careful of what we're saying. And we need to relate to the correct information as it's being said

67
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:38.730
Magan: PASTOR SAID, p, p, you said Kofi here. I said, okay, fair enough. I take responsibility for for not relaying the correct information. However,

68
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:51.270
Magan: You then after they confirm that they were going to treat it as a co a positive closer case you let all 91 people that were on that plane into the terminal.

69
00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.630
Magan: You let 91 people into the terminal. I was like, what is that Chris was like when we're supposed to be quarantine.

70
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.900
Magan: And he goes, that that's been taken care of.

71
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.760
Magan: And everybody's just

72
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:18.030
Magan: Yeah, he's being really, really hush hush about it, upper management, even my own supervisor has not been told about this situation. He's been kept out of the loop as well. So I told him.

73
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.380
Magan: But after that happened. I did try to practice my breathing. It did not go well.

74
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:33.510
Magan: Um, when I was sitting in front of him. I sort of shaking. I started crying. I was so angry. I started crying.

75
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:44.940
Magan: Because I felt like he was throwing all of that shit on me and instead of saying, hey, Megan. Good job. I know we don't have a supervisor here for guidance. I know that.

76
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:56.730
Magan: You were the one that had to make all the tough choices and that this is all unchartered territory and you did a good job. But let's work on this, you know, something like that. But that's not how he did it.

77
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:10.320
Magan: So I was crying. I was angry, and I walked out and then. So when I went to go call him last night, I had to speak to him. And that's what I was nervous about

78
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.160
Magan: Just circle back around here original question.

79
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:23.550
Magan: So I spoke to him directly. And I was like, I'm calling in. I don't want to cause any issues. I'm just gonna stay at home. Today I'll be in tomorrow.

80
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:34.080
Magan: And okay, and they sent out an email that if you're running a fever or you have a cough or something that matches designed to call that you need to call the number

81
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:43.710
Magan: And get checked. I don't want to get checked because I know it's I don't feel it's along those lines, I feel that stress has caught up to me. That's what I really feel

82
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.450
Magan: If it gets worse than I will contact the number. So Megan.

83
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.010
I'm Chris

84
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.590
Magan: Okay, okay, this is what Chris could have said.

85
00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.220
Making your amazing

86
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to need a fall guy and my frontline people

87
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys, you guys are everything so um yeah I don't want to ever hear back that you say

88
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if someone else says it. So what we're going to do is

89
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just going to write down symptoms. So what we'll be doing is to cover our own ass.

90
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're going to do is when people say that word, you'll say um can you describe the symptoms that you are attributing that term to please could you describe them, please. And then they do that and then you write them down and then that's how we report it.

91
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And so yeah, so I dropped the ball and large organizations dropped the ball. And so I'm going to go ahead and blame you. Because I can't

92
00:10:51.120 --> 00:11:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't blame my bosses for those 91 people in the airport, I can't do that. So I'm going to go ahead and blame you for that. And so, yeah, try and work under those conditions. Um so yeah come today, right.

93
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.380
Magan: Yeah.

94
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to say you're not going to do that.

95
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.210
Magan: And that's exactly what it felt like it felt like, like, wait a second.

96
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.960
Magan: You haven't even sent out directives on what we're supposed to say

97
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.180
Magan: That's right, even even sent directives which 1am I supposed to say not. Am I not supposed to say

98
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so pin.

99
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We are a reactive species.

100
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The protocol will come

101
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: From that mistake in the airport sad to say, but that's what we species do you are proactive taken off your shoes before you walk in the house. You have that kind of mentality that's beautiful.

102
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people don't

103
00:11:52.890 --> 00:12:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is varying yet for your proactive type of personality so I'm

104
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really neat what you did. I wish he could have praised you and said,

105
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Yeah. You, you basically kept it together and didn't flip out and didn't overuse that we're investing in, say, it sort of okay and you took ownership for the one time.

106
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You you transfer this word from from P to cove it and you owned it. My god, there's really nothing to tell you needing over. Keep up the good work. Let me better define what we do when people

107
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Use the word and how we're going to document it so that we're not culpable. We're not responsible for setting in motion more chaos. So I wish he took that opportunity to define exactly sort of that what to do the protocol.

108
00:12:51.240 --> 00:13:01.980
Magan: And he didn't like the thing is, it's funny. It's like you didn't even give me like a pat on the shoulder like nothing, not even an uplifting remark.

109
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:11.580
Magan: And, to be quite honest, your lack of scheduling lack of having a proper third person on night shift is what caused this problem to begin with.

110
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:21.570
Magan: There wasn't a third person in the room and I was stuck with a person that's been there less than six months and honestly has no idea what the fuck to do. So technically, it was all on me.

111
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:33.480
Magan: Yeah and that person got to the hospital. They got safely to the hospital and and the seizure kid got safely to last, it'll all my officers are safe and alive, nobody's in danger.

112
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:48.900
Magan: Everyone be contaminated everything. So tell me why the higher ups allowed 91 people into the terminal and not only alone 91 people into the terminal to expose everybody else.

113
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:59.520
Magan: But then they love allowed them to rebook flights, not the same one that they were already on that got cancelled, but we booked flights and spread out and go across the country everywhere.

114
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:03.660
Magan: Let's take this

115
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.250
Magan: Fucking idiot and I really wanted to call the news.

116
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I

117
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.330
Magan: Wanted to I wanted to call the new soul bag.

118
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:29.490
Magan: And I've never done that with my job. Yeah, I've never felt that way because I see some shit. Yeah, I really do. And, and I see some shady shit but this this was really shady. And I was like, You mother.

119
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:37.950
Magan: But I cried, and then I apologize. I took responsibility, he just said.

120
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.820
Magan: I accept your apology. Thank you.

121
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.780
Magan: That's what he said. Yeah, okay.

122
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.370
Magan: I felt like I was talking to my dad.

123
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.900
Magan: Yeah, so that's what it felt like

124
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: From from as far as productivity.

125
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a bit of a waste of your time to go there. But as far as the therapeutic benefit.

126
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I see some interesting things happening. I see.

127
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You cried, which is not the same thing as completely overwhelmed, you are able to still talk you apologize for something

128
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's not the same as did you go into the bathroom and just completely collapse. Did you stop taking calls

129
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Do you realize how much emotional regulation, you had to do, even though you say, oh, I didn't do the breathing. I couldn't pull it off and couldn't pull it off.

130
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.990
Magan: You and I was sitting there, I was looking at my hand and I couldn't do it.

131
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's okay. That's why I try to tell you guys, the social pressure, especially if it's someone with power and authority over us.

132
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost insurmountable. It's really hard to do. So don't be hard on yourself, then we do it the next second that we can for you to have still had the wherewithal to be able to apologize for a year. Little piece.

133
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's not true, like the fact that you were able to find even the morsel to get through that social encounter is brilliant.

134
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you got out of that room because there was nothing productive that was going to happen. He, he found a fall guy, he could find some blame.

135
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Of all the things he could have picked up on that call that he could focus on he focused on this tiny little thing.

136
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And he called you out on it. You could have seen all kinds of great things that you did well.

137
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: He could have he could have used this piece of information and held a meeting and made sure there was new procedures in place. He could have found this utterly productive and really used it as a as a as a

138
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.610
Magan: teaching tool.

139
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but he didn't.

140
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's convenient for him. He found a piece of blame this this little person said she was sorry, and now the issue Stein. It's hardly done that's done.

141
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.800
Magan: Well, the thing is,

142
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but wait.

143
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to get behind.

144
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How much you did, you had to stay seated, you didn't keep crying. You said you were sorry you left the room and you worked. You got through the day.

145
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.250
Don't forget that.

146
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are overwhelmed can't keep taking life or death calls

147
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.390
They can't function.

148
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.470
Magan: Well, I definitely went back to work and I did my shift the whole eight hours.

149
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're amazing.

150
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.950
Magan: You have

151
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a completely invalidating experience for these minutes you had to know deep inside that you

152
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You make great choices the bet with the information that you have for those calls

153
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You make great choices.

154
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them, you know, one little piece of it. You didn't know

155
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What you didn't know. Well, now you know. Okay, fine. And, and, frankly, you're very likely it's going to happen again because it's going to be a gotcha. It's a gotcha, gotcha, gotcha environment law gotcha, gotcha.

156
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so we'll talk about that in a second. But I don't want to miss this moment by saying you handled it. You did a lot to get through that. So you're saying I didn't remember this breathing, you had to do some things to regulate yourself. What did you do

157
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.990
Magan: Well, I asked him for a minute. I said, Just give me a second.

158
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:55.770
Magan: And, well, why, like why like continued to cry. Yeah, but I got it out.

159
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.720
Magan: And I felt, and I apologize for crying. But he said, you know, it's okay if I have daughters. I know what it's like have dealt with this emotional

160
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

161
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.910
Magan: I was like, excuse me.

162
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

163
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.950
Magan: Yeah, okay.

164
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.450
Magan: Nothing to do with the reason why

165
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a discriminatory statement.

166
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.800
Magan: About yeah

167
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.050
Magan: Okay, moving on. It's exactly what he did.

168
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.830
Yeah.

169
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

170
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.640
Magan: So he and then he. What else did he say

171
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:43.950
Magan: Well, I then I bought up. I said, well, Chris, I understand. I'm going to take responsibility for my situation. I'm not trying to put point the finger at anybody else. However, there was a lot of

172
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:58.560
Magan: Opportunities for miscommunications. And he goes, Well, yeah, I noticed that the calls kept getting dropped. I was like, yeah, we put in the work order for it. Nobody's fixed it every time I tried to transfer call the call gets dropped

173
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:09.570
Magan: And I was like, so he kind of tried to put that on me as well. And I was like, No, no, no, no. There's a work order into that. And I was like,

174
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:19.800
Magan: Also, all of you guys have each other's numbers. So why am I calling the director of the airport in the middle of the night, when the chain of command is supposed to be contacting each other.

175
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.410
Magan: Like

176
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:29.550
Magan: I was like, I read the email that says that chain of command will notify chain of command I was I the one that was doing all of it.

177
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:45.960
Magan: And he goes, well, Jane asked you to do it. I was like, correct. And I did it, I was like, but the phones are not are not my problem. That's not my issue they get dropped this because there's a technical issue going on in there that I can't fix

178
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:54.990
Magan: And I told him, I said, James had his book out in front of and following that direction by direction on how to park a call and transfer it and it wasn't working.

179
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.850
Magan: And then I just kind of

180
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.820
Magan: So when I when I was crying.

181
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.240
Magan: My voice gets kind of caught and I was

182
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.700
Magan: I was breathing, but I wasn't breathing. The way that you taught me to breathe.

183
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:19.410
Magan: I was taking deep breaths and I was looking up and I was blowing out okay because I was really upset.

184
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:35.010
Magan: Because, and I told him I I please excuse me, I apologize for crying. However, when I get upset and I get extremely emotional. This is how my body reacts. That's what I told him. Yeah, and

185
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.820
Magan: Then he made that daughter comment and I you know I actually got really upset about that. I was like, you

186
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:43.860
Magan: Like you

187
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.270
Magan: Like, and I even said it in my head like you're a fucking pig your tour girls your four daughters.

188
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.130
Magan: But OK.

189
00:21:53.610 --> 00:22:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So the have a thought. I don't know if it's useful to you, but this is what would have been going on for me if I was in that chair that you were in it would be something

190
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting cross right the chain of command. Typically, you know, manager, supervisor someone that's had years of experience and

191
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: critical incident discussions and larger systems decision making, they tend to talk to each other. I was directed to do it. I don't have the training, nor the title. Are you going to continue to be comfortable with my taking that role on

192
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.180
Magan: Oh, that's good.

193
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.530
Magan: So this is what I'm taking from that.

194
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.120
Magan: Because this just this just came into my head as you just said that.

195
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:54.210
Magan: If I get asked by the associate director to contact the director and CIO and everybody else. I'm going to ask them if they could please do it.

196
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.410
Magan: I would appreciate it if they do it. That's what I want to say, but then I'm asked to do something. You know what I mean.

197
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly what I'm talking about. But you don't lose all your

198
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Power right there. So notice how the power is in. I'm not interested in being set up as the fall guy.

199
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So any

200
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Director. What the what I am happy to be in service to whatever directives I receive. I don't have formal training in this. Can you please identify how you would like me to

201
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Address, blah blah blah, in case my authority is called into question when the director of the airport asked me, I can say I was directed by user to do ABC. What are those things. I haven't got proper training in this one. Is it that you'd like me to do.

202
00:23:47.520 --> 00:24:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This is allocating up. This is managing up right what I just did. This is not my idea. I'm airport, blah, blah. I was informed to follow the following procedures and and I'm relaying this to you. And this is care of the authority of

203
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:17.160
Magan: And you know what's really weird is when this was all happening. I felt really proud of myself.

204
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.420
Magan: I really did. And, and even James the

205
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.130
Magan: Person that was in the room with me. He turned and he said, Megan you handle that, like a boss.

206
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:39.330
Magan: Yeah, like, he's like, You did so good. He goes every you had everything done before I even needed to ask, do I need to do this or do this. It was already done it was or you're already

207
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:48.900
Magan: completing the task. He's like, You just, you did really good and he's lower than me on the totem pole seniority wise but he's my equal. He's my tier

208
00:24:50.730 --> 00:25:05.640
Magan: And he said that to me. And it meant a lot to me. And then when he saw that I came in upset but I continued my shift. He asked me what was wrong and I shared with him what happened. I left parts out but I shared with him because he was in that experience with

209
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:18.060
Magan: He experienced the whole thing from beginning to end with me and he goes, I strongly, strongly disagree with this. And he goes, Chris came into the room was in, he said to me.

210
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:28.170
Magan: Oh officers in the paramedics had already decided that he wasn't cold, but he was like, No, sir. That's not what happened. They told us on air that they're going to treat it as a coven case.

211
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:35.520
Magan: But they figured it out in the field that that wasn't the case. So the only way that you can confirm that somebody is not coded positive is what they have a test on

212
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:49.620
Magan: And that shut the fuck up. He was like, well, it's taken care of. But James. James kind of pushed he he he pushed and it was kind of cool to see that like

213
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:59.400
Magan: He was like, no, wait a second, you're not going to back this into corners here. Like, you can't just confirm that Sunday's not co good positive because you're in the field with them.

214
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.650
Magan: Like they said it on a recorded air on a radio traffic air.

215
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:22.710
Magan: But I've shared it with James and James told me that he just strongly disagreed with the whole outcome of the whole event and he and he just said, You know, I'm just little me, but I do think that you did a great job and I just said, thank you.

216
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Megan you the experience that you're learning right now about what doesn't work. What does work is going to make you an outstanding supervisor. If you decide to pursue that.

217
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:50.610
Magan: Well, I've been trying to I've asked in. Hey, can I take the pre management class. Oh, no. You have to be here a year before that can happen. Okay, well I've been here a year. I'd like to take the cream management class.

218
00:26:51.480 --> 00:27:05.310
Magan: We, we can't. There's no room for it right now. Right now we're just focusing on building up the, the, what did he say building up the bodies in the center. And I was like, so every time I try to

219
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:21.810
Magan: To request training or request. I tried to take the train the trainer class. He won't let him take it. I tried to trick. Take the pre management course he won't let me take it every time that I've tried to reach out and build myself up. I get put down. Yeah.

220
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that all have done also happening in email.

221
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.330
Magan: Us know

222
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.700
Magan: So that is something that I've now learned

223
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.670
Magan: A LOT FROM HERE ON WHO I AM email. Well, since the Sydney thing happened. Yeah I email everything now everything

224
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey Chris, um, you know, we discussed yesterday.

225
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I had followed up with you after a year because six months ago, I had come to you wanting to pursue this training I've now met the year requirement and you're saying you're building the bodies up

226
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You use some phrasing about doing that. I'm assuming you mean you want certain staffing criteria, um, I'd like to know what that criteria is and also if there are other other things that I can be doing to demonstrate my my commitment to this.

227
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just it's

228
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he has to respond because I don't know if he's some of

229
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.620
Magan: The emails I sent him. Yeah, he doesn't respond

230
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.850
Magan: It doesn't matter.

231
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter if he responds

232
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, doesn't matter. There's nothing to do with it. This has to do with later on when someone says,

233
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When you go like this. Oh, what the what this person just got a promotion to supervisor or they just hired someone and not you, then you go like this. This is conflicting information. I don't understand.

234
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.170
Magan: Very good.

235
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.730
Magan: And that you just let it

236
00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Go and you don't have to hold it in your head anymore. You've already timestamp, that it sent he's elected not to respond to you. There's every communication issues.

237
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually know I've been communicating my interest to do this. I see him giving feedback to these people. This is confusing.

238
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand. He could have sent me an email and responded to it and didn't. And it's just sits there, those are facts. They just float around in an email with a timestamp on them.

239
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:28.920
Magan: So you know how. Um, I don't know if I told you this or not but I took on Lost and Found

240
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.610
Magan: I asked for more. I asked her more responsibility.

241
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:41.100
Magan: To show my willingness to I want to move up really, really want to be a supervisor and I think it would be a good supervisor, um,

242
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:56.700
Magan: But I did. I took on Lost and Found for more responsibility and then you know the cabinet in which we hold the Lost and Found items before they get dropped off for city auction Sydney had access to that cabinet.

243
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.550
Magan: And I requested that her key be removed because I felt it was a conflict of interest.

244
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:10.920
Magan: She refused to give the key to my supervisor and said no. So we took it up the chain of command. I told him he said he would take care of it.

245
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:21.120
Magan: And I asked him about it. Recently I was wondering if the key situation has been resolved, because I'd like to continue with last time, but I don't feel comfortable doing so until I know that

246
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.540
Magan: He was like, oh yeah, it's been taken care of.

247
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.360
Magan: Just that

248
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you're asking open ended question resolved could be he did. He did three jumping jacks.

249
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.630
Magan: Whether exactly the key.

250
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she have a key, sir. That's the question.

251
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:48.930
Magan: And so that's my thing here because he has that relationship with her. That's very inappropriate.

252
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.880
Magan: I feel like that is my I feel like that's my obstacle.

253
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.640
Magan: I really do, because she hates me so much.

254
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.930
Magan: She does stains me one. She fucking hates me.

255
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:01.980
Magan: She makes it

256
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:08.460
Magan: Very obvious that she hates me. She makes it playing PLAINLY OBVIOUS for everyone to see.

257
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.440
Magan: And I wonder if maybe that has an effect on

258
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.480
Magan: All these things that happen with Chris like

259
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:27.240
Magan: Like this situation. Perhaps he got an earful and he had to take it out on somebody, and I was as fallout person, I don't know, but

260
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:40.320
Magan: I feel like I keep trying and I get knocked down and he's not noticing the things that I'm trying to do the work that I'm doing. I just keep getting negative the negative and negative

261
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.050
Magan: And that's it's

262
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.270
Magan: It takes a toll.

263
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look at what you did today called out right

264
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

265
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A sore throat.

266
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.270
Magan: When

267
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Symbolically, things are unsaid. And we're sick in the throat.

268
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.130
Magan: Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah.

269
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.920
Magan: And I don't like to call in. I like, I like to be reliable.

270
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You also have a piece and this is so amazing, you know these things you're making all of this profound progress I truly do believe

271
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've mentioned this situation with Sydney

272
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There are times you've acknowledged, I kind of want to

273
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: retaliate, a little bit. I kind of want to show her put her in her place. Like I want her to feel like how I feel.

274
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.630
Magan: And beyond this. Yes, yes.

275
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That was very big of you to say that if you can hold on to that.

276
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That that humility and really see that it might still be happening in more sun ways that and that's called

277
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: A power struggle.

278
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're in a power struggle with someone

279
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And both of you don't know what it's really rough to get out of it if if at least one of you knows it, it's better. It's even better when both of you know it.

280
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And then of course it can stop, but he if you're starting to kind of get that you might be in a power struggle with her.

281
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.670
Magan: I am

282
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the lost and found the key. It'll be over. Little things like the key, it is difficult to see.

283
00:33:47.310 --> 00:34:00.120
Magan: Oh, that's what I asked him in that meeting when he was telling me this, I noticed that came out that power struggle issue came out because I asked him, Is everyone else aware of this issue.

284
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:15.330
Magan: So, and when I stepped away after I was like, why did I ask that question I and I thought about it. The reason why I asked that question is because I didn't want Sydney to know about my failure.

285
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:25.320
Magan: I didn't want her to know about my getting in trouble or doing something wrong and getting called out and getting yelled that I didn't want her to be aware of it to get

286
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:38.490
Magan: But that's true. I was I legitimately stepped away. I was like, why did I ask that. And that's why it's really comes down to her. I don't want her to know that I failed, but

287
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: See, you know what's really interesting is

288
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you fail at something when you didn't have clear directive.

289
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.720
Magan: Exactly but to her.

290
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no.

291
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, you know,

292
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter if you had a hair out of place.

293
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You will you don't get about power, you know that the power struggle is it doesn't matter what it's about. The they're going to come at you with with nonsense and you both kind of if it's true. If that struggle is going on between you two. It can be over just petty little nothing's

294
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because at least this other person doesn't have the power doesn't look like they know more than me because they're you guys are in this this particular dynamic

295
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She has more

296
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.730
Magan: Yes.

297
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: She's sleeping with the guy.

298
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.140
Magan: She's a supervisor.

299
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's a supervisor. So you're going to lose.

300
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone needs to tell mega nap.

301
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now between you and I, if you can handle this with with grace.

302
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to end up being the winner. Okay, you're going to have healthy functioning relationships, you're going to be an amazing commander of whoever you oversee

303
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know it from both sides. You're going to be proactive. It's going to be well delivered and communicated and we when people do leave with their emotions, you're going to meet them with compassion.

304
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be able to meet them with compassion and hold them accountable and then they're not just their aspect.

305
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not just your body's response to stress response.

306
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're also very capable of a functioning in the most stressful job among a few on the planet.

307
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: With no clear directives.

308
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what that business is as I failed, but your mindset around the power struggle piece.

309
00:36:54.390 --> 00:37:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Sydney. It's not worth. It's not worth it. But you don't know that yet, you're still in it.

310
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.150
Magan: It's not

311
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to get you the outcome. I think the undercurrent is

312
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I like this job. I like, I like that. I can make quick effective good solid decisions, even in the absence of clear directives, I think you like that about yourself now. Not a lot of people, James caught it.

313
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see it. And I have a very fragile grasp on really what you're doing. I, but I know you've got it. And I think you like it in you and that's what keeps you in this job.

314
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.500
Magan: I think you're right. With that, because

315
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:48.570
Magan: Every decision. So a lot of my powers were taken away for a very long time in a lot of ways.

316
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.740
Magan: I'm against my will and

317
00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:02.610
Magan: I didn't say anything or I didn't do anything. I've heard every single response as to why that was the way that it was right. But for me.

318
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:16.710
Magan: When I'm working in this job when I'm answering a call and I'm handling it literally from beginning to end. And I'm directing my officers to get them to go somewhere to do something and they listen

319
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.290
Magan: And I make a choice that I know not only protects them.

320
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.410
Magan: But it protects all the people involved. That gives me

321
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.310
Magan: It gives it gives me. What is the word. It's like

322
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.930
Magan: We it's it's re confirming that feeling of

323
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.410
Magan: Suck. Yeah. You know, like, yes.

324
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.630
Magan: Like, it's a good feeling. It's not a bad feeling and even when it is really, really hard.

325
00:38:53.700 --> 00:39:01.320
Magan: Like I've been there over a year. And that's the first time that I've ever been called into a room and told no, no, no, no, no.

326
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.700
Magan: I've been there almost two years and that's the first time that's happened.

327
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.590
Magan: So I feel like I'm doing something right.

328
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use the

329
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give this some some words so it can have some some usefulness on this. It's if that is fueling if it feeds something if it gives you what you need, right, that

330
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I can count on my own intellect.

331
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: My own

332
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.530
Magan: Decision making.

333
00:39:46.710 --> 00:40:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I can count on my own decision making. I see it call after call after call the complex nature of my own decision making, not only on a small groupings, but the larger community.

334
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I can rely on that. That's good.

335
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say it's

336
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say it feeds and fuels the I'm enough

337
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.950
Magan: Yeah, I absolutely think so.

338
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's go to the power struggle.

339
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: With

340
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How does. I want to be the only one to have the key to

341
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Boston found

342
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that fuel I'm enough

343
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:04.050
Magan: It means I'm enough because she gave it up. It's been handed to me.

344
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.120
Magan: Upon request.

345
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.720
Magan: And now I'm in charge of it and

346
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.500
Magan: I was trusted enough. I was

347
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.870
Magan: I was

348
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.250
Magan: Believed in enough to be able to handle this from beginning 10

349
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:41.880
Magan: Successful and I don't want anybody fucking it up for me. And she has that power if she has that key. She has that power if she doesn't have that key and I'm enough. I can do this. But if she has that key everything's fucked up. That's how that's how it feels to me.

350
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If it comes down to this.

351
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This puts me in such a risky position because of accountability.

352
00:41:51.330 --> 00:42:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And the chain of command is subject to error. I'm going to pull back from this position of working in Lost and Found Chris when you just leave it to me. It eliminates all these other pieces.

353
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That I have only myself to answer for where things are placed set and accounted for. I really want to demonstrate to you that I can take on these additional responsibilities, but when it's shared with someone else.

354
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes works both ways. She might end up being held responsible for something. Maybe I did or didn't do. And it works both ways.

355
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm going to pull back on the key position and I'm going to go ahead and if she wants to completely different to me. And when you guys decide that I really want that more but I'm really uncomfortable with that being shared. She and I have

356
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a real

357
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Flow of communication and it's risky. So I'm going to pull back from that now.

358
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How, what does that make you think about that, that option is out there.

359
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:54.750
Well,

360
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.890
Magan: I did say that actually along, um,

361
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.620
Magan: So I said to him,

362
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:16.710
Magan: Chris i'm i'm really not comfortable with the idea of both Sydney and I having access to the same items if one of them goes missing. My name is on all those papers right now not only leaves me

363
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.650
Magan: In a, in a tight situation or at risk. It also leaves Sydney at risk, and I did say this

364
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:32.400
Magan: And I said to him I would feel more comfortable if I just give it back to her. At this point, I had no idea that

365
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:41.400
Magan: It was going to be such a struggle to try to get a key for lost and found when she stated she no longer wanted to no longer wanted the responsibility.

366
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:50.970
Magan: So until she's ready to actually give it up. I think perhaps you should still handle. And he said, no, he said he was going to take care of it.

367
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that's

368
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What is about everything.

369
00:43:54.270 --> 00:44:03.630
Magan: Uh huh. And then when I addressed him again and asked him, Hey, what's going on with the key situation, it's been resolved that that gives me know keep one

370
00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't ask closed ended questions.

371
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:12.240
Magan: And that's my problem. I should have asked him straight up is the key in your possession

372
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but the

373
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Other among other there's all these other solutions. It might be you're in this power struggle and it might be time to pull back. I don't know. But my point is

374
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If the men. If you're going to have to have this I'm enough

375
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: By having the key.

376
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You might end up

377
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.330
Magan: hurting myself in the long run.

378
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm enough could be filled with I'm enough and I don't need this position. This is dangerous. I'm going to lose when people are there, there's a

379
00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Dual relationship going on that and you've got someone who gives you fav responses, who isn't a credible person who's saying it's been handled they talking outside of their mouth. If it's handled. Excellent. So we say for media to assume that no one else has access to this.

380
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm now responsible. So, is that right, no one else has a key you don't follow it up with

381
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.400
Magan: So I'm going to do that tonight.

382
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:21.750
Magan: Um,

383
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, like

384
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but it could be this other thing.

385
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You might assess the situation. If you really see him.

386
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That he's unable to give you a direct answer you could really piss him off. He may not want to answer your direct question and it might be just saying that it might be time to say I'm enough

387
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The timing of me taking on more responsibility, the composition of the Sydney, Chris affair with her as my supervisor. This isn't the right timing. I'm enough

388
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not going to be working Lost and Found. Now I'm trying to understand. Man, I can't, I can't possibly give you advice. I'm just saying that you can get the I'm enough piece, you can get the the the

389
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.280
Magan: Without the last in film.

390
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact it reaffirms it by saying I don't need this. I'm good. Oh, you know what, Chris.

391
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'll keep my eye out. And please let me know if another opportunity where I can really demonstrate additional responsibility comes up, but I think I think at this point. Here's the key.

392
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not and and i just i hit a hit an email, right before I came in here.

393
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's putting so much

394
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know risk into not being able to see who's responsible for something going missing.

395
00:46:51.870 --> 00:47:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just it kind of occupies my mind. And there's this crisis going on in our community and really want to focus my attention here and go do a better job when I'm not having to wonder, you know, whether something might go missing.

396
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, guess who's in charge you.

397
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.180
Magan: He is

398
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

399
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you are. You said here your ski.

400
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you put it in an email and you're done you're waiting for him. You giveaway giveaway here when. How about now when when when when when when you got your answer.

401
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You just don't like it.

402
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.250
Magan: He has

403
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Answers. Now I'm sleeping with this girl woman, whatever, and work it out. And again,

404
00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's handle stuff coming to my office about it, but you don't like, sir. That's different than you got an answer.

405
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.860
Magan: No, you're right.

406
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And he doesn't sound like the China get

407
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.520
Magan: Hard to buy it.

408
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where the power. That's where the I'm enough comes in. That's where you go, I'm in a power struggle and you let go and you say,

409
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm enough

410
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, Chris. I'm going to keep my eye out for another opportunity and and then you continue if you decide to go that route of accountability through email I you know I'm you know like we talked about before. I'll keep my eye out for another one. This one doesn't seem, you know,

411
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Seemed like the best one I want. You know what I'll do is I'll focus my attention here it seems like you know there's, you know, and hey if you're open. I can give you some ideas about how to

412
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Set up some protocol, maybe you know you planning on doing that in the next week.

413
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of some difference, you know, specific ways of speaking to folks that kind of our labeling at this how you want us to label it when we are doing the dispatch over here and here. I'll keep my eye out for that.

414
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's managing up you guys, nobody teaches you how to manage up

415
00:48:52.260 --> 00:49:05.340
Magan: I have another question of which is kind of separate from this, but so I spoke to Dr. Aubrey al about my medication. So my pain levels have been extremely high lately.

416
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:26.460
Magan: Especially like when I wake up, I'm really, really stiff on it's hard to get my body moving my back is just, it's locked up. I'm in so much pain and all I can experience like pain, pain, pain, pain. So I've been taking five milligrams instead of four.

417
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:44.010
Magan: And I cut myself short on that because I did that. And granted, I have to give Dr. Aubrey out for do she didn't argue with me. She didn't fight with me, she didn't like knock me down and say, oh, no, you're doing this wrong. She said, okay, and I really, really, really appreciated that.

418
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.290
Magan: A lot

419
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.750
Magan: But I think

420
00:49:50.580 --> 00:50:03.660
Magan: Does it mean I'm failing at the program because I went up to five rather than stay at four and granted my prescription does say four milligrams, but I've been taking five every day because of my pain.

421
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:16.470
Magan: So I don't know what that does for me in the program or if that messes everything up for my prescription. I just want to make sure that I communicate this with somebody, so that you're aware

422
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:18.030
Magan: It.

423
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like to talk to her about it.

424
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:34.860
Magan: Well, I did, but I didn't say that, like, hey, on permanently on five milligrams. She's still she's still prescribed four milligrams. So I think the best option is to go to group. I don't know when my group is though.

425
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:37.170
Magan: You miss it. You, you, you.

426
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: told me you were going to go. I wrote it down, you are going to go march 23

427
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: down now.

428
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:52.380
Magan: Oh, crap. Okay, can I go next week because I had the money to go. So I set it aside to make sure that I can go

429
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So next group is

430
00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: March 30 at you're saying you want to go at 1pm

431
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.120
Magan: Yes, please.

432
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:10.680
Magan: Okay, I'll go to that one. Let me put it in my schedule as well. I will attend that and I'll just talk to her. Then, and let her know

433
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've only got three minutes left.

434
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We touched on a lot of issues.

435
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.120
The

436
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll let the physician kind of handle the I self medicated but that is self medication.

437
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.120
So,

438
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't use the word fail, but that's a word he used in the work to hey I failed. I mad at myself. Now you see things in that pass fail and don't quite see it like that. So I think

439
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Good copy her will get to kind of process that if you want, or if there's time I'll even know what's going to, you know, we never know, but

440
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: When

441
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:57.690
Magan: I will attend to 30 I will. Okay, so

442
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a couple minutes here.

443
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you coming away with today. What are you leaving with what's important, what's going to you're going to be sort of sitting with and marinating in here.

444
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:11.220
Magan: I think when I'm going to be sitting with today.

445
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:20.490
Magan: Is processing and really applying the I Am enough in regards to this key situation.

446
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:39.090
Magan: I really have to, I really wanted lost and found that I wanted it bad. Not just because I think it's cool, but also because it really is an opportunity for me to show more responsibility and incentive to rise.

447
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:53.640
Magan: But if that is not if this is not that opportunity. I have to accept that. And I think that's what I need to focus on today. That's what I need to marinate on again.

448
00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:01.950
Magan: Yes. Is acceptance of the fact that this may not be that opportunity that I wanted for myself.

449
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:13.170
Magan: And it is putting me in in a very sticky situation and it is really only continuing this power struggle with Sydney. It's only making it worse.

450
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:25.380
Magan: So if it's not all on my shoulders. At that point, and I washed my hands of it, of course, I still have to do Lost and Found regardless because everybody does, but I won't be in charge of the whole system.

451
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:26.910
Magan: And

452
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what will happen is they will notice the inconvenience of how much you've been doing. And maybe, maybe they will throw up their hands and say, You know what, here's the key, the only key. We don't know.

453
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:40.680
Magan: Yeah.

454
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a possibility to. We don't know, but

455
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you're not engaged in a power struggle, at least not around the key. It might still come up in three other pockets, but

456
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.770
Magan: You're free one less for me to worry what

457
00:53:54.150 --> 00:54:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: One less. So there's endless possibilities, but that's got that one. That one's something you're going to give something

458
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:02.730
Magan: I am

459
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.470
Magan: Do you want. Thank you for today.

460
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.820
Magan: Yes. Next Friday.

461
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

462
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.220
Magan: And I would like to do, em, Dr. Next Friday.

463
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really,

464
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, yeah.

465
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.030
Magan: I just need to go break through a little block.

466
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:18.570
Morning.

467
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Good thing. Now those of you who really do the intense pieces there needs to be a little, a little extra time to really like get all the way past the OH MY GOSH moment and then sell it back in and I'm happy to do that.

468
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's do it.

469
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.180
Magan: Yes. Okay.

470
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

471
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:52.590
Magan: I mean, I noticed that it's helping I noticed that things are happening when it's happening. And that carries significance for me and

472
00:54:54.150 --> 00:55:01.320
Magan: I don't know, I, I just see growth in different areas. I do. So it's subtle, but it's there, it's

473
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Subtle but meaningful.

474
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.760
Magan: Yes. So, but meaningful. It is this and I'm

475
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Fighting because.

476
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.460
Magan: Trying to look out for a little meeting, you know,

477
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of what you said early on, and then I'll have to go by, I can see my client WAITING IN THERE IS ON YOU SAID, I'M AFRAID. This won't work.

478
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.050
Magan: Yeah.

479
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't work before

480
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.570
Magan: Yeah, before like a train wreck. Yeah.

481
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So take take time and really see what you just said in

482
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Small meaningful ways I'm changing I'm taking care of a little Meghan

483
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what it's all about.

484
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:48.570
Exactly.

485
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:55.650
Magan: It I'm I appreciate it. I do. It's intense, don't get me wrong, it is intense. Well,

486
00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:00.930
Magan: It's a, it's worth. It's worth the juice is worth the squeeze

487
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:01.740
Yeah.

488
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.420

Gwenevere Abriel: Do I need to send a message to the doc. Do you need. Do you have enough medication to get you to Monday.

Magan: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have enough to get me to Monday.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:24.510
Magan: All right, and then I'm just going to talk to her, let her know I hope she doesn't get upset with me.
