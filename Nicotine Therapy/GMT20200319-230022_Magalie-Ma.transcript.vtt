Yeah.

50
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:15.660
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yeah, and I, they were doing too well I was looking for them to close up. So I figured it's best. I guess I could have fought and got back in, but

51
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.970
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Let me go for a reason. I mean I had been staying clean so

52
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.460
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Maybe they thought it

53
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.770
Magalie Marcellus: Might have been for you weren't being discharged because of non compliance or anything like that.

54
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.960
Magalie Marcellus: No, it was mostly from insurance.

55
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.710
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yes, absolutely. I wasn't. I've never been in trouble or anything like that. So,

56
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.140
Galaxy Tab A (2017): You know, and everybody that they had a lot of them had been in trouble or

57
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:53.370
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Was going through the system and stuff like I kind of felt like I was, you know, I don't know, maybe, maybe they didn't really want me hit no on that one, though.

58
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.950
Magalie Marcellus: And I'm

59
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.930
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Doing very well, why was there.

60
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.720
Magalie Marcellus: So to get started with the program. So what was the drugs or what's the actual substance use.

61
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.010
Magalie Marcellus: And when

62
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.700
Magalie Marcellus: I started

63
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.460
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I, the thing that got me started was

64
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.060
Galaxy Tab A (2017): When I got married in Percocet.

65
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.630
Galaxy Tab A (2017): That's what got started, I started taking Percocet and I got up to like

66
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.910
Galaxy Tab A (2017): About 10 perk 30 a day.

67
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.230
Galaxy Tab A (2017): And as that got a little costly.

68
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.600
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I just lead into other cheap cheaper drugs.

69
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.430
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Heroin

70
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.200
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Heroin

71
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.610
Magalie Marcellus: So the percocet wasn't being prescribed for a reason, or you just gotta handle that.

72
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.930
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I'm actually my husband. They were prescribed to my husband.

73
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.410
Galaxy Tab A (2017): And I was drinking at the time and working at the hospital so

74
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:12.390
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Instead of having this big hangover. I took one of his Percocet and that's what got me started. It took all the pain away and I was working for jobs at the time and

75
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.040
Galaxy Tab A (2017): They will do everything. Keep everything on you know

76
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.290
Magalie Marcellus: Taking it so you can function.

77
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.560
Magalie Marcellus: With your work and everything else.

78
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.790
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yeah.

79
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.420
I was

80
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.430
Working a lot

81
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.730
Magalie Marcellus: And that was about what you when you started

82
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.330
Galaxy Tab A (2017): That was 2009 when I got married.

83
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.490
Galaxy Tab A (2017): So,

84
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.200
Magalie Marcellus: Right after you got married. Oh, was it

85
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.880
Magalie Marcellus: Was nothing else going on.

86
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.800
Galaxy Tab A (2017): No, I wouldn't take a pill. When I first got married so

87
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.440
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I guess 2012 is when I finally gave in and said, Yeah, I'll take one of those give me

88
00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.040
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

89
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:06.480
Magalie Marcellus: All right, I'm a little bit confused. You want to get a little bit of the timeline. So you started taking them in 2012 or 2009

90
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:21.060
Magalie Marcellus: Oh 2012 off because you say you started out as a program from 2012 So was it like a short time that you were using, and then went into a program or were you using for a little bit before you got into

91
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:38.460
Galaxy Tab A (2017): My program that program that there was a couple, but they're different you when you know this one that I just went to that one was seeing people appear. We have pay doctors, you pay to go get 'em.

92
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.460
Galaxy Tab A (2017): You pretty much paid money.

93
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.470
Magalie Marcellus: Goes into prescription time

94
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.790
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yeah yeah

95
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.780
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

96
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.100
Galaxy Tab A (2017): And they did a fast group session in there and then they let you go.

97
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:57.810
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Hmm. In an hour a month and they give you a script for an hour that I would

98
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.950
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I wasn't doing good on that.

99
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.140
Magalie Marcellus: So the script was what, what kind of medication, where you been

100
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:15.930
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I was when I first started, they put me on the orange pills Suboxone okay

101
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.900
Galaxy Tab A (2017): And then I shortly had rushed to the emergency room that they had over here.

102
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:35.760
Galaxy Tab A (2017): As my lip my ice. I don't know what it was, but my lips swelled up and my something in my throat started swelling up

103
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.360
Magalie Marcellus: So we're having a reaction to the pill or something else.

104
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.840
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yeah, that's, that's, I'm supposed to wear a bracelet.

105
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.430
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Okay and I'm so I'm just, that's what made me scared of taking pills.

106
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.040
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Mm hmm. That right there kind of scared me. But I've been on this.

110
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.150
Galaxy Tab A (2017): So,

111
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:25.920
Galaxy Tab A (2017): kind of scared to take anything else because that happens. I mean I had like three seconds and to die. And that was so scary. So

Magalie Marcellus: I was never treated

443
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:51.540
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Nope, never treated. Not until they found out, and then he had to go to Cleveland to get his stomach pumped.

444
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.710
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Once a month.

445
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.190
Magalie Marcellus: You wouldn't stop drinking

446
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.150
Galaxy Tab A (2017): And your mom.

447
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.680
Galaxy Tab A (2017): My mom. She just has anxiety.

448
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.670
Galaxy Tab A (2017): As far as know how she's

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.280
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Um, she used to drink, but she quit drinking, kind of like me.

450
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:28.410
Galaxy Tab A (2017): That alert. We had an allergic reaction. Both of us did to an alcohol and our face kept getting red every time we drink so

451
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.190
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Let's just sense even doing this, you know,

452
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.270
Magalie Marcellus: I would do it.

453
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.400
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, okay.

454
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.290
Magalie Marcellus: Western the relationship all has a relationship with your mom.

455
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.370
It's

456
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.120
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Okay. When I was in drug use. I stole from my parents.

457
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.740
Galaxy Tab A (2017): So that was when I was in, you know,

458
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.200
Galaxy Tab A (2017): When I was using

459
00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:04.410
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Mm hmm. And so getting that relationship back with her and my stepfather was very hard.

460
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.430
Magalie Marcellus: With you. Yeah. So we built that relationship.

461
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:19.590
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Yes, absolutely. I mean, like right now. You know, why can't I be in their house. I'm sitting outside of their house. He's in the Wi Fi.

462
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.810
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

463
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.290
Magalie Marcellus: So, and your stepfather. He's I'm in Ohio. No.

464
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.840
Galaxy Tab A (2017): No, he's in Florida with her.

465
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.520
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

466
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.410
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Here, my mom, pretty much.

467
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:35.730
Magalie Marcellus: That's good.

468
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.840
Galaxy Tab A (2017): That's all.

469
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:45.120
Magalie Marcellus: So he so you say your passive voice at a story. So he's been there since you've been little

470
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.470
Galaxy Tab A (2017): He's been

471
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.150
Galaxy Tab A (2017): A mom can

472
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.560
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah. He's been with me since

473
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:59.340
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Then, so I still calm and by his first name, but he doesn't have a big relationship with his own kids but

474
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.640
Galaxy Tab A (2017): He sees me more than does them.

475
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.640
Magalie Marcellus: Do you guys have a relationship.

476
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:11.250
Galaxy Tab A (2017): We have a better relationship than he does with his own kids.

477
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.050
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Because he's put up with my teenage years, you know, and

478
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.030
Galaxy Tab A (2017): I guess.

479
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.680
Magalie Marcellus: And

480
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.630
Magalie Marcellus: And his substance abuse with them or mental health when you're in a household

481
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.330
Galaxy Tab A (2017): Where he's the alcoholic.

482
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:48.150
Galaxy Tab A (2017): So he drinks, he's put it down. He's that drinkin and then you know in Florida, he'll start drinking, then I'll come home and he won't drink. And so it's kind of an on and off thing with him.

483
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.020
Magalie Marcellus: And how many sentences you have

484
00:38:54.030 --> 00:39:01.020
Galaxy Tab A (2017): We just found out a couple years ago I had a sister, and that my mom gave up at birth in

485
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.190
Galaxy Tab A (2017): She ended up finding my mom which that was really cool.
