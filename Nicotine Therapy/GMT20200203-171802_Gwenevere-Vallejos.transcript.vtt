00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.050

LG Stylo 5: Us. I was um I I stayed at her house until today until yesterday.

15
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:09.870
LG Stylo 5: I went to church with her and stuff yesterday. And then she was just letting me use her car while she was at work and stuff to go for applications and stuff and

16
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.100
LG Stylo 5: I kind of got a lot of applications in and then

17
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.960
LG Stylo 5: And

18
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.980
LG Stylo 5: Then when I came back yesterday. My mom had

19
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.800
LG Stylo 5: Had a paper for me that her

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.480
LG Stylo 5: One of her friends works out at Macy's at the mall or do not may seem to dealers. Okay.

21
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.010
LG Stylo 5: And

22
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.300
LG Stylo 5: That's where I was. Now, I took. I took the bus or there this morning early and then

23
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.230
LG Stylo 5: I was going to be real late so I called my mom and told her she couldn't work right click can pick me up and bring come join me off, but

24
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that was awfully responsive. What do you think of you that you you put this this program in such

25
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A priority. What do you think of you.

26
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.550
LG Stylo 5: I feel better since Wednesday night because I feel like I've been in competition because

27
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.560
LG Stylo 5: Since I since that day. I really haven't really

28
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.620
LG Stylo 5: accomplished much like good like job wise and applications and

29
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.170
LG Stylo 5: Stuff like that. But

30
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.820
LG Stylo 5: Um,

31
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.390
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I don't know how you feel good.

32
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but but specifically around making sure that you didn't miss

33
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.950
LG Stylo 5: This

34
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Event. Do you see, you see that a year ago, do you think you would have done that or you thinking would have blown this off.

35
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.550
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I probably would have

36
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.730
LG Stylo 5: Yeah yeah

37
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did was incredibly mature so adult

38
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Really adult. Does it feel like that.

39
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.990
Yeah.

40
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.240
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, and

41
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.510
LG Stylo 5: I guess I would just kind of

42
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.080
LG Stylo 5: Scared or not scared, but just because how what had happened with the

43
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.480
LG Stylo 5: Most work. Yeah. And I so I wanted to make sure I was here.

44
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So for a while out them. That's how it is right, we have this

45
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.270
LG Stylo 5: Motivation. I

46
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to, you know, have to come off of the subs abruptly. I want to make sure I get my medicine for a while. It's that and then later on.

47
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You start to say, oh, I need this, I need to connect with a therapist. I need to talk through my fear, I need to talk through I need this healing experience of talking with another human being. It feels good. I'm healing.

48
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Later on, it becomes

49
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That. But in the front end of treatment. Sometimes it's things like I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to kick the opiates and be sweaty and miserable and throwing up and crapping myself. I don't want that.

50
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.950
LG Stylo 5: For some

51
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and over time, it changes so that you can see. Eventually, the value of what it does for your soul for your heart.

52
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me a little bit about what you got from being at church, tell me.

53
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.240
LG Stylo 5: I don't know, I just

54
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:33.330
LG Stylo 5: It's like she goes to a, it's a big church. It's like, it's like the movie theater something bigger than bigger than a movie theater and there's like vehicles. I know I never been to church like W port and

55
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:45.150
LG Stylo 5: When I went with her before she was going to like a smaller church, but I guess she had just recently started going to this new church and

56
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:58.920
LG Stylo 5: I don't know if it has big old TV screens like I don't know. It's crazy. And there's like a lot of people like, I don't know. And it was it was cool. Actually, I kinda like that truth. She was more like

57
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.990
LG Stylo 5: Like for like younger people, I guess like got to know like

58
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There were some people that you could maybe relate to a little bit there.

59
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.720
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I like it.

60
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.500
LG Stylo 5: was nice. I enjoyed him.

61
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you hear anything that sort of struck you that you related to

62
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.860
LG Stylo 5: I'm not really because even my aunt says that

63
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.150
LG Stylo 5: We picked the wrong day the wrong Sunday to go because

64
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.270
He

65
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.160
LG Stylo 5: Um,

66
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.100
LG Stylo 5: He wasn't really talking about

67
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.170
Like

68
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.460
LG Stylo 5: I guess the Bible. I guess he was just

69
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.880
LG Stylo 5: You were just going. You were just talking about kind of some random stuff but

70
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.500
LG Stylo 5: It was, I don't know, I just like it was cool. And what

71
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you go again.

72
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.670
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I told her that I would go this next Sunday. All right.

73
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's it like to stay with your audience versus your mom's

74
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.570
LG Stylo 5: I talked to talk more

75
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.550
Yeah.

76
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom seem like she's still kind of judgmental.

77
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.430
LG Stylo 5: I guess like

78
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:34.200
LG Stylo 5: I don't know. She's just she just I guess for the job situation that's what she's really like

79
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.710
LG Stylo 5: Because I love that I quit my job, or I lost my job right, everyone.

80
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she see that you're doing everything you can.

81
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.110
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, totally. Because last time she last time.

82
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:59.100
LG Stylo 5: I got a job like it was the fastest ever got a job like I i did the application and I didn't even call he called me and within like three hours.

83
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember that.

84
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was a pretty unique

85
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.460
LG Stylo 5: Scenario. Yeah, exactly. And so in Jesus thinks that like

86
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.600
LG Stylo 5: I could just do that again or something new.

87
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.220
Okay.

88
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: She gets to think that you got to maintain yourself out. And I realized that was a one off that it would happen that fast most jobs. I mean, sometimes it can take a month. I mean, it just, it just does. That's just timing.

89
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.460
LG Stylo 5: And then what you don't understand is because she goes to I guess you don't see me.

90
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:50.850
LG Stylo 5: Doing stuff because she goes to work out five in the morning. She don't she don't she don't get home until like almost like three o'clock. So the term that she's at work is when I'm doing everything and then when she gets home at like three she sees me. Not really.

91
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:57.390
LG Stylo 5: Doing the job situation. So she thinks that I haven't done anything at all in any

92
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. So let's talk about is it important to you to show her to prove to her. How important is it is. It's not that we won't spend another minute on it. But if it is we could be creative and figure out a way

93
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want her to believe you.

94
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.310
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I do. But it's just that I understand where she's coming from because I have

95
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.090
LG Stylo 5: liked her a lot when I was using and stuff.

96
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.340
LG Stylo 5: And

97
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.290
LG Stylo 5: So that's, I understand where she's coming from but I just

98
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.350
LG Stylo 5: Wish you would believe me, like when I'm

99
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.910
LG Stylo 5: When I'm really actually doing it.

100
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, how important is it because we can come up with a way to show for that you're doing this.

101
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:56.370
LG Stylo 5: I guess it's not important to sure that I'm doing. I just wanted to just get the job in big like had told you I've been doing

102
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all right, fine, but if you decide to you can take a picture of where you are. You can take a picture of the application, but just be flooding or with them five applications, a day, this was complete. This was complete. This one's complete. You see what I'm saying.

103
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.500
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

104
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not see if you want to, if she's giving you such a hard time, you could say, well, this is, this is what the job is I get to have rent. But this is what I do is I show her

105
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.930
You could decide

106
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.880
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I could have been doing that, I guess, cuz she just wasn't

107
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.730
LG Stylo 5: She just wasn't believing like because when she gets home like I would

108
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:46.230
LG Stylo 5: It would really be, like, three o'clock, so I will like sometimes I go meet my brothers, because he gets off at like 240 from school and his cause like

109
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.460
LG Stylo 5: Pretty much to cross the street. So he walks to school and walks home from school and

110
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:10.920
LG Stylo 5: Sometimes I'll just go there and in meet them and then when I get back. She'll. She'll be here and then she'll be like, she'll think that I that I was gone all day that I'm just barely getting back like it's just I don't know if he just thinks pages.

111
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's up to you. Right. But you have that choice. If you take the belief away that you shouldn't have to that you should be trusted. If you take that out of the picture.

112
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say to yourself, you know what, I'm appreciative that my mother is giving me this space to come back here.

113
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to show her that I am I'm want to earn her trust back even if I don't agree with the fact that I broke it however you make that in your mind.

114
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You could decide from today forward to show her because it may only take a day and doing it, then she's off your back and she's believing you for the rest of the month, or it may take two days or whatever. But my point is

115
00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to spend time repairing that a little bit. I don't know.

116
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.320
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Cuz I do wanna

117
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.240
LG Stylo 5: I do want to trash man believe

118
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.310
LG Stylo 5: When I tell her.

119
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing something right. Because how else do people know we only know what we can see with her eyes and, you know, and there was an erosion of trust. I think when you know you went back to her at, you know, to the your children's mother.

120
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.920
LG Stylo 5: Mm hmm.

121
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: She's kind of like, well, now I don't know if what he's saying is true and does you really see how important is that he contribute income, etc. So just just saying it might be an option for you. I'm going to walk away from the screen and go put socks on, it is freezing in this House.

122
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And my feet are bear. So I'm gonna go grab some socks.

123
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll

124
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Be right back.

125
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.140
LG Stylo 5: Hi red

126
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not far

127
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.230
Okay.

128
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:35.760
LG Stylo 5: Now you're seeing the difference with my at my moment just when I was over there for like those four days or whatever.

129
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.610
LG Stylo 5: I just

130
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.120
LG Stylo 5: It just felt on on different like I couldn't

131
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.510
LG Stylo 5: Talk to her about anything. And she's not gonna cheat on

132
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:49.980
LG Stylo 5: Me.

133
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.020
LG Stylo 5: You just never

134
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.230
LG Stylo 5: Know how my aunt's just always there and have a nice, yes.

135
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it more accepting where she's just not not

136
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not focused on the job, but more about she's interested in you. She's interested in how you're feeling what your thoughts are

137
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.980
Yeah, okay.

138
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:16.950
LG Stylo 5: My mom.

139
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.100
LG Stylo 5: Like she told me, like she told me that link. I understand.

140
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:33.060
LG Stylo 5: She'll just say I understand how you're feeling and I know I've been there with you if like my dad and stuff.

141
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.080
LG Stylo 5: She understand it's my baby's mom read every book.

142
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.610
LG Stylo 5: I didn't know

143
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's just something missing about her compassion or empathy, maybe

144
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.860
LG Stylo 5: She just don't

145
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.240
LG Stylo 5: I just could never talk to her ever

146
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to some things that we were exploring last time. Can we do that. Can we talk a little bit about some imagery

147
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As we continue to move and prepare we're into this preparation phase of, you know, down the line. I'd like to do some some trauma work with you not traumatized, you of course but want to

148
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: End our work and part of it is PREP preparing and making sure that you have to have the psychological resources and I do a lot of work with imagery

149
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice how last time I had asked you.

150
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That I wanted you to think about someone real or imagined that embodies the quality of a protective person and you said, I don't know. Do you remember that.

151
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.390
LG Stylo 5: Yeah yeah

152
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had any time to to think a little bit further on it.

153
00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.430
LG Stylo 5: You just

154
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.240
LG Stylo 5: Said it again. I just started my grandma.

155
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.910
LG Stylo 5: Grandma grandma in there then ok so

156
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.940
LG Stylo 5: The one and the one that raised me like she's already passed away. Now, or whatever, but

157
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:25.650
LG Stylo 5: The one she raised me like since I was three to like 14 or something.

158
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture her doing something saying something being protective just pull it into your awareness.

159
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture her doing something and being protective

160
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:50.760
LG Stylo 5: Just

161
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.300
LG Stylo 5: They're just raising me since I was three. I don't know. Okay.

162
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But you got an image in your mind.

163
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.580
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

164
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we have a nurturing figure of your aunt

165
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is unconditionally there for you, no matter what.

166
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: She'll say let's go to church and

167
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.650
LG Stylo 5: Write

168
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Sentences from five on

169
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Video Clips on a from a pastor

170
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.570
LG Stylo 5: And

171
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's also get an image of the quality of someone real or imagined. And if you have to go to a book or to a movie or TV show or something, you've heard or seen once you to picture the quality of someone real or imagined that is wise.

172
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.410
LG Stylo 5: That is why

173
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.550
Why

174
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time with it. You don't have to hurry not going anymore.

175
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.220
LG Stylo 5: I guess.

176
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.570
LG Stylo 5: I would say my

177
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.360
LG Stylo 5: My grandpa. Yeah, he's not really my example, but

178
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.310
LG Stylo 5: It's my my grandma, my mom's

179
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.260
LG Stylo 5: Mom's

180
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.270
LG Stylo 5: Been my guess.

181
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:57.000
LG Stylo 5: But not now because she's with some other guy now. But when I was a kid. They were married and

182
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you call them.

183
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.330
LG Stylo 5: I call them my grandpa.

184
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so we only need you to know this. It's, it's just the census quality of Grampa so pull that into your, your awareness right now.

185
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to picture him saying something doing something really representing that quality of wisdom.

186
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Present without for a minute.

187
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.370
LG Stylo 5: Like, does that mean like

188
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.260
LG Stylo 5: He does, and he will lead us through what

189
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right if someone's wise.

190
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: They know what to do. Right. They have this sort of confidence to them and

191
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were in a sense, uncertain, you would feel comfortable going

192
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.650
LG Stylo 5: To the

193
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Man and saying, I don't know what to do. What should I do. What could I do or even sometimes being in their presence, we feel more confident because they have this experience and knowledge.

194
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like he has experienced and knowledge.

195
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.040
LG Stylo 5: I don't know. I guess I wasn't, I wasn't thinking of it.

196
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.330
LG Stylo 5: That way, I guess I was just thinking like

197
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.300
LG Stylo 5: He just like because my, my dad was there.

198
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.790
LG Stylo 5: And that like I never had.

199
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.620
LG Stylo 5: Like

200
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:41.490
LG Stylo 5: A male role model. You know, I mean, I grew up with to my grandmother's. You know what I mean.

201
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.930
LG Stylo 5: So whenever our ages.

202
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.150
LG Stylo 5: And I guess he would just, he was the one that like taught me.

203
00:20:52.530 --> 00:21:02.430
LG Stylo 5: Because he was good at like building things like I remember we would go to the free market that he used to sell. There's a gift to make like these.

204
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:19.170
LG Stylo 5: Um, I guess they're like shelves. I don't know, but they're just like crazy shells and he would. My God, a wood and stuff and metal and all that and he would just show me how to do that and like work on cars and stuff. That's how I kind of learned

205
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.290
LG Stylo 5: A little bit of work.

206
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perfect. And that's perfect.

207
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This this wallaby of grandpa who can show you how to build and how to work on cars me these are just these are amazing pieces of information and knowledge that he can share he already holds them in his in his head. He doesn't

208
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, just enough to go somewhere else. He just knows how to do it and he can teach you

209
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To just really let

210
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That in and be present with that. And not only does he have this wisdom. He's also

211
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: able and willing to teach you. Okay.

212
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So the president without wise figure Grandpa.

213
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.430
LG Stylo 5: And it kind of sucks.

214
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.850
LG Stylo 5: Like, I don't even know what happened to him.

215
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.180
LG Stylo 5: He just and they got divorced or whatever.

216
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.700
LG Stylo 5: And after that he had he had his own house, but

217
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.050
LG Stylo 5: I wouldn't really see him that much like I went over there. Couple times but

218
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.360
LG Stylo 5: And then

219
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:38.100
LG Stylo 5: All of a sudden, he was just gone. He just I heard that he moved to California, Mexico.

220
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.010
LG Stylo 5: I don't know about you, close, close like I don't know but

221
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.860
LG Stylo 5: He was just

222
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.720
LG Stylo 5: That's what I thought. Okay, I guess. Yeah, that's beautiful.

223
00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there anyone else or anything that we could add to it. You can have more than one in this wise figure

224
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.330
LG Stylo 5: I guess.

225
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.710
LG Stylo 5: I didn't really

226
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.040
LG Stylo 5: I wasn't really close with Tim my

227
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.460
LG Stylo 5: Here's my here's my uncle, I guess, but he lived in California and like I would only see him.

228
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.390
LG Stylo 5: During the summertime, because every summer.

229
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:40.860
LG Stylo 5: I would, we would go out to California to take me to Disneyland and to the beach and all that stuff.

230
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:52.290
LG Stylo 5: So my uncle, he would. I would just, I would always be with him and he just knew a lot to like

231
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.130
LG Stylo 5: Let that mostly with like sports. I would say

232
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:57.990
LG Stylo 5: You

233
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.570
LG Stylo 5: Taught me all all that

234
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.670
LG Stylo 5: You would like just teach me things because I was like at the beach. I just, I didn't

235
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.710
LG Stylo 5: Really know

236
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.300
LG Stylo 5: About

237
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's your truth.

238
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: For a moment, see how true it is just bring up into your awareness, the quality of Grandpa.

239
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: As a role model of teaching how to build things with wood and metal and, you know, maybe even how to sell it. Right. And then all maybe walking with him and how to set it up and just the whole thing and then also this presence of your uncle.

240
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And he knew about sports and you could learn from his wisdom and teaching you things at the beach.

241
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to add if you can

242
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like a team.

243
00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A collection of all three.

244
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your grandma.

245
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The quality of protective sometimes people pull away from the actual image of a person because maybe there's conflict there but

246
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We really want this quality of a protective figure we want a nurturing figure of your aunt and we want this wise quality all together interacting together and surrounding you.

247
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So just take some time and do some imagery with that and tell me what what comes up for you.

248
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.210
LG Stylo 5: Don't know.

249
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do you you like to do drawings. Why don't you

250
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn, turn to a blank sheet of paper and let's see if we can have you actually sketch it

251
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Not about words. Sometimes it's about just getting it out in any way it can getting a visual on it.

252
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.020
LG Stylo 5: So I

253
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.180
LG Stylo 5: Understand

254
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like

255
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.590
LG Stylo 5: To put them

256
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.250
LG Stylo 5: All in

257
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.740
LG Stylo 5: One place.

258
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Can do that or you could have them all in the same room and have you there too. Let's see what what what it's more interesting less about my instruction.

259
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And more about what your truth is. OK, so there's no wrong way to do this.

260
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So as you look at this paper and you think I'm I'm being present with this sense of safety and protection through my grandma, I have this awareness and quality of my aunts nurturing

261
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this presence of the quality of a wise figure of grandpa and Uncle

262
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You sketch what comes up for you.

263
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.090
LG Stylo 5: And remember, this is

264
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your base course this is in the service of you.

265
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that you and I might incorporate and likely will

266
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.680
Into the work we do together.

267
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.850
LG Stylo 5: The things that, like,

268
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: They are the knowledge

269
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we've got three things protective nurturing and why figures.

270
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can be all, do they be separate from you. They can be sort of symbols, they can be. They can be anything you want. The key is that you experience them.

271
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The you can let it in and feel it helps me actively thinking about it. So that's what you're doing right now is you're actually drawing something that sort of represents that I hope

272
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.540
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

273
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.310
Take your time.

274
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.130
LG Stylo 5: No.

275
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.110
LG Stylo 5: I didn't know for some reason, I just thought

276
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.960
Like

277
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.170
LG Stylo 5: Like

278
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.470
LG Stylo 5: I don't know, I guess, I guess, for like

279
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:21.450
LG Stylo 5: Nurturing protect protector. I would just enjoy like

280
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.620
LG Stylo 5: Like

281
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.960
LG Stylo 5: Don't make sense. I guess now that I think about it.

282
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.690
LG Stylo 5: Like a lot. Hey, like a lock or something.

283
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a like good

284
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.830
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, like

285
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.260
LG Stylo 5: Key loggers and

286
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.920
I like it because it has

287
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: described it, or draw it for me.

288
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

289
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.540
Here this lock.

290
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.110
LG Stylo 5: I tell you, my, my dad came over here yesterday.

291
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what was

292
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of weird.

293
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.730
Yeah.

294
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.470
Cuz

295
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.360
I just

296
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:23.370
LG Stylo 5: Don't like even since he's been out now and he's been out since like 2017 years

297
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.230
LG Stylo 5: Like the end or like the beginning of 2018 then

298
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.620
LG Stylo 5: You still I haven't really

299
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.280
LG Stylo 5: spent time with him done anything

300
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.360
LG Stylo 5: And and

301
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.050
LG Stylo 5: I really don't like I just don't know him.

302
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.420
LG Stylo 5: But

303
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.550
LG Stylo 5: And he

304
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.360
LG Stylo 5: He just don't you just turn back more like a friend or something.

305
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.280
Ah, yeah.

306
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Would that be okay for now.

307
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: As you get to know him a little

308
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.360
Bit.

309
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you really want him yeah cuz more like sharing wisdom with

310
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.780
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I guess I would like him to be

311
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.950
LG Stylo 5: But I just

312
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.790
LG Stylo 5: I just

313
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.560
LG Stylo 5: I don't even care.

314
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You care a little and it's weird to care a little and both have lowered expectations but still a little bit of expectation leftover maybe help a mixture of feelings.

315
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.610
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I guess.

316
00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.690
LG Stylo 5: Like when he first got out like when I was getting up

317
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.760
LG Stylo 5: I didn't want nothing to do with him. And that's when I was

318
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.490
LG Stylo 5: With my baby's mama at every

319
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.410
LG Stylo 5: And she

320
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.020
LG Stylo 5: She was kind of the one that

321
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.400
LG Stylo 5: pushed me to go see him or

322
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.420
LG Stylo 5: To even talk to him talk to him.

323
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:33.780
LG Stylo 5: Because when he was like the only time you would ever try to get ahold of me, or whatever it was, when he needed something

324
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so you

325
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: May be

326
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.310
LG Stylo 5: Did you feel. Yeah, I guess.

327
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.360
LG Stylo 5: Not us. But

328
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:55.410
LG Stylo 5: But I guess he was kind of using but I didn't, I just, he just would never just call just to say like

329
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:01.920
LG Stylo 5: How you doing, how are my grandkids and stuff like that he would just

330
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.990
LG Stylo 5: I guess you'd call an act like that for the beginning of the time, but then

331
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:12.570
LG Stylo 5: Always be because he wanted some things

332
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So Adam. It could be, and you're going to have to tell me more stories about that.

333
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That he may not have it in them. You know what I mean, to be this this wise, all knowing, nurturing protective role model. He may not have it in him right now.

334
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe someday maybe not.

335
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I am I am sorry that that's the case. I wish he had it in him.

336
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But he might be so wrapped up in his own

337
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of goals and the things that he's working on the he he may not be as available to you.

338
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you need it.

339
00:34:59.250 --> 00:34:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And it kind of like

340
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.480
LG Stylo 5: That yeah I had

341
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.870
LG Stylo 5: Told them in the first place. I said,

342
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.860
LG Stylo 5: I'm writing all day like i don't i don't really

343
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:22.290
LG Stylo 5: Need a dad. I know I just, I said, if you want to make things right. I should be live for my kids.

344
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.360
Yes, and beauty.

345
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.620
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

346
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:37.650
LG Stylo 5: So he has not yet been like once, maybe twice him to come somewhere but

347
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:39.840
LG Stylo 5: He didn't

348
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.480
LG Stylo 5: Call them.

349
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.350
LG Stylo 5: It's been like a long time since he

350
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:53.310
LG Stylo 5: hasn't seen him and I know if he was to just go on his own and just show up.

351
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.960
LG Stylo 5: My baby's mom's house. I know she would

352
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.070
LG Stylo 5: Give my voice to him and be like, Yeah, take whatever you're going to do.

353
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.890
LG Stylo 5: But he. Has anyone tried

354
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.050
LG Stylo 5: That

355
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.440
LG Stylo 5: Because I had told him that because I said I don't

356
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.220
LG Stylo 5: I don't care. I said, I don't

357
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:30.030
LG Stylo 5: Care, whatever happened. You've been in prison since I was 10 years old.

358
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:42.960
LG Stylo 5: I said if you want to try to be a dad now two years on food, everything just do it to my kids and he just, I guess it hurts, because

359
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:49.410
LG Stylo 5: If I never told him that he's still waiting have done it before me.

360
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And

361
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.050
That makes sense, but

362
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.010
LG Stylo 5: Like for him. I didn't. I guess I didn't really feel like I do with my mom cuz

363
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.570
LG Stylo 5: I don't really know.

364
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Adam. In general, we humans we no matter how bad our parents treat us. It's a weird thing we unconsciously want our parents approval.

365
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We want their attention. We want their love and you can't believe it, you're like, I know don't even know this guy haven't seen him. It's been 10 years

366
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You know he did this and this and this. Why do I want this man's attention or even secondhand attention to your children. It's just innate wiring. We're just wired that way so don't judge yourself for it.

367
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:49.920
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

368
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.260
LG Stylo 5: And even like with my mom, I didn't really know her users.

369
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.110
LG Stylo 5: Like, because I was raised with but until I was

370
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:10.230
LG Stylo 5: Until I started high school, I was a freshman is when my grandma started getting sick.

371
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.650
LG Stylo 5: And then

372
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:26.400
LG Stylo 5: And then that's when my mom, I guess like stepped up and got an house for us and then

373
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.780
LG Stylo 5: Ever since then I lived with you.

374
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.850
LG Stylo 5: But

375
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:42.720
LG Stylo 5: Until that point, I didn't. I never really like I would see here and stuff like she was comes my god doesn't seem to see me and stuff like that but

376
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.370
LG Stylo 5: Not

377
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.340
LG Stylo 5: I didn't really know

378
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.420
LG Stylo 5: Me.

379
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:59.460
LG Stylo 5: And I guess that's close to my athletic as she was there the whole time I was growing up and stuff to

380
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is that some

381
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Processed feelings.

382
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Around dad or mom and it's probably going to have some impact on other relationships. So I think it's important for our work together to explore those further um we are at the top of the hour.

383
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any chance you could show me even a little

384
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Symbol that you did.

385
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.060
LG Stylo 5: I mess it up. I have

386
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A contest grade.

387
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.070
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

388
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.120
A lot like

389
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Representing protection and guidance.

390
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And

391
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.830
Notice how

392
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the was the topic of your dad.

393
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So you notice how you're saying, I don't need anything from you. I don't know you. But deep down inside right

394
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't help it.

395
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.730
LG Stylo 5: Why isn't dad.

396
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you in the right

397
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why I started with. It could be

398
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That he may not have it to give

399
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be this huge piece of acceptance that his ability

400
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To nurture to protect and to model to be a role model may not be what you need. And it doesn't mean we can't find it elsewhere. It just might

401
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:56.070
LG Stylo 5: Mean

402
00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have

403
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning you do you have on grandma, grandpa. That's what this stuff is. That's what this imagery is we get to say I am loved. I am okay I'm gonna pull in this other imagery have to slowly but surely continue to let go and grieve.

404
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The disappointment of

405
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Father, I mean,

406
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We think we've got another step.

407
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.540
LG Stylo 5: And I understand for him because

408
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.640
LG Stylo 5: Who wouldn't spend 17 years in prison.

409
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

410
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.440
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

411
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Harder in there.

412
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.120
I know

413
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.630
LG Stylo 5: He was in this and she was like 19 years

414
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do get that right, he probably didn't have what he needed either. And so how was he supposed to give it to you.

415
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.610
LG Stylo 5: Okay.

416
00:41:48.240 --> 00:42:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you and I can do is we're going to test out and see what he's really capable of and we're going to try and get it from him if he's the guy if it turns out he doesn't have it, to give then the focus is on grieving letting go and just accepting his limitations. Okay.

417
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Already felt a little soft and find out.

418
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:18.120
LG Stylo 5: What's

419
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:25.890
LG Stylo 5: Nice about soapbox injured ever remember how she gave me 10 of them. I think it was only supposed to

420
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:28.920
LG Stylo 5: Last till today so

421
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.140
LG Stylo 5: If she

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.570
LG Stylo 5: If I guess tomorrow.

LG Stylo 5: And tomorrow in group we have group tomorrow. Right.

424
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to ask for in group tomorrow, what do you need to be clear about with her.

425
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:46.260
LG Stylo 5: Just

426
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.060
LG Stylo 5: If she could just

427
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.120
LG Stylo 5: Do it a week.

428
00:42:52.770 --> 00:43:04.320
LG Stylo 5: That's what I if she could just give me because I didn't even the pharmacy guy was was tripping. Like how how she will. I don't understand. She was on she was giving me to a day because I missed

429
00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:11.340
LG Stylo 5: My group I miss group or whatever. So she gave me a link to a day so I had to go like every day you get to them.

430
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Are supposed to be on bridged So Adam I'm going to have to jump out but listen

431
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not getting if you're not getting medicine that gets you to your next service then right then there's a problem. Okay, so

432
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You have group tomorrow. Do you have another book.

433
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Tomorrow, do you have enough to get you so that you'll wake up your group and then

434
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.980
LG Stylo 5: She'll write a prescription. You're good for today. No.

435
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:45.930
LG Stylo 5: I don't have. I don't have any for today, tomorrow, but I can. I know I took my last those

436
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, but

437
00:43:46.620 --> 00:44:00.870
LG Stylo 5: You're on time. I got. Yeah, so I'll be all right until the morning and then, but I just need to ask her if she could just just ended today. Today, give me a week alone at my middle of like 17 years

438
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm fine with that you've been showing up to your last couple of a session. So let's do that. Let's go. But don't miss individual therapy with me. Okay.

439
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.020
LG Stylo 5: All right.

440
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, and so make sure you speak up tomorrow. I don't really need to text her at this point because you can follow up with her tomorrow morning.

441
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:22.260
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

442
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

443
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.570
LG Stylo 5: Listen, good luck in

444
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job hunt and if you do decide to put your ego aside and just send little quick pictures.

445
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Over to your mom and say, hey, this is what I've been doing all day safe. See, take a look. This was filled out. This one's filled out. This was filled out or take a picture of the store. This is where I am. I'm talking I'm going in here, you don't. I mean,

446
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to reassure

447
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see if it works.
