Laura lujan: And I can do to like the drug use and I was on. So whenever I got sober again and got put on it again. I stopped it again. And it's kind of a bad thing. But yeah, there's that.

269
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:51.360

273
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:04.470

274
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.740
Dawn Abriel: So you need to get back on the antidepressant. Which one were you taking

Dawn Abriel: I can see it.

361
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.250
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so let's talk about the program you're going to come on

362
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.910
Dawn Abriel: What, what percentage. Have you been told.

363
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:16.830
Laura lujan: You

364
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.810
Dawn Abriel: That you are have hearing loss.

365
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.250
Laura lujan: I shouldn't

366
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.980
Dawn Abriel: Have. Has anyone diagnosed the hearing loss by percentage. Do you have 50

367
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:45.810
Laura lujan: Yeah yeah it's 48 and 30 to 40% hearing in one year and 32% hearing another girl I don't know which ones worse, which one's better. Okay.

368
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.650
Dawn Abriel: So,

369
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.890
Dawn Abriel: Before you're going to go to group on Tuesday at seven o'clock.

370
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:18.810
Dawn Abriel: And before you go to group the night before or the day before, but you have to fill out a survey. It's called the brief addiction monitor be am

371
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.060
Laura lujan: Okay.

372
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.500
Dawn Abriel: And

373
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.730
Dawn Abriel: And once once you you'll go to the virtual clinic, like you did to get in to see me.

374
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:41.370
Dawn Abriel: Right, you go to the virtual clinic, they will check to see that you did the survey the BAM and then they'll give you the group number because the group number changes every week.

375
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:49.200
Dawn Abriel: So you have to go to the virtual clinic and they have to check to see that your insurance is up to date that you've done your urine drug screen.

376
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:59.160
Dawn Abriel: That you did your band. Okay, so any problems or anything that you want to understand better. You go to the virtual clinic there the

377
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.990
Dawn Abriel: Problem solvers.

378
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.550
Laura lujan: All right. Okay. And that's zoom everything on zoom

379
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.290
Dawn Abriel: Everything is on zoom

380
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:08.250
Every day.

381
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.470
Dawn Abriel: Once a month.

382
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.320
Dawn Abriel: The bright heart health will send you a manila envelope like this.

383
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:27.180
Dawn Abriel: Do not open it. If you open it, they won't count it, you can't use it. So you get this in the mail, you go to the virtual clinic.

384
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:37.530
Dawn Abriel: And they'll and you say, what do I do with this and they say, open it up in front of us and you'll take this out and you'll open this and then you'll go pee in the cup.

385
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:48.300
Dawn Abriel: And then you'll come back to the zoom and you'll you'll rotate the cup and show them so that they can read the results. And that's how you do that you're in.

386
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.700
Laura lujan: Drug every stands. OK. OK. I see. That's cool. Awesome. Okay.

387
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.230
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it seems a lot of

388
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.710
Trying

389
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.430
Laura lujan: My best. Okay.

390
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:13.620
Dawn Abriel: So I do electronic prescriptions. You're never going to get a piece of paper with the prescription on it. I call it into the pharmacy you you told the care coordinators, which pharmacy want to use

391
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.540
Laura lujan: Yeah. I told them that market.

392
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:27.300
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And so I'm going to give you one strip a day to get to Tuesday, and I mean in the meanwhile,

393
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:42.420
Dawn Abriel: The therapist, you and the therapist need to get together because what you're signing up for is one hour a week of group therapy one hour away a week of individual therapy. So it's

394
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.070
Dawn Abriel: Hours a week of

395
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:53.910
Dawn Abriel: Have a commitment now being to be in group. It's absolutely positively. You cannot have anyone in the same room with you.

396
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.350
Okay.

397
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:06.210
Dawn Abriel: Because if that person should accidentally see your screen and know someone who's in the group that would be a huge violation of privacy.

398
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.330
Laura lujan: Okay, so I absolutely have to be alone, even no matter what, like a car, a car or something.

399
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.170
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

400
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:22.080
Dawn Abriel: But, but you have to have Wi Fi or your data package enough to be with video and audio for the full hour

401
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:24.360
Dawn Abriel: So,

402
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.370
Dawn Abriel: You know, even if you have to go like here into the bathroom. That's fine.

403
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.270
Okay.

404
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.370
Dawn Abriel: And you have to have clothes on, obviously.

405
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.260
Dawn Abriel: And you can't show up intoxicated because

406
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.790
Dawn Abriel: Oh, yeah.

407
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.110
Laura lujan: Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god.

408
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:53.820
Dawn Abriel: I've had women show up with just so much cleavage that all you could see was boobs.

409
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.400
Laura lujan: That's messed up my. Come on, like, a place in the time

410
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.230
Laura lujan: Yeah.

411
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:14.070
Dawn Abriel: So, um, the urine drug screen will go to an address if you change addresses. Make sure bright heart health gets that new address as soon as possible. Okay.

412
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.290
Laura lujan: Yeah, there's like a, you know,

413
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.410
Dawn Abriel: I can check it.

414
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.170
Laura lujan: Because I don't know if it's my honor

415
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.830
Dawn Abriel: Because if you don't get the year if you don't get a one of those envelopes.

416
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.560
Laura lujan: Get it all but but

417
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.570
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, just be sure

418
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.420
Laura lujan: Going through

419
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.890
Dawn Abriel: Well, once every month. I don't know exactly.

420
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:54.150
Dawn Abriel: Well, okay. So this is on Monroe street North

421
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.490
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Yeah, okay.

422
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:15.630
Dawn Abriel: So after and I'm also going to give you some Narc can by law. If I give you Suboxone and I'm going to be giving you buprenorphine naloxone, the generic that the insurance is covered by insurance better

423
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.600
Dawn Abriel: And

424
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.210
Dawn Abriel: The end. The Narcan so be be sure and have the Narc can, you know,

425
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.830
Laura lujan: with me at all times.

426
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:34.710
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Mostly. Mostly, not for you, but for the people you see around you. That's how most people use it and there's 11 refills, so you can

427
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:54.480
Dawn Abriel: Use it, go get another one. But it's really important that people have it so after we're done. I want you to go back to the virtual clinic and do two things I want you to ask them to show you how to do the BAM. The brief addiction monitor

428
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:57.660
Dawn Abriel: And

429
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.840
Dawn Abriel: I want you to take one more survey.

430
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.680
Dawn Abriel: Called the ACE AC e

431
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.240
Laura lujan: A survey.

432
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:18.210
Dawn Abriel: A survey. It stands for adverse childhood experiences. It's just 10 questions one time, no fuss. No, Bobby. You shouldn't have any trouble, you'll be in and out of there real quickly.

433
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.690
Dawn Abriel: Do you have any questions.

434
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.290
Laura lujan: No, nothing. Are you going to send the prescription to the pharmacy.

435
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.470

439
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.360
Dawn Abriel: Good, because I can't write another prescription until I get your labs.

440
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.350
Laura lujan: Okay, that's

441
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.570
Laura lujan: Good.

442
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.400
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so I think we're done unless you've got anything you want to

443
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:51.690
Know,

444
00:37:52.980 --> 00:38:11.730
Dawn Abriel: You're going to get an email from me, it will have your therapist, it will have her email address. Also, and it will have her phone number. So, and, and it takes text so you can text her and say I'm new. I'm in your seven o'clock Tuesday group and

445
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.390
Dawn Abriel: She'll get back to you and set up a date.

446
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:16.560

Dawn Abriel: Oh, I forgot I still have the recording on

Dawn Abriel: I was ordering her medicine.

453
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.610
See

454
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.390
Dawn Abriel: I think it's just a matter of filling in the bubbles.

455
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.080
Dawn Abriel: And

456
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.730
Dawn Abriel: I usually put the plan for a new patient in there.

457
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.990
Dawn Abriel: It's a text shortcut, so I might as well.

458
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.700
Do

459
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.330
Dawn Abriel: For new patient

460
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.260
