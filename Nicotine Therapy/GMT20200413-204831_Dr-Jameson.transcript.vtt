00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.050
Dr Jameson: I had to two people in my waiting room, neither of which will have their actual name. It was like phone code and eight, whatever.

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.830
Dr Jameson: I have one person right before you and I just had to pick. So I'm going to put you back in the waiting room. If you want to disconnect for like 15 minutes so you don't waste your battery and then come back.

13
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:44.580

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.180
Dr Jameson: I was. Yeah, I was just trying to pull it up and see if I could open the actual

16
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:10.860
Dr Jameson: Images, because I don't know but it's it had. I mean, it had all the things I expect and I sometimes do you usually test positive for THC which that's completely blurry. I can't see that at all, which I'm not, you know, I'm not saying I love that. But it's not a big deal.

17
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.450
Dr Jameson: But this time, it also said you tested positive for morphine.

18
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah, which I mean so like heroin gets broken down into morphine, when you when your body died.

19
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:34.620
Dr Jameson: digestive process is it so I didn't anyway. And so some other opiates also including coding. Actually, I just didn't know what if

N817: You know cuz my phone is very old.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.230
Dr Jameson: And I just want to say, you know, we don't kick people out. I guess I should make that clear from the beginning to people, but we don't kick anyone out for if

31
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:21.900
Dr Jameson: We were to have had a relapse or used. It's really more about. But let's just talk about it. What was happening, what's going on, you know, that kind of a thing we don't we don't like punish people

32
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.070

Dr Jameson: So you haven't really been thinking about it okay all right i mean i i'm not i'm not gonna

42
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:11.280
Dr Jameson: Again, I can't even see those images are completely blurry picture. So I wouldn't be able to like double check. Anyway, but I have no reason not to not to believe you.

43
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.780
Dr Jameson: Yeah, just know that if there is ever something going on. We're here to help. Not to not to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.420
Dr Jameson: That reminds me, we have. Did you ever get to your primary care and all. There was a transportation issue and then

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.940
Dr Jameson: Are they are unwilling to reschedule you now then.

52
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.630
N817: Right now there. They don't want people call it in

53
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.510
Dr Jameson: Well, okay. Right now they're not seeing anybody, probably. Yeah.

54
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.770
N817: Like the over the phone things

55
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that might be perfect, actually.

56
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.970
N817: Got a week to be able to comprehend.

57
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.750
Uh huh.

58
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.910
Dr Jameson: Can you can you get an appointment doing telemedicine to

59
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.010
N817: Oh, so far, I have a kind of a long

60
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.250
Dr Jameson: Even the regular doctor that you would see in the office they they're doing. Sometimes they're doing both now.

61
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.540
N817: Oh,

62
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.880
N817: You know, I have tried to see if my insurance will cover it. Yeah.

63
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.960
Dr Jameson: They will, there's

64
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:50.430
Dr Jameson: There's like federal laws have been have been lifted. And it's because because of this crisis there they're

65
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.430
Dr Jameson: Paying doctors, the same as they would if they were seeing in the office to do a telemedicine visit and

66
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:09.180
Dr Jameson: THEY'RE WAVING regulations about having HIPAA encrypted secure winds and stuff like that. So if they're able to do if they're doing telemedicine, they should, they should be able to

67
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:17.730
Dr Jameson: Accommodate now other they're willing to do that on a brand new patient they've never met before. That's a different question, but it's worth a question worth asking.

68
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.910
N817: Yeah.

69
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.470
N817: Yeah.

70
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.890
N817: I'll look into it.

71
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.940
Yeah.

72
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.380
Dr Jameson: And then the other, the other thing.

73
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.270
N817: Go ahead.

74
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:48.150
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's one thing about zoom only one person. I was gonna say we actually i i believe i don't know if they're actually all started yet. I believe there's going to be right heart has a psychiatrist now for Ohio or will shortly so

75
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.400
Dr Jameson: We could also oh

76
00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:01.800
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I'll put you on that list of people to see they have anything better for anxiety than just Xanax isn't my favorite is, you know,

77
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.110
N817: There was

78
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.940
To it.

79
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.160
N817: Figured I figured out some trouble with THC.

80
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.020
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean,

81
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.240
Dr Jameson: It's not, I don't

82
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.320
Dr Jameson: It's kind of a gray gray area because in some places. It's not illegal anymore and

83
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.420
N817: Yeah.

84
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.060
Dr Jameson: Country is not right. So,

85
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.270
Dr Jameson: I mean, I don't want it. So I don't like I'm not encouraging it because I feel like part of this whole

86
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.340
Dr Jameson: This whole

87
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.880
Dr Jameson: Process is to try to

88
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.980
Dr Jameson: You know, avoid using mind altering substances in general and kind of deal with life.

89
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.260
Dr Jameson: You know,

90
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.880
Dr Jameson: Life as as it comes without without, you know, numbing yourself in some way.

91
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.120
Dr Jameson: So I'm not. I'm not.

92
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.630
Dr Jameson: It's not that I'm like, it's not that I don't care at all, but it's also, it's just kind of a difficult

93
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.860
Dr Jameson: gray area at this point because some places it's completely legal. So how do you

94
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.410
Dr Jameson: Hurt. It's hard to have a

95
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.000
Dr Jameson: You know, super expensive.

96
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.630
Dr Jameson: negative reaction to that when some places.

97
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:44.790
Dr Jameson: You know it's considered i think it's i think it's a bad idea. I don't like the idea of people, inhaling anything. I think your lungs are it's not good for your body.

98
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:55.350
Dr Jameson: And it can actually cause psychiatric problems too. I know it can help with anxiety, but it can also aggravate certain things. So it has its downsides, for sure.

99
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.120
Dr Jameson: Do you smoke every how often are you smoking these days.

100
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.350
Oh,

101
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.830
N817: Maybe once or twice a week. Yeah.

102
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.640
N817: Not very often. You know, sometimes not at all. After a week or

103
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:19.680
Dr Jameson: Is it is it like a social hanging out sort of thing or is it I'm helped me sleep they would like what's the

104
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.580
N817: Real it's just

N817: You know, help me relax and like

106
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.840
N817: Sometimes I don't really smoke every day.

107
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.690
N817: When I used to use

108
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.480
N817: Barely.

109
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.620
N817: Turn dollars a week break apart, sometimes not even not even at all.

110
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.480
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

111
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.150
Dr Jameson: Um,

112
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.200
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. Well, I mean, if we keep on keep on looking at

113
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.780
Dr Jameson: Other options for

114
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:08.400
Dr Jameson: Healthy will sleep and relaxation. So I know, I know you heard our, our recommendations already

115
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.220
N817: Called

116
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:27.900
N817: I don't know if you know he's a firefighter is like like you better be careful. He's like the Earth, you're a smoker and that co have 19 attacks. So firstly, and those folders along

117
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.010
Right.

118
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.800
N817: It's true to

119
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.330
Dr Jameson: Smoking anything is bad for you. Absolutely.

120
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:48.090
N817: Just from smoking cigarettes. I can tell you know it's bad for you. It's like stains my fingernails.

121
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.710
Dr Jameson: Have you ever seen a picture.

122
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.020
N817: Of what the

123
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.090
Dr Jameson: Lungs of lungs that are

124
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.550
Dr Jameson: Of smokers lungs.

125
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.680
N817: Yeah, it's pretty nasty.

126
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.880
N817: Post will be

127
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.220
Dr Jameson: They tell black and this girl.

128
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:21.330
Dr Jameson: Well, I was thinking a lot of our patients smoke so I maybe I'll, I'll, to give my little five minute spiel next weekend groups just to on the bow or on this subject and

129
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:36.300
Dr Jameson: I don't know if being stuck in your house with nothing else to do, is a good time to try to quit relative to others or. I mean, I know you were kind of staying home mostly anyway. But as opposed to being out and about. I'm not sure, but

130
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.670
N817: Some guy just knocked on the door, said the landlord sold the house.

131
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.160
Dr Jameson: Oh, inspecting

132
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.230
N817: So I don't know.

133
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.120
Dr Jameson: Oh,

134
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:54.900
Dr Jameson: Wow.

135
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.000
Dr Jameson: Interesting.

136
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.230
N817: So that's

137
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, just wait and see. They're not much you can do about it. So,

138
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:16.080
Dr Jameson: Sometimes people sometimes somebody buys it with they're happy to have tenants and they want. They're using it. It's like an income rental income kind of thing. Sometimes they're planning on

139
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:26.070
Dr Jameson: And that sounds like he's in the process of selling it, because usually there's an inspection that happens before it actually gets sold. So maybe

140
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.850
N817: He's still on a

141
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.370
N817: Pre

142
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.050
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah

143
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.420
N817: Section or something.

144
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

145
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:51.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's, there's a variety, there's a series of steps that have to happen. And then there's financing and there's appraisals and anyway. So lots of times these things start and they never made they fizzle out. But I guess maybe

146
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.290
N817: These houses around here are so cheap to buy a house 10 $20,000

147
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:15.450
Dr Jameson: Oh my god. Oh, well I guess maybe start thinking about what you would do if you got word that you're going to be, you know, no longer able to stay there. At some point, so it doesn't completely come as a you know crisis thing but

148
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:24.570
Dr Jameson: But at the same time, wait and see. Because doesn't necessarily mean any. It doesn't even mean it's going to go through just because they're starting the process.

149
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:33.690
N817: Yeah, well, I know that my niece was down the street and she runs from him and

150
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:43.110

228
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.300

Dr Jameson: Determine if there is or isn't a substance use disorder.

230
00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:00.330

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:21.960
Dr Jameson: Huh, well the therapist would. I mean, they, they have opinions, but they're not the at the end of the day, that's not the ones that prescribed medication. So

235
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:31.080
Dr Jameson: Right. It would be like, I'm not saying I don't I value their, their opinion. Don't get me wrong with them that decision will be made more in the medical

236
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:38.100

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.190
Dr Jameson: Into right

458
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:27.360
iPhone: Yeah.

459
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.510
iPhone: All right. No, I asked all my survey. I don't know what it is.

460
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.260
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm like,

461
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.980
iPhone: What is it

462
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.120
Dr Jameson: Well, that's good.

463
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.010
Dr Jameson: Um, so, I mean, so, you know, in this case.

464
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:49.200
Dr Jameson: There is going to, you know, for you, it'll be more observation and hopefully not that you hopefully don't need any discouragement from

465
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:56.670
iPhone: going down that road anyway. But if you are like thinking, hey, it sounds sounds exciting to be a drug addict.

466
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.030
Dr Jameson: Hopefully,

467
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.810
Dr Jameson: Ending yeah I'm joking. But, you know,

468
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.160
Dr Jameson: Give you some context for which way you do not want to go and

469
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.450
Dr Jameson: Correct. Um,

470
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.430
Dr Jameson: You know, we talked about

471
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.490
Dr Jameson: As I don't know. We were just at the one night, I guess. So we talked about like stress management and

472
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:31.470
Dr Jameson: You know sleep and different things that even though it may not really be completely relevant to you that art is relevant to everybody. So, you know, some of that stuff, you might still find some

473
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:38.670
Dr Jameson: Some interest or, you know, something that you could have these apply a little bit to your, to your life.

474
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.250
iPhone: Yeah, listen to different stories, you know,

475
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.300
iPhone: How people cope with their situations and things like that. I have a problem with the group.

476
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:45.900
Dr Jameson: And you might

477
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.910
Dr Jameson: You don't have to, but you might find, you know, if you're on your own, have a certain thing you do, and you feel stressed and, you know,

478
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:59.130
Dr Jameson: This helps me you know you can share it, throw it out there and now that sometimes that helps other people and

479
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.420
Dr Jameson: Right, so it's it's all, it's all meant to be.

480
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.330
Dr Jameson: Helpful right i mean it's not

481
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:06.960
iPhone: To be

482
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.330
Dr Jameson: You know, crack the whip and

483
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.490
iPhone: Right.

484
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:16.500
Dr Jameson: Do your

485
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.210
Dr Jameson: 50 lashes or whatever.

486
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.650
iPhone: That's right.

487
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.070
Dr Jameson: So I think it just I'm

488
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:41.580
Dr Jameson: Just being making sure that we're, we're really all on the same page with what's really the situation is and what what's what's required and I, I'm sorry, that if things have been disorganized. Sometimes, that is true. I'm not gonna rock enough

489
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:58.470
Dr Jameson: But I am also a little bit not I'm a little unsure about the not meeting that things have been weird for it for you from the beginning. And I feel like we kind of went backwards. And so I you may have skipped. I'm not. I don't want to, I want to confirm that. I don't know.

490
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.730
Dr Jameson: I'm not so sure about this not needing labs thing. I guess is what I'm trying to say. So I'm going to follow up on that.

491
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:20.070
Dr Jameson: You know, for better for worse, if you're if you're required by a court somewhere to do a program, we should do the same program that everybody else that comes into our program does. Otherwise, they could say, well, you didn't really do the program.

492
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.720
iPhone: So, right, right.

493
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.690
iPhone: Yeah, but I think is

494
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.440
iPhone: Based what RJ Toby was based off your assessment, you know, your intake.

495
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.490
iPhone: Assessment when you

496
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.110
iPhone: Cut me and how you answer your questions. You know, they, they base it off of that. And that's what she told me

497
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.020
iPhone: You know, she said. Some people do have to do drug test, some people don't. It just depends on how they answer those questions.

498
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.180
iPhone: In their assessment intake on

499
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.300
iPhone: It.

500
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.250
Dr Jameson: So I guess I mean I guess I would

501
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:57.360
Dr Jameson: I would consider doing some labs just are getting copies of labs. You've had recently just to confirm that in fact it. There is no reason to any lab tests and would suggest anything other than what you're

502
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.770
Dr Jameson: What you're telling us

503
00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.220
Dr Jameson: When

504
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.860
iPhone: He by recent lab tests like what do you mean

505
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.430
Dr Jameson: I mean,

506
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:07.020
Dr Jameson: Had lab work done in the last six months from another doctor and

507
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.580
Dr Jameson: Somewhere for something

508
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.390
iPhone: As drug tests at a job or job.

509
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.650
Dr Jameson: Okay, well,

510
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.950
Dr Jameson: Did you for that to your future pearl

511
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.370
iPhone: People know I'm not required to do drug test, you don't drop. Yes.

512
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.450
iPhone: Oh my god like

513
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.790

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.530
iPhone: Every month and a half.

515
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.690
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, sometimes people submit, stuff like that. Just to say like, see, and I'm good.

516
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:36.510
iPhone: No, because if you're in denial or something you think you have a problem. You know, I don't need to prove anything.

517
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:41.100
iPhone: You know, so why should I be submitted, stuff like that. I don't have to prove myself. Sorry.

518
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:42.630

iPhone: By my probation. Oh yeah, well,

524
00:39:55.290 --> 00:40:04.500
Dr Jameson: I would just, I guess I would look at it. Maybe a little. I hear what you're saying, but I also can see where like, you're kind of sort of in trouble and you're trying to get yourself out of trouble and

525
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.130
iPhone: Right.

Dr Jameson: Every opportunity to show evidence that you're on.

529
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:32.340
iPhone: Yeah, he didn't ask me to go that deep. He said he, you know, just do some sessions, you know, do my weekly little group sessions and they he'll let me know what he wants me to stop them. So he makes a stop on April 27 one I haven't next appointment with I just have to see.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:39.300
iPhone: Know me

534
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:42.720

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.520
Dr Jameson: Where we normally do that somehow got missed for you. That's all that's my

537
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:00.330

It's not

539
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:10.740
