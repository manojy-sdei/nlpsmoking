Shawn Phalen: Hear you guys have to go and

5
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.020
Galaxy Note10+: It's it's it's going, yeah.

6
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:57.330
Galaxy Note10+: I'm sorry that I've missed some my appointments. I've had like I write them down and then I forget where I write them down at so I'm my husband started putting them in my phone showing me how to do it in my phone. Okay, good. And

7
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.290
Galaxy Note10+: Then over

8
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.940
Here, my phone before so

9
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.300
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, because then it just pops up as a reminder

10
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.120
Galaxy Note10+: I'll remind myself on Siri, and then I'll forget that I have that 30 minutes

11
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.280
Galaxy Note10+: And

12
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.180
Galaxy Note10+: Today I wanted to talk about

13
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.730
Galaxy Note10+: So my landlord died in March.

14
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.470
Galaxy Note10+: She

15
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.720
Galaxy Note10+: had a heart attack and

16
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:38.010
Galaxy Note10+: never recovered from it and we had a lease and tell may 31 of this month and

17
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.430
Galaxy Note10+: The lease is up and since since she's died. Good. The daughter is trying to kick us out and just gave us a 60 day notice today when I told her, and she told me

18
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.440
Galaxy Note10+: Originally they told me they couldn't find the paperwork that we signed

19
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.350
Galaxy Note10+: And I never told them that they wouldn't find it. It was because I never gave her the copies her and I did the paperwork at my house.

20
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:26.190
Galaxy Note10+: And we trusted each other, it was that was we did the signature thing just to have it on file. But we had verbal agreements between each other. And so what they did is they

21
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.920
Galaxy Note10+: They. I said, Send me a copy of the

22
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.290
Galaxy Note10+: The, the lease. I want to see it and she only sent me a copy of the top part

23
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.960
Galaxy Note10+: She wouldn't send me a copy of the

24
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:55.350
Galaxy Note10+: Bottom part where the signature was very think it's because I'm going to fill that out. I filled it out in blue ink. This was in black ink and they also do my a's, a different way on

25
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.070
Galaxy Note10+: My city and I do my age with roll with the loop at the top looks like an upside down, you

26
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.320
Galaxy Note10+: And then the circle with the loop at the end.

27
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.290
Galaxy Note10+: These are circle as just just a circle and a loop.

28
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.660
Galaxy Note10+: I didn't, I didn't

29
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.640
Galaxy Note10+: I didn't sign that paperwork.

30
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.110
Galaxy Note10+: And

31
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.160
Galaxy Note10+: She's lying and I'm very angry about it. So I told her.

32
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.270
Galaxy Note10+: She said she's a lawyer and they told her.

33
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:59.970
Galaxy Note10+: For now on she's going to talk to my husband. I don't want to deal with her. It's making me upset and and I might even get angry and say something, they're not supposed to, or just get my heart level up too much where I am going to worry too much. So I, I asked for him to take over and

34
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:21.450
Galaxy Note10+: I sent her a message that said I want her to send a copy to his email or to his phone of the signatures on the lease and she hasn't done it. She, she's not responding. She came by today. I didn't answer the door.

35
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:34.410
Galaxy Note10+: And she just left these papers and on the bottom of the paper mice my foster sister is involved in this and

36
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.500
Galaxy Note10+: My landlord was the boyfriend of my foster sisters dad so

37
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.810
Galaxy Note10+: So they know them while I'm waiting where she's in she she

38
00:07:53.010 --> 00:08:01.530
Galaxy Note10+: Works for apartments and she does like all the renting out and stuff like that. And I looked at the bottom of that piece of paper for the

39
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.040
Galaxy Note10+: The 60 day notice and it has the apartments.

40
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:21.180
Galaxy Note10+: thing at the bottom of it. So what they're doing is the lying trying to get me to leave and giving me false documentation saying that it's from the lawyer.

41
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.800
Shawn Phalen: Have they given you an eviction notice

42
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:35.610
Galaxy Note10+: She gave me a 60 day eviction notice. Yeah. She left it up at the door.

43
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:59.040
Galaxy Note10+: But it was not. It's not from a lawyers office or anything like that. I told her to have her lawyer, give me a call and she's still refusing I told her that I want to see the crop the full copies front and back of her and paperwork that she has I'm Elise that I signed in depth signed

44
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.190
Galaxy Note10+: And what they're gonna say it is I never gave that copies of it.

45
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.600
So you're saying

46
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.280
Galaxy Note10+: I'll only I have the copy of the lease.

47
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.600
Galaxy Note10+: My, my ex has it actually

48
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:26.790
Galaxy Note10+: Has it. Yeah, so trying to get that back is going to be hard, but I was thinking I should probably leave him. He I know he reads his messages. He just doesn't respond

49
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:38.460
Galaxy Note10+: But I know that he would respond if I told him what was going on, briefly, and saying that if they tried to take me to court, they're going to take you to court, too. So, I need this paperwork.

50
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.600
Galaxy Note10+: So basically, he's going to get pulled into it. I think that he'll actually respond to that.

51
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.710
Shawn Phalen: So do you live in a house or an apartment.

52
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.360
Galaxy Note10+: In a house.

53
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:06.030
Galaxy Note10+: It's, it's in California, there is a law that the governor passed or he said on the news that

54
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.030
Galaxy Note10+: There can, no one can evict anyone during this time.

55
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:21.510
Galaxy Note10+: Through I may be through May 31 and when I told her about that. She said she, she said she didn't care.

56
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.800
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I mean I think that

57
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.280
I mean, I know.

58
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.160
Shawn Phalen: YOU KNOW, I KNOW THE GOVERNOR PAT.

59
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.300
You know, they're trying to eliminate

60
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.140
As many evictions as they possibly can.

61
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.510
You know,

62
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.910
Shawn Phalen: I don't know. I don't know what your legal rights are there because

63
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.340
In some states, I think it's up to the landlord.

64
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.280
Shawn Phalen: You know, even though the even though the governor's saying like, look, you know,

65
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.390
You can evict these people

66
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:19.770
Shawn Phalen: Are you know we're at pandemic, you know, this is a national crisis.

67
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:34.950
Galaxy Note10+: Trying to find a place with our limited. I mean, with our limited income right now with the whole. How are we supposed to even go and look for a place if we're zoned to be in our house. Exactly. Can I will look for a place

68
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:47.670
Galaxy Note10+: Right. And they extended it, I just saw on the news they extended the the stay at home until May 22 right so it didn't. Lift it that they extended it

69
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.020
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and I mean I don't think she has much

70
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:59.760
Shawn Phalen: I you know I mean I just question, you know, she does, she really have an attorney, she you know she going to really go to the

71
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:18.600
Galaxy Note10+: I don't think feed does. I think that the poor girl as I know, Rachel and I know the dad, and there is a beef going on between me and Rachel sister right now so I haven't talked to her on her sister, should we were best friends for a long time.

72
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:30.750
Galaxy Note10+: story short is basically her has been asked if she was cheating on him and I didn't want to be involved anymore. And I told him.

73
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:39.030
Galaxy Note10+: Yes, she did. Because I know that she did, she came to my house and cheated. I said, please take your business.

74
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.780
Galaxy Note10+: And take care of it at home. I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

75
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:51.450
Galaxy Note10+: And I sent have had to hold that secret in the first place, but I've been holding it for a really long time and I got tired of being caught in the middle, too. And I finally

76
00:12:51.930 --> 00:13:02.610
Galaxy Note10+: I finally said something and I to be honest I I know she was my best friend. I don't care. I don't feel bad. I got my own problems. And that's it.

77
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.740
Shawn Phalen: You feel like there's some retaliation going on here.

78
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.660
Galaxy Note10+: Yes, I do.

79
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:26.190
Galaxy Note10+: It has gotten I had an arrangement that she was gonna let us do month to month to month and she was going to let us stay in here and tell she sold place because I keep the place clean and I take care of it.

80
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:36.150
Galaxy Note10+: And when she passed away everything voided know everything is gone to the daughter and the daughter has done here visiting which is with David and Rachel.

81
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:54.960
Galaxy Note10+: And I know for a fact that they're trying to to get us out. It can't. There's they're saying that the lease was up may 1 the line. I know that it said, May 31 because I filled out the paperwork. That's not the right lease and and I

82
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.950
Galaxy Note10+: And we both my husband and I called her

83
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:12.300
Galaxy Note10+: Because she doesn't know about certain things like my handwriting and stuff like that. She doesn't know that I was the one that went and bought the paperwork. The paper from Staples.

84
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:24.420
Galaxy Note10+: I went and bought my own thing filled it out for dot and came to the house, a year and a half ago, and we sat down me her and Jason and we

85
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:41.580
Galaxy Note10+: I filled out the thing and Jason and me and her each signed it. She even wrote a paragraph letter on the bottom of the page on page four that says I Dorothy Tweety promise to not up the rent during the two years.

86
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.410
Galaxy Note10+: At all, as long as rent is paid on time.

87
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.360
Galaxy Note10+: And that her signature and they won't even show me that

88
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.490
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So try and get that release from your Alex

89
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:06.150
Galaxy Note10+: I'm going to try even if I have to go down there and knock on the moms door. I don't know. Maybe I can call the police and have them meet me there and

90
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:18.030
Galaxy Note10+: He does. He does. He has understand that if this goes to court because his name's on the lease that he's going to be, it's going to go against his credit to as well, not just mine.

91
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.530
Shawn Phalen: Right, yeah. So is there any kind of, you know, there's no restraining order going on with your

92
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.160
Access

93
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:27.990
Galaxy Note10+: Database

94
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.240
Galaxy Note10+: Yes.

95
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:39.060
Galaxy Note10+: Who has the restraining order. He has a restraining order against me, you can contact him.

96
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:51.840
Galaxy Note10+: I know he's contact. I have fruit. So he's contacted me I just talked to him, a month ago and gave him back something up is the forum to him, so I know he won't say anything.

97
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.510
Galaxy Note10+: Um, but

98
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.030
Galaxy Note10+: You sure, yes, positive

99
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.430
Shawn Phalen: Because you can go to jail for breaking that kind of a restraining order.

100
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:20.370
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah I know he's broken it twice. He's contacted me twice he contacted me last month and asked if I had a case by case basis, said, no, no. Have you by piece, and before and I met him after the, the court order wisdom.

101
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:32.580
Galaxy Note10+: I needed. I bought the car from him and I lost the title. And so I had to meet up with him to have him resigned certain spots her DMV and

102
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.910
Galaxy Note10+: So we met up, you know, we both knew you know student secret loon didn't tell anybody.

103
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:51.510
Galaxy Note10+: But I have it. The messages on my phone and everything from him where he says, okay, meet me here at this time. And then the little argument afterwards, where that we had through text message I have all of it.

104
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.310
Galaxy Note10+: So,

105
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.040
Galaxy Note10+: Really, you would be in violation till Yeah, kinda.

106
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.910
I don't know, it's, it's

107
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.540
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's a it's a risk.

108
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.180
Shawn Phalen: I don't know.

109
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:18.300
Galaxy Note10+: And what I was thinking of sending him the text first and letting him know that he has names on the lease and he doesn't get this to me, ends up going to court.

110
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:30.780
Galaxy Note10+: He's gonna get I'm gonna be giving them his mom's address and everything to the badge in and he'll be responsible for half of anything that happens.

111
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:45.120
Galaxy Note10+: So I was just going to send him a short text and see if he answers. And if he doesn't answer my only other option is to call a police officer and have them meet me down and back.

112
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:59.010
Galaxy Note10+: At his mom's house and have them knock on the door and asked for the paperwork. I know exactly where it is. It's, it's in the plastic bag that had all his court documents for his kids that I gave him.

113
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.120
Galaxy Note10+: And it's in, it's in that bag.

114
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.650
Galaxy Note10+: He was going back to to

115
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:23.130
Galaxy Note10+: His ex was taking him to court for child support more child support. She lost her job and he got a lawyer and I did all the paperwork and stuff like that into things and

116
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:31.800
Galaxy Note10+: It's all the pictures and the text messages, it was all in one bag, so it will still be in that bag. He doesn't even know that probably there.

117
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:40.440
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, I'm so he threw the bag on the floor, somewhere in his room or it's on the bottom floor of his car stills just

118
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.250
Galaxy Note10+: So, as he doesn't ever look in anything. Yeah.

119
00:18:49.770 --> 00:19:05.250
Shawn Phalen: I don't know. You're gonna have to approach it the best and safest way you think would work. You know, I don't know your acts. All I know is that people get arrested for breaking restraining orders and

120
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:16.200
Shawn Phalen: Know a judge isn't going to care that he contacted you first for something and I don't, I don't know.

121
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.500
Shawn Phalen: I'm not sure.

122
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:34.200
Galaxy Note10+: I hope he just will answer. I hope he'll just, I'm just going to tell them at the bottom of it and you don't have to respond. You can just put the paperwork in the mailbox.

123
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.670
Galaxy Note10+: That's all I wanted to do. We don't have to meet

124
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:55.860
Galaxy Note10+: Each other, just the mailbox that I have down at the, at the end of my driveway has a lock on it, nobody can get an index of for me. You can pull the tab down where the mail goes in, what in the box and leave. We don't have to see each other. No.

125
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.240
Galaxy Note10+: None of that, what will happen to just, just put a blue box.

126
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.290
Galaxy Note10+: And I'll take care of the rest. Yeah.

127
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.170
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. Again, no. Just have to use your, your, your judgment on what would be the best thing

128
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.820
Shawn Phalen: I mean, I understand the frustration with this, and I understand that you need to get that Dudley's

129
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.200
Yeah.

130
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:29.910
You know, because it's challenging right now and you need something I know you need something in your hand to show them, you know, but

131
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:41.880
Shawn Phalen: I don't know. I would proceed with caution and proceed. The best way you think you will get the results that you want and need

132
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.330
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah.

133
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.310
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, I don't know.

134
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.910
Shawn Phalen: Maybe think about it, maybe the best thing to do is to call the police first

135
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:11.460
Galaxy Note10+: And have them a score you down there, meet me there. So you're not violating any you're not finally that you're not in violation of anything if you call them. And same thing

136
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:12.930
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah.

137
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:23.730
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I just always with situations like this. I just feel like it's better to to really play it safe and buy the book.

138
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.750
Galaxy Note10+: I know I have a memory problem.

139
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.980
Galaxy Note10+: I know why I remember certain things.

140
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.630
Galaxy Note10+: But

141
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:58.680
Galaxy Note10+: I think that they're probably counting our mean not remembering. And I think what they're doing is trying to scare me from me, but I don't scare easily and and my mom. She's my step mom. She's a, she's a realtor for another roles.

142
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:22.140
Galaxy Note10+: Right. And I'm definitely not stupid when it comes to and I think that Rachel probably thinks that I don't know all these things. And she thinks she's been smart. Yeah, but she's not she's making mistakes and I already seen the the paper for the 60 day notice is on a an apartment. It says

143
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:43.350
Galaxy Note10+: No, I didn't catch it at first this is California Apartment Association approved form and then it says 60 day notice of termination of tenancy. And so these are from her apartments.

144
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.120
Galaxy Note10+: Then the lady is just a personal lady. She doesn't own any apartment.

145
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.430
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

146
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.590
Shawn Phalen: So what do you feel the best with the next step is the best next step.

147
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.880
Galaxy Note10+: My next step was to take a picture of this and send it to Rachel let her know that I know that these forms are by her

148
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.420
Galaxy Note10+: That they better start thinking before they start making a move got copies of them already.

149
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:30.210
Galaxy Note10+: Forging signature. I mean 4g and stuff. If we take this to court. She's going to be in a lot of trouble.

150
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:37.440
Galaxy Note10+: For falsifying these these this paperwork. Right.

151
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:46.680
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and I would do it as non confrontational early as possible just present the facts to her.

152
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.710
Shawn Phalen: Okay, because you want to stay out of a

153
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.760
Shawn Phalen: You know you want to stay at the argument here. You want to do this professionally.

154
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.830
And maturely

155
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:11.190
Galaxy Note10+: That's why I was letting Stephen handle it. He even they even got his name wrong. It's funny because they

156
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:22.410
Galaxy Note10+: They have it on my check. She goes, she tried to be like stealth, but I knew exactly what was going on. She called me pretended to be my friend.

157
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:31.050
Galaxy Note10+: Got me to say the names of the renters in the room because and I said, What are you trying to do. I said, You tried to serve me with the notice

158
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:50.790
Galaxy Note10+: And she got real quiet for a minute, and she never answered. She goes, Well, I see that Stevens Stephen is on the name of the chat that you wrote me and I said, Yeah. I said, that's my husband and so on. Here, if you look

159
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.600
Galaxy Note10+: At it, it's nine spelt right, she's dealt with the Wii and he spells. His name with a

160
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.780
Galaxy Note10+: PH. They're just making a lot of mistakes.

161
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:08.160
Galaxy Note10+: A lot of mistakes. So I'm noticing. They don't even they don't even have my renters last names on here. It's just not a valid. It's not valid.

162
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:17.760
Galaxy Note10+: They didn't mean to fill out the parts of this is, please, please take notice that your tendency of the premises is terminated effective 60 days.

163
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:36.870
Galaxy Note10+: Period after your service is and then they didn't even fill out rent must still be payment advance and then it says as follows from blank date to blink date for how many days at this much dating to fill that out and it's supposed to be filled out

164
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.760
Galaxy Note10+: The just making tons of mistakes.

165
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.390
Galaxy Note10+: And I, and I caught it all. Yeah.

166
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.790
Galaxy Note10+: So,

167
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:57.420
Let's before we end here. Let's talk about what you want to do. What is, what is your next, what's the next step, you want to take care

168
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.410
Galaxy Note10+: Um, I would like

169
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:20.610
Galaxy Note10+: I think I want to refrain from saying too much to them because I always talk too much, so I need to let Stephen handle it. I think that maybe he should

170
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:35.640
Galaxy Note10+: Kind of give this girl a warning that we know that this people were came from Rachel and that I think the Houston, just say we don't want to take this to court. We will we have to

171
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:49.410
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, so we can either settle on something, or we can take it to court and we'll be happy to take it to court because we have enough proof and evidence of ourselves to take it there.

172
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.170
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, I think that that's what we should do.

173
00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:05.220
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So my suggestion is to have him handle it and to stay out of it because they think this could turn into an ugly situation and I

174
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:13.680
Galaxy Note10+: Want to try and avoid here. I don't think it's worth it. Honestly, it is not worth it. You know, I will

175
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.620
Be smart.

176
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:32.340
Galaxy Note10+: Because it's already like I have a tenant leaving and I, I'm not going to be able to make Rick and

177
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:47.670
Galaxy Note10+: I know that they had said that landlords, like if you can't make all your rent that landlords kick kick you out and stuff. So when I told her that

178
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.250
Galaxy Note10+: What's, what's happened is Emily is 24 and she

179
00:27:54.270 --> 00:28:01.650
Galaxy Note10+: Just bought a car before all this pandemic happened she bought a fiance and she had three jobs and then when the stuff got

180
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:15.540
Galaxy Note10+: Started she got laid off by two jobs and then her hours were cut from her main job and she can't afford to pay that car and rent and all that she's moving in back with mom, dad,

181
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:24.180
Galaxy Note10+: So I'm mid losing that income and I can't get somebody else in that room because I can't guarantee them more than 60 days.

182
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.440
Galaxy Note10+: So I can't pay rent.

183
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:40.980
Galaxy Note10+: And I can't pay rent because I now have this paperwork, because I have 60 days left and I can't, I can't do that to somebody have the move in and then tell them, sorry. You have to move out.

184
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:51.480
Galaxy Note10+: So that's what I would tell the judge is I would have been able to pay rent has they just made an agreement with me or you know

185
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.720
Galaxy Note10+: Instead, they wanted to pull all these

186
00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.890
Galaxy Note10+: Documents and forge them and and lies and by like what for

187
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:12.210
Shawn Phalen: Right, and I agree. And that's why I'm saying, the best thing for you is to stay out of it because you want to have this turn out. You know, you want the best case scenario here.

188
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:18.270
Galaxy Note10+: You know, guess really this is not a good time should be trying to find a place to live.

189
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.600
Galaxy Note10+: Right, it's just not possible. It's just, you just don't want to do that.

190
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:32.070
So you want to keep things as calm and friendly cordial and professional as you possibly can.

191
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.390
Galaxy Note10+: Like to hand it over to your husband, and that's what you have to do.

192
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.880
Galaxy Note10+: You don't want this thing to explode into something bigger than it has to be right.

193
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:51.330
Galaxy Note10+: I think it's a good idea for you to just exit stage left out of this.

194
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.230
deal directly with your husband.

195
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:02.670
Galaxy Note10+: Was really it was really upsetting because I was even crying for a little bit.

196
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:14.520
Galaxy Note10+: I'm very sensitive here though I don't people who knew me, they just I hold that very well. Or I hide behind a anger, you know,

197
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.180
Galaxy Note10+: But, um, but really, I am a sensitive person. Yeah.

198
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:22.620
Galaxy Note10+: But

199
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:36.330
Galaxy Note10+: It was really upsetting to me. And I just, I think I cried twice. He's like, What are you so upset about it. I've done nothing but pay my rent on time every time. Never once was my rent late

200
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:46.140
Galaxy Note10+: Not once. Yeah, you know, and, and for the daughter to be so cold like just me. I know that it has. She doesn't even know me.

201
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:58.170
Galaxy Note10+: What I know that she's talking to reach on them because I said I said something about me being a very clean cleanliness person. My house is clean and she goes, Yes, that's what I heard.

202
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:11.610
Galaxy Note10+: So I know that she's talking to them that I'm the topic of conversation and that she's only doing this because Rachel us to get back at meaning for other things.

203
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.130
Okay, so

204
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.690

234
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:43.980
Yeah.

235
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:56.220
Galaxy A50: Our faces were established in there, really, really like lengthy and I'm in face to read. So it looks really bad for me.

236
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.610
Shawn Phalen: Okay, you need to can you not walk

237
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:05.010
Galaxy A50: Can you find out. I'm sorry. I've been trying to close something because there's a huge draft.

238
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.920
Galaxy A50: Yes, now I can

239
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.230
Okay.

240
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.030
Shawn Phalen: I don't know.

241
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.140
Shawn Phalen: I don't understand what you're talking about with phase three

242
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:27.660
Galaxy A50: So you know how every state is going to reopen in phases.

243
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.880
Shawn Phalen: Oh, I see. Okay. Right. Okay.

244
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:43.560
Galaxy A50: Our not only our, our faces a lot longer than others. I'm in Phase three. So, the earliest the way I'm reading it is going to be August

245
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.480
Galaxy A50: Are you sure well unless I'm reading it wrong. It says face to face to

246
00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:06.240
Galaxy A50: Will not because so we're in phase one and I thought based to was going to start when this when the state opens back up, which is the 15th. Right.

247
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.960
Galaxy A50: Exactly. Yeah. So on the

248
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:26.940
Galaxy A50: Nothing's really going to change, except will be able to like go places more but for this first phase is just essential businesses Phase two is going to be daycares schools and like

249
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.070
Galaxy A50: retail shops.

250
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.890
Galaxy A50: And phase three, and that's if base to goes well.

251
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.680
Galaxy A50: Is going to be, it says like end of July early August

252
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.750
Galaxy A50: But

253
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:49.890
Galaxy A50: We have to come up with ways where both client and myself wear a mask.

254
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:56.520
Galaxy A50: Right. Which means I can't do any facials so I'll just be a wax off.

255
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:06.690
Galaxy A50: I don't know. I'm just, I have to take it one day at a time because otherwise the amount of anxiety that I'm having because of it.

256
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:14.460
Galaxy A50: I'm not even like, Oh, I'll lose my clients. Nope. If you're a good institutions will come back to me. Eventually,

257
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:15.450
Shawn Phalen: Right, like

258
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.710
Galaxy A50: It's the, the amount. I'm still diligently paying rent.

259
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:31.590
Galaxy A50: Every week. So because we pay weekly if I could at least see how I'm going to get that either back or or some sort of credit for it.

260
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:43.350
Galaxy A50: But I can't find anything because I'm in this very narrow category where I my business. Who's, who's, who has no employees. So I'm a sole proprietor.

261
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:57.780
Galaxy A50: And the most that I can find this I can apply for unemployment, but I'm already on unemployment from before. So I'm losing money for no reason. And then with that you know that they

262
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:09.510
Galaxy A50: Had, like the six every state. If you're unemployed is giving you extra $600 a week, I'm getting that. But the federal one time 1200 dollar stimulus.

263
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.190
Galaxy A50: Because the courts are closed and nothing's going on.

264
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.510
Galaxy A50: Department of Child Support took it because they're pursuing me the same way as before.

265
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:33.060
Galaxy A50: And it went to Sacramento our capital Disbursement Unit and there's nobody there. So the most that people who are, by the way, working from home.

266
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:47.100
Galaxy A50: Could do for me was email my case manager, saying, hey, she's about to get to get everything we established or restart reconfigure it please. Hope this money.

267
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:54.540
Galaxy A50: Because the moment if they do give it to him. He'll be paying me back $50 a month for the rest of my life.

268
00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:05.190
Galaxy A50: My ex husband is really badly coming after me. I don't know what it is. I'm assuming I mean he's done this before, when he's really

269
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:16.350
Galaxy A50: It's like idle hands. You know, because there's nothing going on and he's in the middle of nowhere. So he's just keeps coming up with ways to annoy me

270
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.640
Shawn Phalen: And how are you responding to that.

271
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:33.870
Galaxy A50: I'm not backing down at all. So for everything that he says that's not true. I say that's not true. I say you're violating the court order.

272
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:45.540
Galaxy A50: I did snap at him. In the end, because he was completely wrong with what he's doing. And one of the responses that I sent him with something like

273
00:39:46.110 --> 00:40:01.080
Galaxy A50: A use case he's all i i do not control him. He's old he was trying to see my son doesn't want to talk to me. I don't know. He didn't realize that my son already text me mom, dad, hasn't fed me up like dinner. Just got done

274
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:11.820
Galaxy A50: You know, but that's something that my assessment should have emailed me hey dinners running behind. Do you mind. No. So at this point, he probably went to Hayden, and said,

275
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:20.640
Galaxy A50: Oh dinners just getting done. Oh, what do I do. Well, do you want, do you want to talk know you want to eat. Okay, I'm going to tell your mom that you don't want to talk

276
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:29.010
Galaxy A50: So it sounds like my kid just doesn't want to talk to me and he because I knew that that wasn't true. And he kept emailing me that

277
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:40.590
Galaxy A50: And I said, Have him pick up the phone and we'll decide on rescheduling time and He seriously said to me, he's almost 12 years old. I'm not going to make

278
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:50.910
Galaxy A50: So it's like saying like he's an adult, kind of like an old which is I mean seriously, yeah. He's almost 12 he's you're completely in charge.

279
00:40:52.050 --> 00:41:00.270
Galaxy A50: And so I said something like, Are you freaking serious, you can't control a 12 year old like kinda I wasn't sarcastic, but I just said.

280
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:16.260
Galaxy A50: What's kind of like how are you are more responsible parent than me. If you can't control it. Fabio and his reply was haha lol Baba, and I'm right. You're wrong. Deal with it that that is his exact answer.

281
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:22.290
Galaxy A50: To that I was like oh my god it's a pissing contest. I didn't realize

282
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.540
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, but

283
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.430
Galaxy A50: If I back down.

284
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:36.030
Galaxy A50: Then, then this issue will not come up in court. So then I had to write them an email like two days later, on a cool note.

285
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:43.920
Galaxy A50: And I said, and I highlighted everything and I said you were late with dinner. Again, it is your job to notify me

286
00:41:44.370 --> 00:42:00.090
Galaxy A50: And then also, when I said I have not heard from hate and you might have taken his phone. Then he didn't text me back. Mom, Dad, did not take my phone. So that means that he's going to our son and telling him what we're arguing about which is also a big no no

287
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:16.860
Galaxy A50: And yeah, and now he because of this whole everything being distributed equally among all Americans. My ex husband got so much money right compared to the way he lives. He doesn't need nearly that much.

288
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:31.470
Galaxy A50: Because he lives in a trailer in Idaho and he got the same exact amount that I did. If anything, he got more than me, because my stimulus is up in the air. You know what he did today. What a husky

289
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.310
Galaxy A50: Because what does an unemployed person need a husky

290
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.080
Galaxy A50: One more giant dog to feed and take care of

291
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:56.400
Galaxy A50: I've been really anxious because I feel something my intuition is just telling me that something bad's gonna happen.

292
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:03.240
Galaxy A50: Today I was supposed to speak with Hayden's counselor and Hayden via zoom

293
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:14.280
Galaxy A50: The counselor forgot to tell me that today was the meeting. So luckily, my son told me because his dad told him yesterday tomorrow. We're going to go see the counselor.

294
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:24.990
Galaxy A50: And when I contacted the counselor. This morning like hate my phone's charge, just let me know when he said, and I don't think that this is true.

295
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:32.550
Galaxy A50: He said, we cannot do it for social distancing reasons, because I would have to sit right next to Hayden.

296
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:42.450
Galaxy A50: And I was like, sir. I don't need to look at Hayden when I'm talking to him. I mean, of course, like he would need to look at me, make sure that I'm not like

297
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:49.710
Galaxy A50: Sending gang signals to Hayden or something like that, you know, I don't know, but he would be the adult in the room, but

298
00:43:50.640 --> 00:44:04.620
Galaxy A50: What's more important. My facing face to face with Hayden, or my making sure like that I'm talking to Hayden in a way that his dad does and then turn around and

299
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:13.980
Galaxy A50: Miss. Miss scope. Like, for example, I need Hayden to communicate with his teachers. There's a requirement that he does that.

300
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:31.680
Galaxy A50: There's also a requirement that he does these quizzes online. I think I told you about that. I'm not sure. So my husband doesn't want a then on the computer, for some reason, so he never told Hayden either one of those things. So Hayden cannot email and he cannot do the quizzes.

301
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.920
Galaxy A50: So when I told him what you were gonna say something

302
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.220
Shawn Phalen: The quizzes are required by the teacher right

303
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:48.420
Galaxy A50: Yes, but the thing is, it's all like repeat material on cast fail.

304
00:44:50.250 --> 00:45:05.850
Galaxy A50: So nobody's really but it's not even my kid doesn't do well without structure because he already has ADD and if you add all these distractions. Yeah, I'm gonna get back a really

305
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:22.860
Galaxy A50: untrained kids not to make it sound like a dog, but he's not it's going to be so hard, like just yesterday. For example, He didn't want it to do homework because I explained in the rules. It says four days, four hours a day. You have to do school

306
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:30.480
Galaxy A50: And Hayden's dad apparently came up to him and said, Hey, let's play Monopoly instead you already noticed

307
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:41.970
Galaxy A50: At least monopoly is like a business course fine, you know, but they're all these other distractions that are constantly going on. So now they have an 11 month old puppy.

308
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:56.250
Galaxy A50: Do you think my son did any school work today. You know, it's just one thing after another, and I'm not you know he's in charge. He's the parent in charge, but the fact that

309
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.420
Galaxy A50: He's now like he tells my son.

310
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:11.130
Galaxy A50: See how pushy mom is pretty much like I'm in. She tells him like I'm in charge. You don't have to listen to her. I've never ever in my life set that

311
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:22.140
Galaxy A50: Up in my case that's never come up because I could never find my ex husband. The moment he moved away. He never said like, Oh, I'll do homework with him over the phone or whatever.

312
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:40.050
Galaxy A50: There's been a few times when I need them because I was so tired. But even then, unless I asked. No, it's just because he has absolutely nothing going on. And my son, then I have to be the disciplinarian. And then my assessment is constantly like

313
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:56.250
Galaxy A50: Oh, moms. Oh, you don't want to talk to mom like he writes to me it. Do you really want hate them to not want to speak to you any more than he already does. And every time. He's like, Mom, how are you like Hayden's never once said that

314
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.820
Galaxy A50: So it's just to drive a wedge between us.

315
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:14.970
Shawn Phalen: Alright, so here's the thing is that you're gonna have to ignore a lot of the stuff that you're doing and saying, and your primary focus is to have contact with Hayden.

316
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:29.790
Shawn Phalen: And make sure that there's no explosions or drama or chaos. It's difficult to parent by proxy.

317
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:31.260
Right.

318
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:47.550
Galaxy A50: This is no but you know why it cannot be like that because Liliana is going to contact counselor to and if the counselor says what's going on his mom, you know, his mom.

319
00:47:48.840 --> 00:48:02.820
Galaxy A50: Doing this doing that do not, if my son makes it sound like oh yeah my dad's always the one who he is pushing this and like if he's not going to sit pushing this information, but he's gonna take that

320
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:14.370
Galaxy A50: The stuff that goes into his ear. Yeah. My mom was trying to make me talk when I was hungry. He's not gonna say my dad only told me dinner is not ready. Five minutes prior to my mom's phone call.

321
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.950
Shawn Phalen: Are you following up with emails on

322
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.250
Galaxy A50: Paper. Yes, yes. And that's how you

323
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:41.910
Galaxy A50: Know, because one Once that Dr. Janice or whatever his name is says for whatever reason that oh yeah I guess mom's being collect a pest mom's be that kayden is it doesn't matter the judges just going to go by what you guys as professional say

324
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.870
Shawn Phalen: I totally disagree with you.

325
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:56.940
Shawn Phalen: Okay, are the is the court is are your emails when they're in session or or your emails being monitored by somebody through the court.

326
00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:57.420
Galaxy A50: Know,

327
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.550
Shawn Phalen: Where they ever know.

328
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:16.080
Galaxy A50: But it's better that way, to be honest, because my son and my ex husband when he's drunk and he says ridiculous things and I want him to say as many ridiculous things as possible.

329
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.810
Shawn Phalen: Right, and that's why I asked me.

330
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:19.530
Galaxy A50: To do this.

331
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:32.520
Galaxy A50: It's just this doctor. Also, I told him like he was the one who suggested the him camera session. And then all of a sudden his second excuse was

332
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:40.140
Galaxy A50: Well, I have to ask Hayden, first I was like, Fine, ask him, but while I'm waiting and zoo.

333
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:48.750
Galaxy A50: I don't know. So I just feel like my ex has been has now manipulated everybody

334
00:49:50.400 --> 00:50:00.510
Shawn Phalen: And it's very easy to feel that way when you're going through one of these situations. This is a very difficult. It's very stressful. It's insanely stressful.

335
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:09.300
Galaxy A50: I want to say something to this guy, but I don't know what I'm allowed to say who to who who do due to this counselor guy.

336
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:15.210
Galaxy A50: It's just, it's what he's saying is not

337
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:20.670
Galaxy A50: It's not like it doesn't make any sense. I see hate them once a month.

338
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:33.900
Galaxy A50: I mean, he sees Hayden once a month. How could he possibly wait until Hayden came in today to ask him if it's okay to speak to the three of us together.

339
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:44.160
Galaxy A50: And then wait another month like this is a child. The child needs help a child needs help now. So I really do think that this counselor is not on my side.

340
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.430
Shawn Phalen: Is the court appointed

341
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.630
No.

342
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:54.360
Galaxy A50: No, he's just a counselor where Hayden Phillips. Yeah.

343
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:58.620
And who said that who said, who said all this stuff with the counselor.

344
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:07.770
Galaxy A50: So I contacted the counselor because Hayden was really becoming completely disinterested with school

345
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:24.300
Galaxy A50: And he seemed he was starting to really get really mouthy with me like he said one time because I wasn't even we weren't arguing it was my son contacted me and he was all upset that he did extra work for school.

346
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:34.110
Galaxy A50: And accidentally not realizing that it wasn't do spilled. And I was just kind of like trying to cheer him up and my son literally broke me unblocking

347
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:44.850
Galaxy A50: And, you know, no. Yeah. And then, and then all the crazy things that my excessiveness writing me like

348
00:51:46.230 --> 00:52:02.550
Galaxy A50: Oh, a haven doesn't even want to talk to you and that cadence making cadence aligned to you because he knows you get upset too easily, but I'm pretty sure it's my ex husband who constantly tells Hayden will be careful don't upset, Mom.

349
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:09.210
Shawn Phalen: You can't listen, you can't. It's very difficult. But you have to ignore what you're missing.

350
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:14.520
Galaxy A50: But all my son has to do is tell this to Dr. Janice and I'm fucked.

351
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:21.360
Shawn Phalen: Why do you think he's gonna save that and why do you feel like this, doctors, not going to have input from you.

352
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:32.490
Galaxy A50: Be this Hayden considers him to be dis safe person and if Hayden feels like he can actually share like how he feels about mom.

353
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:47.460
Galaxy A50: It would like even sue the reason why my son apparently didn't want to just pick up the phone and tell me that. Hey, Mom. Dinner is running behind like it was in text and then he just stopped talking to me.

354
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:52.020
Galaxy A50: After we did finally talk. He's all mom, I thought you were going to get mad.

355
00:52:52.650 --> 00:53:04.680
Galaxy A50: And I said I wouldn't get mad, except for the fact that you didn't act like a gentleman about this. If you would have just because I also have things to do. You know, I looked forward to this right and

356
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:17.730
Galaxy A50: But all my access, but it has to do is say enough times like remember mom gets really mad really easily. And then all my son has to do is tell this doctor Genesis, not even realizing what he said.

357
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.430
Shawn Phalen: But this guy.

358
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:22.560
So,

359
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:40.230
Galaxy A50: He's a professional like this, he gets what's happening here. She understands. I'm hoping the dynamics of this, like, really, what kind of a professional would tell them mom who's truly concerned that she needs to wait another month for this.

360
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.980
Galaxy A50: No, this is this is on purpose. Okay. Now, hold on. So he's

361
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:53.550
Shawn Phalen: Continuing to see Hayden now and his next appointment with with the three of you will be next month.

362
00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:03.090
Galaxy A50: Yes, but I emailed this to him. Two weeks ago, in hopes he didn't even tell me that he didn't have an appointment today.

363
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:20.460
Galaxy A50: I figured he would contact me and let me know you know this week, blah, blah, blah. So I was the one who followed up with them last week and I said I have zoom downloaded, just let me know and if it weren't for Hayden yesterday. This guy would never even bothered.

364
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.000
Shawn Phalen: So you're getting into some really like

365
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.700
Galaxy A50: I don't trust anybody.

366
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:35.910
So here's what's happening though is like you've hired a counselor for him for Hayden.

367
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:43.170
Galaxy A50: What's kind of counselor would rather deal with nothing.

368
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.260
Galaxy A50: I'm sorry I this is not therapeutic

369
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.880
Okay. What do you want, what do you need, what do you need

370
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:55.980
I know

371
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:05.160
Galaxy A50: counsellor would have an opportunity to give be the person with the other side of legal custody.

372
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:18.750
Galaxy A50: In in like to have an opportunity and purposely create to get very, very lame reasons for why that's not gonna happen.

373
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:21.900
Galaxy A50: So you

374
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.390
Galaxy A50: Hired cancer for havens.

375
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.040
Galaxy A50: He did.

376
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.470
Galaxy A50: But it was court ordered, he's just not caught up.

377
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:34.500
Galaxy A50: I'm gonna walk out to the other room.

378
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:58.740
Galaxy A50: Is a child who was court ordered to see a counselor to deal with his separation from mom.

379
00:55:59.130 --> 00:55:59.490
Right.

380
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.820
Galaxy A50: The counselor should welcome this.

381
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:19.380
Galaxy A50: Not the other way around, and I could be waiting in zoom for him to ask Caden hey do you mind if your mom joins. There's no reason to wait a month. I'm saying this was such a minute problem.

382
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:30.600
Galaxy A50: That an educated, I'm assuming, PhD, or at least I don't know licensed social worker would never do this unless they didn't want to deal with.

383
00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.790
Shawn Phalen: Have you met with this counselor. This man for

384
00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:44.880
Galaxy A50: Yeah, so he is the counselor at Hayden's pediatricians and Hayden sees him once a month.

385
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:58.260
Galaxy A50: All I'm saying is a professional would come up with a solution and not be a part of the problem unless they wanted to be part of the problem. I just asked you, have you met with this man before

386
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:03.300
Shawn Phalen: Me. Have you had a session of you.

387
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.740
Galaxy A50: Know, just

388
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.000
Galaxy A50: So you spoken to him over the phone.

389
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.480
Shawn Phalen: When was this

390
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:29.580
Galaxy A50: I speak to him. So once I talked to him when so in February and in in snow. No, sorry, end of February, and like end of March, and then over the email like two weeks ago.

391
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.470
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so you have had contact with this man.

392
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.940
Shawn Phalen: And you do realize this is Hayden's therapist is appointed

393
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:56.730
Galaxy A50: Right. No, it's not court appointed it's court order. But the thing is I all he knows is that I'm some mom, he knows nothing else I could be like I could be lying to you right now.

394
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:07.380
Galaxy A50: He, he never seen me and he didn't actually interact. So as far as he sees it normal dad.

395
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:18.000
Galaxy A50: Normal kid and mom who a CT most probably my ex husband probably always says, Oh, she was all pissed off at eight and again the other day over blah, blah, blah.

396
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:38.220
Galaxy A50: But that's not true. But what I mostly want is for Hayden to hear me out and in the counselor to say, Honey. She's not angry at you. She's being a mom. She's giving you disciplinary like she's giving you guidance.

397
00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:45.600
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you're, you're creating scenarios that haven't happened you know here.

398
00:58:45.630 --> 00:59:00.690
Galaxy A50: Yes, they have. Yes, they have. My ex husband will not let him communicate with the teachers and he's teaching Hayden that he is in charge, and I don't count. I'm sorry, I don't see how you don't understand me today.

399
00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.960
Okay, I don't, you're right. I don't

400
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.800
Shawn Phalen: I'm having a difficult time following. I understand that you're upset.

401
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:25.530
Galaxy A50: You're having high half legal custody. I could I could join the session, the fact that people keep preventing me from exercising my parental rights will eventually come and bite me me. Yes.

402
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:31.230
Shawn Phalen: And that's where the fear is fine for you is, like, and I understand that.

403
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.070
Right, I get that.

404
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:48.690
Galaxy A50: I don't understand what you get this guy is part of the decision making of whether I'm gonna get my kid back and if my kid keeps showing up and saying things like, oh, I was afraid to make mom mad.

405
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.840
Shawn Phalen: So he said that he didn't for sure, said that

406
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:53.850
Galaxy A50: Well, he did to me.

407
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.810
Shawn Phalen: So he's for sure, said it to this man is what you're saying to me.

408
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.200
Know,

409
00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.300
Galaxy A50: But

410
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:01.620
Galaxy A50: In his mind.

411
01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:07.710
Galaxy A50: In his mind Hayden things I get mad. Like right now I am getting mad.

412
01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:22.470
Galaxy A50: I don't know what's going on and Hayden is never going to over the phone. Tell me, Hey mom, dad, constantly tells me that you get mad dad tells me, blah, blah, because that is sitting right there.

413
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:23.700
Right.

414
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:29.130
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, he's not gonna do that because he doesn't want to be in the middle.

415
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:45.150
Galaxy A50: Well, yes, but what I want for the counselor to do is just to kind of for lack of better words be like the mediation of luck. Look, this is not my map. This is just mom telling you

416
01:00:45.570 --> 01:01:02.790
Galaxy A50: You will have a job to do. She has a job of like feeding you, and you have a job of going to school and doing what the school expects you to do so right now. You know what Hayden's favorite subject is never has been before his favorite subject these days is pee.

417
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:25.050
Galaxy A50: Pee. Just means he's out running around with the dogs. Fine, I'm good with this, but he still needs to do so much. And when I asked him to to rewrite his completely misspelled English homework. He threw a fit and refused.

418
01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.410
Galaxy A50: And what he refused.

419
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.270
Yeah.

420
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.310
Shawn Phalen: He's 12 right

421
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:37.080
Galaxy A50: Yes.

422
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:42.150
Yeah.

423
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.780
Galaxy A50: He goes to this school that is extremely mediocre

424
01:01:49.920 --> 01:02:02.700
Galaxy A50: And and he's not even shining. You would think that there, he would shine. So, once he gets here seventh grade two more years and he's in high school, he can barely right

425
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:16.110
Shawn Phalen: So I think that you are you're going way in the future here and you don't need to do that.

426
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:30.030
Shawn Phalen: I know that you feel like, what's happening is not up to what your standards are and that's clear, that is not how it would happen if Hayden war with you.

427
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:40.050
Galaxy A50: That the anxiety is coming from the fact that a professional an adult a therapist of all of all people.

428
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:55.350
Galaxy A50: Would come up with the solution. Not a problem. So there was a reason why he didn't want me talking to Hayden anymore. And since he has not seen Hayden since the time we spoke over the email.

429
01:02:56.670 --> 01:03:05.460
Galaxy A50: Today, would have been the day. I'm sure that he had some sort of conversation with my ex husband, or he just decided he doesn't give a shit.

430
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.350
Please email him and ask him for clarification.

431
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:13.770
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

432
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:21.450
Shawn Phalen: And that should have been done. So if you want to ease your anxiety around this. Okay, get it from him.

433
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:32.700
Galaxy A50: Well I, I, I wrote him back. I said, Sir, this is not an unsolvable situation. Can you just get it on after he gave me the second excuse I said

434
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:39.300
Galaxy A50: I we can work this out instead of waiting for a month. Can you just call me nothing.

435
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:55.380
Galaxy A50: And if he asks Hayden know that means he didn't is going to go until his dad, right, because he didn't just that kind of guy. It's not a big deal. And his dad would be like she probably wants to get you out for some because that's what he does.

436
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.480
Galaxy A50: It. This is not it's it's not, it's just

437
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:11.520
Galaxy A50: I'm I'm even more anxious. Now, not even anxious. I'm just so over this. Yeah.

438
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:21.270
Shawn Phalen: And, you know, this has been going on for a while. I understand that and everything's been pushed back. That doesn't help.

439
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:34.500
Galaxy A50: Well, my ex husband, from what I know owed his lawyer, a bunch of money. So now he's going to catch up. And all this is going to skyrocket.

440
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:43.950
Galaxy A50: It's fine. I'll work it out. I'm sorry, I just, I'm too upset to think about it anymore. Okay.

441
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.700
Shawn Phalen: Do you want to reschedule. Then let me want to do

442
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah.

443
01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.470
Shawn Phalen: Okay, how about

444
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.220
Shawn Phalen: Wednesday, May 13 at eight.

445
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.500
Galaxy A50: That's two weeks. Right. Yeah.

446
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.720
Galaxy A50: Yeah, that's good.

447
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.730
Wednesday, May 38

448
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.700
Galaxy A50: Uh huh. Okay.

449
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:21.780
Shawn Phalen: Take a deep breath and there. This is difficult. I don't want to irritate you or escalate your anxiety anymore.

450
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:48.330
Galaxy A50: I'm gonna go for a drive. And I'll feel better. And because of this empty spaces go through that place where I used to go to smoke hookah. Yeah, they're not going to open anytime soon at all. So that was at least my little bit of like social circle nuts over and now whatever

451
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.300
Okay.

452
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.430
