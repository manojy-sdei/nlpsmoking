00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.639
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hi there.

2
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.960
Michael Justice: Hi, how are you

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.389
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. How are you, Michael.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.440
Michael Justice: Doing good.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.020
Michael Justice: Yeah, yeah. Doing good.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.100
Okay.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad. Okay, good. So no changes in terms of pain levels or cravings or anything. Right.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.980
Michael Justice: Nothing, just actually really enjoying life as it is.

9
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.190
Michael Justice: Um, you know, I've been

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:01:00.810
Michael Justice: Starting the walking so pain level. Yeah, and also my, I have a landscaping business. So we've been trying to keep up with that. So I had a couple. I did my survey and I noted on there that I had a couple days that I still had pain, but that was because the extra physical exertion.

11
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.790
Michael Justice: Push bowing and grass out of control. Hi. Hi.

12
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Amy I

13
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.590
Michael Justice: work a lot harder.

14
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.010
Michael Justice: And but as soon as we're done with this meeting me and my six year old is going to go for a nice long walk, not seven miles but but probably like three

15
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:30.390
Michael Justice: So we're starting that out but yeah and so that's creating a little extra pain to, you know, I pretty much like for controlled level without the exercise.

16
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420
Michael Justice: Normally my feet will start hurting after

17
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:50.160
Michael Justice: A full day but then I take my my other dose and then that gives me comfort through the night, and I've been trying to take that later. But sometimes, because

18
00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:03.840
Michael Justice: Of the extra exercise. I haven't been able to hold off on waiting past three or four o'clock or so, but the longer I wait the better sleep. I have. So I've been playing with that a little bit.

19
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:17.100
Michael Justice: But other than that, yeah. I mean, of course, it's gonna create a little extra pain, but it is what it is I'm as long as I'm sleeping at night, like I have been able to, I'm okay.

20
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're okay.

21
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.230
Michael Justice: Yeah.

22
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:34.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, that's good, because, yeah, we want you to have that physical exertion and exercise, you know, that's a good thing. But at the same time. Yeah, we have to be cognizant of flaring up too much pain.

23
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:49.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, right. Yeah. So it's a balance and what's important is consistency, rather than, you know, just a one time thing. So like I like that you're doing. You're starting the routine with your daughter.

24
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Of walking and things like that so that you can keep it up and

25
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, long term.

26
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:06.750
Michael Justice: So I have a question that's come off base, um, apparently in our town, you know, I told you we only have three cases, all of a sudden we have like 15 now.

27
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.010
Michael Justice: And it just like there was a big flare up and

28
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.070
Michael Justice: So the question is, I'm listening to

29
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:30.390
Michael Justice: The governor of New York. And of course, anybody can get a test without symptoms or not. So do you know anything about like, because I would like to get tested. I know.

30
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.530
Michael Justice: A lot of people that would just like to go get a test, but we were under the impression that you had to have symptoms in. Oh, yeah.

31
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:47.460
Michael Justice: It's California like the governor I usually keep up on it, but I've been staying away from it lately, so I'm not totally

32
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.730
Michael Justice: Sure. What's going on as far as. Can we just go request a test and be tested, you know,

33
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:08.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: I that's a really good question, and I believe in Los Angeles County. So it might be county by county. But for example, here they were advertising that

34
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:19.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: You if you're a resident of Los Angeles County, you could go to certain designated places and get tested. And it was implying that you could just ask to be tested.

35
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: But

36
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:41.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like I know certain insurances like Kaiser my family has Kaiser and they won't test you unless you have physical symptoms and the main one being temperature, they will check your temperature. Make sure you have a fever before they test you.

37
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. So

38
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm not quite sure what it's in Crescent City what the situation is.

39
00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:00.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: But remember, if they do, if you didn't get the testing, it would be the type of testing. That's the swab that's going to check to see if you're sick now.

40
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:11.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, it's not necessarily going to tell you. Had you been sick in the past or anything that kind of test is the antibody test that's, that's something that you have to take blood for

41
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: To check to see if you have antibodies against the virus that implies that you were sick and you got over it, or whatever. I'm sorry, this thing is beeping away.

42
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, um,

43
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:42.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so that one also it depends on your insurance. I know some insurances cover the antibody testing just if you ask for it and say, I think I was sick. And then other insurances like Kaiser doesn't do it.

44
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:53.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: They think it's too soon to use that test because it doesn't really, we don't have enough information is what they say, meaning we don't know how accurate the test is

45
00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we don't really know what that means. So if you have, if it was positive, it doesn't. We don't know. Does that mean you're protected or not, or how long

46
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:14.520
Michael Justice: Yeah, yeah. And that's it. We're in the backwoods. I mean, where's the furthest north, you get before you get in Oregon and our health care here is like really

47
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.100
Michael Justice: Sutter Health is like super bad reputation air.

48
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.190
Michael Justice: They use a lot of traveling physicians and

49
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:35.370
Michael Justice: Nobody really wants to stay here because I guess the pay or whatever I and and it's been this ongoing thing. That's one of the costs of living in this beautiful area, which it is.

50
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.060
Michael Justice: You know, we have like the third or fourth cleanest River and the redwoods we have all the beauty.

51
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.490
Michael Justice: That the wilderness has to offer.

52
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:55.410
Michael Justice: You know, but health care is health care and we have the most expensive gas anywhere where everybody that I know.

53
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:12.900
Michael Justice: I save $25 to drive to broken up into Oregon 25 bucks saving so 95 cents a gallon cheaper for diesel fuel ours just stays right around three. Oh, I think it's at 307 is the cheapest in town.

54
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.300
Michael Justice: Oh, wow. Very good. And it's like,

55
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: To 89

56
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:34.380
Michael Justice: And it's easy. So it. Yeah. So we pay more here and I used to joke around and say, well, in order to wrap my head around it and get used to just pain, I'd say, oh, our gas is fresher than your gas or something, you know, because you pay pay more for quality right so

57
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.220
Michael Justice: Right. Other than that I drive to Brookings out all the time.

58
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:51.840
Michael Justice: To get fuel, you know, it's really sad if I wasn't in my line of work I would be boycotting them, and I'd be screaming doing. I mean, it's just ridiculous and and the sad thing is

59
00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:11.190
Michael Justice: The people that sell the fuel they only get a set amount. So I already know that because my family was an unit oil distributor ship here for 50 plus years and I used to work there. And the big companies give you a certain amount on and you don't really make a lot of money on gas its

60
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:18.840
Michael Justice: Oil when when you sell oil and you buy oil. That's where profits are made for the jobbers, you know, the independent people

61
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:36.660
Michael Justice: But everybody thinks because, you know, business, you're automatically swimming in money and it's just not true. Most of gas station people they only make it's barely worth it, that the the mini marts they bank on you coming in and buying something from their store.

62
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.440
Michael Justice: To make your profit they don't get rich off of gas, I guarantee

63
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.740
That

64
00:08:42.240 --> 00:09:03.330
Michael Justice: Just keeping everything running day make minimal amounts. We used to sell truck and trailer loads of fuel to different companies and our cat was $25 every time we sold it, they just paid us 25 bucks to sell them 880 500 gallons of diesel or gas or whatever.

65
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:15.300
Michael Justice: Wow, it's pretty controlled and the ones that are getting read in the oil business are the refineries and the people that are, you know, pulling it out of the ground and kind of people get rich but

66
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.150
Michael Justice: It's not, it's not per se, a highly back when it was like in our town.

67
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:38.070
Michael Justice: When the mills were all running, we had like 15 Mills here and machine was so abundant that oil we sold we sold so much oil that my grandfather actually after 50 years of working

68
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.830
Michael Justice: When he died, he was

69
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.510
Michael Justice: Probably a millionaire just and

70
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:55.170
Michael Justice: But other than that, my dad worked in the field for 25 years and they when they finally sold and disperse the money.

71
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:06.150
Michael Justice: It took him seven years to find somebody to buy it and then apparently he financed, most of it and they ran that 50 year business into the ground in one year.

72
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:14.430
Michael Justice: And I predicted it was going to happen because the guy was shady that the son in law was shaving that talk to

73
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:24.630
Michael Justice: The guy into purchasing it from my parents and him running that he ended up. Yeah, they just ran this business into the ground and my dad had to go back to work.

74
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:36.150
Michael Justice: Because IRS wanted their money for the whole amount. And so they paid that off and my dad did pay his house often his cars and all that he owned everything out. Right. But, uh,

75
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:46.620
Michael Justice: Yeah, there's not a lot of money in it, like, people think. But that's, yeah, that they make three cents a gallon of gas so many gallons. You gotta sell

76
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.910
Michael Justice: To make a profit. It's just, it's really hard, but

77
00:10:51.450 --> 00:11:05.100
Michael Justice: Um, other than that. We did get. Did I tell you last time we did get all our grant money last week Board of Supervisors said they weren't going to take any of it and and listen to this as a critical

78
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:18.120
Michael Justice: And to the and so now we're trying to get the contractors to go starting so will be 57 beds, seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner shelter all year round.

79
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.180
Michael Justice: Next winner. If we can get the contract.

80
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.030
Michael Justice: That's going to be a challenge right now but

81
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you guys open with the coven. Are you fully open. Are you sometimes close

82
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:39.630
Michael Justice: Like probably have you had 12 people in our discipleship program when this started. And so in the health department came, they said.

83
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.750
Michael Justice: To receive 13 more people

84
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.400
Michael Justice: And there's not enough room in our shelter room that we had

85
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.940
Michael Justice: So they shut that down immediately, but we only had

86
00:11:51.390 --> 00:12:00.810
Michael Justice: I mean, now the weather starting to change. Finally, but all for the last 10 days it's been pouring raining cats and dogs that was like full on winner.

87
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:18.900
Michael Justice: But for the most part we were done anyway we we we were on the operating five months out of the year. So we started in October and then and November, December, January, February, March, so we were shutting down anyway.

88
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:27.330
Michael Justice: Because we only have so many months, the worst months of the winner to operate and you try to predict that

89
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:40.890
Michael Justice: And that's another thing we won't be on any stipulations. So we can, we'll be able to operate year round and not having any problems and we'll have 57 bats so

90
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:53.640
Michael Justice: That'll be good. Then we'll and we're using the whole building. So it's a 10,000 square foot building you need 50 square foot per person in order to how somebody, you got to have 50 square feet.

91
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.890
Michael Justice: Each person.

92
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:02.730
Michael Justice: And so that'll it's gonna be super good. But yeah, they shut us down on that but

93
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:20.940
Michael Justice: We increased our feeding program and offering free food. And so people. So the homeless have a place to come and get food every day, seven days a week. Also we have put a portable toilet out there and hand washing station us, we had

94
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.660
Michael Justice: Tons of masks to be able to give them. Plus, we're doing showers.

95
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.240
Michael Justice: Two days a week. Today's this shower day keeping everybody clean

96
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:39.060
Michael Justice: We rented a motel room. We didn't the county actually county and city paid for it.

97
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.330
Michael Justice: But we run it run the program.

98
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.970
Michael Justice: giving out showers. You know, people sign up for a list and sun done on

99
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.930
Michael Justice: Tuesdays Tuesdays and Thursdays twice a week.

100
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: So they can take a shower.

101
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: The reason I asked is,

102
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:11.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: There was a patient, I just had the other day that said he was in Crescent City, and he said, Do you have a place to live. And he was like, well, I'm kind of in a camp like thing. You know, like basically homeless.

103
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:25.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then I I asked. I said, Oh, do you know that there's a place called our daily bread. And there's a ministry in seven years, like, Yeah, I've heard I know them, but I don't think they're open because of coven. I don't think they have

104
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Meals and stuff as well. You may want to check it out because they think they might

105
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.680
Michael Justice: Push it to

106
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do right

107
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.940
Michael Justice: Yeah and there's food. There's a table that we put out at 10 o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night, seven days a week.

108
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:51.150
Michael Justice: And we put food out on that drinks, things like that. So anybody can just come up and get it. They won't see people at night, of course.

109
00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:02.850
Michael Justice: But they can come and use the facilities and get food and we're going through a ton of it. So it's actually pretty successful when not sheltering. That's the only thing we are not doing right now.

110
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it, got it. But the food remains. That's good. Oh, yeah. So

111
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.900
Michael Justice: Then breakfast and dinner. Yes.

112
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:21.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, cool. That's good to know. Um, yeah, so that's great. I'm so glad you're getting the financial support and to expand like you want to and

113
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, good news.

114
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.700
Michael Justice: It's been a long journey. I tell you, yeah. And

115
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.320
Michael Justice: We have another friend of mine, Dr Kimbrough our she's

116
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:38.520
Michael Justice: On the board for Mission Possible and she's been bringing me and Daphne, and my wife and everybody

117
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:51.660
Michael Justice: My wife just donor letters were I'm trying to keep because we're still going to be privately funded our entity. And then the other ones, you know, public funded through grants.

118
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.230
Sure.

119
00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:07.530
Michael Justice: And we want to keep our section two were separate we will benefit from the other organization, but in the sense our whole ministry is going to be around still privately. So I'm going to be

120
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:20.190
Michael Justice: Meeting with individuals trying to get them. So it's donor. What do you call it relations, trying to get people excited again about it, especially

121
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:33.240
Michael Justice: Believe it or not, this is a perfect time because people understand like, oh my god, this could be, you know, we really don't know. I mean, I watched a documentary, the other day.

122
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:42.030
Michael Justice: That says that there's another virus out there and I don't quote me on it because for some reason I didn't retain a lot of it, but

123
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:53.280
Michael Justice: It says that, yes, we have this virus, but there's actually other viruses that are worse that they're looking at that they're all believing that could happen.

124
00:16:53.790 --> 00:17:10.230
Michael Justice: So in a sense, everybody's kind of panic stricken. So it's taken away from the stigma on the homeless about, you know, all of them sleeping in the parks and leaving trash everywhere they go.

125
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.450
Michael Justice: They're not looking at it like that. They're looking at it. Finally, because of the sick.

126
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.200
Covert

127
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.900
Michael Justice: That wow how they must be feeling, you know,

128
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:29.910
Michael Justice: How they must be feeling so it's actually a really good time to sit down and let people know you know they're all people.

129
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:47.820
Michael Justice: You know, you know, just us being able to go to the store and fill our pantries and have that peace of mind to not have that and I not all people you there is a group of people out there that just really kill them on like God sorted out type mentality.

130
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.260
Michael Justice: They don't have any compassion, you know, and then

131
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.070
Michael Justice: Reality.

132
00:17:53.490 --> 00:18:01.140
Michael Justice: If you ask me, what's the cause of it. It all has to do with how we were raised, you know,

133
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:01.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

134
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.570
Michael Justice: These people were raised by people that were dysfunctional attics

135
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.640
Michael Justice: Right away that thing for them. Their goal set was

136
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:23.640
Michael Justice: You know this one girl. Her mom told her what you do is when you know at 16 you start looking around for your man, make sure he's done disability.

137
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:24.960
Michael Justice: And

138
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.720
Michael Justice: You get on disability ASAP.

139
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:36.960
Michael Justice: Oh my god, figure out how to get on it. So you take your two incomes. Okay, which is usually so at the best case scenario, it's 2400 a month.

140
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.190
Michael Justice: Get your little RV. You put it in the park and you've made it on me.

141
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:41.880
Oh,

142
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: That was the advice she got that.

143
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:53.880
Michael Justice: Mom to daughter advice. Yes, it's, you know, and I don't want to die. I'm not, I'm not being me. And I'm being real. This is

144
00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:13.680
Michael Justice: The take from it all has to do with how we raise our kids what values and goals we bestow into them is how it is. It's like if your parents were addicted go into food banks welfare their whole life, you know,

145
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:22.830
Michael Justice: There was a movement that was really I witnessed that where people would have more kids to get more money.

146
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:34.110
Michael Justice: And they would consider that a success and they'd be proud of the fact that yeah I'm getting 1200 dollars and food stamps, a month and I'm

147
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:42.960
Michael Justice: Getting to go to all the food banks and taking advantage of all you know like especially back before 2008 when it was entitlement.

148
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:57.900
Michael Justice: Oh my gosh, everybody felt like everybody Odom, nobody was, you know, it was like, where's the, you know, goals, I don't know if I told you when I was matic for so long. I looked at

149
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:08.490
Michael Justice: Hitting on disability. One thing I wanted was to for to get denied a couple times so that I get that big track, you know, thinking to myself,

150
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:26.430
Michael Justice: And then you know 950 a month. And it was like, about seven months and two. And I said, Man, I am not gonna settle for no $900 so much. I can't even visualize how anybody could even do anything with that little amount of money.

151
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, but

152
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.550
Michael Justice: That was that take from it. You know, this way, these people are raised.

153
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's good.

154
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can't believe that advice like me.

155
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Saying we did

156
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.050
Michael Justice: Budgeting promises we did

157
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, you did.

158
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:48.420
Michael Justice: Well, we used to, and they wouldn't come unless we put donuts and coffee out

159
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.610
Michael Justice: Donuts and coffee out

160
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.710
Michael Justice: They would come and they eat all the donuts and drink coffee and

161
00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:04.260
Michael Justice: Sit there and basically not retain a dang thing. It was the most unsuccessful things thing we ever tried to do and we tried

162
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:17.160
Michael Justice: We, we also. We also have programs now that where you can come in like if you become a disciple in the program you can, you know, start taking all these classes budgeting classes.

163
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.440
Michael Justice: Basic

164
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:29.850
Michael Justice: You know just how to behave, how to be, you know, teach you how to I can't think of the name of it right now past week.

165
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.340
Michael Justice: Just basic life. Life Skills class.

166
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:47.430
Michael Justice: Yeah, yeah, you know, just the simple yeah you know because a lot of them don't. They don't have none of that training they go in, they asked you a question, you say no. And they start freaking out. It's like to teach you how to, you know,

167
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.230
Michael Justice: Be more successful just in your daily dealings with people you know

168
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.490
Michael Justice: Yeah, it

169
00:21:53.700 --> 00:22:03.300
Michael Justice: Takes me back to the thrift store. When people come in there and you gotta give me this. And that's, like, Oh my gosh, you don't even under, you know, but not understanding the fact that

170
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:15.690
Michael Justice: If you go into Walmart and you act like a fool like that, you're going to get kicked out and you might even get, you know, where they take it you out. So you can't, if you come back. You'll be trespassing.

171
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:28.980
Michael Justice: Yeah, the fool you know you can't be a jerk. You can't go into even if you have a bad experience in Denny's, you know, if you start breaking their dishes and yelling and cussing them out. You're not gonna

172
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:30.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

173
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.700
Michael Justice: Things like that like

174
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:37.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Life Skills about. Yeah. How do you act. How do you react. Yeah.

175
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:53.370
Michael Justice: Well, they need all of that the majority of the people I deal with. They need you know basically a whole like erase it and start over de frag completely different what you've been taught and to really learn

176
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:05.970
Michael Justice: Even some of the basic stuff and it's just really sad. And that's the kind of, not all, but that's kind of how there's a lot of cases of people that were successful that

177
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:18.000
Michael Justice: failed due to addictions and bad choices and things like that, how it's another thing, making positive choices. You know, what's your money, you know, that's a budget and it's like the biggest thing they

178
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.530
Michael Justice: They go without all mine and they get their money and they Oh, let's go. It's like that Christmas, they'll go and

179
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:43.380
Michael Justice: They go to the pizza place and they get filled up on pizza. But then, where they screw up as they bought a Pitcher of beer and now they got a buzz and let's go to the casino or let's go to the store and you know I mean when I used to sell fireworks. I seen that so many times.

180
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:50.190
Michael Justice: Yeah, that people would bring their kids in and spend in I'd have to tell me what are you going to do for the rest of the month.

181
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

182
00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:06.990
Michael Justice: No, because they want to spend seven $800 at the fireworks with and I could see the kids, they were let down so much that that mom probably thought, Oh, I'll spoil. I'm not thinking that you've got to have money for the rest of the month. That's the Fourth of July.

183
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:16.350
Michael Justice: Yeah, you know, you got the whole month ago, you know, now you're going to be struggling and you're just going to disappoint them kids again because you're not gonna have any money for him.

184
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:26.130
Michael Justice: It was like, Oh my Lord. And so that's kind of my take an analogy of the whole system. When you asked me, What's the cause.

185
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.970
Michael Justice: And then wrong childhood traumas and things like that, you know,

186
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.090
Michael Justice: There's a lot a lot more to it than that. But the general consensus says they didn't have any

187
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: By the whole model, Mom.

188
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:47.550
Michael Justice: Tivoli enforcing, you know, giving them positive reinforcements and no good role models to go by. And so you get that put in your mind.

189
00:24:48.120 --> 00:25:06.330
Michael Justice: And all of a sudden, if you're, you know, your mom and dad are just well for people. That's what your, your mind as you're okay. Well, all I really need is instead of, you know, man. I want to, I want to be a successful, you know, nobody's encouraging them either.

190
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.530
Michael Justice: And

191
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:12.540
Michael Justice: I see that a lot. So they're starving for that, you know, because they never got it as gets, you know,

192
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, encouragement and you know yeah someone's on your side.

193
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.330
Michael Justice: Right, so

194
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.470
Wow.

195
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: That is that is bad, that's and that's a generational thing, you know, you just keep passing it

196
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Down that, you know, if you don't get out of that.

197
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:40.920
Michael Justice: That's so true. And that's what that's what I deal with and that's what I think it's happening. And that's why, even with my kids, man. I tell my daughter. I go to your shoes and I encouraged her like

198
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:51.450
Michael Justice: And you're going to be like a movie star or a singer or dancer and I just can't encourage her enough to just whatever you want to be. You can be

199
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.100
Michael Justice: Yeah forth the effort and you know she's already booked smart so

200
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:03.420
Michael Justice: I said untalented that she she does ballets she's never missed ballet. I mean, of course, everything's on hold. Now,

201
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.030
Michael Justice: For my little tiny girl.

202
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.930
Michael Justice: You came up and hit me a couple times and almost floored me

203
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:22.980
Michael Justice: Anyone believe because she's so little, but she is like the leader in that she's advanced so much she doesn't give up when she gets to starting something

204
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:33.660
Michael Justice: She's like, totally missing jujitsu like you wouldn't believe and and ballet, she was super good at ballet and and everything she does he gets good at.

205
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:41.910
Michael Justice: And I just keep encouraging her and I tell her you know all the timing, you're going to be doing movies le you're going to be doing.

206
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:53.100
Michael Justice: singing and dancing, you know, of course, you know, you're going to be whatever you want to be and encouraged that way. And don't even look at us. Because, I mean, we're

207
00:26:53.580 --> 00:27:05.760
Michael Justice: Good examples of good people. But still there's even more. And so when I tell her. These stories and and she really think I'm going to be in the movies. And I said, I think you can be anything you want to be.

208
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:18.600
Michael Justice: Whenever you put your mind to just keep doing what you're doing and she's she she asked me because mom and me and her asking because Dad, you think I'm going to be thought. And I said,

209
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:29.550
Michael Justice: No, I really don't think so. I says, but you need to not watch our example and and do get so shrimp do like exercises and

210
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:38.340
Michael Justice: She's just she's a ball of energy. I really and and my son's the same way to ease. They're both super skinny. But, you know, yeah, they could

211
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:48.420
Michael Justice: If they make bad choices they could. So in the same sense, you know, don't look at us. We example for the physical fitness yet, but we're always

212
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:59.550
Michael Justice: Concerned, and we say yes. Do not eat bad foods and we try to encourage good foods and and you know that's our battle, but, you know, the whole thing is

213
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

214
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:17.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, the whole thing is about like being there and encouraging your children and wanting the best for them. And I mean I'm not suggesting those other parents didn't want the best for their kids. It's just they did what they could in their limited means, I suppose, and then another

215
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: They didn't do the best they could, who knows.

216
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.230
Michael Justice: It was passed down and then once it's passed down. And that's the acceptable norm.

217
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:41.490
Michael Justice: Yeah, then you get to that level. And you think, Okay, I'm good, but you're really not unfortunately as sad. It really is sad. You know, it's, um, because people are, you know, wonderful each one and then in the same sentence to you know

218
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:50.580
Michael Justice: We always say, Okay, so here's the three basic things we offer. And if we do anything over and above that, it's usually for somebody that's

219
00:28:51.570 --> 00:29:01.050
Michael Justice: Applying themselves trying to get out of that rut, you know, because there is a pretty big number of people that don't want to, and they want to learn a new way.

220
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:13.230
Michael Justice: You know, we had people go through our program. The life recovery program that went on to get their, their master's degree. We have to success stories.

221
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.110
Michael Justice: And this lady is running the big program for

222
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.700
DHS

223
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.530
Michael Justice: Vs.

224
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:36.090
Michael Justice: And the other ladies in the mental health field and she's like big way after bigwigs. So those are two just them are the ones that I say hey you know what anybody can do this and they were all down to the level of the people we serve. So

225
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.440
Michael Justice: They weren't to me.

226
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:46.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a great, great. Yeah, you know that you know there with hard work, there's, there's a way, you know,

227
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.690
Michael Justice: Yeah, yeah. Oh.

228
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:59.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're doing great work you have such good insights, because you seen intimately, you know, the different sides of this kind of people's lives, you know,

229
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that's a gift. So

230
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:20.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's great. Michael, I think it's wonderful. I'm so, so okay so so in terms of us your medication. I even though you're having more pain. I think it's best to try to you know keep keep those Suboxone stable.

231
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.780
Michael Justice: I think it's working. I

232
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.190
Know you're sleeping well

233
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: I should, you know, we should really try to keep it at bay and

234
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.100
Michael Justice: I'm surprised that it's still just did it work so good. It's just, it really does.

235
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.970
Michael Justice: Not oil effects. I don't get higher nothing from it. It's, uh,

236
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.570
Michael Justice: Yeah, just takes away that payments. It's a miracle.

237
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:51.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a miracle. Yeah, it's really good. I'm so glad that it's working for you and I want to encourage you to continue with the activities, you know, don't

238
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:59.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, like, I mean, obviously, trust your body. If something is too much like maybe that grass mowing situation was too strenuous

239
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.630
Michael Justice: Yeah, I

240
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:06.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Find exercises to keep your body in motion moving, you know, for your diabetes for your heart.

241
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:14.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, sugar control all of that is affected blood pressure control when you are more active with your body.

242
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.530
Michael Justice: Well, I had my cottage cheese and one piece of toast today. So that was my breakfast, so

243
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you're watching your diet.

244
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:37.200
Michael Justice: Yeah. And what it is is you know the wintertime, we still do our lawns. We maintain all of our properties but it's so easy. And then once it starts growing it becomes harder, more physical effort to do it. Yeah. And so that's all that is

245
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:56.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah yeah it's part of the par for the course is um okay so that's good. Um, the other thought I had for an activity exercise is, you mentioned your daughter's Jiu Jitsu and ballet.

246
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:07.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe there's something she could do like kids yoga or kids some, some kids thing and you could kind of do a little bit of the exercise with her.

247
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.450
Michael Justice: That's a lot.

248
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:29.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: I know that Rachel said that the living room area where the TV's is quite tight but you know i think i think it's an idea because I mean there's so much on YouTube if you were able to access that and trying to do some exercise with that too.

249
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:36.630
Michael Justice: Well, we do have a 10,000 square foot playground to just right right next door so we can always go to the ministry and do stuff so

250
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's true, yeah.

251
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:48.360
Michael Justice: We don't have that many people like we only have three people in the program right now. They're not even really in the program and we have

252
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: One.

253
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:58.170
Michael Justice: Yeah, there'll be always be two people there. Johnny and Kyle and then his mom's getting ready to get a place we've

254
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.440
Michael Justice: We've gotten people are stimulus money.

255
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.990
Michael Justice: The people that were in our program. We refer them all out to other programs like they're all signed up for hide.

256
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:15.900
Michael Justice: Right now, most of them were in motels doing 90 days in the motel.

257
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.330
Michael Justice: Some of those for mental health.

258
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:25.830
Michael Justice: has that ability and some of them. Department of Health and Human Services is doing a lot to get people off the streets as well.

259
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:34.440
Michael Justice: So again, you know, that guy. You talk to if you ever do talk to him if he wants to get in touch with me. I can refer him to a lady.

260
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:45.150
Michael Justice: That can probably if he doesn't have mental health issues or whatever, one way or the other. She can assess them and get him hooked up with somebody that could get him off of the streets.

261
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:45.930
Stover

262
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.660
Michael Justice: Yes. So if you get a chance to talk to him again. Tell him to reach out to me.

263
00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:01.050
Michael Justice: He can go to the ministry and dial the number on the on the sign and it'll ring my phone, personally, and I will get them in touch with

264
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:19.770
Michael Justice: Daphne, and she will. I've seen that happen. I mean, I've seen well eight people that were in our program went right into 90 days in the motel off the street and had about trips and so they're actively looking for places. And so, okay.

265
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:20.790
Um,

266
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.100
Michael Justice: There's ways

267
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the ministries name is our daily bread.

268
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:36.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, yeah. Okay, so he would just have to physically go, you'll see the sign. And there's a phone number. He just calls and he asked for you. It should be

269
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:42.540
Michael Justice: Two minutes anywhere in this town. You can be at our place. It's a 15 minute walk. Yeah.

270
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:42.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Great.

271
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.310
Michael Justice: Great, no matter where you're at.

272
00:34:45.000 --> 00:35:00.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm sure he knows. Okay. Yeah, I'll let them know the question I had, though, is I wonder for people that are so he's obviously just engaging and treatments. So he's still like trying to get sober.

273
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. What are the rules around that. I mean, I would imagine, he needs to be sober, but

274
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:19.290
Michael Justice: Believe it or not, they're not really demanding that but that's another avenue. If somebody wants to get off the street, we refer to all these different agencies we get people off the streets by getting into a program so

275
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Many day

276
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:33.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think he would really benefit. This is the kind of person. I mean, I just the way he was just pretty intensely in his addiction. I think he would benefit from like being in a residential like treatment with

277
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.280
Michael Justice: Three programs that teen challenge. And I don't know if you're familiar with them.

278
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.040
Michael Justice: And that's not for teens or 60 year old people go to teen challenge. Oh.

279
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:56.280
Michael Justice: It's a free program live in program to where they just make you get food stamps and they take all your $300 a month food stamps and you go through their whole program. It's like a one year intensive program.

280
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: And people

281
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:05.670
Michael Justice: Get off the streets, all the time. By doing that and and then they get to work with them and then you'd be surprised at how much success stories they have

282
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay team is one resource. Okay.

283
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:15.780
Michael Justice: And then there's but different ones we get we can send you to your rica Humboldt County and get a

284
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:25.500
Michael Justice: get referrals to all these different programs. So that's something we we really tried to do right now, especially since we don't have housing so

285
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.930
Michael Justice: That's what Ray Okay.

286
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, oh thank you Michael see who knew. You're a patient but also a great resource.

287
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:45.840
Michael Justice: Well, I'm. That's what we do. That's the Mission Possible. That's her own new job as I refer everybody to death. He definitely takes care of all the leg work with all the other agencies and

288
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.620
Michael Justice: And then I do the food and all that stuff that I do.

289
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:59.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, got it. Okay. Cool. Well thank you. Thanks for all the info. I will if anything pops up like that guy. I will refer that over to you guys.

290
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.330
Michael Justice: Please do. Yeah.

291
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, Michael. I'll talk to you next time.

292
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.670
Michael Justice: Okay. Sounds good. You have a good day.

293
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.710
Michael Justice: Bye bye.

294
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, patient

295
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Michael justice.

296
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: No unusual for

297
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: This is Raphael share know unusual.

298
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:49.980
Rocky: There we go.

299
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.350
Rocky: Hey, my headphones were connected via Bluetooth. Sorry.

300
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:10.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: But good, how are you doing are you okay now I know you're freaking out. I'm so I'm so glad I was like oh gosh she's freaking out and you know fretting over this. But did you get to speak to your physician that day.

301
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:18.390
Rocky: I canceled because I didn't need to talk to her anymore. Um, I looked it up and it was it was fine. It was just one day.

302
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:32.010
Rocky: Okay, yeah. Um, I just didn't read it. And it's funny, you know, it said surface antibodies detected and I thought I just looked bad to me. But yeah, I got it. Um,

303
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:46.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're not the only one to freak out over that particular type of testing. The other day I had a different patient who had a similar read, but for the hip a

304
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:53.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: And she was just like, you like freaking out, like, oh my god, am I sick. What does this mean, you know, whatever. But it was the antibodies, so

305
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.650
Rocky: What, what did they always test for antibodies or is this new thing and then thing.

306
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:07.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, this is a no. This is a pretty typical test. Yeah, we checked to make to see sometimes do you have immunity.

307
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: And also if you're acutely ill, they check. Yeah.

308
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:28.020
Rocky: So I had a panel done I think december of 2019 and there was not a surface antibody test, I don't think, although the chart did, yeah. So whenever you see read on those things from quest.

309
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.430
Rocky: It looks like it's bad, they should have a note there that says

310
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: They really should to

311
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Say, you know, this may be that you have immunity or like at least to give you some calmness.

312
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.160
Rocky: Exactly right.

313
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:48.330
Rocky: Yeah, there we go. I'm switching the sermon on. There we go. Cool. Yeah. So, so

314
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:59.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you're over that everything's good on paper, you know for your test. How are you feeling like mentally this week. How did it go for you.

315
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:08.790
Rocky: It's it's going great. I'm guess what I stabilized on 16 milligrams for seven days straight.

316
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: No way off.

317
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.690
Rocky: I totally did.

318
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:19.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, that's amazing and effort. Did you do it like the half, half, half thing or did you do one

319
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:34.200
Rocky: No, I did was I just took the first day I did. I took four and then for an but the remaining days I just took an eight milligram film like it was a

320
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:46.230
Rocky: Sort of treating it like a vitamin or something. Just take it eight and then take it again if you feel like you want to actually I was taking the second eight

321
00:40:48.180 --> 00:41:03.870
Rocky: Even if I didn't feel like I wanted it, but I knew that I would feel bad if I didn't think if I won. But the cool trick about this is that if I look at the clock and it's after one o'clock, no matter what. I don't take any more. So that's working.

322
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's working.

323
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: The 1pm rule. I love

324
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.080
Rocky: Yeah, I guess.

325
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:11.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: I was good.

326
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:21.720
Rocky: I guess that's the trick is to just find, um, you know, whatever works with everybody's brain because this is just a chemical you know plays, mine, mine games, you know,

327
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:30.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, got a different thing. So for you. Yeah. And how has. How has your sleeping and waking up in

328
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.550
Rocky: I'm fresh in the morning. I'm no drinking

329
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:54.090
Rocky: And that's a great combination I sleep really well. I go to bed early now like 930 or 10 and I sleep straight through. I slept too much. I think, I think I'm sleeping like nine and 10 hours sometimes

330
00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.570
Rocky: So, but, yeah, it's I don't I'm letting myself do that because

331
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:05.730
Rocky: I'm not working right now. So it's, it's, kind of, which should be fine.

332
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:06.810
Rocky: Yeah, I'm

333
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feeling like it.

334
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:09.300
Right.

335
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.330
Rocky: So work.

336
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:25.290
Rocky: There's still work. I'm looking for work every day as a consultant and with, you know, Disney or or NBC or one of those studios around here and then also

337
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:35.760
Rocky: Fundraising. But that's very quiet. I'm so I'm attending a couple of webinars every week, meeting new people checking out my technology.

338
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.050
Rocky: So yeah, actually, I'm pretty healthy and happy.

339
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.810
Rocky: I'm reading this book.

340
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.230
Rocky: I don't know if you've ever heard.

341
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.190
Rocky: Serena talk about this book on fuck yourself.

342
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:58.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, I think she told me she recently read it, or she recently ordered it

343
00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.460
Rocky: Now is it

344
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:08.310
Rocky: She was reading it. When I first saw her two weeks ago. And I'm going to see her again tomorrow. It's really good for some reason, I figured out

345
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:16.290
Rocky: I mean this last 10 years of my life I've been really weird. It's, I haven't been myself. Since the crash.

346
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:27.630
Rocky: Steve mention our treasury secretary. I've told you screwed my credit illegally and I lost two shopping centers and fell out of retirement and had to go back to work.

347
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:39.300
Rocky: And now I'm a month to month guy, but I had two surgeries got on Suboxone got off of it and then three and a half years ago, back on it, due to have surgery.

348
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:56.400
Rocky: So I'm just trying to get this 10 years past me and go back to myself and I'm starting to feel that that's happening. And I know that getting off the Suboxone is going to be the biggest success of that, if I can do it.

349
00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.840
Rocky: But the the point I'm getting to is reading this book.

350
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:10.650
Rocky: I feel like I have the ability to brush off negative thoughts. Really simply, like it's just so simple, whereas before

351
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:24.960
Rocky: I was like flypaper every negative thought stuff for a while and it took a lot of energy to get rid of it. And it's, it's sort of like cognitive behavioral therapy becomes second nature. After a while, if you think about it enough.

352
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:37.290
Rocky: Yeah, and that's happening with me. I'm feel like I'm Teflon I get these negative thoughts like, God, why are they not returning my call maybe our partnership after a coven with this guy in Tennessee.

353
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:52.380
Rocky: Maybe he's sick of me. I'm just annoying and that's why he's not responding well I choose to decide that that's not it. But he's busy. He doesn't have time to deal with me right now. And that's it. So go be happy go on a bike ride. Yeah.

354
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.490
Rocky: So I'm kind of

355
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.450
Rocky: I'm kind of feeling that this last week and I'm digging it.

356
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Aligns a happy for you off. That's such a relief.

357
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know that that burden is off your shoulder of

358
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

359
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that was an important

360
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:13.200
Rocky: important first step for handling emotions because reaching for

361
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:20.160
Rocky: Suboxone was one of the ways that I would get through those negative mental issues.

362
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

363
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.020
Rocky: No, so that's good. I just had a

364
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:38.010
Rocky: Nice phone call with my psychiatrist, which when I changed providers. I had to go through a bunch of to get them. They say medications. I got all new providers.

365
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:47.940
Rocky: And he was asking me if I know he's gay. I'm on by Vance, which I know a lot of people were on, I don't like Adderall, but I

366
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.520
Rocky: was diagnosed with adult ADHD.

367
00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:06.330
Rocky: And that was probably a result of losing everything in cricket and and the fact that I experience depression, but I don't ever have hopelessness. I mean, I

368
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:17.610
Rocky: I've never been that kind of a person ever so but i'd be sad that this should happen to me, and I can't seem to get over it, you know. But, uh, so by Beyonce. I like

369
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:35.010
Rocky: I have that I take that every day, but he was saying, I don't really like to give you advice Vance and Monique and at the same time, it's just like uppers and downers so he's we we down or he asked me, Would, would you guys be interested in

370
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.640
Rocky: Taking that part over

371
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:45.150
Rocky: Because he doesn't want to be the guy that's given me by Vance and Klonopin

372
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.910
Rocky: So what we're doing. First

373
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:53.130
Rocky: Is, well, I told him I'd ask you whether or not you guys could take that over for him.

374
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.470
Rocky: On the other hand, he's

375
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:04.980
Rocky: We're going down to three, three a week because I was taking between three and five a week before so 30 tablets. A month was fine.

376
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:17.280
Rocky: So I have nine tablets left. And quite frankly, I was realizing that sometimes when I felt overwhelmed and I took a Klonopin one milligram during the day. Never at night because of the respiratory issues.

377
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.380
Rocky: Because of

378
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:36.720
Rocky: I was drinking a lot of Diet cokes. I went through like a little three or four week phase of drinking Diet Dr. Pepper with caffeine during the day and sometimes I felt overwhelmed at two or three o'clock, and it was it was stupid caffeine. It wasn't anything else. So I stopped that.

379
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.820
Rocky: And I don't

380
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:53.250
Rocky: Really need more than two or three Klonopin during the week for overwhelming kind of circumstances. So we are winding down, but he asked whether or not you would take it over so that the same doctor is not giving uppers and downers

381
00:47:54.420 --> 00:48:04.290
Rocky: I do like Klonopin on occasion, because I know it's there more than I like taking it itself just knowing that it's their meaning. I know I don't have to

382
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:23.610
Rocky: Hate the feeling of being overwhelmed when I get a call from somebody that says, no, we're not interested in funding you or whatever, like that. So, um, you know, money's really tight. I'm living on unemployment, so you know every phone call is can be overwhelming sometimes so

383
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.530
Rocky: So that was that happened last hour. So I thought I would bring

384
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.210
Rocky: That up and see how you felt. Yeah.

385
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:41.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, thanks for bringing it up. Yeah. I understand the concern. Yeah, with offers and downers. In fact, I was to be honest, I was kind of questioning myself.

386
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:52.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Why you were on that regimen. In the first place, but, um, but, so it's good. I mean, I think that's good. The nice cautious. But in terms of taking it over.

387
00:48:52.830 --> 00:49:06.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: The clonazepam would be something if you wanted to do it through right part that would be something that one of our like psychiatry colleagues would take over could take over. We have

388
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:23.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think we have a few of them. Now we have Mary, who's a nurse practitioner who prescribes and then there's a few others. I don't really know their names, but I mean, so we could do that. But then you might as well. Transfer your vitamins to bright heart.

389
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:30.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: As well, if you're going to do. I mean, I don't know, to consolidate so you don't have like so many different positions that you're seeing

390
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.550
Rocky: I agree.

391
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:39.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could do that you could you could opt to do that and like established care for your

392
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:44.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: The psychiatric stuff ADHD and anxiety.

393
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:47.940
Rocky: I mean, it's such as

394
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.580
Rocky: Yes.

395
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:57.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're doing two a week or trying to stick to a to a week. He's given. So that would be like eight pills for

396
00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:19.650
Rocky: Work. So I'm taking in between three and five. Now he wants to push me to three only a week I have nine left. So we're going to talk in like three weeks or when I run out and go from there. So that gives us some time in the meantime it kind of makes sense to put everything in one place.

397
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:25.590
Rocky: But if the new psychiatrists might have the same issue, but

398
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:33.900
Rocky: I'm not taking that much quantity and I'm not drinking at all. And I don't take lump in at night. So I don't know.

399
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:51.090
Rocky: Why they you know if they're if it's 15 pills, a month. I don't think anybody would have that much of a problem with it. So that means really he shouldn't be having a problem with it, but I was doing 30 a month. And now we're down to 15 so

400
00:50:51.270 --> 00:51:09.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: So maybe, yeah. Just give it, give it a then then maybe wait and see. Like when you talk to him one more time. How that conversation goes and if he's like, if he feels more comfortable and you're able to stick to the 1512 to 15 a month. Right.

401
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.160
Rocky: Yeah, I can. That's easy.

402
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:18.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. And then, like you said, for you. It's more the fact that you know it's there.

403
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:25.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, then then anything else right at the security of like, well, I, I have something if I really need it.

404
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:30.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's the bigger thing for you than the actual medication.

405
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:37.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. So, so the number shouldn't matter so much. I have a feeling, you'd be okay.

406
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: With less and you're already saying, yeah, I know I can do it.

407
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:52.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: So let's see. So if he, you know, I think that if you comply and you do less half as much as he used to he'll probably feel more comfortable. Yeah.

408
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.820
Rocky: Let's if I can, if, if it's not a problem to just

409
00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.500
Rocky: Um, with the nine left. I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM ON JUNE 16 which would be three a week.

410
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:15.540
Rocky: And and we'll, we'll just do that for now and see where that goes. Because if if it ends up being 10 to 15 tablets. A month I'm I don't think you'll, you'll have a problem.

411
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:31.170
Rocky: I like, I mean, I like this guy a lot really but you know I don't really have any psychic psychiatric problems right now. My only issue is Suboxone wanting to get off of that, really, I mean, I was taking CLANTON, you know, for 10 years

412
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.180
Rocky: After the crash it helped because I mean it was there.

413
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're on search willing to right

414
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.020
Yeah.

415
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:47.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know the sertraline the clonazepam in the finance, you know, ADHD, and

416
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:55.620
Rocky: That's, that's true. These pills are all helping me. And that's why, probably, I don't feel like I have any psychiatric issues at the moment. I mean,

417
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: I, that's good. Yeah.

418
00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:02.460
Rocky: Yeah, stable is good and the fact that I was able to do

419
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.300
Rocky: 16 for a week. That was really good.

420
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: is amazing. I'm so I'm so happy about that news.

421
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:17.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: So for our to move forward. We had given you enough for for a day at the last script.

422
00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: And go do you what do you want to do this time now that

423
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.200
Rocky: I want to do.

424
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.270
Rocky: I would like to do three films.

425
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.550
Rocky: Oh, so I have the extra if I want

426
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.200
Rocky: But that I'll feel really good.

427
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

428
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.680
Rocky: Doing to, um, and then also the on dental town, but this time.

429
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.270
Rocky: You want sublingual

430
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:42.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: sublingual. Let me see if I it comes out. This one is the oral tablet that came up last

431
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.870
Rocky: Yeah, that was a problem that doesn't. I don't like that. I don't take them.

432
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:52.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's the other thing is, I thought that you didn't do even do take these like

433
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like I you didn't

434
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.160
Rocky: Drink

435
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.550
Rocky: Since I quit drinking. I've taken a take them a lot less

436
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:01.620
Rocky: But

437
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:10.230
Rocky: I still find myself a little bit nauseous. In the morning, for some reason, sometimes I mean maybe five times a week.

438
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:20.040
Rocky: So I just take to those sub link walls. And for some reason, I just fix it and I go on with my day.

439
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm just

440
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:32.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thinking like what are we masking here because it's not. I mean, it's a little concerning to me that you have

441
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:47.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Nausea, out of nowhere, without us knowing, like why why do you have it. Is it is it acid reflux, and if so, then you know you should be taking something like a result like protonix or

442
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.880
Rocky: Something's not acid reflux.

443
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:57.480
Rocky: On when I have acid reflux, which is a couple times a month, I take Zantac and it fixes it immediately.

444
00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: You take it.

445
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's not a chronic, this feels different. This isn't just nausea.

446
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:18.750
Rocky: It's just a little bit of nausea and it was mostly associated with with drinking and now that I don't. It's less, but I still find myself like I took two pills. This morning, even though I don't have any more sublingual

447
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:33.960
Rocky: Because I just kind of felt a little bit weird, a little bit nauseous. For some reason, I don't know why. Maybe I'll start paying attention to that some some more as to why like what did I eat the night before and stuff like that.

448
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:46.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I would. Because, you know, yeah. And like less is more. If we can you know get you off of this to like it's one less thing you have to worry about and and like I said it's not

449
00:55:47.550 --> 00:56:03.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's not a typical thing. It's not something that you know we should normalize like what's going on with your gas Strix stuff like what's happening there. So, so, yeah, look at patterns look at what you're eating and then you may want to also ask your primary care doctor about

450
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:04.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: I did say, hey, I told her.

451
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:15.750
Rocky: I told her about it and I was supposed to give us another client colonoscopy, except they canceled all those I didn't tell her about it. So we're working on.

452
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: It. We want to scope from the top two to see, is there anything going on.

453
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: From the top, and then. Yeah.

454
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so what's coming out for

455
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:45.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: For for this in my in this formulary that's popping up is a four milligram tablet, which is not the one you want. There's a four milligram disintegrating strip and then there's a there is a this integrating tablet.

456
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.380
Rocky: disintegrating tablet is what I've been taking. That's the one. Okay.

457
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's get you that one.

458
00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:54.480
Okay.

459
00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:57.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Alrighty.

460
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Patient tolerated previously. Okay.

461
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: God and you said you take

462
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:10.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Two in the mornings or

463
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:10.860
Rocky: I mean, yeah.

464
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:16.290
Rocky: Two in the morning when I feel it. So whatever whatever you

465
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:17.820
Rocky: Gave you say

466
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:23.910
Rocky: Well, yeah, the month before you gave me the pill version, it was the right amount

467
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: That was 90 pills. So that would give you three a day and you would take them.

468
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.940
Rocky: I only take two a day usually

469
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just do two to two times a day.

470
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:36.450
Okay.

471
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:44.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, if you need more will give you more. I'm just, I just, I'm just concerned if you're nauseous every morning. I mean, it's a little

472
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.950
Rocky: It's not every morning, but

473
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.590
Rocky: I do seem to go through them.

474
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:52.350
Rocky: They do taste good.

475
00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.840
Rocky: It's like the, you know, it's sort of the sublingual work like with that.

476
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:09.990
Rocky: There is no side effects or addictive anything on those. Is it. What's the, what's the issue.

477
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't think there's an addictive property that I've ever heard of. Right.

478
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now addict.

479
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:23.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: But in term side effects. Every medication as possible side effects. And after a while, I don't know.

480
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: I and with particular one, I don't know, I'm not

481
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:30.330
Rocky: I'll start paying attention to what it is or

482
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.760
Rocky: What could be an all see

483
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:34.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

484
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just a recommendation, just for your general health

485
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:38.370
You know, yeah.

486
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.260
Rocky: So that's

487
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.530
Rocky: Today that 60 comes in boxes, I think.

488
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.980
Rocky: Okay, however many that is 60

489
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:52.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And then, and then we want to do.

490
00:58:53.250 --> 00:59:01.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Three times in three films a day even though you're going to really try to stick to this new routine of 16 of us to a day.

491
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.060
Rocky: Right, okay.

492
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: So let's do the Suboxone

493
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:22.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Well, I think that's great. I think this one thing worked well and you feel good, you know, you're motivated to stick to it because it physically makes you feel good.

494
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mm hmm. So, so when when

495
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:35.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then let's stabilize on this. Let's see how you do. If you can stick to a whole month of of that that means

496
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:42.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: You would have a month and a half's worth almost or something like that. Maybe a little less than that.

497
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: The map. But anyway, the point is, let's see if you could stick to it. Keep a log of what you're doing.

498
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.750
Rocky: Yeah, I do that now.

499
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:52.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good.

500
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.800
Rocky: Everything I put in my body is now on the computer.

501
00:59:56.550 --> 01:00:00.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sweet. Okay, good. That's a good thing because you want to

502
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:12.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really be accurate about what you're doing, especially since you want to wind down or stick to a certain regimen. It's good to be okay. Okay. So yeah, that's

503
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:19.770
Rocky: just hoping that there isn't, if we, if we go a whole month at 16

504
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.650
Rocky: What's the next step.

505
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:26.280
Rocky: Would it be 12 would it be a

506
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.170
Rocky: I don't

507
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.590
Rocky: Wanna. I don't want to feel those withdrawals where I started to feel fluey and all that.

508
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.600
Rocky: So,

509
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.880
Rocky: I mean, you've probably got more experience than I do. Although I'm taking us longer

510
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.600
Rocky: So the question I'm getting at is

511
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:54.900
Rocky: What can I look forward to. If I stabilize at 16 would then be we would start on 12

512
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well,

513
01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:57.270
Rocky: A couple of weeks.

514
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:08.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: 12 yeah we could do 12 if you're worried about 12 we could try to do. We could convert to the two milligram films and go to like

515
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:12.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: 14 from 16 we can

516
01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.670
Rocky: Go, I can, I can call them. It's just, it's

517
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:16.290
Rocky: Just as easy.

518
01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:18.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: To quarter. I mean, yeah.

519
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.550
Rocky: Yeah, yeah. To do that,

520
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm used to. Yeah, we could do that. We could just go from 16 to 14

521
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.060
Rocky: So we do like a go down two milligrams every couple of weeks.

522
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.660
Um,

523
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.490
Rocky: Does the

524
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:39.630
Rocky: What would a sensitive body like mine, be able to do that without any withdrawals.

525
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:55.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: I i mean i i can't guarantee use zero withdrawal. I mean, I think there might be some discomfort. As we step down. But I think if we go slow enough, it'll be

526
01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:04.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Minimal like you'll be like, Yeah, you know, maybe you're a little achy or you're feeling a little more anxious or something, I don't know, something subtle but

527
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:25.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not like dramatic enough to be disruptive to your day. But you, you probably will feel a little something, you know, as we go down. But if we do it so slowly and so gently like you probably will be like it's tolerable and then you'll stabilize, you know, and then we'll, we'll kind of stuff.

528
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:32.160
Rocky: So I hope that works. I do. I hope this this doing it really slow like this works.

529
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:33.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

530
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:47.760
Rocky: Because you know when I tried to do that eight milligram. And I was like, wow, I can do this, you know, the fourth day last month I felt really awful. That was very discomfort was big.

531
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.300
Yeah.

532
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: We don't want it. We want to go very gently, where you're like,

533
01:02:53.310 --> 01:03:01.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm not feeling optimal but I'm okay. Like, I can do this. And then, and then give it a few days and then you stabilize and you're like, Okay, I feel normal again.

534
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:11.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we drop. Again, you know, like we're gonna, I think we should do it that way tier by tier. And so, like right now you're at 16 and you're feeling good. You look great. You're saying you feel

535
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:13.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, so

536
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:23.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: I do, so it's awesome. So, so this is what I'm talking about. So let's stabilize here let's let's keep it at 16 let's not oscillate. The best you can, you know, not to go up.

537
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:33.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then if you do, you know, we talked about it. Like what happened, how can we keep you at this level. And then we just keep going if you can stick to it. Great. We can keep going, you know,

538
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.580
Rocky: Okay. Sounds good. Okay.

539
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:46.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: So don't don't anticipate badness. It's not going to be horrible. You know, we're gonna we're gonna try to finesse it the best we can. So that you're minimally feeling it.

540
01:03:47.370 --> 01:04:07.710
Rocky: Okay. All right. That's, that's good. I wish that I wasn't so sensitive, like I was talking, you know, my psychotic just didn't think it was necessarily should be diagnosed as having an opioid disorder opioid use because I never really took more than I had a couple early fills.

541
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.450
Rocky: And pharmacies drove me crazy for a while but

542
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.730
Rocky: The point is, is that

543
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:22.200
Rocky: I am not mentally addicted to these like I would quit tomorrow if I didn't feel like shit completely shit.

544
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.380
Rocky: It's so discomforting for me that

545
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:30.120
Rocky: If we do it slow. I think that's probably the only way I'm going to be able to beat this.

546
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:38.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: You didn't do it. Yeah. No, I know. I think you're going to do this, it'll be it'll be fine. You just need patience and and

547
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:48.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just persistence and discipline about like your 1pm thing like that was great. You kept yourself to it. No excuses. Boom. That's how you have to proceed.

548
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:58.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: And mentally you're finding less excuses to take it like you said you're changing the way you think about things in your life and stuff. So you have less

549
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Temptation

550
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: To like skew it you know

551
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:03.750
So it's all good.

552
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:20.100
Rocky: Yeah. And the other thing is sometimes if I really, really like I remember I was telling Dr eyes rolling. This is that I can replace wanting to take the feeling of wanting to take another film with taking a Klonopin instead

553
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.490
Rocky: And I've done that in the past, to see if it works. And it does, but I don't have a particular

554
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:31.440
Rocky: Thing for Benz's myself. I have never like unlike

555
01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:50.340
Rocky: Opioids I have never really dug Benz's at all. I mean, just, it helps to feel get rid of the overwhelming feeling, but I don't feel high. Yeah, I'm a big guy in one milligram is not much. By the way, my diets i mean i i started exercising every day since I've seen you.

556
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:51.150
Rocky: And that's good.

557
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:59.430
Rocky: I haven't weighed myself yet but I'm I hope I'm losing now but that's another battle. I'm working on. So,

558
01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:00.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm glad.

559
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:15.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, they was all right. Well, we will talk next week, stick to the 16 I prescribed the two things, and hopefully the XO friend or the, you know, and ondansetron is the correct one. So you'll see

560
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:30.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: If not, they can call they can call right hard or you can call Danielle is the liaison and will change it, it's no big deal but i think i mean that's the only option and gave me gave me a strip or a tablet that disintegrates so

561
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.190
Rocky: Okay. That should be the one that doesn't say sublingual on it though.

562
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:38.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, just says disintegrating.

563
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.050
Rocky: How do you do you already

564
01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: Resolved in your mouth. It just kind of melt.

565
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.580
Rocky: Yeah okay um

566
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: But it doesn't have to be under your tongue. It just in your mouth somewhere it melts.

567
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.560
Rocky: Yeah, okay.

568
01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:50.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: So this is like

569
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: The box and it has to be under your tongue.

570
01:06:53.340 --> 01:07:04.860
Rocky: Oh, that's right. So do you actually order this electronically, or do you give it to bright heart and they do it because they can make sure with whoever calls the pharmacy. But if it goes in electronically. It's

571
01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:08.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's electronically going direct

572
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.420
Rocky: To the pharmacy.

573
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.450
Rocky: All right, well, I think, I think there can't be any mistake this time. If you put the dissolving tablets.

574
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

575
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

576
01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:18.420
Rocky: It should be good.

577
01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. All right, take care. All right.

578
01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.550
Rocky: Bye bye.

579
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.080
Jason Casey: Good afternoon.

580
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hey, good afternoon.

581
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:39.210
Tommie Timmons: Good afternoon. How are you doing today.

582
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. How are you guys doing

583
01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:46.410
Tommie Timmons: Oh boy. Soon, very quiet. I'm good, how are you

584
01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:54.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good, good. I'm so Jason What's up with you. I know Tommy said what happened time and you forgot

585
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:56.730
Tommie Timmons: Something. Now I fell asleep. That's

586
01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:59.160
Tommie Timmons: Back working so

587
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.730
Tommie Timmons: Like they got me doing on 630 to five in the morning.

588
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:04.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

589
01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:06.630
Tommie Timmons: Yeah, so I took it.

590
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.960
Tommie Timmons: But shoot unemployment was paying me more.

591
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:11.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh really,

592
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.310
Tommie Timmons: Yeah, yes, I

593
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.120
Jason Casey: Meant right now than I did. It might, um,

594
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.020
Tommie Timmons: Yeah.

595
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:23.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: More money with unemployment than you do with your job. Wow.

596
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: That that is not an incentive to work.

597
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:28.680
Tommie Timmons: At all.

598
01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.380
Jason Casey: Not at all. I don't want to go back my shit I

599
01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just terrible like the comedy is just going to be a man. This is crazy.

600
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:42.300
Tommie Timmons: Oh, that's what our President is doing on purpose, but I will get off in today because I got a whole bunch of us on that.

601
01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:56.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'll kind of a message this. I mean, it's great that we have support for unemployment, but but then we got to have a long term solution of, like, people need to go back to work and make money, you know,

602
01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:57.420
Tommie Timmons: Mm hmm.

603
01:08:58.770 --> 01:08:59.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Very weird

604
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:04.530
Jason Casey: Yeah, they were saying that like if your employer offers you your job.

605
01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:05.010
Jason Casey: Back.

606
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:13.620
Jason Casey: And you deny it, they'll cancel your unemployment. So that's one incentive, I guess. But how, how are they going to know unless you're

607
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:28.410
Tommie Timmons: Oh, they're going to know. Yeah. But this is what kills me is that, um, they're talking about. They're going to waive your rent and you know your cable and your bills and everything and stuff. And then you're just be

608
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:39.810
Tommie Timmons: You know liable for those bills. Once you know the pandemic is over and everything that stuff. If I'm having trouble paying them now. How the hell am I gonna pay three and four months.

609
01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:41.610
Jason Casey: All

610
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.960
Tommie Timmons: Together this

611
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.640
Jason Casey: Man, yeah.

612
01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:45.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

613
01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.620
Jason Casey: See, everybody into a hole.

614
01:09:46.650 --> 01:10:03.360
Tommie Timmons: But see this guy he is. He allowed this to happen, so he can come through as a savior. They're going to reelect this buffoon. They're gonna reelect this idiot. But every time. And I don't mean to play the race card, but this is something that might not be related but it's relative um

615
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:17.880
Tommie Timmons: Every time black people make a step forward as a whole. First we have to fight for our Martin Luther King going to stamp after we get him. Then who did they put on the stamp after that Daffy Duck.

616
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:27.510
Tommie Timmons: After we get a first black president and everything. Who did they put in there this morning and I'm talking about the medical term moron.

617
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:40.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: I totally agree with you. I totally agree. You're right, it did feel. I mean, I'm obviously I am not black. But when Obama was elected.

618
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:56.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I was, you know, I like I cried. I remember being so emotional. I couldn't like I was just so proud of, like, being an American of like this happening.

619
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.710
Tommie Timmons: Like we make a step forward.

620
01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:02.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, it felt like progress. Like, this is awesome, like we're in

621
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:13.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly the world like this is great. Yeah, foot steps forward and then the next thing, like you said, is like an extreme multiple steps backward like

622
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Embarrassed right

623
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:15.480
Tommie Timmons: Did

624
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.110
You like

625
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.640
Tommie Timmons: If I was another country distributor bourbon. Time to attack.

626
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.130
Tommie Timmons: Because I will respect him or his cabinet.

627
01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.210
Tommie Timmons: This is a perfect time to attack.

628
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:38.010
Tommie Timmons: But I got a lot of views towards that guy when they told me when they asked him about this coronas virus and everything.

629
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:41.190
Tommie Timmons: I don't worry about it, we got it under control and blew it off.

630
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.130
Tommie Timmons: But he knew what he was doing.

631
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

632
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:55.140
Tommie Timmons: He knew what he was doing. They allowed to ship to come over here and attack us. They started bringing all of these people over here from them boats and documentary in California, why

633
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.300
Tommie Timmons: Where's the biggest homeless population that the state of California.

634
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.210
Tommie Timmons: But they got to control it somehow. So how they gonna do that set it off in the jail's

635
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.050
Tommie Timmons: Population control.

636
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:19.710
Tommie Timmons: And everyone that are warned us about about this, about this this virus in this this thing that's going to change the world like it has

637
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:32.700
Tommie Timmons: I mean, this is a worldwide problem. And I'm scared I'm concerned, this is a worldwide problem I have maybe I wouldn't be lying if I said I have I have mask everywhere.

638
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:39.150
Tommie Timmons: I have masks. Everywhere. Everywhere I got all kinds of different mass

639
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.740
Jason Casey: That's awesome.

640
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.050
Tommie Timmons: I have all kinds of different mask.

641
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.790
Tommie Timmons: This is ridiculous. You're

642
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Ready, you're ready. Tell me, man.

643
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.390
Jason Casey: I've only got the one mass. My mom sewed for me. And I did.

644
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.090
Tommie Timmons: Have one in every car I drive

645
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.470
Tommie Timmons: And all my bike.

646
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:18.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. No, I agree. This is a crazy situation we're in. But, um, yeah. Wow, are you guys are you guys doing any zoom like a meetings or anything like that. Like community.

647
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Support meeting.

648
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.380
Jason Casey: I tried like the recovery Dharma thing.

649
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.450
Jason Casey: It was more like

650
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:30.360
Jason Casey: Meditation focus and mindfulness

651
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.050
Jason Casey: I tried a couple of times now on the zoom

652
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:35.970
Tommie Timmons: It's interesting.

653
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:42.450
Jason Casey: I think if I were there in person. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I'd have too much anxiety and I just freak out.

654
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:51.870
Jason Casey: But, with it being on zoom. I can kind of just block the screen where I can't yet and I don't even have to show my video and I can just listen along and talk. I want to. Oh, that's

655
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's true.

656
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:55.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's, that's an interesting. Look at that.

657
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:57.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because, yeah.

658
01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.180
Jason Casey: Patients that are shy or anxious

659
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:06.630
Jason Casey: The good way to get them into the those kinds of groups and they don't actually have to put themselves in an uncomfortable situation.

660
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: They have control over how much they can expose or not.

661
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: I like that. Okay, that's a very good take on it recovery Dharma someone else was saying there's something called conscious recovery, which is a Buddhist

662
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:24.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: based thing conscious recovery.

663
01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:28.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they do like 2030, is that the same thing. It's not right.

664
01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:33.210
Jason Casey: It sounds very, very familiar. If it's not the same, it's probably an offshoot

665
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: It may be

666
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.340
Jason Casey: Like I said, I've only done it twice now so I don't really know too much.

667
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:42.750
Jason Casey: But was that helping me

668
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.190
Tommie Timmons: Jason is it helping me

669
01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:48.960
Jason Casey: Nah, it's too soon to say like

670
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:51.360
Jason Casey: Oh, crap.

671
01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:52.830
Jason Casey: I know I'm just

672
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.670
Jason Casey: Checking it out.

673
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.250
Tommie Timmons: If you are all later on, man. You have any more information about that I'd be interested in hearing it.

674
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:01.440
Jason Casey: Yeah. Not a problem.

675
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:07.560
Tommie Timmons: Yeah, it almost sounds like metaphysical philosophy, but it also also sounds like a little bit of cognitive behavioral

676
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:08.400
Tommie Timmons: Theory. I'm also

677
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, exactly. It's probably which is good. Yeah.

678
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:13.050
Hmm.

679
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, and Jason, it's, it's free, right. You just Googled it and found it or how did you

680
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.640
Jason Casey: Yep, no, I just googled alternatives to a na and that was one of the ones that came up

681
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:30.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Awesome. Okay, cool.

682
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:32.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cool.

683
01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:45.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, okay. So you're doing that. Are you you're sticking to that, to see if it'll help. There's a smart recovery smart recovery is more the cognitive behavioral therapy based stuff.

684
01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:48.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think they

685
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: They do it that way.

686
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:58.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: But anyway, so. Okay, so that's what you're doing. So Jason, you look good today. You seem happy and happy are you doing well.

687
01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.240
I'm

688
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:08.160
Jason Casey: Kinda I guess last week was intense. I had

689
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:15.330
Jason Casey: Having to leave my house and getting a hotel room to get away from an unsafe situation.

690
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:24.030
Jason Casey: So that's actually why I missed yesterday is I was in the process of moving and setting up the new internet I found a new room to rent. I moved in.

691
01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:28.650
Jason Casey: But other than that, I've been good.

692
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:36.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, that sounds like some drama, but you've you've, you know, gotten past it.

693
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.200
Jason Casey: Is in the past.

694
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you feel safe now where you're at. Do you feel like

695
01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:45.870
Tommie Timmons: Yeah.

696
01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:56.310
Jason Casey: I like the place where I'm at now there's cool roommates. Everybody gets along. Nice and the homeowner has dogs. So my dog has friends to play with.

697
01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:14.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, that's good. That's so great. Okay. Good. I'm glad I'm okay, good. And then in terms of your medication Jason you yeah your pharmacist was like oh you you can't fill until that Thursday or something. The 14

698
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.520
Jason Casey: Yeah. That was really weird.

699
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.230
Jason Casey: I still have leftovers from Kaiser

700
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.530
Jason Casey: And I wonder if maybe that's what master. I was that

701
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did that trauma, but no Kaiser, you would go to a Kaiser pharmacy.

702
01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:40.410
Jason Casey: Yeah, well, and I had already had it like I had the prescription at home because they gave me a month's worth when I lost my insurance, um,

703
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.590
Jason Casey: But yeah, I still had maybe like a day extras when you call them cap.

704
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:52.590
Jason Casey: Prescription and the one I had picked up beforehand was only a three day supply

705
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.930
Jason Casey: So I was a little confused. So I don't know how the day is got messed up. But it's all on track.

706
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's all on track.

707
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.540
Jason Casey: Okay, yeah, I was able to get it. So I'm good.

708
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:09.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're good. Okay, so I can give you a week's worth again and you'll be good. Yes.

709
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.350
Yeah.

710
01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:20.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going to try to give you guys a like eight days instead of seven days, just to kind of give you wiggle room.

711
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.300
Tommie Timmons: That would help me.

712
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.150
Tommie Timmons: Yeah. What helped me a great deal, man.

713
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know,

714
01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:35.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not to encourage you to miss stuff, but I understand, you know, things happen and whatever you have and you don't want to be completely strapped there without anything

715
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:37.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: You

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.100

Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, I can hear the bad stuff to Jason if there's bad stuff.

726
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.820
Jason Casey: No, I went over all that in my therapy appointment I got another tip for next week.

727
01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay. So Jason, you're on the

728
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:38.460

Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I'm, I'm going to give you the eight days worth

730
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which is the 48

731
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.160
Jason Casey: Alright.

732
01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:58.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hopefully they're not going to like hold on I think it'll be fine if you're on track. Now you should be on track. When you pick it up.

733
01:19:58.710 --> 01:19:59.850
Jason Casey: Yeah, I should be okay.

734
01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:02.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: And if it's a few days.

735
01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:06.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, hopefully they're not going to like hold for just because you're a day earlier.

736
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:09.450
Jason Casey: Well, that's what they did to me last week.

737
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:10.770
Jason Casey: Was just one day.

738
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.510
Jason Casey: I might switch pharmacies, this keeps happening. Oh.

739
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:27.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really yeah lets you figured out because, you know, honestly. That is up to the discretion of the pharmacists, some are very like, Oh my God, it says one week's worth and you're here, what day early

740
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:36.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's like, dude, I'm going to be on this long term, you know, like this is a maintenance medication. I'm going to be coming every week like it can't be dealing with this.

741
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:37.650
Jason Casey: Yeah.

742
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:46.020
Tommie Timmons: What I did was I just made fun I made friends with everybody at the pharmacy. I made sure they knew my name. I made sure I knew their name.

743
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:59.880
Tommie Timmons: And when I walk in, I, I speak to them by their name, so that way they get, you know, my kitchen. That way they get used to seeing me and then that way when something happened, they're more than willing to help me, you know, kind of resolve whatever situation that I'm impressed with

744
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Tommy, you're like a slob guy, man. Like, I don't know. That's

745
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's very smart.

746
01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:20.760
Tommie Timmons: I mean, one time. I'm trying to make everything to smooth the transition as smooth as possible and I mean I have to do what I mean. What I supposed to do at the same time, but sometimes

747
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:30.270
Tommie Timmons: Other outside elements kind of affect your, you know, your program so you know when that happens and stuff. You need to have all the assistance, you can get to get back on track.

748
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.760
Tommie Timmons: Exact why alienated anyone when you're trying when you're the one that you know you're the one that's weak.

749
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.950
Tommie Timmons: You know, you need help. So why alienating that's like cussing at somebody that's cooking food, they're going to fit in.

750
01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:50.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: I need you to teach a Life Skills class. Can I have you do that we can have like

751
01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:04.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so serious, because honestly what you just said seems so simple, but wouldn't you agree, Jason that a, you know, maybe not everybody's temperament is, you know,

752
01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:10.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: As outgoing, so you may not think of doing that or whatever and be

753
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:18.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Most of us fight the system instead of time to come, the system down for ourselves before things get bad. I think

754
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:27.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a life skill that you have that you're like already thinking ahead like hey, it might be helpful to be friendly with people just in the event that I need their help in the future.

755
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:33.210
Tommie Timmons: Then treat me like I'm norm, when I walk into the pharmacy. It's like, all I'm Tommy, you know,

756
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:34.620
Tommie Timmons: The thing.

757
01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.490
Tommie Timmons: They all like Tommy, you know,

758
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.440
Tommie Timmons: It's kind of cool stuff.

759
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.750
Tommie Timmons: And everybody turned around, like, who the hell is this guy.

760
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know,

761
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:45.930
Tommie Timmons: I'm right with you and they'll like make sure

762
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:55.140
Tommie Timmons: That, you know, I don't have to stand in line. Sometimes, you know, they'll just like we already got the time to come over here. I got you. And somebody else will stop doing what they're doing to come over and you know

763
01:22:55.470 --> 01:23:01.050
Tommie Timmons: Take care of me and keep me out of here because they're familiar that I'm coming in there for the same thing once a week, and every

764
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:01.890
Tommie Timmons: Every weekend.

765
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.940
Tommie Timmons: Yeah yeah

766
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:04.830
Tommie Timmons: Great. So it worked out.

767
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:09.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: I love it. Wow, that's pretty brilliant. I'm glad.

768
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's what a smooth way to get through life.

769
01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:23.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Instead of like the other way around, which is get tripped up and then get angry and then they're mad at you and you're like,

770
01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.480
Tommie Timmons: Well, you know what I learned now mad. Don't get you shoot

771
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:29.730
Yeah.

772
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:32.940
Tommie Timmons: Man, somebody to get

773
01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Angry so so situation.

774
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:40.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can tell you it doesn't do much. Besides, you get it like

775
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:44.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then looking like a crazy person.

776
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:57.960
Tommie Timmons: Exactly. And then you're going back and forth. So don't if somebody standing around watching you and that other person in this dialogue that's kind of heated, you know, it can tell who. Which one of y'all are, you know, making sense and which one of y'all are really wrong.

777
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:05.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. And the sad part is you might end up looking like the bad guy when I hear the bass.

778
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:10.320
Tommie Timmons: And then by me being black to play the race card again, but by me being black ish

779
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:18.090
Tommie Timmons: That was a funny joke I'm sorry I i want to be doing it. That was funny, but by me being black is

780
01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:26.760
Tommie Timmons: I have to keep in mind that if I behave. Any other way other than what they anticipate need to behave like

781
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:39.840
Tommie Timmons: That is going to lend credence to what they believe about black men as a whole, we're hot headed. You know I'm saying where I'm stable work you know explosive where you confront you were combative. You understand what I'm trying to say.

782
01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:43.500
Tommie Timmons: And and so I'm looking out for my whole

783
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.120
Tommie Timmons: Race when I'm doing stuff like that, you know, in my mind,

784
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:51.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's really good. You know that's that's

785
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.010
Tommie Timmons: I know it sounds stupid but

786
01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:02.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: No it's, it gives you a sense of responsibility beyond just yourself you're thinking about your community and like the situation at large, when you're

787
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:18.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Realizing that it's not just about you. There's a whole year intertwined with so many other people. Um, yeah, that's, I think that's awesome tommy. Tommy, you're like rocking it today. Plus, I don't know what's going on. But she's doing good.

788
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.490
Tommie Timmons: I got rid of my fiance.

789
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:25.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's tell your fiance. You're doing good.

790
01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.450
Tommie Timmons: No, we broke up.

791
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, really.

792
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:30.000
Yeah.

793
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:33.150
Jason Casey: It must be that could

794
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.060
Jason Casey: Happen to me, my belief. Oh.

795
01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:36.660
Yeah.

796
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:38.730
Tommie Timmons: Yeah.

797
01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:40.590
Jason Casey: But we're nothing

798
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.040
Tommie Timmons: Over nothing is over nothing.

799
01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:49.230
Tommie Timmons: But in all actuality. I'm a little more at peace.

800
01:25:50.850 --> 01:26:09.510
Tommie Timmons: Now then, I was with her because she was always on me about getting my medicine, you know I'm saying, or did you do this. Did you do that do to do this and it frustrated me that you know I'm a grown ass man, I don't need you to remind me to take my Suboxone I know I have to take on Suboxone

801
01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:17.640
Tommie Timmons: You understand what I'm saying this is my life. And thanks for reminding me. But damn Babe, you know, kind of, chill. Just a little bit.

802
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:28.470
Tommie Timmons: You know I'm saying that. Then she jumped from once you know extreme to the next. And I didn't realize it until after we broke up that excuse my terminology, but this bitch was crazy.

803
01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:36.660
Jason Casey: I had a similar revelation. Because after

804
01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.620
Jason Casey: I left my husband started calling my parents and

805
01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:41.760
Jason Casey: Tell him these like

806
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:51.810
Jason Casey: Weird far out stories of me doing all these crazy things just because I wouldn't answer the phone to talk to them. So he got my parents all worried they're calling me freaking out.

807
01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:52.920
Jason Casey: Oh,

808
01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:55.080

Tommie Timmons: I'm done.

827
01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:53.490
Tommie Timmons: See, I'm the type of person I can forgive you, but I just can't forgive why I had to forgive you.

828
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good one.

829

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:03.960
Tommie Timmons: Yeah, I can forgive you, but I can't get over the fact of why I had to forgive you.

831
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:04.950
Yeah.

832
01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:17.700
Tommie Timmons: So I know neither you know I'm saying kind of beating a dead horse, you know, I mean, more than likely, as you know, the log on, put something out there better for me and I'm happy, I'm good.

856
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:37.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

857
01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:42.000
Tommie Timmons: So she kind of felt a little uncomfortable about that.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:42.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

859
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.280

Tommie Timmons: I never moved in with her and when she asked me to. I told her knowledge do a little trial thing and see how that works out and we'll go from there. Good thing I did.

Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

866
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:09.360

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:11.100
Jason Casey: Screwed right now.

868
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:12.150

Tommie Timmons: Where she ain't no kind of complements me and I compliment her

883
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:19.770
Tommie Timmons: And it's kind of hard to find because I'm kind of high brow. So it's kind of hard for me to find women that are on my page or on my level, not that my shit is so together. But even in my darkest times

884
01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:30.750
Tommie Timmons: My mind is different from the average guy. I don't think along the lines of, you know, the status quo, I think, a little weird, for lack of a better word, you

918
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:27.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, good, good. Um, so, so you are. Are you new to bright heart or have you been with us in the past.

919
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:28.890
Sara Floyd: Yeah, I knew

920
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:46.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: You knew. Okay. Um, and I was able to pull up on there's like a state database to look at, like any prescribed controlled substances and through that I saw that back in November, you

921
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:47.610
Sara Floyd: You right back to work.

922
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:51.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Dr. Welsh Suboxone

923
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:54.660
Sara Floyd: He's my favorite doctor. Yeah, he's great, but I can't live in Baltimore.

924
01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:56.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you can't

925
01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.610
Sara Floyd: I can't live a Baltimore, and that's where he is so

926
01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:03.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, I see. So that was in Baltimore.

927
01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. And did you take the Suboxone. Like, were you on it for a while or

928
01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:16.800
Sara Floyd: Guy and I have been and it's been successful in the past, and I am I'm taking it right now, but it's off the street. I haven't stopped taking it really to except for when I would relapse.

929
01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:24.330
Sara Floyd: And it was because I didn't have any continued care following and there's a bunch of crazy stuff going on. But yes, it definitely works to me.

930
01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and your dose is what

931
01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:34.950
Sara Floyd: What is, what are you tour and I'm on 24 milligrams a day. Still, which is pretty hot.

932
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:41.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I mean, if it holds you do think it holds your cravings at that level.

933
01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:45.000
Sara Floyd: That I have to take it twice a day because of my metabolism, but yes.

934
01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.890
Okay, no.

935
01:35:47.970 --> 01:36:02.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, so tell me a bit about yourself like what, let's, let's go back to, like, I don't know your childhood teenage years. Like, when did you start drinking was an alcohol that started

936
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:03.150
Sara Floyd: With

937
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:20.880
Sara Floyd: A very abusive home I ran away at 15 I started drinking I drank. I was allergic to alcohol to the point where I got a rational at fat so i i started dating this rich kid. I got introduced to heroin and it's just been a battle on and off since I was 19

938
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:26.370
Sara Floyd: I'm covered in scars. Yeah, it's awful. So

939
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Since 19 that was when you were

940
01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:35.340
Sara Floyd: Introduced center right i would say 99 so maybe I was actually 19 before it really started to get bad

941
01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.840
Sara Floyd: And then my connection with heroin peaks. When I was about 26

942
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:44.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, heroin is when you were 26, he said.

943
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:51.300
Sara Floyd: Now, I started when I was 19 but it didn't peak until I was 26 then I got really just like absolutely impossible to stop.

944
01:36:52.170 --> 01:37:03.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, got it. And then I'm, um, and did you what what is your treatment history like did you end up going to a residential we have ever

945
01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:09.450
Sara Floyd: Yes, I was at when about three years ago in San Francisco. It was a harm reduction rehab and

946
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:21.840
Sara Floyd: It actually was really, really helpful and and I stayed sober for a while that I married a sociopath who has cancer and everything kind of devolved and thought hard about a year and a half after that so

947
01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:30.780
Sara Floyd: You know, I've had a lot of time where I was just on Suboxone and then if I don't have a doctor, following the eye or therapy. Of course it's not gonna

948
01:37:31.410 --> 01:37:42.120
Sara Floyd: You know, it's not helping. If I therapy with it. But yes, so the medicine does hold me. But see, I can't find it on the street or something. Eventually, I'm not going to put up with being sick. You know what I mean.

949
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:43.590
Sara Floyd: So,

950
01:37:45.630 --> 01:37:53.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're here and you you have medical setup now so everything's gonna be okay, right, I mean in terms of

951
01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:59.610
Sara Floyd: Yeah, yeah. I called him yesterday, I have one more call with them today, but it was fine.

952
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:00.690
Sara Floyd: That's really

953
01:38:02.490 --> 01:38:05.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good, good. Um, any allergies to medication.

954
01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:06.870
Sara Floyd: Not that I do.

955
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:07.650
Okay.

956
01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, and then and then you said you got married.

957
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:18.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you now divorced or are you still married but separated or

958
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:27.540
Sara Floyd: Yeah, it's, it's a divorce. It's, it's not it's going through. He's dying. I don't know what's happening. That's awful, awful situation so

959
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:31.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Sounds sounds like it. Is he in Baltimore.

960
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:36.780
Sara Floyd: Now he's in LA, I came back to get a divorce. Okay.

961
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:37.290
Gotcha.

962
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and then

963
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:46.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, any siblings any family members or since you left at

964
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: 15 never looked back. Kind of thing or

965
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:53.340
Sara Floyd: And my mother stole my kid. I know I have no family.

966
01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:59.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: told me about your choice. So you have one child.

967
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:12.660
Sara Floyd: I do. She's a but I haven't seen her in four years. And my mom is also says you have had and I went to court. Part of the reason I relapse and valleys, because I had a court case with them and I went last year and

968
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:25.980
Sara Floyd: It just, I wasn't prepared for court. I didn't have any support for that. So that didn't work out. And I had my rights terminated, so part of this is trying to appeal the case to I need to get my shit together and start trying to appeal that decision.

969
01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, yes. Okay. And where, where is your

Dr. Belis Aladag: Florida. Okay, so that's where your daughters.

973
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:49.410
Sara Floyd: Yeah, I have no contact whatsoever. Not even a picture. So I really, I have no Paley. Um, I mean, I do like I i you know I'm holding out hope that I'll see her again but

974
01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:51.900
Sara Floyd: I don't have any family. Other than that.

975
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:53.610

976
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:55.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um,

Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, any history of like trying to harm yourself and you suicidal thing.

978
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:02.730
As

979
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:17.730
Sara Floyd: Part of the reason I got your phone number is because I 5152 weeks ago or last week or something. It's been pretty recent i i'm trying to leave sensitize but yeah it's, you know, it gets really desperate.

980
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:21.870
Sara Floyd: Go and I've been really surprised. So

981
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:34.230
Sara Floyd: Um, yeah. So I think even if they gave me a prescription for Zoloft that I haven't taken because I didn't have a doctor. I was like, I'm not going to start an SSRI without a doctor, following me.

982
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:36.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

983
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:40.320
Sara Floyd: Well, you should, which made me way more suicidal and value.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.560
Sara Floyd: And I have ADHD to so he had he had me on Adderall, but I couldn't ever remember to take my Adderall.

988
01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:05.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: While you're taking the steps to help yourself and that's that's commendable, I think you should give yourself credit for that, you know, Sarah, you're going to be okay.

989
01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're, you're helping yourself.

990
01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:15.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm sorry. Wow, you got you got a lot of stuff on your shoulders.

991
01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. The 5150 okay

992
01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you feel

993
01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:28.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, are you okay now.

994
01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Past the or yeah

995
01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:32.340
Yeah.

996
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Better do

997
01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:37.440
Sara Floyd: Sick anymore I stabilized myself on Suboxone

998
01:41:37.770 --> 01:41:45.210
Sara Floyd: And just kept calling. I was trying to get into impatient, but it doesn't seem like that's very accessible. So I am okay

999
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:47.790
Sara Floyd: I just gotta do what I gotta do.

1000
01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

1001
01:41:52.410 --> 01:41:53.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm

1002
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.840
Sara Floyd: My anxiety.

1003
01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:56.910
Sara Floyd: Out unsure what to do about that.

1004
01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:12.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so, yeah, maybe I'm given your depression, anxiety, and then the recent I think you should, we should have you connect with a psychiatrist with us to, you know,

1005
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:24.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'll help you with your Suboxone and the addiction piece. But I think it's important. I mean, with all the stuff going on that you also have medication management from an actual psychiatrists a specialist in that

1006
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:28.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'm going to, I'm going to ask them.

1007
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: You get okay

1008
01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:31.290
Okay.

1009
01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:34.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: And

1010
01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:43.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: So for the Suboxone we can continue you on the on the 12 milligrams twice a day dosing

1011
01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:52.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: And we what we do is we see each other. You and I see each other in a group.

1012
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Format like there's a few other people to that are on. So, most of them are on Suboxone

1013
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:02.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: And we do it in like, Okay. How Was Your Week, Sarah.

1014
01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:13.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you need anything, any changes, whatever we do a brief like medical check in and then we do like a full group conversation about something recovery based, you know, so it's like a group therapy session.

1015
01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:37.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, as well. So it's like a combo and there's a therapist helping run the group to with me and then you, I think, in addition to the medication help with the psychiatrist from us, I think. I mean, it's mandated that you do individual therapy as well. So you'll have your own one on one therapists.

1016
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:47.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I think that'll be helpful to because you already mentioned, it really does help. And I think it helps you organize your thoughts. If nothing else, you know, and have

1017
01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:48.600
A staff.

1018
01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:49.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know,

1019
01:43:50.040 --> 01:44:01.620
Sara Floyd: I think last time I came up so fast. I was doing before I got married, I was doing so well I mean I had like a radio show. I was everything was so great. I was really doing well. But I had continued care and everything kind of started

1020
01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:07.380
Sara Floyd: Getting bad. It took about eight months after stopping all that and then I just went nosedived you know so

1021
01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:09.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

1022
01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:16.470
Sara Floyd: Very good. Penny charity, followed by a team, so I need the accountability, I think, and just

1023
01:44:17.490 --> 01:44:18.690
Sara Floyd: The support so

1024
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:27.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: So tell me about your living situation now. Like, what would it. Where are you, what are you doing, where are you staying

1025
01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:34.620
Sara Floyd: I'm staying with a friend.

1026
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

1027
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.090

01:44:57.450 --> 01:44:57.900
Um,

1035
01:44:59.190 --> 01:44:59.970

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:14.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is normal now okay um yeah quest is urine and blood and they'll check you know

1039
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:17.250

01:45:17.850 --> 01:45:19.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's hard. Yeah, okay.

1041
01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:23.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, they can try and then if it's too much, then

1042
01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:32.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, whatever you do the best you can, I think, I think it's good, though, because it'll will check for, like, you know, HIV, and all those things.

1043
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:33.780
Sara Floyd: Just your Dad at the hospital.

Dr. Belis Aladag: Least you have that

1049
01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:52.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Worst case if you can't get the quest done, then we can maybe get those records from the other place or something. Yeah.

1050
01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:54.570
Sara Floyd: They had these an ultrasound so

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.430
Sara Floyd: Yeah. And then I have PTSD.

1101
01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:24.180
Sara Floyd: Which is the forefront that

1102
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:35.550
Sara Floyd: No person personality disorders. So far, I don't know, and I'm not sure if I really have major depressive disorder or if it's just situational. You know what I mean, like, that's always been like, yeah.

1103
01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:35.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't

1104
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:39.390
Sara Floyd: Think I might have been neurotypical without the trauma. I don't know.

1105
01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:41.670
Sara Floyd: Yeah.

1106
01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:45.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and

1107
01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:53.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, you, you were receiving you are you receiving regular therapy that time that you were doing really well.

1108
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:54.330
Yeah.

1109
01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:55.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

1110
01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.520
Sara Floyd: Yeah yeah

1111
01:50:56.670 --> 01:51:14.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I think, I think this will be it'll be really good. I'm so glad you're connecting again and we can get you the therapy need. And the cool thing is it's portable so it doesn't matter where you're at, you can, you know, continue to your care. Right, so that'll be really good. Yeah.

1112
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:22.020
Sara Floyd: Because a lot of ways, it's safer for cut out with my friends Joshua Tree and calm down for most of the week you know they need to then go back to LA take care of things and

1113
01:51:23.490 --> 01:51:26.670
Sara Floyd: That's right now. That's kind of what I need to be doing so.

1114
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:33.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then job wise or school wise. Are you are you doing, what are you doing

1115
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.820
Sara Floyd: I'm looking to get into school

1116
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:44.430
Sara Floyd: I don't have a job right now. And yeah, I mean like temporary disability. I'm yeah I'm not doing well. I totally fell apart and

1117
01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:53.490
Sara Floyd: So I'm looking to find something I need to find like a school grant or something, I don't know if there's anything I can do or skip student loans. I don't know.

1118
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:59.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, do you know what you would want to study or not sure

1119
01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:05.940
Sara Floyd: I, I was thinking about doing like an addiction counseling or something.

1120
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:09.240
Sara Floyd: I don't know, like I basically have a street PhD at this point.

1121
01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:12.060
Sara Floyd: Yeah, that's good. Inside it out, you know, so

1122
01:52:13.110 --> 01:52:14.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's true.

1123
01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:21.630
Sara Floyd: You know, that's how I started there. I don't know. I don't you know i don't know that i want to deal with addicts for the rest of my life, necessarily, because I've had enough of that. But

1124
01:52:22.590 --> 01:52:29.760
Sara Floyd: It's probably a good starting point, because my resume is garbage. Right now, you know, and I'm almost 40 so it's horrifying.

1125
01:52:30.330 --> 01:52:36.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Were you did you have some. So you mentioned a radio show. Did you were in radio or something.

1126
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.870
Yeah.

1127
01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.020
Sara Floyd: Yeah, I don't know how employable. That makes me at this point, though, you know,

1128
01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:44.460
Sara Floyd: Yeah.

1129
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay, um,

1130
01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:56.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Anything else that we haven't touched upon that I you know I should know about anything else going on with you.

1131
01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:07.860
Sara Floyd: I don't think so. I mean, I have some autoimmune disorders going on. I don't know what they are. They're not diagnosed, but I get like weird crashes. I'm sick a lot. So, but that could also just

1132
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:14.010
Sara Floyd: I don't know. I think there's a travel related. So, I have no idea. No, not really. I guess the answer is no.

1133
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:18.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: No. Okay. Well, once in a while you get rashes, you said

1134
01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:27.420
Sara Floyd: I get rashes, all the time. I have weird pains. I'm just tired and sick all the time even if I'm not using though.

1135
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:29.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, yeah.

1136
01:53:30.210 --> 01:53:40.800
Sara Floyd: I just beat up. I'm really good at this point, I've had the same ear infections since the 90s and no one can fucking do anything about it like 1998 is the first time I remember having problems with my ears that both always infected fucked up.

1137
01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:43.350
Sara Floyd: Ever resolves with it.

1138
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's a middle ear infection like

1139
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:47.880
Sara Floyd: Now, there

1140
01:53:48.150 --> 01:53:54.750
Sara Floyd: It was, yeah, sometimes it gets to the middle years but it's like, usually I think it's, I honestly think it's some sort of fungus or something.

1141
01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:01.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: External yeah if it's if it's chronic. I'm wondering if it's like yes something. Maybe it's fundable and

1142
01:54:01.890 --> 01:54:02.370
Sara Floyd: Maybe

1143
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: If you're on an antifungal agent that would be helpful.

1144
01:54:07.050 --> 01:54:07.290
Sara Floyd: Yeah.

1145
01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:16.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Can we get you too soon, you know, once we stabilize everything and you feel up to it. I think it would be really cool if we can get you a primary

1146
01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:18.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Care doctor, you know,

1147
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:23.790
Sara Floyd: Yeah, yeah, I really, I need to find that I just had a really hard time navigating that account at La for some reason.

1148
01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:26.490
Sara Floyd: So that's, that's what my problem.

1149
01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.760
Sara Floyd: Is five doctors. They give a shit. Or like this seems hopeful and promising, but

1150
01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:33.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

1151
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:34.650
Sara Floyd: That hard

1152
01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:38.460
Sara Floyd: Because I don't have very many resources so

1153
01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:46.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe la care la care might have, I think, la care takes medical and they have some

1154
01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:47.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Spots for

1155
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Here. Yeah, I think because

1156
01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:55.140
Sara Floyd: You know, like to start with that they would assign primary care and then the the

1157
01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:07.020
Sara Floyd: Primary care that I was assigned didn't have any openings and I'd be like, What the fuck, and then I would call like 50 other doctors, none of them would have openings. That was my problem like it didn't make any sense. Like I would you give me a doctor that didn't have room for me.

1158
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:09.240
Sara Floyd: But yes.

1159
01:55:11.490 --> 01:55:18.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Usually if they say your doctors busy. You think they would say your doctors busy until whatever. But here's an

1160
01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.840
Alternate

1161
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:24.000
Sara Floyd: Nine months you I can give you an appointment six to nine months. And I'm like, what the fuck

1162
01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and they didn't give you like okay, but if you want to see someone else you can sue someone else. No.

1163
01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:42.240
Sara Floyd: Well, I could but I would call and none of them would have openings. So I'd say that the medical systems really just, it's, it's weird.

1164
01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:43.980
Sara Floyd: So,

1165
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:46.380
Sara Floyd: Hopefully it won't be this hard this time.

1166
01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:56.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't know, okay, I hope not. Well, we'll work on it and maybe our staff could assist a little bit too with helping you.

1167
01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: But at least let's get your mental health stuff like right here.

1168
01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.090
Sara Floyd: Organized. Yeah.

1169
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:20.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, so you'll have me for your addiction for the Suboxone you'll see me weekly, and then, like I said, I think you should see a established care with the psychiatrists, just to try and get that sorted out, and then you'll have your, you should have your one on one therapy started

1170
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.380
Sara Floyd: As soon as you can. Okay.

1171
01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:37.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so for the therapists appointment and the psychiatry appointment. Those two, you need to call like where you called today the virtual clinic, you call them again and you say, Hey, I saw Dr. Allah DAG.

1172
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:44.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: She says I need a psychiatry appointment and a therapy appointment and then they hook you up with those

1173
01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:48.540

Sara Floyd: I don't know what plan. I'm under, I guess, for now, that's fine. Can they can, they move it. If it's not

1178
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.620
Sara Floyd: If they don't have it or if they don't take my insurance for some reason.
