00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.460
Andriana Clark: When she looks at certain girl. She gets butterflies in our stomach ache and she just knows that she's a lesbian.

21
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:24.360
Andriana Clark: Which I don't have a problem with it, what I've heard. I don't have a problem with it because it's not a boy and there was a boy and his eyes, he would have an issue with

22
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.650
Richelle Direny: A little bit of advice and I think

23
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.390
Andriana Clark: It is a lot of a lot of guys I knew her like that. And it's a shame.

24
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.750
Andriana Clark: Well, she ended up dating the girl for a day and then she came home from school bawling her eyes out all day yesterday she was crying.

25
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:53.550
Andriana Clark: And she goes, I wish, I wish there was no so that I don't have to go to school tomorrow and then like 10 minutes later, it starts like a raining snow and then

26
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:06.750
Andriana Clark: By five o'clock this morning. It's a two hour delay. So I'm like, Well, I'm gonna stay a little longer, make sure that I don't fall asleep and don't get her up at a time that she has to get up for school.

27
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:20.820

Andriana Clark: Another girl I had asked her out and she told Kaylee that he had a break up with her and explain to her that other girl asked her out and she liked the other girl for a long time, so she doesn't want to tell it now.

45
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:18.630
Andriana Clark: Thank you really like she's such a good hearted person she said this, you know, she takes everything to her soul.

46
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:36.240
Andriana Clark: And she like felt so upset over it. She thought everybody nobody cared about her because she finally came out and told everybody that she likes girls that now everybody. Nobody liked her. My mom.

47
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.900
Andriana Clark: And I'm like old school. And she's like,

48
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.290

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.140
Andriana Clark: So like when my daughter told my mom. My mom like it's a girl.

50
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.500
Andriana Clark: You're not supposed to grow your girl.

51
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:11.940
Andriana Clark: Like I just explained to my daughter that a lot of people believe that if you like girls. They you'll go to hell, or whatever, like I explained to her out was

52
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:30.960
Andriana Clark: In Bible and now it's considered wrong and stuff for the longest time, I'm like, you see it all the time, Kaylee. I said it don't matter what anybody else thinks I said if you are happy with. If you like girls and you're happy and comfortable with yourself. That's all that matter.

53
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:43.110
Andriana Clark: And then after that she like kind of me and ended up doing a coloring coloring coloring book and just talking and she finally calmed down today.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:54.450
Andriana Clark: And she's like, it just hurts, because it was my first girlfriend. I'm like, I know that a VM like Kimberly data that day, though. I'm like, eventually you will find somebody

55
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.600
Andriana Clark: two year old seven years old, you're young, you got

56
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.280
To find somebody

57
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.620
Andriana Clark: I was like, You didn't even know that girl you just started dating or because my sister comes up and she's like,

58
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.510
Richelle Direny: How old is your sister. Wow.

Andriana Clark: And Kaylee Blake.

61
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:36.990
Andriana Clark: crying a little bit more. And she's like, I think star did that on purpose. I'm like he might have over like bullets that you install seem to like the same people, unlike you need to find somebody that's not friendless or don't like Star don't want nothing to do a store.

62
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.100
Andriana Clark: It's going to be the same thing over and over

63
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.800
Richelle Direny: So how does she. How does she take it when you said to her, um,

64
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.230
Richelle Direny: Like when you

65
00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:04.530
Richelle Direny: When you told her that even though you know if she's happy with the decision. She's made she's comfortable, that's fine. But then you gave her the perspective that you know

66
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.550
Richelle Direny: God doesn't like it or whatever it is that you said to her,

67
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.980
Andriana Clark: She actually was fine about. She goes, she don't

68
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.120
Andriana Clark: I didn't raise her with any religion or anything.

69
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:33.930
Andriana Clark: And I'm like, for her. She like she believes in God and my mom and my grandma told her some stuff like different stuff about the Bible and stuff. And she's she got her own Bible and she reads it sometimes

70
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.520
Andriana Clark: So she kind of like understood, like with my grandpa and stuff because she goes, Grandpa Jerry's old

71
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:56.970
Andriana Clark: So I understand him and old people. She goes, but Guillermo messy always tells me that no matter what my choices are, no matter how wrong I do that you always loved me, but then she acted like I was doing the worst thing in the world.

72
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.760
Richelle Direny: Who we her grandmother

73
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.530
Andriana Clark: Yeah, my mother.

74
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:05.790
Richelle Direny: She

75
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.290
Richelle Direny: So she's saying that her grandmother told her that she loved her. No matter what

76
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:19.710
Andriana Clark: Yeah, but at the same time whenever my mom told her no girl. You're not first date, girls.

77
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.470
Andriana Clark: She kind of felt like

78
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.430
Andriana Clark: My mom just couldn't accept her choices and it kind of hurt real bad.

79
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:41.550
Richelle Direny: But then that's the part that goes into eventually having that conversation with her that they're in for her to understand because like you said she's young

80
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.240
Richelle Direny: Yeah, um, you know, kids think that they have things

81
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.960
Richelle Direny: Life all figured out. And they know everything, and they know

82
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.440
Richelle Direny: That they can make their life decision.

83
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.730
At this young age.

84
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:09.480
Richelle Direny: Older things changes and all these different things, but I'm just understanding that there are choices that you make and things that you do and directions you decide to go in that everybody is not always going to agree with you.

85
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.150
Richelle Direny: Right decide within yourself.

86
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:27.030
Andriana Clark: Right, I told her I kind of explained like explained it like that. Like with how my life has been like how bad things were compared out things or

87
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:43.650
Andriana Clark: And like I don't remember exactly how I explained it, but the way I explained to her. She kind of got it and she understood that. Some even though some people might not have might not like it might make. They might not like the fact that you like girls.

88
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:52.050
Andriana Clark: But you can't let that bother you, you just gotta look at and be like, Oh, I'm sorry. You don't like my choices, but

89
00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:03.360
Andriana Clark: I'm not going to change how I feel for anybody. And he probably URLs and she kind of like brightened up in her eyes, but real Big Ben and then

90
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:18.360
Andriana Clark: We had went to my dad's right afterwards to take my sister down home and my dad and Kaylee, or my dad Kaylee and store where in my dad's bedroom just and the girls were talking to a year off.

91
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:33.240
Andriana Clark: And they were both talking about how they like girls and stuff. And my dad gets kicked your lesbian asses out of my room and he said a joking around and they knew he was joking and

92
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:40.800
Andriana Clark: Kaylee started cracking up laughing and she's like, that's the best thing that happened to me today. He just praise him up my day.

93
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.740
Richelle Direny: Because of the fact that he

94
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.430
Andriana Clark: Referred eat. They eat for

95
00:11:48.690 --> 00:12:00.060
Andriana Clark: Like just said you lesbian assets take get your lesbian asked about in my room like because for my bad, like he he's always joking around like it's kind of like

96
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.770
Andriana Clark: Kinda like sexist when it comes to It's Okay with women don't want it, but it's wrong with men doing it.

97
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.630
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but that's that's

98
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.190
Andriana Clark: It so like AND THE GIRLS UNDERSTAND like that. That's how he feels

99
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:27.750
Andriana Clark: So like whenever they joke around and say, he said stuff about get your lesbian asked about my room or anything close to that are a little bit different from that or something like they know that he's joking.

100
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.800
Andriana Clark: So they immediately laugh at him.

101
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.320
Andriana Clark: He has like the face. You can tell when he's joking. And when he serious

102
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.630
Richelle Direny: So you said that she felt a little bit better with him.

103
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.990
Andriana Clark: And then today she can't for the last about three hours.

104
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.310
Andriana Clark: She had had on my neighbor. She's 21 but she had the mentality of like a 10 year old.

105
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:03.450
Andriana Clark: So Kaylee likes playing with their control car together play with slam together and being together and stuff.

106
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.780
Andriana Clark: So she was over here today and

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.060
Andriana Clark: Has to other sons and their birthday.

111
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.000
Andriana Clark: So she like kinda

112
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:48.270
Andriana Clark: was explaining to Kaylee, like how other people will treat you, and I'll act and stuff like

113
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:56.520
Andriana Clark: She was cutting out but in Kaylee understand a little better than I was in Kaylee's like in a way better mood and everything and now she's like

114
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:05.490
Andriana Clark: I don't even care that she broke up with me now, I'll find somebody later on when I'm a little older be friends with them and get to know him. I'm like, that's good.

115
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.390
Richelle Direny: So how do you feel about

116
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:16.920
Richelle Direny: Like her coming out, we're having this conversation and feeling comfortable with having this conversation.

117
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:28.710
Andriana Clark: She, she's always known like that she could always come to me and talk to me about anything. But, um, the last couple years she's been kind of like

118
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:39.780
Andriana Clark: Telling me but not telling me all the way, like she would hint around to it, but try not to say it. I think you want to kind of see what my reaction would be

119
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:51.780
Andriana Clark: And I told her, because I have had a relationship before with a girl and I told her that it was years ago, like before I was ever with my husband, but um

120
00:14:52.770 --> 00:15:02.790
Andriana Clark: I just I explain that to her and she kind of like already knew that from early hear people talk about it and stuff like my family likes to gossip.

121
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.980
Andriana Clark: And

122
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.860
Andriana Clark: I think that's why she like kinda felt comfortable coming out to me.

123
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:19.200
Andriana Clark: It felt good, that she was comfortable enough to come out to me and like she was petrified to come out to her dad.

124
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:34.620
Andriana Clark: Because usually, she's Petra, she don't like talking to me. She usually scared to talk to me or scared that I'm going to get mad at her for everything because she knows that I got a temper, kind of, when I look I get mad easily and start yelling. I'm a screamer or yellow

125
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.510
Andriana Clark: And

126
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.760
Andriana Clark: It kind of felt really good that for a change. She actually came to me before that.

127
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.160
Richelle Direny: So you felt so you you like the fact that she felt comfortable enough

128
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.680
Richelle Direny: That you would

129
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:51.750
Richelle Direny: Be someone

130
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.180
Richelle Direny: Okay, now let me reform. Do you think that she felt

131
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:02.730
Richelle Direny: Comfortable because of her knowing that in the past. You've had

132
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.580
Richelle Direny: Identified as

133
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:19.290
Andriana Clark: Being in a relationship. Yeah, I think so. And I think it's because she always knows, like I've had friends that were gay or

134
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:35.310
Andriana Clark: Like guy friends that were gay or friends that were was being said and hung out with when she was younger and stuff. And it wasn't like we were more than friends. I was just like a like a really good friendship between a couple gay people.

135
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:44.280
Andriana Clark: And I would be me and my husband. It was like wow me my husband were together and we would all hang out together and just talk and stuff and

136
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:54.660
Andriana Clark: Kaylee, she she used to like hanging out with them. The one friend that I had with take go shopping and take her shopping and buy a bunch of clothes and stuff.

137
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.620
Andriana Clark: He always wanted to buy girls clothes and he never would you like wearing them pretty always like buying them.

138
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:17.040
Andriana Clark: So I think that it was just like knowing how her dad so about guys being gay like Kaylee used to tell him just to see how he would react you to go, I want my brother to be gay.

139
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.680
Andriana Clark: Any of you like

140
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.870
Richelle Direny: Your husband is someone like her dad.

141
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:22.830
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

142
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:28.350
Richelle Direny: It's okay to be a lesbian. But it's not okay for men to be

143
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:35.970
Andriana Clark: Yeah, because it is. Is it sexy for two women and it's just disgusting for two men.

144
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.830
Andriana Clark: It's a shame but

145
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:52.560
Andriana Clark: Then she was like petrified to even say anything to him because of that because you knew that how we react that whenever she said I want my brother to be gay.

146
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:03.840
Andriana Clark: And then I told her I found our comfortable enough to say so. Okay, to tell anybody else.

147
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:05.610
Andriana Clark: I

148
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.310
Richelle Direny: You said it's okay for her to tell

149
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.770
Richelle Direny: Anyone else

150
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:23.790
Andriana Clark: Yeah, there you go, where she feels comfortable enough that she can tell people that she felt about herself and stuff like

151
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:40.950
Andriana Clark: Me and then like just sitting around talking a lot, and it's it's different because growing up. She me and her didn't really have much of a bond. It was kind of a postpartum depression right after I had her and it was real bad and

152
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:57.840
Andriana Clark: Until and taking care of for a long time. So like I did what I could to stay away from her. And I just never really had much of a connection with her. But now that she's getting older and it's like stuff that she wants to ask

153
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:05.040
Andriana Clark: Me and not or data feels more comfortable. Ask me. It kind of feels good for change, because it's like

154
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.640
Richelle Direny: You're only door.

155
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.490
Andriana Clark: Yeah, I have one better one son.

156
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:19.020
Richelle Direny: Oh, you only have two children. Okay. Okay. So you said that when you had, are you were going through postpartum depression.

157
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.310
Yeah.

158
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.950
Richelle Direny: So now that you've now you your, your relationship with her is

159
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:37.140
Andriana Clark: It's like there's kind of like a connection between the air now on that was never there before. It's like a little bit different than what I had like the connection. I had with my son.

160
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:51.630
Richelle Direny: And then, of course, it's going to be different with the connection with, you know, expression what you were going through at the time that you have her your first child.

161
00:19:52.350 --> 00:20:04.050
Richelle Direny: You kind of somewhat mastered the art of the bonding. And what that is like in your soul aware of the lack of the bond that was for new creative with your daughter that you somewhat overcompensate with your son.

162
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.700
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

163
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.740
Richelle Direny: So, and you were also a stay at home mom with your, with your daughter as well.

164
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:24.180
Andriana Clark: I was. But, um, my husband, he worked on the boat. Then, too. But we lived with his parents because he didn't trust me to take care of her by myself and I really didn't trust myself, either.

165
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.680
Andriana Clark: You work when

166
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.150
You Liam.

167
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.700
Richelle Direny: Did you just started your sobriety after you had her or

168
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.240
Andriana Clark: No, I had her when I was 18

169
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.880
Andriana Clark: And I was completely against drugs and everything. And at the time it was supposed to be for me to start pushing

170
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:56.310
Andriana Clark: The next thing I know, I'm getting shut up with all kinds of drugs that I didn't want to be on or anything because she was a breech baby and then know it until

171
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:03.240
Andriana Clark: It was time for her to come out and she was coming up first and my hips didn't want to spread apart like they were supposed to

172
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.470
Andriana Clark: If she would have tried to push your way out, she would have died.

173
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:22.860
Andriana Clark: And then I had a C section which when the it was an emergency C section I was pumped full of drugs for those first three months afterwards. The doctor tapped me on Oxycodone and

174
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.020
Andriana Clark: The annex.

175
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:36.060
Andriana Clark: And my daughter when cute. She was born. She, uh, well, the doctor also cut my bladder and

176
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.420
Andriana Clark: Whenever they're doing the C section with her and I wasn't able to really get up and move or walker anything famous three months.

177
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.580
Oh, wow.

178
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.290
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

179
00:21:50.640 --> 00:22:08.280
Andriana Clark: That had to do with La yeah I think a lot of that had to do with our I felt to me like I just regretted having a pregnancy. I think at the time because I was against drugs and then right after leaving the hospital. I was addicted to them.

180
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:21.360
Andriana Clark: And then that's where my drug you started from there. And then it was like going through the postpartum depression. I didn't want nothing to do with my daughter, the sound of my voice, listening to her cry.

181
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:31.860
Andriana Clark: I mean, looking back now I heated, but I can't change it. And that's exactly how it was. I can just try to do better with my son.

182
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.290
Richelle Direny: And again, like I said, with your son.

183
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:50.970
Richelle Direny: You're going to tend to overcompensate when especially when you become completely aware of the disconnect you have with your first and everything that you were going through in your first, it's almost kind of

184
00:22:52.230 --> 00:23:03.510
Richelle Direny: You feel guilty for how you are, you were not able to connect and bond with her. There is that sense of guilt. That's that this like in the back of your mind that oftentimes

185
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:20.190
Richelle Direny: How we respond to things and how we react to things and how we deal with situations. So when you have your next child. It's almost like you almost tell yourself that you're going to make up for your lack

186
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:29.130
Richelle Direny: Of what you provided for your daughter, you're going to make that up in with your son, and then you find yourself someone always doing that you

187
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:30.480
Andriana Clark: Make up

188
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.770
Richelle Direny: Or compensate for what you

189
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.350
Andriana Clark: Really are not making up for anything. You're just doing better for one than you did for the other

190
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.750
Andriana Clark: Exactly, exactly.

191
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.220
Richelle Direny: But in our minds we justify our actions that

192
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:58.740
Richelle Direny: We are always justifying and we're always in order to suppress the guilt or the feelings and the thoughts that we have in our minds we justify it, and you will you tend to overcompensate for the next time.

193
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.000
Right.

194
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.780
Richelle Direny: But I mean, and then actually I think I'm

195
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.580
Richelle Direny: Having

196
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.230
Richelle Direny: Sons. I don't know. There's something about voice.

197
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.300
Andriana Clark: I was like more of a tomboy growing up. So I think that's another reason why I will be easier for me to connect with them.

198
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.810
Andriana Clark: Because I work with my brother.

199
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.890
Richelle Direny: Phil you it's a boy.

200
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.880
Richelle Direny: love and attention in something that they do.

201
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.980
Andriana Clark: Right. And like he's my brother and my son will

202
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.590
Andriana Clark: Always wanting to try sports.

203
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.710
Andriana Clark: Football to get just

204
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.150
Andriana Clark: I'm always the one they come to do it.

205
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.950
Andriana Clark: The only one that's still a product enough in the field way.

206
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.780
Richelle Direny: So yeah, I mean it's a combination of a few things.

207
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:08.460
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

208
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.890
Andriana Clark: It's like he constantly reminds me that I'm

209
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:22.560
Andriana Clark: Like eat so cute he is right now is for he'll be five and November but

210
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:39.450
Andriana Clark: He'll come up to me and like first thing in the morning, he gives me a huge, huge chance every morning and then they'll start kissing me like Oh give me like 100 different kisses will pull back and kiss me kiss me again. And he's like, I love you mom, your best mommy in the

211
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.340
Richelle Direny: World every bit of you.

212
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.510
It does.

213
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:59.460
Andriana Clark: And then it's like whenever the invite. I want to be a disaster that, but then I sit there and look at him and I just thought like laughing because it's like he's just like I was when I was younger. Like, it's only as I was a stubborn.

214
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:12.480
Andriana Clark: If, like, I don't know if I want to be the best rock bottom because it reminds me so much of my sister, one of my cousin when we were little kids, and it's just crazy.

215
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:24.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's, um, you know, like you said, it's just as easy. You know, we have attachments. We bond very differently with each of our kids.

216
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:39.570
Richelle Direny: You have different attachments their personality draw you in a different way, um, you know, there's just so many different factors that's involved in it. But it sounds like at this point, at this juncture, because of you're aware of

217
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.760
Richelle Direny: What it was like when she was first born

218
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.830
Richelle Direny: It seems like you appreciate the bond and the relationship that you're creating with her now.

219
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.200
Andriana Clark: Yeah, I do. Oh. Uh huh. It's so

220
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.560
Richelle Direny: Do you find that you guys are spending more mother daughter time together.

221
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:13.050
Andriana Clark: Yeah, and I've noticed like she's been asking more like winter dads and stuff, she asked her dad to stay in the living room with a brother so that her mom can have mommy, mommy and daughter time or girls time

222
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.070
Andriana Clark: Like

223
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.930
Andriana Clark: Sometimes it's annoying because sometimes it's like

224
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:33.960
Andriana Clark: She thought that age where she talks a lot. And sometimes it's like non stop in your ear talking about everything in anything. And it's like, I just want to shut you off, but I can't show you all

225
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.450
Right.

226
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.540
Richelle Direny: So,

227
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:50.310
Richelle Direny: It's funny that you're a saint. But I think that, at this juncture of your life like this is a critical stage. So what she's, she's 11 so she's one in the sixth green

228
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.840
Andriana Clark: But this she had to stay back here because of a birthday.

229
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:06.120
Richelle Direny: Okay so fifth grade, and you're going to notice you're going to notice it's kind of so I like to. This is a picture when you were younger. Did you ever go on roller coasters.

230
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.280
Andriana Clark: Yes, yeah.

231
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.590
Richelle Direny: Picture the biggest, baddest roller coaster.

232
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.260
Richelle Direny: I think when you get to the middle school years.

233
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:30.570
Richelle Direny: You like sixth grade you get on that roller coaster and you know like when you're getting on the road because like i don't care for roller coasters and I find out later in life that roller coasters are just little demons from hell.

234
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.910
Richelle Direny: Should be shaking you up like that.

235
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:36.810
Right.

236
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.180
Andriana Clark: Now you know

237
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.120
Andriana Clark: But then they go back and forth.

238
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.830
Richelle Direny: And it goes upside down and

239
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:52.440
Andriana Clark: Get what me and my daughter, like the seat belts were barely even like the the hooks world barely out of this down and like

240
00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:10.290
Andriana Clark: We're both so right. I'm like, only 120 pounds. She's like 70 pounds and the top seed and nobody's after sitting beside us and I think like, I think if they were to fill it all the feedback or something. Well, I'm telling myself from the airway.

241
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.520
Andriana Clark: from falling out when she's like I've never do that again more

242
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.180
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I want you to think about the feeling so when you're going on a roller coaster so recently.

243
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:32.070
Richelle Direny: I'm I went. The last time I went on a roller coaster was like two years ago, I went to Busch Gardens and I went on the cheetah.

244
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.620
Richelle Direny: And so I'm not really. I'm like, you know what I should be getting on a roller coaster. But, you know, one of my two girls.

245
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:47.940
Richelle Direny: And I said, you know, let's go on it. And so like I did a little investigation, they're like, well, no, it's not too bad. It's the milder of the roller coasters and

246
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:57.540
Richelle Direny: You know, yeah, you guys can get on it. It's not too big in the defend, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, all right, no problem, we'll go on it. I'll go on it with you guys.

247
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:07.200
Richelle Direny: And but when you go on the roller coaster. You remember it starts off like really like and I'm getting like butterflies right now just thinking about the doggone thing.

248
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:23.040
Richelle Direny: But like I like to describe life with children as they go through this transition period in middle school, especially and kind of find yourself getting off of this roller coaster. So, you know, like how when you get on the roller coaster. It's like

249
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.150
Richelle Direny: It's like taking you slowly into the Devil's Den, but you don't know your

250
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:41.010
Richelle Direny: Been because it takes you real niceness soil. Okay, I could do this, and it's taking its time, and it may be some of them. It goes up to the top and it's going off really slow.

251
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:57.810
Richelle Direny: And you're like, oh, I could do this. This is nice. This is smooth. You're looking at the scenery and you're enjoying what you're seeing. And you're like, oh, elevated and then it goes June and that's when it starts to take you and it throws you and it puts you through so much stress.

252
00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.160
Richelle Direny: That's how

253
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.630
I like to describe

254
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.620
Richelle Direny: This stage that she's getting ready to enter

255
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.530
Andriana Clark: Right. The woman stage.

256
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.290
Andriana Clark: The everything

257
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:20.790
Richelle Direny: That everything this. Okay, Mom. I like this. I'm emotional and I'm not. You're the enemy. You're not. You're this and I believe in that. And it's just like they take you through this emotional

258
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.200
Andriana Clark: Raw now because

259
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.010
Richelle Direny: They're going through this roller coaster and they don't really understand all of these things.

260
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.700
Andriana Clark: Going on.

261
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:30.450
Andriana Clark: Right.

262
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:44.550
Richelle Direny: You have no clue. So they have like figure it out. So like, even with I'm and I'm going to kind of proceed with this statement with caution because everybody you know everybody's choice and what they do. It's their own

263
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:51.480
Richelle Direny: And so like with this stage, especially saying, you know, identify as being this like I like girls were this or that.

264
00:31:51.870 --> 00:32:05.430
Richelle Direny: It's still a part of that emotional state. And this is where you're getting really truly ready. This is where it's a very tender moment for not just you, but also for the child as well.

265
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.570
Andriana Clark: Okay.

266
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:16.140
Richelle Direny: This is where it's very important. How you mold them and how you pour into them and your the way you raise them because

267
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:27.330
Richelle Direny: At this juncture that she's getting ready to enter in and she's going to remain in it for a couple of years because remember your entrance of that puberty staging you remain in that for a little bit of time.

268
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:39.000
Richelle Direny: And it is very important, how you present like your parenting style, how much you you sit and you have that conversation with her. This is where you teach her

269
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.600
Richelle Direny: This is

270
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:45.510
Richelle Direny: Where you really lay down your values and your morals, you're passing on, you're pretty much saying

271
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:52.980
Richelle Direny: Kind of like when your grandmother got you and says, okay, sit down. I'm going to teach you a few things because this is the lesson that you need.

272
00:32:53.310 --> 00:33:06.570
Richelle Direny: In life, later on, these are all of the tools that I'm giving to you to pass on in life. That's kind of where you are. This is the roller coaster. The big the third of this and it's just throwing you all over the place.

273
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.550
Andriana Clark: And what

274
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:20.880
Richelle Direny: The roller coaster is doing to your body and you can't i can't function, I don't, I don't know what I feel what I think I'm trying to get I'm trying to gain control, but I can't get control. That's what this stage of her life goes through

275
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:34.110
Richelle Direny: Then later right about 1819. This is right about the end of high school when they're kind of going off into middle school. This is when you don't get off the roller coaster right there you slow down.

276
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:42.030
Richelle Direny: It's slowing down because remember at the end of the roller coaster. It's slowly takes you back in. Right. It

277
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.100
Andriana Clark: takes you back in before it.

278
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:57.090
Richelle Direny: Stops and it lets you off. And that's kind of how the stages that they're entering that's kind of how it is until they get to about, I would say between 18 and 20

279
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.880
Richelle Direny: It's when they're really getting off of it.

280
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:13.110
Richelle Direny: When they're really slowing down, and where they kind of go and they start experience in life, but they still start to really appreciate you. They start to appreciate everything that you taught them.

281
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.980
Richelle Direny: During this stage when they were going through this the the hormonal rage work. They couldn't figure it out.

282
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:26.370
Richelle Direny: That's where they're going to go back to that and they're going to reflect back on it now and they're going to think

283
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:36.030
Richelle Direny: Okay, now I understand what mom was telling you what dad was telling me and all that was going on now I can start putting it together. Because guess what

284
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:48.120
Richelle Direny: Every their hormones and everything has somewhat settled. So like I said, this right now is where even though sometimes it's just like, oh my god.

285
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:56.760
Richelle Direny: I'm tired. I can't, I can't hear it now. I can't. That's where you have to be mindful of how you present yourself.

286
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:11.430
Richelle Direny: In front of her, or how you speak to her. This is where you truly have to be mindful of that, um, because every little thing you say and do and how you act that she's watching that and that can

287
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:23.730
Richelle Direny: Only be her or break her. So how she came to you and she was like, Hey, Mom, I want to tell you something, and how you were just open and you just kind of embraced her and

288
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.680
Andriana Clark: You know, the kind of how respected her

289
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:38.100
Richelle Direny: Pretty much. Pretty much you respected what she and even if you don't necessarily agree with it. You're not going to kind of go in with your legal battle axe. No, that's not so empowering.

290
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.490
Andriana Clark: This is

291
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.960
Richelle Direny: You're not going to do that.

292
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.590
Andriana Clark: Even if the way I want to do it sometimes, but I've learned

293
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.970
Richelle Direny: Yet you can't

294
00:35:46.440 --> 00:36:02.160
Richelle Direny: You have to, you have to kind of ease and in there. You got to take your time, you're not always going to agree with certain things are not always going to be. You don't believe the decisions, but it's all about your delivery. Because what did they say

295
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:03.930
Richelle Direny: I'm

296
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.950
Andriana Clark: The best way

297
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.090
Andriana Clark: Hmm, I was gonna say I could either breaker. So, or I could help her. So no

298
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.050
Andriana Clark: More comfortable about herself or more ashamed of yourself.

299
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:27.180
Andriana Clark: Exactly him like growing up, my parents. That's what they did. They made me feel ashamed of everything I did everything I did was wrong. It was never good enough and like an order to fill the way that I did.

300
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:34.950
Andriana Clark: And I'm like, I know sometimes like I look at it and like I can see like pain in her face just from

301
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:46.620
Andriana Clark: Everything that she's already been through like she's been through a lot because of my drug use and because CPS take it in and out of the house which was my fault.

302
00:36:47.430 --> 00:37:00.780
Andriana Clark: But like she blamed herself for a lot of it and like, it's so hard, because she, she's like that type of person that feels like everything that goes wrong is because of her

303
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:14.460
Andriana Clark: And I've been thinking about trying to get like in therapy or something. But then at the same time she's scared to talk to anybody because she's scared if she talks about the past and things

304
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:24.060
Andriana Clark: Have happened that she'll get taken off of us and I keep trying to break. We don't even have custody over my dad does

305
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.530
Andriana Clark: He let her live with us, but either taker or kill one at a time.

306
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:52.650
Andriana Clark: And like she knows that me like she gets scared but us in my dad's gonna get in trouble or something like that. Like my dad's Ray wake by as he checks in on us all time we see him every single day. He knows everything that's going on.

307
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.720
Richelle Direny: You, you don't have

308
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.400
Richelle Direny: Like your parents or rights were terminated or just

309
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:09.660
Andriana Clark: I find I did six nila has been both that six months in jail. We signed custody over to my dad so that the kids didn't end up in foster care.

310
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:20.520
Andriana Clark: And we had planned on already getting customer feedback, once we go straight into our lives and clean but um

311
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:29.880
Andriana Clark: We decided to wait a little bit before we go to court to get the customer the actual custody back because

312
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:49.050
Andriana Clark: The data cups got caught on my husband O'clock Scott call them my dog man has been out a warrant for unpaid finds that he didn't even realize that he had he thought that I had taken care of them back in 2015 and I probably was supposed to and I probably spent the money on drugs.

313
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.300
Andriana Clark: And told him that if he room or something like guarantee that's probably what happened.

314
00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:06.900
Andriana Clark: But, um, they came and got him for that, like, I just want to make sure we have no more legal problems before we go and get custody back that way. There ain't no chance at all.

315
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:18.300
Andriana Clark: That we're going to get arrested for something and they lose the kids because we got arrested for an unpaid fine or something like that.

316
00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:25.620
Andriana Clark: Now everything in lines taken care of and all my court cases are closed, which I did have I had a lot

317
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:42.960
Andriana Clark: And we just got our income tax it back yesterday, so I have to call I tried calling today to pay it all. It's fine. But I have to call tomorrow to do it. And that's my goal for tomorrow is to get all it's fine to pay it off and then

318
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.150
Andriana Clark: Sometime by the end of the month. I plan on going and taking my test and getting drivers to

319
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.130
Richelle Direny: By the end of what month, next month.

320
00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:02.250
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. Okay. Um, the thing is, you know,

321
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.470
Richelle Direny: So this is what

322
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.450
How can I put this

323
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.690
Richelle Direny: You can be your child Council.

324
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:22.470
Richelle Direny: Okay, you can through your own counseling equip yourself in a way that you are there for her and you're able to speak to her.

325
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:23.790
And kind of

326
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.280
Richelle Direny: Put you don't lay out the platform.

327
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.410
Andriana Clark: Kind of get her insight and the situation or what come of it.

328
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:41.580
Richelle Direny: Back and then where she gets to a place where she feels comfortable. Now the other thing is

329
00:40:44.250 --> 00:41:00.690
Richelle Direny: You have to be able to, you know, teacher and educator her because with therapy is always going to be a trust factor. It's person that you don't know, um, you are having to open up and talk about personal

330
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.650
Andriana Clark: Issue with someone

331
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.640
Richelle Direny: That you have no idea. You don't know what they're going to do with the information if they're going to use it against you have really no clue. So you're

332
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:19.170
Richelle Direny: Out on your seven out on faith and you're kind of just like stepping out blindly to say, hey, I'm gonna try to trust this person and you're hoping

333
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:30.660
Richelle Direny: That they're not going to take whatever information I share with them and throw it back on me but you it's ultimately you have you are working on learning how

334
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:31.860
Andriana Clark: To

335
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:43.890
Richelle Direny: Speak to her in teacher to be okay with getting to that point where she allows herself to speak to someone, a neutral person.

336
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:44.760
Andriana Clark: Right.

337
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.200
Out bias.

338
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.130
Richelle Direny: That will be able to sit and speak with her and they're not trying

339
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.580
Richelle Direny: To run off and say, oh, well, the mom is this and that and A, B and C.

340
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:09.360
Andriana Clark: You understand. Right, right. Because I mean it took me 15 years until I found the camp counselor come out what's comfortable talking to and that you everybody else. I feel like once or twice and then just completely quit talking to them.

341
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.860
Richelle Direny: What I mean, and so you have to, you have to identify look within yourself and saying okay

342
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:30.120
Richelle Direny: What was it for you that made you feel uncomfortable in the past, where are you now where you feel okay you felt a little bit more comfortable to open it up, you have to answer those questions within

343
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:30.780
Andriana Clark: Yourself.

344
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:36.090
Richelle Direny: To say about the situation made it more comfortable where you got to that.

345
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.280
Richelle Direny: Place. And that's kind of how you feel.

346
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:49.830
Andriana Clark: Right, and I think a lot of it for me. What got me to that place was kidding around the past and getting over all the hurt and regrets and fear that I had

347
00:42:52.740 --> 00:43:06.390
Andriana Clark: A lot of fear, but it's nothing like it used to be. And that's because I was able to get it out, even though I don't think anybody else. I was able to get it out to myself on paper and

348
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:20.670
Andriana Clark: Go over it like I read and I completely wrote out every thing that's ever happened to me in my life. And then I read it a couple times and then I

349
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:33.660
Andriana Clark: Listen to other people's story different people's stories. And I just thought of, like, all the yes but I haven't had yet like there could be so much worse things that have happened to me like

350
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:49.260
Andriana Clark: I could have been a child back instead of just having my father beat on me. He could have been raping me or something else too because he was drunk. And that's where a lot of things happened young girls and stuff is because their father is drinking and

351
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.530
Andriana Clark: Just so drunk with a lot of times people with children.

352
00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:58.830
Andriana Clark: Like their own mind what they're doing.

353
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:09.600
Andriana Clark: And then I think, yeah, I just kind of like, think of all the guests that never happened to me all the things that could happen to me.

354
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:10.500
Richelle Direny: That didn't

355
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.020
Andriana Clark: Yeah, I think that's kind of what helped me get through my past.

356
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.810
Richelle Direny: So it's like it. So you're based on what I'm hearing you say is that when you think

357
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.250
Richelle Direny: About when you put down your own fears and all of the things that you when you wrote it out on

358
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:26.970
Richelle Direny: Paper right

359
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.230
Andriana Clark: And then you put

360
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.310
Richelle Direny: The story.

361
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.280
Andriana Clark: Your situation and circumstances and

362
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.720
Andriana Clark: Thought was not

363
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.910
Richelle Direny: As bad as that person went through.

364
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I'm

365
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.730
Andriana Clark: Gonna try to like remind myself like

366
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:55.650
Andriana Clark: It could always have been worse, and it can always get a lot worse if I get back to it. And I think that's what helps me to stay strong and then like I also in last couple years I

367
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:07.770
Andriana Clark: Was down. I've read more people in than I ever have before. I kind of like my husband's notice the difference because he knows like

368
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:16.800
Andriana Clark: I would never talk to him about anything since me and him, got together like he had a really hard time getting enough term and I mean I would I trust them with my life.

369
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:27.990
Andriana Clark: I just didn't feel comfortable talking about different things that have happened in the past because I tried to act like they never happen. I tried to put woke up and I like thing and break this that

370
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:36.510
Andriana Clark: So whenever something about it would get up for something I would shut down because, in my mind, it didn't.

371
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.350
Andriana Clark: A lot of the things I found

372
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:49.110
Andriana Clark: Out in the things that I've been able to talk to people about I think that that helps

373
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:58.140
Andriana Clark: It helps me more than I put the walls down at first when I first put them down. It does. It hurts like hell.

374
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.190
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

375
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:04.590
Andriana Clark: I get depressed for a couple days and then I get over it.

376
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.180
Richelle Direny: And it's all, it's so it's so amazing what you just said. And it just goes to show how

377
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.610
Richelle Direny: Much strength you have that you didn't know you have

378
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.580
Andriana Clark: You used to talk about like

379
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.760
Richelle Direny: Addiction and what the

380
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.220
Richelle Direny: Purpose of why you use the drugs.

381
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.780
Andriana Clark: The drugs.

382
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.460
Richelle Direny: Is because you got addicted.

383
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.610
Andriana Clark: To the idea and the thought and feeling of not feeling

384
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.950
Andriana Clark: Good and being numb.

385
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.150
Andriana Clark: Yes.

386
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.170
Richelle Direny: Of Vietnam.

387
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.670
Andriana Clark: So you're saying that

388
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:47.130
Richelle Direny: You realize that kind of like a cut and it's not going to stay hurting forever. It has to heal. But am I going to allow it to take its course because

389
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.170
Andriana Clark: It will stop.

390
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:56.010
Richelle Direny: It's not going to continue. It's not going to nothing lingers on and on, it will stop oftentimes it's

391
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.310
Richelle Direny: I don't know if I've ever said to you. It's kind of like

392
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:15.330
Richelle Direny: Think about how we hold on to things and we fester things. And when we're struggling and how without realizing it. We're holding on to the hurt into the pain, where it's like, no, just let go. You ever

393
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.310
Richelle Direny: You ever think about a child a monkey bar.

394
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.980
Richelle Direny: They're holding on, you know, the ones that they're holding on to

395
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:26.670
Andriana Clark: And like you're holding on, and you don't want to let go. But you can barely hold on and you're trying your hardest just to keep going.

396
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.980
Richelle Direny: There you go.

397
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.540
Richelle Direny: Let it go.

398
00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.750
Richelle Direny: You're hurting, you're in pain.

399
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.370
Richelle Direny: The only way the pain.

400
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:46.470
Richelle Direny: Is that you have to let go. That is the only way. And I think it's like we have a hard time and I like that analogy for someone to feel like just like oh

401
00:47:46.890 --> 00:48:01.800
Richelle Direny: Someone is here, willing to catch you is willing to help you just let go and oftentimes we go through and we stay in the pit and we continue with the depression, simply because we refused.

402
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.810
Andriana Clark: To let it go. Let it go.

403
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.360
Richelle Direny: We refuse to let it go.

404
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:20.490
Richelle Direny: And it's just like I get it hurts. It hurts. I get it. I can't see. I understand it because I've never been there. I've never experienced but but i get it hurts. It hurts like hell.

405
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.680
Andriana Clark: But listen, yeah.

406
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:28.770
Andriana Clark: It will stop hurting people. And on to it just gonna keep hurting longer and longer. There you go.

407
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.150
Andriana Clark: There you go.

408
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:37.350
Andriana Clark: And that's what a lot. Yeah, that's a little lot of my problem. I think was was because I like filling my mind like

409
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:49.980
Andriana Clark: I didn't want to get it out. I didn't want to let go. But I didn't want to think about it or feel nothing from it. And that's what the where the drugs came in because they made me number the world to reality and what

410
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.820
Andriana Clark: I pretty much didn't care about nothing but the drugs.

411
00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:06.990
Andriana Clark: And then now that I'm sober, I can see a difference in the world. And like how good everything can be and everything. Don't have to be the same way that

412
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:14.790
Andriana Clark: It was for me growing up, I can do better, but I can't do better if I keep holding on to the past, because then I just keep living in the past.

413
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:24.030
Richelle Direny: You're absolutely right. And when you think about even when you gave the example with your dad and him having his own

414
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:37.110
Richelle Direny: addiction to alcohol or whatever that situation is, but it's thinking about, you know, the reason why he had he had his addiction to alcohol was because he had his own issues that he was holding on to

415
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:48.330
Richelle Direny: But now, are you going to completely change everything about your dad or the way you grew up, or are you going to say I will never do anything, or are you going to look at the situation.

416
00:49:48.930 --> 00:50:00.270
Richelle Direny: Processing and just take out what you can use because it's not everything that was horrible. Because if everything was horrible. You wouldn't sign over custody to your dad.

417
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.060
Andriana Clark: So there was something about him.

418
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:14.550
Richelle Direny: That you admired. There's something about him that you respect it. That's why you felt safe enough and you trusted him enough to allow him.

419
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:21.000
Andriana Clark: To take that because I respected the fact that he was hard working me anywhere, do anything.

420
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.610
Andriana Clark: For family, no matter how bad things caught

421
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:33.450
Richelle Direny: You see how you were able to pick, pick that out of the fact that he was an alcoholic and whatever the bad things where you see how you still was able to pick that out.

422
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.360
Andriana Clark: And Daya how you look at your

423
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.410
Andriana Clark: parenting style.

424
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:52.050
Richelle Direny: And say I have my own style. There are certain things that I may do a little bit different, but you have to sit and like you said. Allow yourself to let go of the past so that you can see it.

425
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.250
Andriana Clark: Right, but

426
00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:15.840
Richelle Direny: In the end, and I think daily and what I'm going to encourage you to do is daily. Just tell yourself and remind yourself that you are strong and you are capable and you are worthy and you have more strength than you give yourself credit for

427
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:25.200
Richelle Direny: Okay, just encourage you have more inner strength and ability to do things, then you give yourself credit for

428
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.390
Andriana Clark: And I think if you gave that to yourself.

429
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:37.110
Richelle Direny: Daily your realize how much you're able to continue to let go. Other things in your past that you may still be holding onto right

430
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.430
Andriana Clark: The more I let go of things, the happier. I am

431
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:53.400
Richelle Direny: The happier you are and the more confident you become of telling yourself that you have more strength than you give yourself credit for

432
00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.300
Richelle Direny: And that you are much better today than you were yesterday.

433
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:08.010
Richelle Direny: Even though you're great today, but you're much better tomorrow than you were today.

434
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:13.440
Richelle Direny: Right, okay, but it's just a constant encouragement, because

435
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.030
Richelle Direny: It's bringing those things into our awareness and saying,

436
00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.880
Richelle Direny: I really just have to let this go I'm doing more myself that I'm doing good.

437
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:29.100
Andriana Clark: I just have to worry and usually it's stuff that we hold on to that really doesn't matter.

438
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:39.090
Andriana Clark: Yeah, it might have been painful yet late be something that you think about from time to time, because it was something that was painful but

439
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:46.920
Andriana Clark: Think about it, but also think about the good times that happened around but that there's that times

440
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.770
Mm hmm.

441
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.080
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's just, just think just

442
00:52:59.130 --> 00:52:59.790
Richelle Direny: Think that

443
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:15.690
Richelle Direny: Every time whenever you get to that place where you're like, you're feeling emotionally overwhelmed in your satin and whatever the situation or circumstance that presented itself kind of puts you in that frame of mind.

444
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:22.170
Richelle Direny: Just think of the analogy. Am I holding on to this monkey bar.

445
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.150
Richelle Direny: Am I at that place where I can let it go. I want to let it go.

446
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.080
Andriana Clark: All right.

447
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.310
Okay.

448
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.530
Andriana Clark: I can do that.

449
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.430
Andriana Clark: And

450
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.950
Richelle Direny: When you get to that place where. And if you ever get

451
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:54.120
Richelle Direny: This is also where strength comes from. If you get to that place where you say, I can't let it go. I feel like it's choking me I need help. I need someone else to hear me. That's why you can call and say, Hey, Michelle, you know what I'm really feeling overwhelmed right now.

452
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.110
To

453
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.450
Andriana Clark: Help me.

454
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:03.660
Richelle Direny: Because when you talk to someone and a person somewhat repeats back to you what you're saying.

455
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.950
Andriana Clark: Then going to help

456
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:07.620
Richelle Direny: You got it out.

457
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.420
Richelle Direny: You're hearing it back. And then you're like, Okay, I feel a little bit better. I think I do.

458
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.310
Andriana Clark: Or I feel a little bit better but I feel a little bit dumb free villain and it gets to me.

459
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.070
Richelle Direny: So that's, that's the hope.

460
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.490
Richelle Direny: In some degree, to some degree, because it's hearing it back.

461
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:32.790
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like when you tell someone something and then they repeat it back to you. You're like, Well, hold on now.

462
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.020
Richelle Direny: So,

463
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:47.400
Richelle Direny: Let me encourage you keep loving on your daughter keep being there. Trust me as much as you're like, oh god, she told me the story. One more time.

464
00:54:49.500 --> 00:55:00.600
Andriana Clark: Oh no, she's like, there's all these crazy apps out there now that I don't understand them, or all these other social media accounts for kids or teens and stuff.

465
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:07.200
Andriana Clark: And like she's on some of them and it's like I'm on her phone trying to get through everything and it's

466
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:13.620
Andriana Clark: In my head I'm like, I can't trust her because I knew what me and my cousins and my sisters and all of them that we were younger.

467
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:23.850
Andriana Clark: And then it's like after I'm sitting there telling myself I can't trust her. And I'm looking through her stuff. I'm like, I'm such an idiot like why am I getting myself worried about it.

468
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:32.850
Andriana Clark: Mm hmm. But then it's like, I don't know who I can trust out in this world, either. And I don't want it to turn out to be

469
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:48.360
Andriana Clark: Somebody that end up being on our Facebook group and find out where she lives because of her name or a picture that's in her in her one of her pictures or something like sometimes the alien work in new words up because of that.

470
00:55:50.190 --> 00:56:03.060
Richelle Direny: You're it's important that the relationship you build with her now, especially where she is seeking it out from you, and sometimes they're seeking things out from you. They don't realize that's what they're doing. But you have to be able to be in tune to them.

471
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:05.460
Andriana Clark: So that

472
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:13.140
Richelle Direny: You know, okay. You know what my mom said this, because listen, let me tell you something. Sometimes you think these kids are not listening to you, but trust me down.

473
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.280
Andriana Clark: Oh, no.

474
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:23.430
Richelle Direny: They're listening to you. It goes into it when you will know when they're listening to you because they try to throw it back at you in the most inopportune time

475
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.330
Yeah.

476
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:35.970
Richelle Direny: So you. This is where it's very important that time that you spend with her and how you pour into her. Listen, the best teacher

477
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:38.070
Richelle Direny: For your daughter.

478
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.300
Andriana Clark: Is you

479
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.290
Richelle Direny: Do it. What, why do you think you are the best teacher for her.

480
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.710
Andriana Clark: Because she sees me and watches me every single day.

481
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.870
Richelle Direny: And because of the past. You've had

482
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:50.820
Andriana Clark: Yeah.

483
00:56:50.970 --> 00:57:00.360
Richelle Direny: Look how to pass like no other. So, you know, what's out there you know relation looks like you know what all of it looks like

484
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:10.710
Richelle Direny: Well, you're the only person who can tell her, ain't no. So think about it. There is no conniving in the Seaver better than me. So, trust me.

485
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:23.490
Richelle Direny: It takes one to know one so I could tell you what a person is doing what they're thinking where they're going with that line of questioning why they're doing this, how they're they're fishing for you. I'm telling you, because I know it. I've been

486
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.330
Andriana Clark: There, done.

487
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:39.540
Richelle Direny: That. And that's what you have to keep so your past is your pants you went through it. But listen, you can take what you've gone through and you can teach someone why this is the reason why you don't want to walk down that

488
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.010
Andriana Clark: Right.

489
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.680
Richelle Direny: And the reason why I brought that up because

490
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:55.890
Richelle Direny: Just like you with all of these different accents out there, there is very peak, they're sick people out there that they they get into these reach to these young children and they don't know

491
00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:04.080
Richelle Direny: Right, this is the reason why, like you said, you have to be very vigilant in trying to be a part of what it is that she's doing

492
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:12.900
Andriana Clark: Right, just so that I can be aware that there's nobody out there trying to harm her and that she's safe.

493
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.630
Hmm. Mm hmm.

494
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.390
Richelle Direny: You've got this, you've got this

495
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:22.860
Andriana Clark: Is your. Yes, you may kill you. You got this.

496
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.370
Richelle Direny: Your, your, your whole lot better than you give yourself credit for

497
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:26.730
That

498
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:28.860
Andriana Clark: Thank you.

499
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:32.580
Richelle Direny: So, and you'll get through it. But definitely, as I said,

500
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:47.250
Richelle Direny: You know, just kind of do that. Man in the Mirror type of thing every day, just give yourself that kind of motivational speech. I am stronger than I give myself credit for

501
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.420
Andriana Clark: I said,

502
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:56.460
Richelle Direny: I'm worthy and you just keep doing that, I am going to make the best of today and I am going to appreciate what I can say

503
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:58.920
Andriana Clark: Okay.

504
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.310
Richelle Direny: All right then. Adrian. So, um, let's see.

Richelle Direny: Don't worry, we're always at the end of February, put it like that.

513
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:30.300
Andriana Clark: Yeah, that's usually about how I know around what it is.
