Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, my zoom froze. I mean it was just crazy. It's the second time that it's done that.

Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Oh, it

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: is crazy. I don't know what is up resume. I think it's overloaded.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.920
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Probably. That's what I was thinking.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I apologize, how are you

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.000
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Doing all right.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's happening with

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.780
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It, you know, and so my boss. He came in yesterday to be able to talk to me.

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He didn't say that. That's what he was coming in for but when

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.080
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yesterday morning

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.350
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: When I call them. Well, he originally called me to wake me up, you know, and

22
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Then I remembered I was like, it's Monday I have my appointment, you know, the group therapy appointment.

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:39.000
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And he knows, like he knows about my appointments. I've told him, he's told me that like a couple weeks before I ended up telling him about my addiction and stuff like that.

24
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.860
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And starting bright heart. He told me he's like, Yeah, I used to be like addicted to meth and he's, you know, he told me that his whole story. So that's why I felt comfortable enough to tell him.

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:01.080
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: My story. And he's also pretty he's pretty cool and chill. He calls me his white daughter, but I call him my Filipino bad kind of thing.

26
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.040
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because yeah, but he's just really cool chill person. So when I called him and told him about the

27
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.470
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Clip is like. All right. Well, whenever you get time call me so we could talk and I was like, all right, then you already knew what it was going to be about in a way

28
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:32.580
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because I'm always late always late to work. I can't. I mean, there's times where I'm like okay and I got a full eight hours of sleep. Why can't I get up, but like yesterday morning, and even Saturday like explaining group.

29
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:43.650
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like I just literally slept through my alarm and if nobody nobody would have called me. I probably would have woke up you know 11 or 12 or whenever my son would have gotten me up.

30
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.280
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But that's another thing that's we are too is like either, my phone just didn't like the alarm didn't go off at all.

31
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.880
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because I have like seven or eight alarms and I have my Fitbit watch that goes off, too.

32
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:09.420
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But that when it rains for a certain amount of time and then it cuts off and then it doesn't ring again, there's no snooze on it. So I'm wondering how it went off so many times and it didn't even wake my son up either which is

33
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:24.660
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like, I don't think. But my ALARMS WERE SET. I always check in, it's set to go off every weekday on my phone. So I don't. I just don't understand how I slipped through all of my alarms and turn them all off like

34
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.060
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't understand like at all.

35
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah. Weird. So back to the story. He

36
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:42.600
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He was in his office and he was like doing something. I mean, he was there for other things too, but um I think to do like a meeting or to fix the schedule or whatever.

37
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.280
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And he I messaged him, I was like, well, since you're here. Do you want to go ahead and recommend me or whatever and

38
00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:01.410
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He's like, yeah, do you have a moment. I was like, okay, sure. And he asked me if I wanted a representative and I was like, are you going to fire me. Because if so, then yeah.

39
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:15.090
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He's like, No, I'm not going to fire you. I was like, all right. So a couple minutes later I went to go see him and went in his office and we shut the door and he again. He was really, really nice about it. He

40
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.100
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He wasn't

41
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:31.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: His first question, though, was is are you like, do you have any cravings or anything. I was like, no, I take medication that hopes that and I guess in his eyes like what I was getting what he was saying is

42
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:42.180
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: All he said that I'm showing signs of like using and I'm like how and he was like, because you're sleeping a lot and like you can't wake up in the morning.

43
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:53.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And I'll say, I understand that. But I think it might be because what two things. One, I'm trying to get on a normal sleep schedule and like my whole sleep. Ever since becoming

44
00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.360
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, like clean and sober, however you want to say it like my, I think my body is still trying to like normalize itself out with

45
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:24.720
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like sleeping. But I think the main thing is, is the medication and I take the Clonidine that helps me like with my nightmares and stuff. I think because since I didn't take it for two nights. It made me possibly sleep harder, which is, I think, would have been the opposite way around

46
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.420
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But he, he was like very understanding and he's like, if you while like you know kind of be like a sponsor to

47
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:44.220
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And you just been really helpful and being really nice. He wasn't like he was talking pretty low, too, because sometimes if you speak loud enough you can like hear through the door, whatever.

48
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:53.190
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But, you know, he says that he wants. He's really supportive of my recovery and you know he's being really, really nice and understanding about it.

49
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And then he said he was like, if you want me I can, I can call you in the morning I wake up at 530 and

50
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:13.200
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Do you wanna call you at seven. I was like, No, that's way too late you you'd have to call me at like six. He's like, that's fine. That's whenever I'm about to go outside and take a walk and I was like, Okay, if you want to but I mean I don't feel like like I don't

51
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:26.220
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like I just feel so irresponsible like I shouldn't have to have somebody call me to wake me up, but it's like I I need it, but I just feel like it's kind of

52
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.830
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, being dependent on someone else but also giving somebody else the responsibility because I'm being irresponsible because I can't wake up.

53
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:44.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because I'm always usually a few minutes late to work quite often probably like through anyway anywhere between like two to four times a week.

54
00:06:44.880 --> 00:07:04.320
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, it's a lot so he says that he doesn't want me to like lose my job over something that could be, you know, like someone could fix and he said that he knows that I'm like a really good hard worker and I mean well and he said that he'll call me in the morning, which is good. So

55
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:20.160
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I told him that my husband, like when he's not around. He usually will call me in the morning, but since he's been riding his motorcycle and there's a different time change. You know, he actually just got to Michigan.

56
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Maybe like an hour or so ago, a little less than an hour ago. So

57
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:37.170
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It's three hours ahead there now. So, but while he was writing. He can't just stop on the side of the road and just call me, you know, um,

58
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.450
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And of course when he's there, he'll, like, make sure I'm up at a weight.

59
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know,

60
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Least I have

61
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:53.040
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Somebody to kind of like, help me out, and even like my, oh my boss East because I told him.

62
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.220
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because one of the days I it was last week, the day that my husband.

63
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.980
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Left, I think, or the day that I thought he was leaving on Thursday, he

64
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.560
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Or I

65
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:18.930
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Slept overslept two hours because again I set my alarm and then I I turned it off or whatever and

66
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I messaged him when I got to work. I was like, hey, just want to give you a heads up that I was

67
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:41.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: A couple hours late because my husband's leaving Michigan and I just found a lot of anxiety and I can't sleep and blah, blah, blah, blah. And again, he's really understanding and back to the when he was talking to me. He said that he knows that my husband's gone and I'm

68
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:51.510
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, pretty much taken care of, like, my son by myself, because my dad hasn't been at my house because he lost his keys.

69
00:08:52.290 --> 00:09:03.990
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Where he's staying out right now with my step mom. He's like, they're half of the time if not a little more than half the time over there. And then, you know, he kind of like comes to our house to pretty much escape, you know, being over there.

70
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.870
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So he

71
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.020
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Hasn't been there to kind of like, help me out with things here and there, but

72
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.200
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It is it is pretty hard like yesterday I we when we got

73
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:30.900
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: When I picked him up. We went to the Dollar Tree, because I was trying to find extension cord so that way I could plug my phone on the other side of the room and couldn't find anything so

74
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.670
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I know that we have an extension cord at home, but it has the three prongs on it.

75
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah, we don't

76
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:45.930
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Have a. We don't have a socket like that that's in our room that's like that. So, and plus it's like 100 or 50 foot. It's like a really, really long.

77
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Industrial tonight or

78
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:55.410
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So I was like, Okay, I'll just put it on the other side of the bed, but that didn't work out when me and killing went to bed.

79
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.350
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But pretty much I got home made

80
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:10.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: The dishes and I took a shower and I was going to be killing and and I was like oh my god it's already 930. I was like, I gotta go to bed like time from basically like

81
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:21.480
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Once I get Kilian. So we'll say about like 545 like once we get home to, like, I only have like three like three to four hours to really do stuff and

82
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:30.180
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Doing it all by myself because I didn't bake him. I wasn't able to finish all of the dishes wasn't able to close way. I mean,

83
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:44.760
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Our fields are okay, but I needed to Washington, his little sippy cup things because he had none. And of course, I needed to shower and make dinner. So it's kind of hard to cram a lot of things and just a small timeframe and still go to bed in time.

84
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

85
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.750
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, still try to wake up early. So my boss called me this morning and

86
00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:15.600
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Even though was hella tired and I wanted to lay back down. I just obviously you called me so I got up and I went a Witten made some breakfast and brush my teeth and then got myself mostly already. And then I woke up my kid and dropped him off. So it wasn't like I was there.

87
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You were 15 minutes early. That's cool. And, you know, there's nothing wrong with

88
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Accepting help

89
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean you are, you're, you're in this routine with your husband and he has been, you know, your help and he's not there. So,

90
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:42.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is an adjustment. You know what I mean. But in the same sense, I think it's awesome that your boss is willing to call you at six in the morning.

91
00:11:43.200 --> 00:12:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let them accept that help because that's going to help you get in the routine that you're looking for. You know what I mean, we can't always do things on our own, and by ourselves. And, you know, in today's society people helping is not so.

92
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Prevalent everywhere like it used to be. You know what I mean.

93
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think it's awesome that he's willing to call you at six o'clock.

94
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To help you get up. I think that's great. I don't. I mean, it doesn't mean that you fall short with anything.

95
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know and I understand that it's hard to

96
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:30.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wrap your head around that. But it's really true. We're humans. We make mistakes. You know what I mean. We do things sometimes that we need help.

97
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this right now in this area is where you need a little, a little push a little help to get your sleep cycle back in a routine that you can

98
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do what you need to do, get up when you need to get up, you know what I mean. Yeah, so don't overthink it. That's really I think what I'm trying to say is like he offered to call you at six in the morning, except that call, you know,

99
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'll get it but about the time that your husband's coming back.

100
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then all of a sudden you'll

101
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll be in that routine. You know what I mean, it's like, whoa, and another great thing about it is what a way to take a look at a piece of your relationship.

102
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you appreciate

103
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

104
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:33.060
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because I I've kind of always thought like, you know, if I was a single parent or you know me, my husband for separate whatever may be

105
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I always thought like, oh yeah, I could do this, you know, I could you know

106
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.970
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because the way that I see is because when he would ride his motorcycle, especially with the last like, month or so that it's kind of warmed up.

107
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:56.880
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I'm taking him, you know, back and forth to daycare and bathing him and, you know, doing a lot of this stuff. And I've kind of been thinking like, of course, when I get all pissy at my husband.

108
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:08.010
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And myself like I don't really need you. Yeah, I need the money, but I don't technically need you and now these last like four or five days, whatever, it's been

109
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:17.280
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, it's been really hard trying to make sure I wake up early enough get him ready for daycare because he's a little brat. And last night was just

110
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:30.690
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like, even though we went to bed at 940 but we didn't go to bed, till about 1050 like he didn't fall asleep hour and I had my phone plugged in. On the other side of the bed where my husband usually sleeps.

111
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:39.330
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But my son thought, you know, it was really funny to try to like grab my phone and try to like he wasn't having it.

112
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.320
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like he saw the

113
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.840
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Air and he wanted the phone so

114
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.930
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You and of course he wanted. He felt like, oh, I want to be potty training right now so

115
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:59.910
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know he's drinking this water and he's kind of starting to fall asleep and I was basically almost asleep. Surprisingly, and he woke me up and said, Mom, you have to go pee.

116
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:11.520
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And I'm like, now you have to go pee. I just do like a while like a while ago, like 30 minutes go like almost before bed if you had to go potty. And you said no. And you didn't want to

117
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.680
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And he's like, well, I still didn't say I will. I still have to go pee. But he kept asking

118
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:35.370
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: To go pee. So like, okay, fine, but you know goofing around or anything because anytime, or he kind of gets his way, he gets like this little laugh that he gets like a high got my way kind of laugh and I hate it, you know, but I'm not going to tell him. No, just pee in your diaper and

119
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:48.990
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, be encouraged him to just keep paying in his diaper or pull up or whatever. So I took him to go potty. And then we laid back down and then he was almost asleep and

120
00:15:50.970 --> 00:16:06.120
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I was like, I pretty much took, like, I don't know. It could have been like maybe a 10 minute nap that I'm not really sure how long I kind of slept for or was almost asleep and they he woke me up again city had to go potty again. So I was like,

121
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.020
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I'm not giving you water before bed anymore so

122
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's not in a pull up or anything he's

123
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:16.860
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: gonna pull up. Yeah.

124
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:31.740
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He wears but he wears pull ups you know all the time, he still peeps in fees and poops in it and everything like that is daycare like like you shouldn't be buying clubs. If he's not or not, like, you shouldn't but

125
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She suggests that we should just still if he's not gonna really try to go potty or whatever. This was like probably like six or so months ago.

126
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:55.260
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: When she said that pull ups are more expensive. You don't get, you know, like you're the money that you pay you pretty much get a better deal of doing diapers like use the pull ups for really you know potty training.

127
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.470
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, heavily used for, you know,

128
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:08.940
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Matt, he goes through phases where he wants to potty train like he wants to go potty or, you know, use the big boy party and

129
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But there's times where I'm like, Okay, let's get on a little bit of a schedule and like, Come on, let's go potty.

130
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:24.180
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't have to go potty or no, I don't want to a lot of the times, as he doesn't want to. He's being a little brat. And that's another thing is that

131
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:38.190
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Since Kevin's been gone killing is being he's been a lot worse. And he's kind of like acting out born just being a lot more hard like he's it's a lot more hard to handle him. Yeah. Oh.

132
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.930
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And of course, he said, No, I want my daddy or

133
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.100
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He's in that

134
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:58.230
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Phase two, which I think is pretty young, but I don't know. So I just know what's my siblings. I always thought it was kind of more of like a pre teen stage like I hate you. I don't want you in my life kind of thing.

135
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, they go through it when they're younger, too. And you know he's he's testing the boundaries.

136
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what he's doing, you know, he's testing, you know,

137
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dad's away so Kilian will play to, kind of, you know, mentality that kids get and they get that way, whenever

138
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:28.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One parent isn't in the home and the other parent is trying to handle everything. You know what I mean, you've got to set heart those hard boundaries with them. When does Kevin come back.

139
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:37.500
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He comes back. He's supposed to be back. I think around June 1 i think i don't know how the days phone but he said the beginning of June.

140
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.400
Mm hmm.

141
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.980
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, I think it's like the beginning of June, something like that. So,

142
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he just got there.

143
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And everything was okay on his trip.

144
00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:07.020
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, he was fine. He said that it was really cold in some of the states. I think he stopped in Nevada, Utah, Minnesota, Wisconsin. Oh, South Dakota. They saw Mount Rushmore, and then

145
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:24.600
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I'm pretty sure they stopped a couple other places, but that those are the places that I think that they stayed at was in Arizona, and the rest. So, but now they're going to stay at Danny's which is Kevin's friend our friend, he has a son.

146
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:32.970
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: That's like in his early 20s, I think he's they're going to stay there with them little him and his dogs so it's

147
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.420
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Been my

148
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, OK. OK. And yeah, you'll

149
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll get everything down pat. You know what I mean about the time when it's about time for him to start coming home, you know, the first week, we can have sometimes

150
00:19:51.060 --> 00:20:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be chaotic, the kid, you know, kids going to test you know what I mean, you're not going to be able to get up all of these things. But if you could accept the help what you did and

151
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take a look at the situation and realize the appreciation that you have, you know,

152
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It gives you this whole mindset when he does come back to think differently. Yeah.

153
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean,

154
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:18.840
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah.

155
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

156
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's pretty cool. And you know, it's a learning experience for both of you also hopefully the, the hope is, is that your husband also appreciates

157
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You

158
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. While he's gone to, and that can only mean good things, you know,

159
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, so it's good. You didn't get rolled up at work. You didn't get fired at work. Yeah, right. Everything is okay. You're just struggling with the schedule and asleep stuff.

160
00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:06.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I forgot. Kind of like a huge deal to me that one of the girls. Her name is Monica. She's kind of like she's like a micromanager or she's like, you know, she always tells my boss, what to do.

161
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.020
In a way.

162
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:17.100
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He, do you really told my boss, like I kind of like hated her. She's the one I told you that I think that sometimes she acts like she's on something.

163
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:38.250
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know she she really told my boss and my boss told me to get rid of me and he was like upset about that. He's like, Monica really said that I should just get rid of you because I'm never on time. And you know, I, I'm not pulling my load, I think, is what he said. And I'm like,

164
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:53.370
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I'm still like learning how to do like I'm sorry I'm not good at the paperwork side like when it comes to scheduling. I'm good at that. Because that's what I had a year of experience before I started that particular job at that clinic.

165
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.460
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But to say to get rid of me like

166
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:05.040
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like that just kind of in a way it kind of blew my mind that she would say that like I was very offended by that.

167
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.810
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, he

168
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:16.290
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like because the past like couple weeks. I'd say like maybe week or two. She's just been like kind of quiet, in a way, and

169
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:25.410
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She doesn't really talk to me, or I'll ask her something like she's to be very like very, very helpful. Like sometimes a little too over hopeful. Our like

170
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:31.110
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: intervenes too much like if I'm trying to do something, I asked a question that she takes over and it's like

171
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:44.190
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: What is the point of view, doing that if I don't learn how to do it myself. I'm just asking the question about one thing. Let me, you know, try to do it, figure it out, kind of thing. But the past two weeks. Like, I try to ask her.

172
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:51.150
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, like a question and then she's just kind of quiet and she doesn't really say anything, so I'm

173
00:22:51.150 --> 00:23:06.870
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like she didn't hear me. And then if I repeat myself. She's like, I heard you. I heard you. I heard. Yeah, she's, she's kind of like a repetitive person to like she talks or says things she like kind of like overly repeats herself.

174
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: kind of annoying but

175
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:16.080
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Again, I think in she's also very shaky it's it's weird, but that could be something besides like drugs, I guess.

176
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:25.560
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She also jokes around a lot about drinking before work like. She says, Yeah, I just put a couple shots in my coffee and then

177
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:36.330
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: head out the door. I'm like, Are you freaking serious like you're just openly admitting to drinking before you come to work. I'm like, is that before or after you're driving like I don't

178
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:37.770
I got

179
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.630
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But I guess, to each their own, but

180
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They do good. You mentioned that to your boss.

181
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: About the drinking part. Yeah. Well, she knows she's she said that when he was around

182
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

183
00:23:53.550 --> 00:24:03.810
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't think like she could just be joking, but she's said it a few different times and even I'll even say something. I'm like, yeah, she probably puts clue. She's like, no, I put

184
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:12.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I forgot what she says she puts in it. I don't know what else would go good instead of coffee. I don't really know. I just think of like kalua because

185
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.970
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I think that's like coffee flavored

186
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.170
Yeah.

187
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

188
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's insane. And, you know, there's a piece of it to that says you know that if she's pointing the finger at you, she's hoping nobody's looking at her.

189
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:31.080
You know,

190
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:43.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that. I mean, your issue is the fact that, you know, you're struggling with sleep and getting on a regular schedule and, you know, nobody really knows the extent of what her issue is so

191
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. I would just be cautious and on guard.

192
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely is what I would do if I were you.

193
00:24:52.650 --> 00:25:01.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Know. So now, what I do is like when I'm at work and what I've kind of been doing. But now what I've really been doing is whenever she liked tries to

194
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.160
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: joke around with me or tries to talk to me and conversation with me. I'm just kind of quiet. I don't really

195
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:24.750
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like, I don't want to associate with her, especially now after she said that because, you know, I was like, once he told me that I was like I kind of was crying, but not really crying. I was trying to hold in my tears and not actually fully cry because I was hurt by it.

196
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:31.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And also just kind of like what he was saying to me to even though he's being really nice, but it just

197
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:39.810
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Just like the whole conversation. I just wanted to cry. So he's like I knew that I was like my eyes will probably watering up and stuff.

198
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:51.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Getting very far from each other. And when we were dying is like go why for softball, for crying. The bathroom or whatever you need to do and then get back out there, kind of thing so

199
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's a good thing.

200
00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:15.900
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: They said I needed obviously try to, you know, be more attentive, I think, is the word and you know like this is like my official verbal warning and then if I'm like, come and lead again or if it's more of like a what it was before. Then he will write me up kind of thing and

201
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:23.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Then on so forth. So I don't know how many write ups I could technically get but three

202
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:33.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah, this is yeah he hasn't even begun, so you know you've got you've got more leeway than you can then you even though

203
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And now that he's on board to give you a call in the morning and to help in this area. I've got, you're going to see a difference. And you're going to be there. You know what I mean, like, you're supposed to, you're going to get in that rhythm.

204
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the great part about it is that once you get in this rhythm all of your issues are done.

205
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's still got many

206
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Chef. Oh.

207
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.270
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Really like

208
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.960
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like I understand how she says she's stressed out and like I understand like curse.

209
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:20.250
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Whatever. She's kind of coming from, I guess in a way because of what she says that work because she's been she's still lives with her her ex, who's the father of her four kids and

210
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:28.920
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: The reason why they don't you know live in separate houses because housing is so freaking expensive for both of them. They can't live

211
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:43.200
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: With their own money like separately, you know by now for kids. And then you know the cost of EVERYTHING IS JUST SO EXPENSIVE IN SACRAMENTO or wherever they live. I think she says she lives in antelope, but still Sacramento.

212
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:43.980
Sacramento.

213
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.470
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Originally

214
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:55.260
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Around the time she was talking about moving to Oregon where she's from to live there, but

215
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:04.560
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I think housing and stuff like that is still, you know, cheap and stuff, but for him. The her ex husband.

216
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:21.000
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She like I guess he couldn't even live by himself, plus the whole thing with the kids and like where they would go because of them are still in school like he wouldn't be able to have his girls that are like 14 or whatever still

217
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:30.810
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: LIVE THERE AT HOME AND HIM, be able to afford all of that and she doesn't want to send him money and you know it's just a whole bunch of like drama and stuff and

218
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:38.670
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I remember when she first was kind of like talking about it and I asked her, or basically told her I was like

219
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:49.470
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Wow, that must be kind of messed up for the kids like you shouldn't really even though she's like in her 40s or whatever. I was kind of telling her what she already knows, of course, but like

220
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:58.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I feel like if you're like so mean to each other, like if me and my husband were separated or divorced or whatever.

221
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:09.570
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And we're being very like vicious towards each other and just fighting all the time and yelling like that damages a kid a lot worse than it is to split up in my opinion at least

222
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:21.300
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because you're like that's somebody that you used to love and that you grown up with to a point and then your parents just hate each other and hate each other's guts. I feel like it really affects kids.

223
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:30.450
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So it's like a really broken home I feel bad for kids and feel bad for her, in a way, but I mean I guess there's only so much you could really do so.

224
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's true, you know, and that is a very

225
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Weird toxic environment.

226
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and it is better to get away than it is to have the kids sit in in the arguments.

227
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.660
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, you know,

228
00:29:49.290 --> 00:30:00.330
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: X. I've even asked her, I was like, do you and your ex husband fight. She's like Oh hell yeah. It's like, gee, that's why she usually works a lot of overtime is because she hates going on.

229
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:15.330
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So that's, like, another thing is you're taking your time away from your kids too. So, you know, I mean, I know they're teenagers or whatever. But she's been having this job for like I think like four or five, six years, something like that. And it's like,

230
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:32.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She's been doing it, but I'm assuming for a while now for a few years. So, you know, I don't know what her ex husband does, but I think right now. He doesn't have a job. I think that's another main reason but she's planning on moving up to Oregon and like around the summertime.

231
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.080
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So,

232
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

233
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:45.750
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: That she was talking about because I guess she's doing two jobs now she's doing something that's like more like

234
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:52.740
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I think later in the night or like on the weekends or something, I don't know exactly what it is, but

235
00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:04.140
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She's doing something and she's trying to save up all this money so she could move and she was talking about finding another job if she's not able to move and I asked her why

236
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:13.800
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And she just says she's basically sick and tired of like she loves a job or whatever, it can be stressful and she does take on a lot at work, but she

237
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.850
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She's just tired of like the company that we work for, you know, for the government for the veterans and

238
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:32.610
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It's all about numbers. She said it was something like politically something and I was like what are you talking about, and I was like, What do you mean, and she said, it's all about the numbers. It's not about the care.

239
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:43.110
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Sounds like yeah that is really true. That's one of the things I hate about the VA is there's no care. I mean, there is a little bit care they say that they care but

240
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:57.990
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like when I used to work at the call center. They want you to like answer a phone and have a call only be three minutes. It's like, how are you able supposed to, or like how are you supposed to schedule.

241
00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: An appointment.

242
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.770
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And figure out what this patient needs and, you know, a lot of these people don't know what they're calling about or they

243
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:12.990
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Have mentioned like they're all, at least in their 70s AND AGE, I feel like. So it's like how to, how could you

244
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.200
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: help somebody in three minutes, you can't

245
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.140
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Know me. I'm always going the extra mile. That's another thing about Monica. She's like,

246
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:29.910
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You shouldn't be doing all that work like she basically tells me that I shouldn't be overly like she says I'm overly helpful.

247
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:39.270
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Or helping or whatever it is. And it's like, that's just how I am like if I was in their shoes, especially after I'm done, helping somebody

248
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:47.040
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: They're like thank you so, so much. Because usually, people will do this and that and no i don't get anywhere. Nobody helps me

249
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:56.310
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like, I feel bad for all these people. So it's like the golden rule that people say like you treat people the other though you treat people the way that you'd want to be treated.

250
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So that's just what I'm trying to do. I'm just trying to do the best that I really can. And that's another reason why my boss likes me is because he's a veteran himself so

251
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.840
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: He sees that I'm really, really helpful. And I'm willing to learn new things and

252
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.670
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, so

253
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.370
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't know. But anyways, it was talking way too much about somebody else and not me. So

254
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:35.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. But just know you know just sit back and watch. You know what I mean. And you have every right to be heard and technically your boss PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU THAT SHE SAID THAT

255
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

256
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that causes that barrier.

257
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

258
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:53.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so he probably shouldn't have told you that i mean i think it's it's kind of cool that he did, but in the same sense, what was the use of it, other than

259
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hurting. No, no.

260
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:07.440
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I think because I've told him in the past when or, you know, like, since I started and people were all like, how come she gets extra break. She's out there, smoking cigarettes and blah, blah, blah, blah.

261
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:16.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Or how come she is to do that. Is she putting in her time for, you know, taking this blah, blah, blah. You know, like, people just being nosy are wondering

262
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:31.710
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: At for my appointments and stuff. And it's like, it's knowing your business. But I told him I was like, I just wish people would instead of just coming to my boss, like just, you know, either asked me, or, you know, let me know.

263
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:41.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Instead of going to somebody else and like, I mean, I understand. I'm going to somebody else, because they're not confrontational or

264
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:52.500
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Whatever it is, but I feel like I'm such an understanding person where it's like if you'd be like, hey, can you please help me with this I will freakin help you don't go to my boss and say, Oh, she doesn't do anything.

265
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, as

266
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.010
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It tries to make me look bad, you know,

267
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:08.160
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, just, I just wish people are more upfront with me and I told him I was like, I just wish I knew who was seeing all this stuff about me that I'm you know doing or not doing so I think just

268
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.750
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Letting me know that she said, that kind of thing. So that way I was aware, kind of thing. I don't know.

269
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:16.740
Yeah.

270
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you'll definitely be on guard a little bit with her from now on.

271
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:21.690
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah.

272
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:27.450
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't buster. So, I mean, it really trust her before so I definitely don't trust her.

273
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, understandable.

274
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable. Um, what about used to going to meetings. Yep.

275
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What meetings are you going to

276
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:46.530
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I, I just go on to. I think it's called na stuff, whatever that website is there's a 24 hour one

277
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:57.510
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: On zoom, of course, and like pretty much whenever I drive to go drop off Kilian I listened to it. And then I turn it off.

278
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:14.790
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And then, you know, put them inside and deal with them for a couple of minutes, whatever it is. And then whenever I drive to work. I listened to it on my lunch I listen to it on my way home. I listened to it and then like after my shower. You know, like I listened to it a lot.

279
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:27.150
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, and I share every once in a while, but usually there's so many people like what their hands up. There's usually in where did the smallest I've ever seen amount of people was probably about like 170

280
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:35.430
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: People. Wow. But usually, and I think the highest I've ever seen was like to 60 seconds. There's a lot of people on there.

281
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then a lot of people

282
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:52.230
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And when people are sharing this I don't really count but it looks like there might be like 15 to 20 people maybe though this morning when I was driving to work. I saw two or three people's hands up, but I was driving and I wasn't going to share so

283
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool.

284
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just learned how to put the hand up.

285
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really yeah I never knew how to put the hand up and zoom. I just learned that this week.

286
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.110
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It's funny.

287
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:10.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I it's funny, and it's cute, that the little hand stays up there like pick me, pick me, pick me

288
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean the we've got all these other things down here but emojis reactions.

289
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:24.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. But yeah, I had no idea that there was more over here. And that you can put your hand up. Yeah.

290
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.490
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Because they kind of lighting.

291
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.860
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: up or thumbs down or something.

292
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, it's really kind of cool.

293
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you still in contact with Lauren

294
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:42.060
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, I talked to her. Maybe like once a week or so she like she messaged me. Oh, she messaged me

295
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:49.830
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yesterday before group and then she messaged me a little later today. And I started typing but

296
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:58.410
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: While I'm working. That's probably like another thing. Like, I don't want somebody to bitch about me is she's always on her phone texting are always on her phone, blah, blah.

297
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:06.000
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, and it's like 99% of the time I'm messaging, my husband, asking them, like where are you, how are you doing, where you are.

298
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:18.450
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know what time is it there fan of thing because I was curious of how, like, I think the farthest he went where it was still only two hours was, I think it was either Minnesota or Missouri.

299
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:19.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

300
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:26.520
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: It's still only two hours. I was like, that seems so far you I thought it would be like a three hour difference. Instead, two hours.

301
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.270
But

302
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.700
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: But

303
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not yet. The cut offs, a little bit farther over

304
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.500
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Just a little bit.

305
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I

306
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:41.250
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: was beginning to texture and then I haven't missed it. I haven't finished it. But thanks for reminding me.

307
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay. So have you checked out women for sobriety yet.

308
00:38:47.790 --> 00:39:02.580
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: No, I think I, I think I was trying to look at it through Google while back when I was trying to get into the virtual remember when I was telling you how I was trying to get into it. I couldn't really figure anything out kind of stuff or find anything so

309
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:13.470
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Is that the one where it's not as spiritual or it's not as religious kind of thing. Yeah, that's good to kind of look out

310
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it focuses a lot on what we go through as women.

311
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really pretty amazing. I kind of dove into it a little bit today and

312
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because when I find stuff like that. I want to know. I'm like,

313
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm interested. Yeah, women for sobriety is what it is and and i think that the thing that amazed me about it was they don't do step work.

314
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their level the levels.

315
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.440
Yeah.

316
00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let me see if I can

317
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Share this with you but I found their levels.

318
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their levels, it's it's weird for me to get that concept, but so it's women for sobriety New Life program. Right. And I am to get my glasses on and they do except acceptance statements which helps a lot with self esteem.

319
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So these are acceptance statements that what they recommend is that you take these you either download them or you print them off and have them up somewhere.

320
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it just talks about the self defeating thoughts that we have a lot of times the first one of course is

321
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About your disease. We've all accepted the fact that we're addicts right that's already a piece that pieces done I now take charge of my life and my well being. I accept the responsibility which you have right

322
00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The second one negative thoughts destroy only myself, my first conscious sober act is to reduce negativity in my life.

323
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.870
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Mm hmm.

324
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Happiness is a habit I am developing happiness is created not waiting for

325
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:19.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Problems bother me only to the degree I permit it. And I now better understand my problems. I do not permit problems to overwhelm me

326
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am what I think I am capable, competent caring, compassionate woman.

327
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Life can be ordinary or it can be great greatness is is mine by a conscious effort.

328
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And love can change the course of my world caring is all important.

329
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The fundamental object of life is emotional and spiritual growth daily I put my life into A into a proper order knowing which of the priorities.

330
00:41:48.600 --> 00:42:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which are the priorities. The past is gone forever no longer am I victimized by the past. I'm a new woman all love gives returns. I am learning to know that I'm loved enthusiasm is my daily exercise I treasure the moments of my new life.

331
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am a competent woman and I have much to give life. This is what I am, and I shall know it always I am responsible for myself and my actions. I'm in charge in my mind my thoughts in my life. And so you can print them or you can print them out.

332
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, they're really positive affirmations that my gosh, I think all of us should be reading every morning.

333
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To start a new day to have these things in your head and know that you know everything's gonna be okay you know life is going to be good.

334
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then those are the acceptance in the art. I mean, every piece of this acceptance statements level of levels of recovery and then articles, you can get a lot of information through them a lot of

335
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:59.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Negative thought process changes right is what we're after.

336
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:07.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The one that I like the most is Level two level one again is accepting that you have a disorder.

337
00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Level two and discarding negative thoughts putting guilt behind and practicing new ways of viewing and solving problems.

338
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so this really feels like where

339
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Most of the work, a lot of the work goes, because you're changing your thought process you're changing. You know how you

340
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How you view things so self destructive at this stage, we must also recognize the distorted negative and self destructive patterns we have developed and resolve to change.

341
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This levels difficult and take some time. Also during a later period of stress, we may need to return to these exercises.

342
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:59.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or review any level. This is not a matter of failure, but an opportunity to grow and change against any time of crisis, it could be anything could be in crisis in your life. It could be something that's going on that you don't know how to handle, you know,

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.180
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Leaving Friday morning.

374
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:24.360
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I don't know if I explained it. I think I did in group yesterday but Saturday.

375
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:32.100
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like I went out to go swimming and stuff. And I thought that was the reason why I overslept but Sunday morning, I was supposed to

376
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.180
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Sorry, I think they're doing a drug deal over there.

377
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Now the cars driving away.

378
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.640
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Anyway, um,

379
00:46:47.040 --> 00:47:00.450
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So Saturday I flew. Okay. No. Okay. So, Sunday, which I was supposed to wake up early to do the podcast to like go over the outline and, you know, because I asked her name is Dr. Kurtz Esther if

380
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:13.350
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like how far back. She wants me to go, you know, how's it really supposed to be like, because, you know, like she gave me like the name for podcast of how

381
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:21.060
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know she's I guess you can get the feel of it or what she said the vibe. So like, okay, and

382
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:43.740
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I listened to it but it. There's nothing about like people talking about you know sobriety or, you know, addiction or anything. It's more of doctors or nurses stories about being like, one of them was like being in a maternity ward or something and somebody else was talking about how

383
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:53.340
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: You know, he's a doctor and he's like exposed to people coronavirus he's like ER doctor or something and his

384
00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:10.980
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: His partner. He's really susceptible to getting sick. And I guess he had, you know, so it's like those kind of stories. It's nothing about like addiction or being clean. So for me, it's kind of hard to base off what I should say from those stories that

385
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:11.640
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Other people

386
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:24.780
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Will because of doctors and nurses perspective, it's not like a normal person like normal, you know, a non physician or health care worker in that sense, you know. So to me it's kind of different, so

387
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:33.630
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I went to bed at midnight, and I thought like, oh yeah, you know, I'll just set my alarm for eight hours, and I'll wake up around 839 o'clock.

388
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:53.250
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And I turned off both of my alarms because I thought that I'd be able to sleep for eight hours and then wake up and I I slip through the alarms and I wake up until like 1130 or so. So I she messaged me and actually her Texas. What woke me up and

389
00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:00.420
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: She's like, Hey, I just want to see how things are going and she's really cool and very chill. She's like,

390
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:12.330
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Yeah, it's all up to you. We could do whatever you know she's very easy going so I just told her I was like, Sorry I plan on waking up early and my son I specifically have my mom and my step mom watch

391
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:32.190
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: My kid, so that way I could wake up early and not be bothered by you know him, asking Who's that. Who's that. Who's that is that daddy. You know, so I overslept with that and I was also going to cut my other agents hair because she had surgery this past Monday yesterday and so

392
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.350
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like I felt like

393
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:39.210
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Saturday or Sunday was just a bill waste so

394
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:58.410
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So Friday morning. This upcoming Friday morning. I'm going to do the outline for the podcast, hopefully, at least, and because she has something to do at 11 o'clock, so after I've been with her. Then I'll be gone. Until about Tuesday afternoon, and then all

395
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.790
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: will drive back down to Sacramento and then I have an appointment, a one on one with Dr. Allah DAG on

396
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:07.860
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: 330 so

397
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:17.370
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Perfect, yeah. And then talking about appointments. When I spoke to ICO she said that I didn't have any appointments set up with you for next week. Oh.

398
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I gotta, I just go in and do it myself or either

399

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, let me just go in and do it really fast.

403
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:11.070
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Oh, and then also tomorrow I'm doing like a research study thing.

404
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:18.720
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Or whatever. And one of my cousins great cousins, I think it is.

405
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:28.590
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Probably about 10 or 11 years ago, she asked me, she's like, hey, you go to beauty school like

406
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:35.910
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: There's this research study about like hair, hair care products or whatever. Would you be interested in. And I was like, we're talking about

407
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:46.560
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And she told me about this place called Elliot Benson and it's like a research where like I've done some for like lottery tickets and the radio and it's just a place that

408
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:57.120
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: They just want your opinion and want to know if they should keep certain songs on the radio or what lottery tickets look the best. You know that that will sell better or more of

409
00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:04.350
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: And then they pay you. I think this the short the smallest amount of money I've ever gotten was like maybe 100 bucks but

410
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.500
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Only between like one

411
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:28.080
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: Like 125 up to like 200 like 200 is the most I've ever gotten but there's some that are like 500 but those are for people that are more of like you know people that own businesses or, you know, software programs like things that are way out of my my scope, basically. So

412
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:34.920
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: I'll be doing that, tomorrow, I'll be getting off work a little bit early, so that way I can do that before I pick up the alien

413
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.850
Kiara O’Neil-Dominguez: So nice and 35 bucks, which will be nice.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

542
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:17.280

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:00.750
iPhone: You know,

552
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:09.210

621
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's all

622
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:48.120
iPhone: You're doing is asking questions. And what that does is get the subject to start thinking and then eventually, in some cases, the subject comes back and says, Wow, I thought about this and it was a revelation, and now I see my world in different view.

623
01:11:49.380 --> 01:12:01.110
iPhone: Because you can't argue with someone to get them to change your worldview, but you can get them to ask questions and hear their own answers and then they can think in their own mind. What are these answers are you giving making any sense, you know,

624
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:06.840
iPhone: Pretty amazing. I think you should interview, Tom. This

625
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.010
iPhone: Interview, everybody. I'm going to walk down the street and view interviewing people

626
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the one I like is Joe Rogan

627
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:24.990
iPhone: Yeah. Joe rogan's good, but the street epistemology, you'd like it. I'm telling you, and it seems Anthony at a manta Bosco or something like that and

628
01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:34.470
iPhone: you'd really like what he does and but he sticks mostly to religion and I want to go way beyond that. I'm going to go to

629
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:49.770
iPhone: Everything in people's lives that they're believing in that may not be true. So not just religion, but also you know we are being programmed by the media to hate people of the opposite political party.

630
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

631
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:55.590
iPhone: And we need to bring those things out and discuss those two and have a discussion.

632
01:12:55.950 --> 01:13:02.790
iPhone: Because the powers that be seem to feel that we need to be a divided nation. And really, we don't need to be

633
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.280
iPhone: Anyways,

iPhone: And got stopped that night. She's never ever done anything back

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:13.920
iPhone: She got out of it. Her husband did seven years.
