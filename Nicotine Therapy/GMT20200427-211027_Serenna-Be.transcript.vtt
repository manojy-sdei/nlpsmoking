00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.040
Dottie Newton: Justice for I'm at pain management.

Dottie Newton: Okay, yeah, that's, yeah. I've got my next appointment with Dr fig. I need to talk to him, I, I'm not liking. Not at all. It's not working for me.

21
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.510
Dottie Newton: No, no.

22
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.530
Serenna Beers: Is it side effects is, does it not, is it not working because it's not strong enough, or it's

23
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:47.670
Dottie Newton: Not I'm the pain is ridiculous. It's not help me at all. It has helped me with getting off of the

24
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.310
Dottie Newton: oxy code down

25
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.000
Serenna Beers: Okay.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.430
Dottie Newton: You know, I don't have any

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:03.330
Dottie Newton: Side effects or, you know, coming down off of this, the oxy but as far as

28
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.510
Dottie Newton: You know, pain management as it's doing nothing.

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.170
Serenna Beers: Can I ask you what milligram that you're on.

30
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.230
Dottie Newton: Ooh, yeah.

31
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.130
Dottie Newton: You can ask me, I have to get up together.

32
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:33.870
Serenna Beers: All right, I could probably just just just looking. Your turn. I just wondered, you know, obviously I'm not a doctor, so I can't talk to you about any type of anything with meds. I just wondered if you were on a lighthouse or something and

33
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.690
Dottie Newton: That's it right here.

34
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.690
Dottie Newton: Is this right

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.800
Dottie Newton: Eight dash two. What is that

37
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.310
Serenna Beers: Well, I know that so Suboxone comes in in various tabs or, or, I don't know if your tabs or a film.

38
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.590
Dottie Newton: And it's a tablet, I, I see what it is now. It's an I can't pronounce this at all.

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.090
Dottie Newton: Superman. Superman.

40
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.730
Dottie Newton: And now Lux now likes

41
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.050
Serenna Beers: Hmm, I

42
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.960
Dottie Newton: The EU PR E on

43
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.220
buprenorphine.

44
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.060
Dottie Newton: Slash na li x

45
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.800
Serenna Beers: Okay, it's buprenorphine which is just another term for the Suboxone

46
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:55.290
Serenna Beers: I just wondered, you know, if I am glad that you're going to be able to see Doc, Doc. Dr fig because I am sure that he will work with with you.

47
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.190
Serenna Beers: Around what whatever that next course of action is because it takes time, especially, you know,

48
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:20.910
Serenna Beers: When you're dealing with pain management. I mean, it's kind of like you're gonna play with it until you find something that does take that away, you know, until something does work well with your system. So I'm I am really glad to hear that you're going to be able to meet with him. I'm

49
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.340
Serenna Beers: Right, I am meeting with you. Have you ever done a bio cycles social before

50
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.680
Dottie Newton: I don't know what that

51
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.250
Serenna Beers: Okay, so then maybe not so I just ask you a bunch of

52
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:46.230
Serenna Beers: Questions that you've probably answered in some way, shape, or form, but I'm going to try to make it as painless as I can. And basically this just gives me an idea. I apologize, but these these headsets really make my ear rich

53
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.430
Dottie Newton: That's all.

54
00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:02.400
Serenna Beers: They are very firm on your ears because for HIPAA. So they're noise cancelling so nobody around me. Even if you talk really loud can hear outside my little headset, but they're very snug.

55
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:13.050
Serenna Beers: Anyway, and so I'm going to ask you, just some questions just about your background, what brings you to bright heart health, which is actually what we'll start, start with, even though I know

56
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:24.240
Serenna Beers: It's your chronic pain. I want to know specifically the story. So what precipitating event has happened that led you to need chronic pain management.

57
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.540
Serenna Beers: And then I'll ask you a series of other ones after that.

58
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.090
Dottie Newton: Okay, I'm

59
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.990
Dottie Newton: Going back to 1919 2014

60
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.280

Dottie Newton: Four.

62
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.950
Dottie Newton: knee surgeries and one shoulder surgery and I started oxy code on them.

63
00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:13.080
Dottie Newton: And my doctor in Denver was prescribing. Well, not the surgeon, but my family doctor was prescribing Alex ICO down for me and moved here to Denver in July I hooked up with

64
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:23.250
Dottie Newton: Jane Jacobson as my primary care physician and she was, she was prescribing oxycodone

65
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.410
Dottie Newton: I'm not sure.

66
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.320
Dottie Newton: What made her

67
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:42.510
Dottie Newton: Tell me, she wasn't going to prescribe oxy for me anymore, and she wanted me to see pain management clinic.

68
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.690
Dottie Newton: Mm hmm. Um, I do have

69
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.600
Dottie Newton: An excuse me history of alcoholism.

70
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.440
Dottie Newton: So I know

71
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.790
Dottie Newton: And that bothered her

72
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.920
Dottie Newton: Sure. I'm sorry. This Suboxone dries me

73
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.540
Serenna Beers: I'm gosh

74
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.460

For saying

78
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.120
Serenna Beers: That

79
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.160
Dottie Newton: Yeah, so she she wanted me to go to the pain clinic.

Dottie Newton: Mm hmm. The only other pain clinic. She knew of was and

81
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.870
Dottie Newton: Where was it

82
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.900
Dottie Newton: Was about two and a half hours from here.

83
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.940
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. I

84
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.460

Dottie Newton: Yeah.

91
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:22.290
Serenna Beers: I can do everything in the comfort of your own home because it genuinely is is difficult for some folks to leave and especially now more than ever with everything that's kind of transpiring in our just in our world.

92
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.880
Serenna Beers: Right, it's

93
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.140
Serenna Beers: You know, I can't even imagine if you didn't have this place.

94
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.960
Dottie Newton: Yeah, this is great. So

95
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.240

Okay.

101
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:22.920
Serenna Beers: What about, do you have any sort of history with suicidal ideation. Have you ever wanted to harm yourself or anyone else. And these, I apologize if they feel intrusive, but their questions. I need to ask

Dottie Newton: My brother and I never

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.150
Dottie Newton: Ever

117
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.070
Dottie Newton: And

118
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.250
Dottie Newton: She will be 90 years old this year.

119
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.460
Dottie Newton: And she's in an assisted living facility now.

120
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.320
Dottie Newton: I'm

121
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.390
Dottie Newton: And I don't care.

122
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.110
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

123
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.270
Dottie Newton: We just don't. There was not anything

124
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.020
Dottie Newton: You know, there was never any

125
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.110
Dottie Newton: What am I trying to say.

126
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.260
Dottie Newton: Is it nobody heard each other in the house, you know, man.

127
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.000
Dottie Newton: Nobody smacked anybody around anything like that.

128
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.300
Serenna Beers: Sometimes emotional abuses, the hardest over physical abuse.

129
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.500
Serenna Beers: So in your

130
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:12.960
Serenna Beers: For one, I wouldn't judge, anything that you were to share with with me. We all come with our stories and our pain from our past. And so I just want to preface it with but that I'm I'm definitely not here to

131
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:23.610
Serenna Beers: Judge your mom or to judge you. I mean, shoot. If you knew the skeletons in my backyard. You would you might not think I was a good therapist, but then they say some of the

132
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.200
Serenna Beers: Best therapists need therapy. Right. I mean, because we comes with experience.

133
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.120
Serenna Beers: But what I'm saying is, is I don't want you to invalidate

134
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.930
Serenna Beers: what transpired in your home as a child, just because it wasn't

135
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:49.950
Serenna Beers: That bad, you know, because we can go there and that's our way of you naturally will protect her even though the you guys are estranged you will naturally protect her because that's

136
00:12:50.220 --> 00:13:00.210
Serenna Beers: She was your caretaker. I mean, that's just it's embedded in you, whether you like it or not, but in in order for you to heal from this

137
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:18.690
Serenna Beers: It's going to take you not minimizing it. You know what I mean. So, as you say, well, she never hit me or anything like like that. Hopefully over some time when you get to know me. Maybe you'll be able to share about the ways that it does impact you. And the reason I say that is because

138
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:31.170
Serenna Beers: Here you are. And you're shocked. I just asked you, What was your family life like and you couldn't hardly form a sentence. So, now tell me that doesn't impact you.

139
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.180
Serenna Beers: Know what I mean.

140
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.720
Dottie Newton: And I know I know it does.

141
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.610
Dottie Newton: I know facts me

142
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.320
Dottie Newton: And I, I wish I could do it all over again.

143
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.770
Serenna Beers: Well,

144
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:58.350
Serenna Beers: Hopefully you'll let me work with you to change the just to tweak the way you think a little bit because obviously

145
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.070
Serenna Beers: We

146
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:09.600
Serenna Beers: Can never go backwards. But what about changing from here on out. I don't know about you, but once I hit 50 all of a sudden life became more precious to me.

147
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:21.720
Serenna Beers: I know I'm closer to death than I am life and with that thought. It's like guy have one chance to to be my best version of me. Whatever that

148
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:29.700
Serenna Beers: Looks like if that mean I have to cry and stop my feet like a little kid to get out all my pain from when I was a kid. If I have to release my inner

149
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:51.780
Serenna Beers: Child and let her throw a fit just so I could step into my adult self and be a better woman to my kids to my dad to my sisters. I don't have a man, but like, you know, like I we have to be able to heal and it's never too late for that is what my point is, is so

150
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.460
Dottie Newton: I won't hear it's I'm done. Hmm.

151
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.660
Serenna Beers: Maybe you may never forget.

152
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.150
Serenna Beers: But do you know the difference between forgive and forget

153
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.810
Serenna Beers: It's not a trick question. I swear.

154
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.070
Serenna Beers: When you forgive

155
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:38.340
Serenna Beers: It's never about them. It's never about them and so many people think that you have to in order to forget, you have to forgive. But the reality is, is we never forget our memories, our memories.

156
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:47.040
Serenna Beers: But in order to forgive is how you heal because when you forgive. You're taking yourself down off the hook, you're, you're, you're

157
00:15:47.340 --> 00:16:00.840
Serenna Beers: pulling yourself up off from off the cross, because you're the one who's sitting up there and pain. You're the one who's suffering. When you forgive you don't do it for them. You do it for you. And in forgiving.

158
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:14.370
Serenna Beers: It becomes less painful the hurt is still there, but the forgiveness is the release and it's the sir render. And I say that because

159
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.860
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

160
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.990
Serenna Beers: I let the anger towards my dad almost take take me out.

161
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:33.540
Serenna Beers: I was so angry with him because I couldn't understand him, you know, how could you not show me love. How could you be so emotionally abusive how go. How could you not be there for me.

162
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:43.230
Serenna Beers: How come you worked and never ever came home and when you were home I felt like I was a burden that that was the message that I got, I had a soul wound of you didn't love me enough

163
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.540
Serenna Beers: So then, of course, I carry that into my

164
00:16:45.810 --> 00:17:00.030
Serenna Beers: Relationships into my marriages I screw those up I screw up stuff with my kid, you know how it goes. So for you to say that you won't heal or there's no getting past this.

165
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.480
Serenna Beers: Actually there is

166
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:10.110
Serenna Beers: Moving on. But again, I'm not saying that you're going to forget it, all I'm saying.

167
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:30.750
Serenna Beers: There you can actually heal from emotional trauma, at least so that it's not affecting you in the way that that it does. Obviously at this point and and I'm not saying that you cry every day. But wouldn't it be great to get to a place when you talk about stuff that

168
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:37.770
Serenna Beers: It doesn't leave a frog inside your throat and you feel more at peace with it.

169
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.340
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

170
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.140
Dottie Newton: Yeah, that'd be great.

171
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.620
Dottie Newton: But yeah, I

172
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.060
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

173
00:17:49.710 --> 00:18:00.660
Serenna Beers: I mean that's way farther down the road. I'm not sure how long that you are with us, but I do know that we usually like for folks to meet with their therapist at least twice twice a month.

174
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.450
Serenna Beers: And so if you're, you know, open to that.

175
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.280
Serenna Beers: If nothing else, you know, I think, I think for you.

176
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:19.740
Serenna Beers: There's a lot of that childhood pain that that's there and I haven't even heard, even in a piece of it yet.

177
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.480
Dottie Newton: I decided that

178
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.010
Serenna Beers: You can't even talk about it.

179
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.420
Dottie Newton: Oh, I can talk about it.

180
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.890
Serenna Beers: Well, and you know that it affects your chronic pain to

181
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.150
Dottie Newton: Then I could believe my Yeah, she is.

182
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.880
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

183
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.760
Dottie Newton: Never ever could. I DO ANYTHING RIGHT FOR THAT WOMAN.

184
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.210
Dottie Newton: Maybe I could believe

185
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.370
Serenna Beers: emotional trauma exacerbates physical pain.

186
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.450
Dottie Newton: Need drugs.

187
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:30.240
Serenna Beers: Or, well how about a combination of medication assistance and maybe try and try and work through some of this stuff. And I'm not saying to to do it in this setting, but I'm just saying.

188
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.420
Serenna Beers: For you, for me to ask you the question that I that I did.

189
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:44.310
Serenna Beers: dotty and you have such a and for you to become activated as quickly as you did.

190
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:55.680
Serenna Beers: Honestly told me personally, all I need to know about the best way that I hope, hopefully can work with you and work through some of this stuff because

191
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:06.990
Serenna Beers: Again, this is your time in your life where it's supposed to be about you and you're supposed to be happy, right, at least be maybe not happy joyous

192
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:12.000
Serenna Beers: And free, but at least be free, you know, and you don't need the guilt.

193
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:25.140
Serenna Beers: Eventually because eventually you you won't have her here, and I know you say that you don't care. And maybe you don't care, but somebody who feels that kind of pain is because she has compassion.

194
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.650
Dottie Newton: Who, me or hurt.

195
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.270
Serenna Beers: You

196
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:49.380
Serenna Beers: You. So whether you want to say, I don't care. Obviously, you obviously do care. And so this really is about you being able to heal so that you don't carry around guilt of any more coulda woulda coulda woulda coulda woulda should as anymore already have

197
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.220
You know, yeah.

198
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.140
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

199
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.360
Serenna Beers: So we don't have to dive into it because it's, it sounds like it's pretty

200
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:05.550
Serenna Beers: Comes with a lot of pain. So we can work through this as time goes on, but just in a nutshell share with me this.

201
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.520
Serenna Beers: Were you raised growing up with mom and dad or just mom or

202
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.020
Serenna Beers: Mom and stepdad okay

203
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.330
Dottie Newton: Yeah.

204
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.640
Serenna Beers: And you have brothers and sisters

205
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.910
Dottie Newton: two older brothers. I'm younger sister.

206
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.750
Serenna Beers: Okay.

207
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:27.300
Serenna Beers: Did anybody in in your in your household ever struggle with mental health or

208
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:36.480
Serenna Beers: Substance abuse or gambling or any other type of addictive type of be yours or anything like that. Okay.

209
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.880
Dottie Newton: Yeah, everything was good.

210
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.340
Dottie Newton: Yeah, my dad. My dad died when I was 23

211
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.600
Okay.

212
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.320
Serenna Beers: Have you ever

213
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.480
Serenna Beers: Process that

214
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.040
Dottie Newton: No.

215
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.530
Dottie Newton: Okay, I'm 61 years old and I cannot deal with that.

216
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:01.860
Serenna Beers: Okay.

217
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.890
Dottie Newton: And I, and I'm telling you this. I've never told anybody else, but I think

218
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.860
Dottie Newton: Why was it that my mother.

219
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.260
Dottie Newton: And

220
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.350
Dottie Newton: Why is my dad's daughter.

221
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.980
Dottie Newton: And I know you have to go up. I'm

222
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.840
Serenna Beers: Fine.

223
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.460
Serenna Beers: That's a very real thought

224
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.370
Serenna Beers: But as it

225
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:44.190
Serenna Beers: Certainly, I mean, I'm not surprised or shocked.

226
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.520
Serenna Beers: And I say that because

227
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.240
Serenna Beers: Pain like that is

228
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:09.480
Serenna Beers: I understand pain like that. I didn't lose a parent at 23 I lost my mom at age eight and I didn't even process that until I was 36 years old.

229
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:23.310
Serenna Beers: Oh no, that's okay, but it it impacted my life, hence why I got into this field. I was right where you're at, sitting, not on the couch, but on a boat on a chair across from

230
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:35.940
Serenna Beers: A therapist and she said, If you don't deal with your grief around the loss of your mother, you will never move for for for for forward in your life. And I was 36 years old at the time.

231
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.260
And I thought,

232
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:48.210
Serenna Beers: I'm never going to heal from this, I really believe that just like you. I really believed I was not going to heal from it and she proved me wrong.

233
00:23:48.720 --> 00:24:11.100
Serenna Beers: And I used to think the same way about my dad. He was the emotionally abusive one. My mom was a loving the nurturing one she made she made me feel like everything was going to be okay all the time. My dad even to this day. And he's still alive. He's Henri as hell mean I love them but

234
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.380
Serenna Beers: I thought, gosh.

235
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.170
Serenna Beers: What if, and I've, I've had those thoughts. So I just want to

236
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.540
Serenna Beers: Nor not normalize it for you so you don't beat yourself up. Okay.

237
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:36.690
Serenna Beers: That's a very normal way. That's one way of, you know, expressing the way that you feel. And so after all this time, though, see what's

238
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:52.620
Serenna Beers: What's going to happen is, eventually, it kind of starts to bubble up. So for you, it's probably I would imagine. Imagine it increases your chronic pain probably has an impact on some depression, maybe a little bit. Yeah, okay.

239
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.030
Dottie Newton: Oh, yeah.

240
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.900
Serenna Beers: Okay.

241
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.090
Dottie Newton: I said, I've been

242
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.860
Dottie Newton: Taking depression medication for almost ever, it seems

243
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.470
Serenna Beers: Sarah anything that genuinely makes you smile. I mean, like where you do it.

244
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.300
Serenna Beers: And mile

245
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.510
Dottie Newton: Or dog.

246
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.200
Serenna Beers: Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me.

247
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.570
Serenna Beers: Dogs are like there are there are there are people right

248
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:31.170
What

249
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.690
Serenna Beers: Is your dog more of an emotional pet like the girl or boy.

250
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.660
Dottie Newton: It's a boy.

251
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:43.860
Dottie Newton: What

252
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.240
Serenna Beers: Type of dog.

253
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:53.850
Dottie Newton: Well, gotten from the shelter, because I'm just all about taking them from shelters and not

254
00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.200
By

255
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.460
Serenna Beers: What type of dog is it

256
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:08.400
Dottie Newton: I don't know. I think as I've as part Chihuahua and part something else sure what it is.

257
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.440
Serenna Beers: What is your pups name.

258
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.620
Dottie Newton: We

259
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.360
Dottie Newton: Well, we got name.

260
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.510
Dottie Newton: He was already named

261
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.890
Dottie Newton: Sean sh. A W and re are he

262
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.630
Dottie Newton: Shall we thought

263
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.600
Dottie Newton: We thought that it's that it sounded to us like a French name.

264
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.750
Dottie Newton: He went unanswered anything else. So that's cool.

265
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:54.750
Serenna Beers: Okay, so your dog make makes you smile. Is there anything that you like to do, whether it's reading or taking a walk.

266
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.050
Dottie Newton: No, no.

267
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.550
Dottie Newton: No, I just bought some

268
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:11.220
Dottie Newton: pencils and paper. I thought I might want to get back into draw like that I did in high school, but

269
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.920
Dottie Newton: No.

270
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.880
Serenna Beers: Have you ever just sat and drew just how you felt

271
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:22.740
Dottie Newton: You know,

272
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:38.040
Serenna Beers: That's very interesting to to do because when you are art affects a different part of the brain. And I, gosh, I have it on my fridge. I have left brain and right brain on my friends and I want to say.

273
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:49.380
Serenna Beers: right brain is the crafty one gosh it's it's on my fridge and red and blue. And it tells you all the the different things, but

274
00:27:49.740 --> 00:28:01.620
Serenna Beers: When you draw it accesses a different part of your brain to process emotions versus when you talk talk therapy and art. They're an art therapy do different types of things. So

275
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:14.490
Serenna Beers: While you and I talk right right now. This would be what you call traditional talk therapy. Then when you draw. It's very, it's very good for those people who have suppressed emotions. Hence,

276
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:23.280
Serenna Beers: What you have done for years. You just kind of keep stuffing it down and it's coming out because our body keeps the score and I say this every person I work with

277
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:36.540
Serenna Beers: The amount of trauma, you hold you hold inside of your body, it has to come out. It can't stay in there. It's not physically POP POP possible eventually it's too much. So you get

278
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.070
Serenna Beers: These pain, you get headaches, you get depression, you get stomach eggs you get

279
00:28:42.390 --> 00:29:02.430
Serenna Beers: Sinus stuff you get. I mean, there's all kinds of things that where your body starts to expel so another form. If you can't process it by talking about it, you sit and in your mind as you draw your prop you're processing your emotions which helps to restore

280
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:15.150
Serenna Beers: The emotion reg motion regulation which oftentimes I mean that's that's what goes right so once you start to stuff and stuff. And stuff you can no longer

281
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.950
Serenna Beers: One probably feel emotions, except for add an extreme so like it's

282
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:35.790
Serenna Beers: You'll go along and you won't cry or you won't get upset for like a week and all. And all of a sudden someone asks you a question, and you're like the Niagara Falls, like all everything just bought bothers you. Right. Everything is an over abundance

283
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.480
Serenna Beers: And that's because your body needs to get it out.

284
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:46.410
Serenna Beers: So my suggestion to you until we meet again, even if you

285
00:29:48.330 --> 00:30:00.090
Serenna Beers: I want you to commit to one, just one drawing that you might be willing to share with with me for next time and you're simply going to just sit down with your sketch pad or whatever.

286
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.140
Serenna Beers: And you're not going to overthink it. And you're literally just going to

287
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:15.060
Serenna Beers: Kind of just center yourself. Look at your pad, whether it's with the pencil pin those cute little gel pens crayons, whatever you use and literally just

288
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:21.120
Serenna Beers: Don't think just do and let your brain do all the work. And as you draw

289
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:29.100
Serenna Beers: Just think about it. If you're drawing read and you find that you you draw light all and all of a sudden you start to draw really, really hard. That's

290
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.580
Serenna Beers: You're probably bringing out the anger. Right. Or maybe you feeling sentimental or maybe there's some hurt. So maybe you draw

291
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:44.400
Serenna Beers: An eye with tears in it. I mean, there's all kinds of things. If you just let your brain go that you might be able to process. But what I want you to do.

292
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:56.610
Serenna Beers: Is I don't want you to try to figure it out until you and I meet again, I want you just just just to draw just a draw. And then I want to process it with you when we meet again just

293
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.510
Dottie Newton: Just see

294
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:02.190
Serenna Beers: What comes out when you don't talk when you just draw

295
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:10.530
Dottie Newton: And I, that's something I haven't done since I was 15 or 16

296
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:18.090
Dottie Newton: And that's something I don't know if I can do that. I'll see what I could do, because

297
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:25.410
Dottie Newton: I tend to think every everything be on logic, it just

298
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.770
Dottie Newton: It has to make sense to make

299
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.580
Serenna Beers: I don't expect you to do anything but your best. Okay.

300
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:42.810
Serenna Beers: And if you sit down and all you get is this on a

301
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.950
Dottie Newton: Line.

302
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:56.130
Serenna Beers: By line and you're like, I just can't. We're gonna, we're gonna we're gonna work through that and then maybe the next time you might get a little bit farther

303
00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.410
Dottie Newton: Yeah guy.

304
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.060
Serenna Beers: We, we don't have to go fast. There's no expiration date.

305
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.730
Serenna Beers: But I do think for you.

306
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.140
Serenna Beers: As emotionally charged as you are that

307
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.790
Serenna Beers: Dirty, you have to start like doing something

308
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.380
Dottie Newton: Because I know

309
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.200
Serenna Beers: Your pain is only going to get worse.

310
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.000
Dottie Newton: I know, I know.

311
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.290
Serenna Beers: You're how old if you don't mind me asking because I

312
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.780
Serenna Beers: Know it all off the top, top of my head.

313
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.510
Dottie Newton: 61

314
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.530
Serenna Beers: See, you still have

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.230

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:47.760
Serenna Beers: Well,

319
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:59.430
Serenna Beers: Let's see, because you know stress is the number one. Well, it's, it's in the top five. I don't know the research. So I'm not going to quote that but I do know that stress is in the top five.

Serenna Beers: Yeah Can and someone's life.

321
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:13.920

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.030
Dottie Newton: You have to feel

323
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:26.640
Serenna Beers: In order to heal. I have to feel so when you want to Choke, choke it back. Tell yourself that I still use that line. And I've been using that with others and all myself still for 15 years

324
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:36.510
Serenna Beers: Yeah okay um I and I got off track because we started to talk about some stuff that was happening with you.
