00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.030
James: Morning.

2
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.410
Good morning.

3
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, what happened. I didn't hear anything and you missed group, what happened.

4
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.650
James: I've been able to sleep, these past what four nights.

5
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:18.690
James: So Monday night or Sunday night Monday night, I didn't get didn't get sleep, but I was going to go to my class, but I kind of fell asleep, around three in the morning. And finally, I could, I couldn't get up. I just slept through my alarm and then yesterday, too. I was a little late for work.

6
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.910
James: Because I couldn't sleep.

7
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's interesting. The, the, the very topic right of that particular group was on, you know, using the constructive worry

8
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.970
James: Group.

9
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It was on anxiety and how you know how to use that that paradoxical thing that I do, where I schedule I scheduled a worried time but I put a lot more structure to it.

10
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So you tell me what is let's let's deconstruct what's keeping you awake because we've talked about this before. Yes, really central

11
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me hear it. What kept you awake.

12
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.220
James: I don't know, just thoughts.

13
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.130
James: Yeah thoughts and worries and

14
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.890
James: Why like just a

15
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.450
James: Thinking about the past, when I was trying to go to sleep.

16
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A past and now we're talking girlfriend past that kind of stuff.

17
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.360
James: Yeah, and then just the past like how it how it used to be.

18
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if

19
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You get it out of your head and you tell me how she used to be.

20
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.310
James: I used to be fun.

21
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So it was reminiscing like, Oh, man. It's just that memory.

22
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.240
James: Yeah, I was just reminiscing about the old times. I mean, the home easiest to have or that me and my girlfriend. Am I will meet my ex girlfriend, nice to have a just shit like that.

23
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And that kept you awake.

24
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.670
James: Yeah.

25
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.960
James: And just like my mind running and it doesn't know how to stop.

26
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

27
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to stop.

28
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to teach it how to stop.

29
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.770
James: Yeah.

30
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe what we'll do is we'll do, I'll do that activity that I didn't group. Maybe I'll do that with you today, if we have time.

31
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so I had given you

32
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I gave you an invitation to do something. Do you remember what it was last time we met.

33
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.030
James: Oh, the book find it.

34
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: dig it up.

35
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only find it. But there was something you were going to do once you found it.

36
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.750
James: Study it. Like was it, study it was a text. Do something about it.

37
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't studying, I wasn't. No, it wasn't. It was take a picture.

38
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.420
James: Take a picture. I knew is supposed to be something like that.

39
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but so and you gave me permission to know you a little bit

40
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I did. And how did that work out.

41
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.960
James: How I remember getting that text and

42
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And

43
00:04:48.360 --> 00:05:04.620
James: All pretty all right when when he texted me. I was when he texted me. I was a little bit busy so like it kind of didn't click in my head. Also, what the hell is she talking about like I like stare at it for immediate like think, and I was like oh my book.

44
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And then, and then I didn't hear from you.

45
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.400
James: Yeah. Oh, sorry. I got busy.

46
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's check on on motivation again.

47
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: For the ASCO book do you did you run across it in your dad's house.

48
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.360
James: Oh, no.

49
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.770
James: Have not came across in my pops house yet.

50
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.030
James: I've looked, but I don't know where I put it.

51
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you, you. Did you love recently like as in over the weekend.

52
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.360
James: Yeah, like when I like when you texted me

53
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.470
Okay.

54
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Okay, so you did look um

55
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.340
James: It. Yeah, I just didn't find it.

56
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what, what ideas do you have about being able to get

57
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The books that you do have

58
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.670
James: Oh, what do you mean

59
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You have another one right

60
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.330
James: Yeah, yeah, I'm a mom's house. Okay.

61
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not doing any good over there. Is it

62
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.990
James: No. Not at the moment.

63
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you usually calm, cool, and collected when you're over your mom's

64
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.930
James: Not really.

65
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: not conducive for studying

66
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.830
James: Yeah, now

67
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to

68
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Step back from that for a while and see if you can find your own motivation for it because

69
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had had that book sitting around at your pops house and you were up right at 1am 2AM. Yeah, you might have taken that boring book out so boring and opened it up and looked at it.

70
00:07:48.630 --> 00:08:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And trying to answer, maybe the reading problem or reading comprehension for a but it would have gotten your mind off of reminiscing and so would have been doing two things for you. Because it, it could have bored you sleep.

71
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we would have had it.

72
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You know what I mean. So there's a lot of cool things that could have happened from that.

73
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But

74
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What I see on is that, again, this motivation.

75
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: needs to come from you like this, I want this, but it's like there's still a pushing away of it. It's more. I want to reminisce the fun times and not wanting to look to maybe the inconvenience of studying and to the unknown of the future, but rather you rather spend time reminiscing

76
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.830
James: Hey, what exactly

77
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it then tell me, correct me.

78
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.310
Maybe

79
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of it.

80
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.330
James: Oh fuck. Fuck if I know what it is.

81
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, did it work.

82
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:06.900
James: Daughter now.

83
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So again,

84
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess what I wonder is, if you're if so if it's me if I'm pretending I'm you and I'm awake at three in the morning and I think

85
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Crap, I gotta

86
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta make it to a 7am meeting if I don't make it to the 7am meeting.

87
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: My PO will hear about it. Then I got to hear her mouth. And I don't know if I'm going to get thrown into jail. I don't know if I have community service or I don't I don't actually know what their sanction stuff is. I don't know. I don't know what they do.

88
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, to me there's a connection. But I don't know if, in the middle of the night. Those occur to you, do they occur deep. Do you think those through is it just thinking about the past.

89
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.590
James: No, I think about that too.

90
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Didn't motivate you to read something boring.

91
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.510
James: Now,

92
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.120
James: Have you ever done that makes me want to go to sleep so that I could get my ass up to go do this shit.

93
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.530
James: No, I mean, yeah, when I was in jail. I read a book to go to sleep.

94
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you think it won't work out here.

95
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:24.870
James: I don't know.

96
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.180
James: Yeah.

97
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

98
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see what we got here.

99
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How often are those thoughts swinging by telling you to have a drink, how often they popping up.

100
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.500
James: Not often.

101
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Every day 10 times a day, every week, once a week, once every two weeks. Give me a general frequency

102
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.190
James: Once in a while.

103
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No know what that means, that's different for everyone just kind of give me a frequency range here once a day, once a week, once a month.

104
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.800
James: Once a week.

105
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

106
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess would be Monday night was part of the reminiscing a piece of that was that also drinking too. Was it a piece of it.

107
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.420
James: No.

108
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No, okay. It was

109
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just fun and happy and those memories, but it didn't have anything to do you weren't

110
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Drinking for those memories.

111
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.610
James: No.

112
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you didn't have to have a good time without drinking

113
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.260
James: Drinking but I was in sa soccer. I never said I was completely clean either

114
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. So, um,

115
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we've got maybe having handy, a kind of book that at least could catch her interest enough to get you

116
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Get you drowsy maybe fallen asleep.

117
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be handy to have around.

118
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 group.

119
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.800
Yeah.

120
00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yeah it looks like I've already to some degree already not quite as specific as I did it with the group, but I've already put out there, this notion of of using the constructive worry or the worry hour

121
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But my guess is you didn't do it.

122
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.200
James: No, no, I guess my worry. Our. It was from 12 to four.

123
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll give it one more try. Here, let's see if this, this makes a difference. And certainly, your choice.

124
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll share this with you, cold.

125
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, constructive worry

126
00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a paradoxical intervention. So this some of this reason. First person I didn't write it. It's a combination of two or three things, but it kind of I like it in first word instructive worry

127
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to designate like 1530 minutes each day to worry about.

128
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To worry about concerns as a mean of means of controlling word. So one of my mottos in life is to feel the fear and do it anyway.

129
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: On the whole, it has served me pretty well, it pushes me through big life changes and it helps me calm my nerves with daily stresses. But even with the experience of confronting fear I still worry a lot

130
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes that's a good thing worrying can drive me motivated me to work harder be better prepared and focus on what I can control.

131
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hmm. But when I ruminate which means think think think think think think think think think that's a fancy word for for overthinking

132
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But when I ruminate of things that I don't have control over.

133
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:03.750
Or

134
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All it does is send me into a tailspin and makes it difficult for me to sleep soundly.

135
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier this year, I noticed that stress and anxiety compromised my sleep, to the point where it was impacting concentration at work. I followed all the standard sleep advice like avoiding screen time, you know, you don't watch any blue screens no phone

136
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: No snacks no caffeine and eating healthy and exercising. I followed all that advice, but nothing seemed to be working. So I sought the opinion of an expert Gary zammit Founder and Executive Director of the sleep disorders Institute in New York. And he said,

137
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If the anxiety is producing worry. The best thing to do is try to put that worry into a day time situation.

138
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Into an awake situation Salman said that he asked patients how long they lay awake at night and yours is about, what, three hours.

139
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Not more. Yeah, so it would say, how long is it keeping you awake.

140
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.080
James: And then

141
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you would instruct them to schedule a word for that long. I wouldn't do that to you. That's just cool. I wouldn't say worry sit there and freak out for three hours.

142
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

143
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I seems a little, little too much.

144
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So where you can sit in a quiet chair and think about all the things that you worry about some patients would realize that it just ain't worth it. Stressing about it and others would just sleep better, because they've literally moved that activity into the day

145
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm gonna show you

146
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let me just ask you in your in your truck to your car. Do you happen to have the paper and pen or know

147
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You already have something in there. You don't have to because this is just

148
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.620
James: A new look.

149
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.330
James: Let me look

150
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.550
James: I mean, so this is not mine. I'm on think my dad rights much it takes much notes.

151
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.580
James: While he's driving cuz I can't find a pen for shit.

152
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no big deal.

153
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just, I'll just go over it with you and maybe next time.

154
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll just give some instruction and kind of remember how to do it.

155
00:18:53.730 --> 00:19:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This is basically saying, as I've gone over with you, but a little bit more detail. So if you had had the piece of paper, it might look like this. On the left hand side, you might write the right the problem. So first,

156
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What is something that

157
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A problem that's most likely to keep you awake at night.

158
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.440
James: A money financial security having money being able to pay off the courts.

159
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so making money.

160
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

161
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold that as we do this activity, just kind of hold that that the problem. That's the one that kind of keeps you awake. Right.

162
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. So then we're going to go on to have that in the back of your mind.

163
00:19:52.710 --> 00:20:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So what it says is constructive worry instructions when we have problems we tend to this is the part. So this is the new piece of information that most people hadn't thought of before.

164
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When we have problems we tend to use our problem solving skills to make our lives better and relieve ourselves of anxiety. It's not surprising, just that some of us may use our problem solving skills at the wrong time.

165
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning at that time. So the problem solving skills are awesome. It's just not at two in the morning.

166
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so we may think about a problem trying to solve it. But unfortunately, the anxiety caused by the problem will keep us awake.

167
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Constructive worry is a method for managing the tendency to worry during quiet time, which is when you sleep.

168
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: When really sleep is supposed to be with taking over. So what's happening is, Look, we all need to kind of worry we got. Okay, well this is getting motivated to problem solve, but the problem is is happening at two in the morning.

169
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When it's causing you anxiety and that's what he displayed. So what this activity does is, it gets it in the middle of the day, it gets it.

170
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.370
James: Whenever

171
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.480
Your alarm.

172
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to get into some specifics here. See all this down here is a little bit more to it.

173
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So just keep that that problem, you identified which is money.

174
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So write down a problem facing us, what is the greatest chance of keeping you awake. We already have that

175
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.220
Are

176
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Then think that, think of the next step that might help fix it. So you write down the word solution which you saw I had drawn a line of vertical line down the middle of the page. And on the right, I have solution.

177
00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And on the left, I have my problem. And this is where you're giving this is really specific to how to convince that busy mind to shut up.

178
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So the need

179
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not be so this need not be the final solution to the problem, since most problems have to be solved by taking several steps, anyhow.

180
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll be doing this again tomorrow night, and the night after until you finally get the best solution. Okay, so see how I have a, b, c, d. There's different choices.

181
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just one

182
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Solution.

183
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go through all of these options, but the key is that for whatever problem you have on the left hand side you want to write something

184
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Over on the right. And the reason you want to write one of these things on the right is so that it's done. It's out of your head. It's on paper.

185
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll get into why that's important in a minute. So here's your option if you already know how to fix the problem, then you write that down.

186
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Asked my boss for overtime would be a specific solution. I'm just making that up quit my job. Get a better paying one

187
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Blah, blah, blah. But my point. If you already have the solution you write it down.

188
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or be if you decide that this is a really big deal. He'll just go and just deal with it when it, when the time comes, then you write it down. And the key is to write it down. You would literally right just deal with it when the time comes, you would write that down on the right hand side.

189
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd literally put that

190
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.410
James: Right there.

191
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

192
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's, you could do that. Now see if you decide that you simply do not know what to do.

193
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To Matt.

194
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you need to ask someone to help you, then you write down

195
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, I need to ask someone to help me.

196
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you're right.

197
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to ask someone to help

198
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's what gets written now.

199
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's easier. Yeah. If you decide that you simply was another one. Oh, it's the same exact thing except I need to do some research or learn more about the problem.

200
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're going to write that down. Or he if you decide that it is a problem but there seems no good solution. It's just too. I can't think of a solution.

201
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where radical acceptance comes in right you'll just have to live with it.

202
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

203
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people

204
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.280
James: Right.

205
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Do you write that down.

206
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost through this

207
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to repeat this for all of those things that are likely to keep you awake, you place the constructive worry on the nightstand next to your bed and forget about it until you reference it when you're worried alarm goes off during the day.

208
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You pick this list up and you look at it.

209
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if it's on your bedside and it's one in the morning. It's two in the morning.

210
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This is key. This is the piece and then and then we're through this okay if items of worry come up. Write them down, even if it's a two in the morning.

211
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.630
James: Okay.

212
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Get them out of your head and onto the page. Remind yourself that you will be working on them again tomorrow on schedule. And now morning or whenever you have the alarm set and that not list. This is the part that nothing you can do while you are so tired. It

213
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Can help you any more than you have already done.

214
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your effort will only make matters worse.

215
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So follow this logic. Right.

216
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: When is your when is your hopes for it, you

217
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I can

218
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See

219
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, you know,

220
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

221
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

222
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When is your

223
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: IQ our as in, when are you feeling smartest brightest most intelligent what time of day.

224
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.820
James: I don't know.

225
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, do you want to know, do you want to that look into it. I mean,

226
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:45.420
James: Yeah.

227
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there you go. That could be your first solo homework well additive. The other one that you do.

228
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So thinking about noticing where you feel sharpest. So, for example, some people will say, Hey, I'm really a morning person. I'm really bright and sharp and I'm the schedule all my high IQ. Like if I had an important meeting, I would schedule it at 10 in the morning, let's say,

229
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Or some people they really come online at six o'clock 6pm and they would say, you know, let's schedule later in the day when they their mind needs to be really sharp

230
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: They know that about themselves, but I'm hearing from you. You do not know that might be something to know just notice it. Hey, I'm, I'm, I have energy and I feel sharp. Maybe it's three o'clock.

231
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So the whole point of this exercise is to certainly know yourself know when that peak IQ time is

232
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And realistically to say, maybe it's better than I do my problem solving. During that time versus two in the morning when

233
00:28:54.810 --> 00:29:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to cause me anxiety. It's going to keep me awake and I'm going to probably come up with kind of crummy answers.

234
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's keeping me awake, but if I go look at my piece of paper. I already did the best I could, at my peak IQ. I already wrote it down. I already had it written down. I came up with these solutions at 3pm when I was really feeling smart.

235
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that you see the difference.

236
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.330
James: And yeah, okay.

237
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's find out. Tell me, tell me.

238
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What the point of this exercise was for you.

239
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.670
James: For you all

240
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.180
James: To help me sleep at night and to help me figure out how to

241
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.400
James: The worry hour to get my worry. Our on time were on point.

242
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.010
James: I guess you could say.

243
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.210
James: Will be able to help me sleep.

244
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is.

245
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not dismissing it. It's not saying the worry isn't important. It is right. It's just putting it and this is the part that in fact from you because you don't know where your peak IQ our is

246
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would be the first step is to start to get to know yourself and kind of watch and say, Oh, dang. Yeah, man. I had my comebacks coming at people like this. I felt really I felt sharp at this time of day, then that might be the one where you kind of

247
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You learn that about yourself and maybe that's when you might schedule that constructive worry time

248
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wonder if he'll do it. We'll see.

249
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, all right.

250
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.330
James: Go.

251
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in here. My know closed.

252
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back.

253
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationships are pretty important. How are dynamics between you and your pops these days.

254
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.320
James: Pretty good.

255
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, great.

256
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But worrying about money is your employer cutting back on hours.

257
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.190
James: Yeah.

258
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How about with things opening up a little bit in New Mexico. Does it seem like it's going to get better.

259
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:47.100
James: Hopefully, if not all, as I could hope for is the world is to hope for the world to hurry up and fucking go tits up because I'm tired of waiting around twiddling my thumbs of this Kobe bullshit. I want zombies already

260
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember if somebody is a contagious thing to

261
00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:03.990
James: Think they are

262
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think a mask is going to help them.

263
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta wash

264
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.700
James: I gotta watch out point. I think we're all fucked.

265
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If we all have it I guess we won't know that it's a problem, we'll all be zombies. Right.

266
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we have viruses to worry about.

267
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.810
James: Exactly.

268
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.840
James: What we want to have an economy to worry about.

269
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It, but do we just eat each other like, what am I, what do I eat if I'm a zombie.

270
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.770
James: I mean whatever whatever people are alive and then we start going for cannibalism.

271
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:56.730
Okay.

272
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to hurry up and get there, huh.

273
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.690
James: Yeah.

274
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So what would you write on the, on the right hand side.

275
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: For the problem is money instead of the Apocalypse, and the zombies and all that.

276
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's one thing you might write

277
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.590
James: Get another job.

278
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.840
James: Or two jobs.

279
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

280
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have some some buddies that might hook you up.

281
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:42.990
James: Yeah, I

282
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.270
James: Think so.

283
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they know you're interested yet. Maybe that's a first step is to reach out to them and say, Hey, I'm looking to add some hours.

284
00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.900
James: I know they're not interested. Yet I mean they don't know. I'm interested to get everyone

285
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that seem like a reasonable first step.

286
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.350
James: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm going to do that. I just had a fun time.

287
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Way me find the time you're not working that much. Where do you. Where are you

288
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.140
James: I'm in front of my work.

289
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I mean,

290
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you have to fight.

291
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.290
James: For

292
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to find time you're working less. Tell me what you mean by that. I just don't know what I mean.

293
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.070
Oh,

294
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.750
James: I'm working less, but I'm working at my dad's house still for no pay

295
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

296
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.630
James: Those because they cut my hours, doesn't mean I'm not busy.

297
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you.

298
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You think he'd be understanding if you said, Hey, I've got a friend actually

299
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Get another job you think you'd be understanding

300
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:23.670
James: Oh, he went he Yeah he wouldn't care like Putin K like alright cool whatever you go get yourself another job, then he's all already know until I got that means you'll be spending less time at at the house.

301
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you maybe have some mixed feelings like a part of me likes being at the house doing those projects.

302
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:54.360
James: Like being at home and improving on my dad's house and doing whatever he needs help with and just little projects like that. But the only shit. Part of it is, I don't get paid for it because it's well my house.

303
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.160
James: Also allows so

304
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't be convenient if he was kind of pushing you a little bit more if he would kind of encourage you. Hey, spend a couple hours, blah, blah, blah. Tracking down another job with that a motivated you are pushed and helpful.

305
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:34.860
James: Maybe, but I could do it, do it on my own. Because, like, I'm the one that needs the money and it's always in the back of my thought on the back of my head is I need more money.

306
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. How much more like what are we talking about here.

307
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How much

308
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:46.410
I know

309
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about $1,000 more a month or like even just $100 a week more would make a difference.

310
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.690
James: It would be nice to get a fucking thousand dollars a month.

311
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What would help reduce the anxiety.

312
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm James, what I don't, I can't quite tell is if the, the, I don't know, is really real like

313
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You worry about money, but you don't get a sense of how much would give relief or if it's like more about just kind of not wanting to talk. Which one do you think it's more likely

314
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.850
James: Or no, I mean,

315
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:12.540
James: Money wise enough money to give me the fuck out of here and keep me gone and set me up for life. So maybe a couple mil fucking disappear.

316
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.860
James: But I sure as hell ain't gonna happen. Cuz I ain't doing nothing worth a couple mil

317
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And she mentioned earlier.

318
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Money that used to go to the courts and there were a couple other things I didn't hear them. My guess is you don't need millions for that.

319
00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.240
James: No.

320
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.180
James: Just close to a couple grand

321
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.880
Okay.

322
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple grand maybe over what time span next few months.

323
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:13.560
James: Shit Fuck no, I rather prefer like within a month. So then I could pay off the court and get them off my fucking ass.

324
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:28.020
James: And then I could pay off. Whoever boy. Yeah, just basically the court so they could get off my ass and I could go pay the MVD for my goddamn license and like go pick whoever the fuck oh fuck and pay for my interlock when they get into the walk.

325
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

326
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you have now. I thought they gave you something the breathalyzer type of thing.

327
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't pay for that.

328
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:50.520
James: Oh, it's a sober link, it just keeps now. And plus, it's not in the vehicle. It just keeps me sober here today.

329
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't charge you a fee for that thing.

330
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.710
James: No, not unless I break it, which I doubt. I'm gonna break it.

331
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.580
Okay.

332
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I see

333
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple grand would cover outstanding money for MVD and the court fees somehow the pre trial release supervision fees kind of thing.

334
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:27.960
James: Yeah, something like that.

335
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.710
Yeah.

336
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that seems a whole lot easier to get than 2 million

337
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have to be in a month or

338
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it was over a few months.

339
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: With with your POV okay with that.

340
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:17.670
James: I prefer to get it all done and over with within a month because and the sooner I pay them off the sooner, they'll, they'll tell me you get the folk out today and the similar tell me to fuck off. And the sooner. I'll be in the Navy and the sooner. I'll be able to leave this goddamn state.

341
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, you definitely know emphatically what you want.

342
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just keeping you awake, is it, how to do it, or that you'll be able to do it.

343
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.400
James: I know I'll be able to do it.

344
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.670
James: Once I figure out how the fuck to do it.

345
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Who can you call or text me. Let them know you're interested in picking up either a new job or some shifts somewhere.

346
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.510
James: I don't know, have to go around town. See

347
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have time to that next Wednesday, Thursday, right, do you have time today or tomorrow.

348
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:39.900
James: Oh, I'm pretty sure I'll time the day cuz now after after this meeting off to check in with my PO and then

349
00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.720
James: And then I'll have time to

350
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.640
James: Look for a job application.

351
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

352
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, do you have anything else you want to process share before we head out today.

353
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.690
James: No, not really.

354
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well,

355
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see you next Tuesday.

356
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.620
James: I said, Okay.
