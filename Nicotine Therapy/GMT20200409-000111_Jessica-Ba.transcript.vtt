00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:50.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said sobriety is something that you're stable with what is something where maybe it's more emotional that you want to work on, or what skills to do better at

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.500
Sergio Molina: Being in a much better mood every day.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. Okay, see you more serious.

41
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.580
Yeah.

42
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how does that seriousness presented itself in relationships as to why you would want to work on.

43
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.820
Sergio Molina: I tried to open myself up a little bit more open relationship.

44
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thankful So work on being less serious to be enjoying life a little more laughing or smiling more

45
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:57.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Okay. All right. So let's think about it from this aspect. What triggers you or how has childhood or current experiences affected you would be so serious.

46
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.740
Sergio Molina: How has it affected me

47
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.890
Sergio Molina: It's affect me and a lot of ways.

48
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like what, why do you think you're so serious.

49
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.850
Sergio Molina: Because of the things that I've heard in the past.

50
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Sergio Molina: I guess rough childhood, I guess you could say.

51
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So being serious, was how you adapted or was it more like a survival technique.

52
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.210
Sergio Molina: Yeah, pretty much. Survival technique.

53
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There are certain things, certain reactions or certain environments where you find that you're more serious than others.

54
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.950
Sergio Molina: around people that I don't know.

55
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't have to be as serious with, who are those people

56
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.550
Sergio Molina: Mom family.

57
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So host Sergio when he's around his mom and his girlfriend.

58
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.770
Sergio Molina: More

59
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Detail jokes or you're more of the person that just laughs at the jokes.

60
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.770
Sergio Molina: I'm more of a listener.

61
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how does, how do you communicate with your girlfriend.

62
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No.

63
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Joke

64
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, does she do most of the talking to you do the talking. Was that dynamic like

65
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.500
Sergio Molina: You are like to listen for

66
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right.

67
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there certain situations that make you just kind of shut down and that you don't get serious all over again. Your loss come back up.

68
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.800
Sergio Molina: Yeah, maybe when I get proved wrong.

69
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, my friends, Iran, okay.

70
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So to be proven wrong, that means you have to have been in a position to be arguing or trying to state your claim that what you do.

71
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.870
Sergio Molina: Yeah.

72
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How have you tried to work on. Well, is that

73
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.490
Sergio Molina: Just accepting that I'm wrong, I guess.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's worked well for you and getting you to open up and smile more. Let's see it. I see.

75
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.780
Sergio Molina: I'm just

76
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.210
Sergio Molina: The drugs in general, we're

77
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.450

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was your drug of choice that the drugs that made you more happy.

79
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.940
Sergio Molina: Know the drugs, the drugs that I was on didn't make me happy.

80
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you're saying being off the drugs.

81
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.890

83
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:32.400

84
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Who said she's not from her from here. She's your nurturing figure or he's electric

85
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, where's your family from

86
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.490

Sergio Molina: When she was six months pregnant with me.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:21.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how was the transition in the that station to the United States culture. What was that like for your family, do they have to. They have to talk about it.

93
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.270
Sergio Molina: I mean, no they don't really talk about it, but I'm sure it was rough because they didn't know how to speak the language so

94
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What

95
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.100
Sergio Molina: Does a lot of people here. I'm sure they figured it out.

96
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They came straight to New Mexico.

97
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.510

Weekly.

116
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.630
Sergio Molina: Yeah, she couldn't be.

117
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.290
Sergio Molina: Yeah, I have.

118
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.130
Sergio Molina: Two brothers and a sister.

119
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And where are you, oh, this little young is

120
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.430
Sergio Molina: I'm the oldest

121
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you did say that you started working at an early age. Right.

122
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:27.900
Yeah.

123
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'll come because your mom wasn't working.

124
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.680
Sergio Molina: She was just on drugs.

125
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.290
Sergio Molina: To number around

126
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Her drugs of choice.

127
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.410
Sergio Molina: Well, crack

128
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The crack you started when she was in Mexico of winching with here.

129
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.610
Sergio Molina: You know, it was here.

130
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Longer story of how how that started for her. The crack addiction.

131
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.750
Sergio Molina: Know,

132
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:22.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I don't remember discussing that when I read your bio psychosocial and those so many that sometimes I forget. So I'm curious to know, because whenever there's an ad in the family, the family unit and because you have brothers and sisters, everyone plays a role.

133
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's the added to sell with your mom.

134
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:40.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's an enabler. That's the person that kind of denies there being a problem and they convince everyone else, but it's not a problem. And they just come to ignore it. Who was the enabler in your family.

135
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.300
Sergio Molina: Grow my brother.

136
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Younger

137
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.310
Sergio Molina: Brother. He's the middle

138
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's his personality like

139
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.790
Sergio Molina: He's a

140
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.760
Sergio Molina: Very negative and

141
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.820
Sergio Molina: Kochi, I guess.

142
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's your relationship like with him.

143
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.480
Sergio Molina: I don't talk to him.

144
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:36.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, the here on the family. They're the hard working perfectionist. They try to make the family seem as normal as possible, even though there's an addict. They try and get lots of achievements do everything right so that the family can look as normal as possible. Who is that in your family.

145
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.360
Sergio Molina: Don't want to see myself well

146
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's say yourself.

147
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.730
Sergio Molina: Yeah.

148
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.870
Sergio Molina: It's myself then

149
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.870
Sergio Molina: I mean nobody graduated in my family. I graduated

150
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.960
Sergio Molina: I still have a job, they're still on drugs so

151
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.600
Sergio Molina: I don't know. Yeah.

152
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I really think it's us because typically the hero is the oldest child.

153
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:19.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: take on the responsibility they want everything to be right. And so we take pride in the achievements, they made

154
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why discipline and structure is so important for you.

155
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's probably why you take like a little more seriously and for you. Now you're trying to find a balance because the seriousness is good because it gives me the discipline. But I also want to enjoy night and feel happy and not always feel like I have responsibility.

156
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That accurate.

157
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.480
Yeah.

158
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a scapegoat in the family. That's the person that gets blamed for all of the problems.

159
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:16.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These people when they get older, it's escape goal is a guy. They're kind of more aggressive. The act of violence that the Skakel is a woman, they run away alive or they're a little more promiscuous as far as sex goals, but they're the ones that always be the problem the issue.

160
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.290
Sergio Molina: Let's play my little brother.

161
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Youngest one

162
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.620
Yeah.

163
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:34.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's also a mascot. That's the person that tries to make everybody laugh. They don't want to really deal with the issues.

164
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like that happy place.

165
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the family.

166
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.190
Sergio Molina: My sister.

167
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The youngest one

168
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.080
Sergio Molina: There's only got the one, there's only one she's the second oldest

169
00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:05.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there a lost child in your family. They're the ones that like the invisible. People forget about that person they have trouble with forming relationships and connecting with other people.

170
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.690
Sergio Molina: Yeah, but my little brother, does that

171
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The same. I'm the same one. That's the mascot. I mean, the scapegoat.

172
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:17.850
Yeah.

173
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So he's escaped goal. And the last shot.

174
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.670
Sergio Molina: All he does is just follow the middle brother around

175
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:42.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To ask these questions because when I asked about culture because that plays a huge dynamic one and how people respond to addiction.

176
00:15:42.930 --> 00:16:01.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And communication styles you know all of our attachments start from childhood. So you have a mom that migrates to the United States with her siblings without the caretaker, the father for children. She gets here. She does his own language.

177
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now she's addicted to drugs.

178
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She processes all of the struggles through her anger through her addiction.

179
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You'd be in the oldest child rise up as the hero and takes pride in all the accomplishments and just trying to do things right, because by you being an order. It makes everything seem there.

180
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Everybody plays a role in our family structure.

181
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your brother. That was the scapegoat. And the last child.

182
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:43.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is probably more so just the last child because he doesn't have any sense of identity. He doesn't know what to do in this unit.

183
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.830
Your sister.

184
00:16:47.880 --> 00:17:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your sister who's the mascot who tries to bring the humor tries to to she may struggle with addiction to because to just try to keep light in the situation and the issues through comedy not taking like so seriously.

185
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is your sister abusing drugs or alcohol.

186
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.070
Sergio Molina: Know,

187
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's your relationship like with your sister.

188
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.920
Sergio Molina: Man, or the closest

189
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:31.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you guys support each other because she's the one that brings the humor in your the serious one. So we need to work together. What does that look like

190
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.260
Sergio Molina: Which a little bit more open

191
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Brings on one side.

192
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.010
Sergio Molina: I'm almost like mom and

193
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.520
Son

194
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.160
Sergio Molina: With each other.

195
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She being the mom.

196
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:48.720
Sergio Molina: Yeah.

197
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even though you're the oldest

198
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.470
Yeah.

199
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that hero complex it's exhausting of always having to do right

200
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To make the right decisions. It's a lot of responsibility.

201
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you take up that here. Okay, you can just relax with your system.

202
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where is your girlfriend come in the mix.

203
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She made she has allowed you to take off that here. Okay, where do you feel the need to keep on the hero with your girl.

204
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.070
Sergio Molina: She was

205
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.160
Sergio Molina: She was verbally abuse for a long time so I

206
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:47.250
Sergio Molina: Try to be really open with her. So I try to watch sedate and stuff. So I guess I could take off the king.

207
00:18:51.030 --> 00:19:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Protective with your words be serious be responsible. So it almost seems like that hero Kate stays on, because the hero is the protector.

208
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:22.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They have to do right to make the unit normal to make things function. So what I heard that is that to keep your girlfriend say listen more watch what you say because you don't want to trigger her to think that she's in another situation that's not healthy.

209
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What ways could you share that she seems like a very safe space for you and what ways could you practice that new goal that you want to work on and being more open and not being so serious.

210
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.410
Sergio Molina: Know maybe

211
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.170
Sergio Molina: Interact with her kids more

212
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.920
Sergio Molina: Once nine and the other ones 11

213
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is it, girls, girls.

214
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a hospital women.

215
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:10.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

216
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're smart man, if you're watching your words.

217
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For women.

218
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This madman.

219
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

220
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:36.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm thinking in that role with a house full of women, you already being the oldest having to be the responsible one in a family where your mom was an addict.

221
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that dynamic must make it difficult to just relax and laugh.

222
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

223
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.230
Sergio Molina: Yeah.

224
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.640
Sergio Molina: So right now, they're not even going with their debt so

225
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.060
Sergio Molina: They're here. They've been here for like a month straight

226
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's that been like for you.

227
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.270
Sergio Molina: It's been good.

228
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.350
It doesn't bother me.

229
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.960
Sergio Molina: I guess get closer and closer to them.

230
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.160
Yeah.

231
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kids are a great source of letting your guard down and having fun.

232
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:44.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm thinking a great way to practice this, this new goal of yours is to do it in a safe space with with the girls because they're home they're probably wanting to play different board games, or watch a silly show together different things in common to their world.

233
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Allow yourself to take off a hero cake for a while and just really know what it feels like to just enjoy the moment and not worry about responsibilities.

234
00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that's all children do all day, every day, you have the responsibility. They're looking for a way of when is this gonna be over soccer just relaxing.

235
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.160
Sergio Molina: Yeah but but see, if you do that, then they want to do it every single day.

236
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, well, you take moments of time.

237
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:19.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You choose a point in the day and it doesn't have to be the same time every day but moments throughout the day where you think

238
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me, let me go into the world for a bit.

239
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And trust me, they'll respect the boundary. If you give them enough of that on an ongoing basis.

240
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.260
Sergio Molina: I mean I guess I can

241
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.990
Sergio Molina: Act like a kid. So I like to have

242
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.290
Sergio Molina: four wheelers and stuff so

243
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.170
Sergio Molina: We go forward with it and i mean i take them out for rides and

244
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.700
Sergio Molina: I I turned into a good luck to

245
00:22:53.610 --> 00:23:00.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So you already identify opportunities where you allow yourself to have fun and you're not as serious

246
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:11.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So maybe increase those moments so that what other opportunities present itself to laugh and to just relax and to take off the hero, Kate, you can do it.

247
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That way you get that balance that you're looking for.

248
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any other goals you want to add to your treatment plan.

249
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.270
Sergio Molina: To overload myself.

250
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right. Any thoughts or questions.

251
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.750
Sergio Molina: So some lady commented, if

252
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.150
Sergio Molina: Facing

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.990
Sergio Molina: She said them another point on the 17th. Is it for the same thing.

254
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.580

261
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.520
