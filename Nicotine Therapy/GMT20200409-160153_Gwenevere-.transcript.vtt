Gwenevere Abriel: Video. Make sure they're in sync.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.750
Cynthia We: So,

Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check.

Gwenevere Abriel: Audio, video in sync. Everything looking nice flow 1233 everything in sync.

5
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.580
Cynthia We: See

6
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Check 12121 to

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.330
Cynthia We: Two into into check 1212 I have a stable internet connection, apparently.

8
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you do. This feels familiar like deja vu.

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.800
Cynthia We: I would like to know what's up that

10
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.490
Cynthia We: I am not sure I fix it.

12
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.020
Cynthia We: Or they just gonna say that it's like this for everybody right now.

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh, no, I just, I met with people since seven o'clock this morning, the connections been good. There's something unique going on over there with you.

14
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.930
Cynthia We: That's what I thought. Yeah.

15
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. This man. I'm a people person. I know it.

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.750
Cynthia We: Can call cable, though, and ask them, because it is something that I do every week, a time and it's no problem.

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.040
Cynthia We: And suddenly,

18
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.030
Cynthia We: The test to exist.

19
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so I mean I'm okay there's Wi Fi. There's using data that can be an issue. Sometimes people talk about, oh, I'm going to use my

20
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: My hotspot when there's a challenge. So like there's little things that I've learned along the way, about what can be used as alternate ways to connect to the internet, having internet I think is the best route.

21
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.920
Cynthia We: So I have internet I have Wi Fi at home. Yeah. What I turn my maybe I should turn my hotspot on my phone.

22
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.450
Cynthia We: And connect to that.

23
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do you have unlimited data.

24
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.340
Cynthia We: Um,

25
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't

26
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Impulse from you.

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.950
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah, yeah.

28
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I do I

29
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you can try that. So if you want, you could

30
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Switch to linking it to your

31
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: hotspot when I'm out and about driving around and I'm not sitting here in the office.

32
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel so like techie. Wow.

33
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.840
See

34
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.490
Cynthia We: IPhone

35
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Settings. Oh, yeah. You see it. Get in there.

36
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it makes that

37
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Those two links and I think it makes those two links.

38
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So much worse.

39
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Beyond

40
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Beyond

41
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, Tara horrible.

42
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.550
Cynthia We: Horrible.

43
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would go back to what you were doing before.

44
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I would take it off that personal

45
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.840
hotspot.

46
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: completely frozen. Can't hear you at all.

47
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.430
Cynthia We: Yeah, I'm putting it on to

48
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.390
Cynthia We: Okay. Is that any better.

49
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I heard is not any better. That was a full sentence. So that's progress and I am seeing you eyes blank so you aren't frozen. So whatever you doing right now that's a whole lot better than that hotspot thing. Oh, okay.

50
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.250
Cynthia We: I'm gonna run out here and I'm going to report to my family because I think everybody's got meeting tonight.

51
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.160
Cynthia We: Okay, I just want to let them know

52
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.810
Cynthia We: Okay, well that's unfortunate.

53
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.530
Cynthia We: That said, you know, it's supposed to be a problem right they lowered the Internet.

54
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Or did they really

55
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Who they who

56
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.140
Cynthia We: Someone day why

57
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, a cable company makes money off of the bandwidth so

58
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.510
The trick.

59
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:25.770
Cynthia We: I guess I'm Xfinity did maybe because so many people were you didn't want to break it. I don't know. I'll ask him the details later.

60
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so there might be times when I asked you to just go on audio so I can hear specific things you're saying, but right now we're okay. We'll just keep on long. Just the way we have it here. If I start to break up, just let me know. Okay.

61
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I want to check in on a couple of things that you're working on. You want to quit smoking.

62
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It was an identified goal. How are you doing,

63
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.530
Cynthia We: I am smoking twice as much as I was, and

64
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.590
Cynthia We: Um,

65
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.150
Cynthia We: It feels like a distant Goldie now.

66
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, when did you notice the twice as much

67
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.060
Cynthia We: A lovely less sick, like maybe a week ago, not even

68
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:32.640
Cynthia We: Because i well i talked about it in group about how much I was going outside to smoke because that's my escape and um

69
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.740
Cynthia We: And then I

70
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.480
Cynthia We: I

71
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.980
Cynthia We: Just, I don't know. Notice there's thing I just noticed I was downs like five and I'm way past that I might I'm Elise smoking can now.

72
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.780
Cynthia We: Discipline well

73
00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: There was also said, Why don't you say you're going out to smoke and watch a yo I was saying yoga video. But what was said was reading a book. Oh, you know, so it's a bit of a

74
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do something else.

75
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.950
Cynthia We: It's a conversation to have with him because he

76
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.060
Cynthia We: Believes beliefs. I don't know. Fuck. He believes, but it's a problem.

77
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.950
Cynthia We: Okay, I'm that I'm not really allowed to have personal time

78
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what is presenting right now as you're in this meeting.

79
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.140
You have that same

80
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.820
Cynthia We: Oh, I mean like if I go out side.

81
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.760
Cynthia We: To read a book, I believe that the hill.

82
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.580
Cynthia We: Think I'm escaping or say that I'm escaping

83
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.410
Cynthia We: And

84
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.450
Cynthia We: Something I already have the excuse. I don't have to make excuses, but

85
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.710
Cynthia We: It's just something I do. And nobody gets mad, mad.

86
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.570
Cynthia We: You know,

87
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it.

88
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.870
Cynthia We: Going out and reading is Cindy escaping

89
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.160
Cynthia We: And it's perceived in a different way. So,

90
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is, you know, there's another piece that's been said in here. When Scott was president, which was you know we we want to go on a walk with you. We want to hang out with you.

91
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.630
Cynthia We: Yes, yes.

92
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's really

93
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If you put aside, what other people want um

94
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you longing for more alone time

95
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.200
Cynthia We: Yeah.

96
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

97
00:08:48.540 --> 00:09:00.930
Cynthia We: I deal with them to the part I really like I went I had fun and I walk and I'm I played soccer with Teagan

98
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.160
Cynthia We: Then yesterday to not

99
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

100
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.290
Cynthia We: Today in the middle of doing something

101
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.000
Cynthia We: And I thought,

102
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.580
Cynthia We: That maybe that would be expected because before

103
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.710
Cynthia We: And I'm here, throwing a temper tantrum like a child.

104
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so we're talking about sorry the connection is not 100% I want to say that back.

105
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Today I want to stay home and work on something.

106
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.580
Cynthia We: Yeah, I was looking for.

107
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on.

108
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.680
Cynthia We: From high school

109
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.890
Cynthia We: High School.

110
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.380
Cynthia We: Is today.

111
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.950
Cynthia We: So,

112
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.900
Cynthia We: Looking

113
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.560
Cynthia We: In the middle of all these pictures in these back in

114
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.470
Cynthia We: High School. So on their faces like

115
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.330
Cynthia We: I just needed some ways to deal with it.

116
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:43.080
Cynthia We: Now, Scott deals with it a different way, deals with it by getting together the kids going and doing things. That's how I deal

117
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.990
Cynthia We: And he doesn't seem to understand

118
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.300
Cynthia We: ever really sad.

119
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.200
Cynthia We: Very sad. It was as we are, you have the tails, but it

120
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.930
Cynthia We: Is not a stroke on my god

121
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so sorry.

122
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy.

123
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.950
Cynthia We: He moved to the UK with me.

124
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.360
Cynthia We: Tonight at seven.

125
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:35.790
Cynthia We: We moved to New York. I got up there, but he didn't have a job. We just and I loaded a U Haul in Chicago. And then I stopped by Michigan pick them up and I left it like this much in

126
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.650
Cynthia We: The U Haul truck and

127
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:56.250
Cynthia We: We moved out there and there was something wrong with our place that we're going to stay so it's Jody's boyfriend in Queens and it was just a big, big long drawn out or deal. And then we finally got a place

128
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:57.750
Cynthia We: And

129
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:15.300
Cynthia We: ended up leaving because Scott and I had gotten all of us were part of this for Carolyn Scott and I had started to like it a little too much and I think he was really uncomfortable with it. And so he left and went back to Michigan.

130
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.100
Cynthia We: We've always been friends with we've maintained a friendship and

131
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.930
Cynthia We: You know Scott and he and Scott were

132
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.950
Cynthia We: Closer because they were friends first. That's how I know him.

133
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:38.250
Cynthia We: But I'm even when Scott and I worked together like art and I were friends. And he came to visit it. Which state. He came to visit me in Chicago.

134
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.630
Cynthia We: And

135
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:46.290
Cynthia We: There's just, there's this luxury. It's a big empty space.

136
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.240
Cynthia We: So I needed some space and I'm

137
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.900
Cynthia We: Got through a little temper tantrum and

138
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.920
Cynthia We: I think maybe I need to figure out a way to say it.

139
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.620
Cynthia We: So that he stops taking these things personally. They have nothing to do with

140
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

141
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:23.190
Cynthia We: You know I'm laughing matter than the kids hear him get out his kids have this perception that mama never wants to do anything with them.

142
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.500
Cynthia We: In actuality it's maladies space. I was having a heart attack.

143
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

144
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's

145
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, Scott taking things personally. You think the kids are taking it personally. Scott thinks that you're

146
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: His kids are taking it personally because you're rejecting them and

147
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see that you take things personally

148
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.780
Cynthia We: Can you say yes to that.

149
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's why I'm here because we're all doing it. We're all doing the same thing. You can see it in someone else, it's just harder to see it when we're doing it.

150
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We've been addressing this all along and goes by different names.

151
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm Shane activated.

152
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: My could be that space. But the bottom line is this

153
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you stop.

154
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing tantrum yelling any behavior from other people as a reflection of your value.

155
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Something really big is going to change in you.

156
00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You still waiting for him to stop a behavior and then you will start

157
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A behavior, but you're still waiting for him. They them.

158
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To change.

159
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we will proceed. It doesn't work like that.

160
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, you keep doing it, even though I sell it. I try and shape it, put it in this container. I put a bow on it and I

161
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.810
Cynthia We: Do like I really understand the concept I really understand it. Um,

162
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's this. He has a tantrum and you look and you

163
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that's a tantrum.

164
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But then

165
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You reinforce it.

166
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't even know you're doing it when you

167
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend time go for the walk and cave and

168
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: They're reinforcing it and I know we don't mean to do that reinforce negative behavior, but we do it, we do it because it's easier. It seems easier in the moment to not confront it.

169
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:19.500
Cynthia We: Or hunt. It is like that. I do not want to always do things with. So, so when I want to. And I do want to time.

170
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.900
Cynthia We: I will agree to go

171
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that would be good except you do something when he has a tantrum.

172
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.370
Cynthia We: No, I don't think so.

173
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it. Well, what did you do that day.

174
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.920
Cynthia We: And he had when he had a tantrum. Well, I didn't, I didn't go

175
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.780
Cynthia We: Um,

176
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.840
Cynthia We: I just stayed home and I continue doing what I'm doing. I did feel today and I

177
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.580
Cynthia We: I felt angry that he didn't just understand me.

178
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.240
Cynthia We: I tried to approach him.

179
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.690
Cynthia We: I did try and approach it later because

180
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:14.280
Cynthia We: Yeah. After the kids went to bed and I said you know i i really it's not

181
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.570
Cynthia We: Today I needed to spend time going through those pictures I needed the time alone.

182
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.190
Cynthia We: Um,

183
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:31.530
Cynthia We: You understand that it has nothing to do with wanting to spend time with you guys or not as a family.

184
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.330
Cynthia We: Um,

185
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.350
Cynthia We: I think he's too wrapped up in his own stuff to purchase think

186
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.700
Cynthia We: Is that really listening. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I did hear that you did sort of maintain that position.

188
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.810
Cynthia We: Yeah.

189
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: stayed home and later on you attempted

190
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Excuse me, a clarification to try and explain your motivations.

191
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And but it fell on deaf ears.

192
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that she's still got hooked. Is this anger.

193
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.190
Cynthia We: Yeah.

194
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'd be it'd be one thing if you said to me, I promise you. When

195
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I was angry, and it didn't leak out anywhere. I promise you, it didn't. I was mad, mad about that and it didn't leak anywhere else.

196
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.660
Cynthia We: I don't think it leaked out

197
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.010
Cynthia We: I don't think so. But I'm not 100% sure

198
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

199
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Let's, um, let's come back a little bit. Let's, let's just, we'll go with didn't, didn't leak.

200
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

201
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If you knew

202
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be spending. This is sort of an exaggeration but spend the rest of your life.

203
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Right with him and he's going to continue to act out his emotions.

204
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's a tantrum.

205
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: being realistic.

206
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.900
Cynthia We: Answer.

207
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Not great. I think you said I don't have an answer. I think that's

208
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.380
Cynthia We: I don't know how to answer this

209
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a complicated one, because maybe the longing to have it be something else is maybe strong and then the reality of it's been this way for so long. Maybe it will be like that, in the future, like those two things are opposite energies, you know,

210
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm talking about right now is the is the radical acceptance stuff. It happened.

211
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It did.

212
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.810
Yeah.

213
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You held on to what you wanted to do for your reasons, the choice was about the anger, why bother being angry about it. He was behaved in a very protective. I get the logic. Don't get me wrong, I get. I get the I'd be pissed, too, but it is a place of choice.

214
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have just

215
00:20:48.480 --> 00:21:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Seen it and not taking it on not gotten hope seen it named it that's tantrum. I'm going to spend time going to be in here going to be grieving. This is going to be one of the first pieces of it is I'm going to be looking to these pictures and greeting and

216
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: there'd be nothing left. There'd be no no energy left to it then there'd be I see him in the hall. Later that day when they came back.

217
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

218
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you told me no, there was no leaking. You didn't have any more anger and it didn't, it didn't show up.

219
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.750
Cynthia We: Yeah, it didn't show up and I don't feel that I was very angry.

220
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.740
Cynthia We: This time

221
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

222
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.040
Cynthia We: Maybe I was frustrated, a little bit and like just kind of like, oh,

223
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.440
Cynthia We: Come on.

224
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.710
Cynthia We: I'm okay.

225
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.440
Cynthia We: I don't feel like I've got. I don't think it was the same as what I usually do.

226
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

227
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now it's happening right now. Notice how you

228
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.750
Cynthia We: Don't you know me, I know.

229
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Well, right. So you said earlier, just understand me you wanted that now you I think you said why don't you know me by now.

230
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.770
Cynthia We: Yeah, yeah. It's funny because we just

231
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.250
Cynthia We: Mind him all the time.

232
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.350
Cynthia We: This was all about my

233
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.400
Cynthia We: Feeling okay going outside and reading a chapter of a book, instead of smoking.

234
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

235
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So, or staying in and looking through pictures. It doesn't matter where it is. It's your space, it's your time and another words inside, outside

236
00:22:48.180 --> 00:23:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you, having that whatever space you want. Maybe I want it with other people and in 10 minutes, it might be different. But what I want need right now is in opposition, sometimes with what someone else needs and wants. And that will be

237
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.240
Cynthia We: Okay, that's life.

238
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's right in there. So right now you just in a sense, and he fought for that in here with me even make sure even though I pressed it was trying to label okay angers leaking. I'm sure of it right you held on

239
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And your position and you're like, No, I don't think so. I don't think so. You didn't at least two to three times. I don't think that's it. Right. Did you see did that.

240
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now, you didn't take ongoing of your stuff. You just held on

241
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't think that's really true for me. I don't think I've looked I'm looking, I'm visiting those memories. Don't forget leaked was a little frustrated and and kind of the thought was dancin know me by now.

242
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And wouldn't it be nice if he

243
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Could have the assumption

244
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how Cindy grieves

245
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: She kind of goes through times where she pulls in she she refuels by pulling in where she read. She writes, she does these Mitchell come out and play with us. And that wouldn't have to defend and explain that over and over would be nice.

246
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.240
Cynthia We: Yeah.

247
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:47.460
Cynthia We: Have god you know I did go to the park with them. The other day I did go for a walk with him a few times this week. And that's really good. Good.

248
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.680
Cynthia We: To be primarily me

249
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have you forgotten how good that can feel

250
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.100
Cynthia We: Um, yeah.

251
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So in some ways.

252
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That reminder that Scott offers. Sometimes I feel annoying and invasive and other times it's a nice reminder to come out.

253
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And play. Yeah.

254
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to my space my space.

255
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To walk outside without having to explain

256
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

257
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.830
Cynthia We: So what's really weird that I'm

258
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:46.440
Cynthia We: Reading a book is perceived by some people as being lazy.

259
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.610
Cynthia We: Like I may as well be taking a nap.

260
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:58.800
Cynthia We: Which is the exact opposite of how I feel and how I feel we should be modeling for our kids.

261
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:14.340
Cynthia We: Right, because they all of a sudden realized they don't read, they're not reading. They're not reading it all. I am such a reader and I'm such a reader. When I was growing up, and I think it's so important.

262
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.270
Cynthia We: They're not even doing they're eating before bed. I have no interest in it, they've taken after Scott's family.

263
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you stay with those convictions and values. What are you doing to stand present and sort of represent those kind of the way you represented in here and you stood in that truth okay so

264
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you make sure

265
00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.680
Cynthia We: They should pick up a damn book and go sit in front of them and read

266
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.510
Cynthia We: All day long.

267
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, why not

268
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.240
Cynthia We: Yes, yes.

269
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:05.790
Cynthia We: Um, the fact that Scott's perception of what reading is influenced my behavior so much, really, really, really disturbing to me.

270
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it the same thing as I took personally his assessment his definition of what reading is I took it on. It wasn't mine took it on for a while and now, maybe you don't want to take it on anymore.

271
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.040
Cynthia We: Um, I think so.

272
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:46.620
Cynthia We: Okay, I wouldn't when he first of maybe like three or four years ago would come home from work, I would get my Kindle out and I would just read, I would read like crazy because that only time I could when he was home.

273
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.610
Cynthia We: Home I little kids that I was always taking care of

274
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:57.810
Cynthia We: So he said to me a few times. Is that all you ever do is sit around and read. And I'm like,

275
00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.580
Cynthia We: Oh,

276
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.260
Cynthia We: No, I just do when your own because I can

277
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.570
Cynthia We: And and

278
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.000
Cynthia We: I think he said it again. And so I stopped reading my Kindle.

279
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

280
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:23.520
Cynthia We: I well i think that not looking at my Kindle is probably better I should have an actual book. It's a Kindle. I'm

281
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that we're missing the point here. Let's go back.

282
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.080
Cynthia We: If you work for the for the kids purposes.

283
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.550
Cynthia We: I it rather than having me, stare at a screen, they should see me reading a book.

284
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only that,

285
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.160
Cynthia We: It's not the point at all.

286
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I know there's so many things going on. Um, I'm going to invite you to turn your video off. I don't want to miss about what you're saying right now.

287
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just do. There we go. So let's let's

288
00:28:53.730 --> 00:29:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to stay on the Kindle versus I haven't done all the research on it but just hearing people talk about the screen the sort of that backlit screen. How many hours are going on for kids.

289
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Something to be said, scientifically, I think biologically around sleep circadian rhythms.

290
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Etc. And so you're reading book book has some real biological validity there so

291
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I see what you're saying. Like the actual turning of the pages and getting away from the backlit screens on but

292
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.640
Cynthia We: There's opposed to see you, or something. So see they're reading books.

293
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.200
Cynthia We: And that helps them. I don't know how old they were talking about.

294
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:53.850
Cynthia We: But when the kids were babies that they should see us reading books if if we want to have them to be readers and

295
00:29:54.870 --> 00:30:00.690
Cynthia We: And seeing you stare green is not the same thing as seeing you read a book.

296
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.750
Cynthia We: Know it comes off completely.

297
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.090
Cynthia We: The opposite way that you want it to.

298
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So something that you could explore on your own research. Maybe that's probably available through a couple articles online edit.

299
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, though, can we visit this, I want you to picture Scott saying now.

300
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that all you ever do when your home.

301
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is read now.

302
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what would you do, what would you say, how would you respond

303
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If he said that in current day like soon like today or yesterday. Like, what would you, how would you respond to that.

304
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.090
Cynthia We: I would say

305
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.920
Cynthia We: No, it's not all I do.

306
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:04.470
Cynthia We: But it is a hobby of mine and something I really enjoy doing and

307
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:13.500
Cynthia We: So because we are stuck at home, probably doing it more than I usually do, but it's what I love to do.

308
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, do you notice how

309
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You yourself. Everyone right we

310
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Say things and do things because we want a certain feeling and we're trying to express a certain feeling. And do you notice how you defended content right there. No, and you went into content.

311
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.880
Cynthia We: Though I don't know.

312
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what happened. It was

313
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You talked about book.

314
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

315
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's content. Now go behind that.

316
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What does Scott feel when he sees you reading

317
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know

318
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.800
Cynthia We: Yeah, I have no idea. That's a very good question, but

319
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why he said, is that all you do. And I'm not around history just. That's why you mean we all speak about content is we have we have an emotion behind it. We have a reason we have, we are motivated by something. Otherwise, we don't say anything, typically

320
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.580
Yeah.

321
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how another option to that today if you can remember these things is like

322
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott. How does it feel when I'm here again, reading, you know, I noticed that right last the last afternoon, you kind of walked by. I'm

323
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: From a walk and I was reading and I noticed when you came in to the bedroom. The other night I was reading. How do you feel when each time you see me in the house. I'm reading

324
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.510
You see,

325
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: A difference that is

326
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:57.240
Yeah.

327
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.240
Cynthia We: I wonder

328
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:14.040
Cynthia We: I don't know. I have never ever asked that question. So I really should question is I am curious about why

329
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.800
Cynthia We: There seems to be so.

330
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.310
Cynthia We: Seems to be like upsetting for him.

331
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So the paradox here is Cindy, he might be thinking, shouldn't she know me by now.

332
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.260
Cynthia We: Oh that's fun.

333
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Being kind of ironic here unintentional.

334
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.860
Cynthia We: Yeah. Well, funny, that's very take it was very good way to put that. Because

335
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.720
Cynthia We: No.

336
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.860
Cynthia We: Why would I know the answer to that question.

337
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you can hold that space like

338
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're gonna have to maybe give him that benefit the doubt to

339
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.030
Cynthia We: Uh huh.

340
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't understand

341
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Why on earth. You've got this extra time with your family, you're not spending it with them, he doesn't understand his mind works differently.

342
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:13.260
Yeah.

343
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's a good thing because, do we really want to be married to ourselves.

344
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.530
Cynthia We: No, no.

345
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we take the I'm bad away from it. He sees me as bad broken and wrong. We take that part out. Then it's I'm using that skill of curiosity and I can actually

346
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Sponsoring it asked me, he's done this a few times.

347
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how he feels every time he sees me reading. I'm going to go find out. Seems like I'm seeing something here. What is that

348
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Until we can investigate and our tongue is going to be kind, it's not going to be accusatory i don't think

349
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't say, Why are you asking

350
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If we use the word wine, you may want to just sort of took that one in a safety box at Wells Fargo for a little while. It's a, it's a problematic one it's going to create defensiveness.

351
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.120
Yeah.

352
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you, you and I, you, more importantly, might discover something you and i right now can't even guess

353
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:35.610
Cynthia We: Like

354
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe he grew up with a particular sense of being second to something

355
00:35:46.740 --> 00:36:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're reading that book brings it back as if it's happening again and again and again. Again, this unwanted feeling and it's just as simple as Cindy doing her thing. It's not right, it's not wrong just is.

356
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's nothing like that. We don't know.

357
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be. I'm so jealous that you have this thing that that you can enjoy. Right. Why, why can't it be any of these other things except

358
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to defend yourself. You don't. You can go a different direction with that exchange. You can be curious about what your husband is experiencing you know yours. I know I want to refuel and I get it through, through this reading

359
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Boys.

360
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to

361
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.840
Cynthia We: We did bring up um

362
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.600
Cynthia We: He taught. He was talking about.

363
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:51.690
Cynthia We: The books that we were reading when we lived in New York. I'm just talking about this the other day.

364
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.560
Cynthia We: And how he was, he read

365
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:07.950
Cynthia We: Million little pieces. Do you know that guy that lie his memoir, he lied about his story. And he wrote about it. And oh, he lied to Oprah. It was really

366
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:23.640
Cynthia We: Um, that was like in 2000 I think 2000 and right around the same time, there was this guy JT Leroy, who wrote a book Sarah and Scott was reading all these books.

367
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:32.430
Cynthia We: At the same time, I was like we were reading a lot. And, um, I think that was unusual for him to read a lot because he had some trouble reading

368
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:47.160
Cynthia We: Oh, I'm like, not dyslexia, but just he had trouble focusing on books, but he was reading and he talked about it. The other night like you really missed it.

369
00:37:47.760 --> 00:38:01.830
Cynthia We: If you really missed being really into those books and I'm feeling like I really connected with the authors JT Leroy ended up being a false person that

370
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:12.330
Cynthia We: was somewhat of a celebrity and had showed up around Manhattan. Lower East Side of Manhattan. Turned out it was actually a girl.

371
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:33.150
Cynthia We: Who worked for the suicide happen, and she took the stories of people who had called in and turned it into a memoir, so called memoir and put these books out there and I'm Scott was devastated by these revelations, because if you read a true story.

372
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:42.240
Cynthia We: You want to know that it's true. And, and I think it takes a lot away from it. If you find out it's false, and I'm

373
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:52.260
Cynthia We: It was just talking about that, which I thought was interested forgotten about us reading those books and how she was reading

374
00:38:53.070 --> 00:39:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice you didn't see how he felt. But you are talking about some rationale about how he might have had a strong feeling

375
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.380
Cynthia We: Uh huh.

376
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To betrayal.

377
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.430
Cynthia We: Your trail. Yeah.

378
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Like an idiot like a fool, like a sucker.

379
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.270
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

380
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.290
Ah,

381
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

382
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:22.710
Cynthia We: You read anything. How can you believe anything anybody says after your heart has been broken like that.

383
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.420
Cynthia We: Is you identify these were like broken characters and and

384
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:47.400
Cynthia We: Both of us felt so bad for that, especially the JT Leroy stuff was just heartbreaking shed and it really felt yucky that it wasn't true.

385
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's true for someone

386
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.910
Cynthia We: Well, it's true for some, but not the person who wrote it.

387
00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: but that says more about how you hear

388
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerate someone misrepresenting how Scott over here, tolerates the meaning he makes out of represented a misrepresentation and how you to get to talk about it. It could have been right and you were talking a little bit, but do we just stop reading, do we stop. No.

389
00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

390
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are we around misrepresentation basically someone the lying to us.

391
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:29.340
Yeah.

392
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Who am I, who am I, who am I, why I'm a sucker. I'm a sucker. I'm a sucker. I'll get suckered again I'm embarrassed. I look like an idiot. I don't know what I'm doing.

393
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I walk it through. I walk it through sit with it a little longer isn't just that there's more underneath, that's a conversation with a sweetheart. Those are fun.

394
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all about feelings, but it's not about be okay.

395
00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about book.

396
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.120
Cynthia We: Right.

397
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You can soften there. You can find your grace, they're not going to hung up on book and read

398
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I around the trail.

399
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We talk about it. Let's talk about it. Hey, and because I want you to actually have a lot in common, when we did that relationship vision thing have a lot of overlap.

400
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.200
Cynthia We: Uh huh.

401
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.700
So,

402
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a place to get connected

403
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:38.700
Cynthia We: Yes, right.

404
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And to triangulate. Those are really easy ways like member or sometimes you'll hear me say, you know, you can always throw me under the bus and make me the bad guy.

405
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.510
Cynthia We: Oh, right, right.

406
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: My thumbs or YouTube

407
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.430
Cynthia We: Oh, no.

408
00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And make JT Leroy, the bad guy and you can kind of be like yeah and then awful. I felt like this and you feel like, Yeah, me too. Well, he's a bad guy or, you know, it's, it can be fun.

409
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.170
Cynthia We: But well,

410
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:09.810
Cynthia We: Yeah.

411
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.620
Cynthia We: I think we have

412
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:24.060
Cynthia We: Here, like anytime something like that starts to happen. Scott backs off and and

413
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:30.960
Cynthia We: Jumps on the person's side he's really uncomfortable with it.

414
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He would be on the side of justifying

415
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.140
Cynthia We: The awesome comfortable being on my side, I should say.

416
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.670
But

417
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. It's not a side, the whole sector is outdated.

418
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a side, it's a

419
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about. And guess what, in 20 minutes after this conversation. I might have a different thought isn't aside it so let's

420
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.040
Cynthia We: It's a way to connect

421
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's just talking but but it is a real thing for you to probably to have to swing. Am I the bad guy in this conversation, who's right, who's wrong. That's the habit. That's the thing that needs to break

422
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:22.650
Cynthia We: Why right

423
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get there. One of you at a time, at least one of you if you can find it sooner than he can then you do it. And this is how you do it when he says something like

424
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess you really don't want to hang out with the family. Oh, there you go again one day yourself. You're so selfish.

425
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a choice.

426
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, personally, focus on what he said or brief and remember. Hmm.

427
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what's money he made it. What is motivating him to say that

428
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You already know you're going to hear from me. That's passive aggression. We already know all the fancy words for it.

429
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But a lot. Good. That does yeah doesn't do any good. Just sitting there with a fancy label. What if you were curious about wonder why this person would use the passive aggression. What are what's going on behind it. Look at my tone. Look at how I am. My whole position my disposition is like

430
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

431
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is very different than

432
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:27.900
Cynthia We: Uh huh.

433
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Here you asked me that I have every right I have every right to have my alone time and all you do is you should know me by now is just a wholly different type

434
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.960
Cynthia We: Of the different

435
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone's got to start it, you're the one in therapy. My guess is it'll be you. You don't have to. You can keep meeting it with you should know you should know

436
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been 20 years already.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.420
Cynthia We: Yeah.

438
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, remember the stuff I SAY I SAY YOU REALLY you want to be assumed to be exactly the same Olson.

439
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.670
Cynthia We: Right. No, I don't.

440
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, Cindy, or do you kind of want to be seen as kind of like a wonderful Cindy's up to today. Wonder what her but she's what's going on her big beautiful mind, you know, like to be seen as waking a new

441
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.130
Cynthia We: Mm hmm.

442
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.180
Yeah.

443
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy.

444
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we are down here to the end, I would really like to see you again. I, I miss seeing you. Can you bring your video back

Cynthia We: Right now, what do you mean he missed seeing me. I just saw you two seconds ago.

448
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.280
Cynthia We: Wasn't on video because I could still

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: make it possible for me to hear you a little better. So I'm

450
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.370
Cynthia We: going good.

451
00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But still it's, um, it's a problem. I'm thinking

452
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's your Xfinity thing.

453
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.740
Cynthia We: I think it should I call Xfinity I think I'll call Xfinity

Cynthia We: I am going to start doing some streaming video actually as props to I can feel myself getting pretty depressed.

459
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me hear the streaming video. I didn't hear the first part of it. I'm getting depressed. Tell me what you're going to do streaming video Tony my

460
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.570
Cynthia We: Whoa, just sighs

461
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:38.760
Cynthia We: Exercising

462
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, fantastic.

463
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Oh, I love it. And I want to continue to say this is a rare opportunity to connect with people that you have now connected with in many years and meet in here in zoom. I'm telling you.

464
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is bringing us together where we pulled away for years. You can pull in and maybe you do a meditation. Maybe you bring up a topic of exploration, or what is grief for you or don't don't rob yourself of what this isolation thing right this so lockdown.

465
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever. Everyone's got or emptiness shelter status, whatever you guys are calling it

466
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm seeing it be a positive, it could be around to exercise to anyone want to take a yoga class I ran across this little

467
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This little chicken do she pretty good. How about we take it together and we giggle and laugh and we stretch together. You want to eat on a zoom me me on another one. And I'm like, Oh, that one hurt and you laughing Why not take a class together.

468
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: may not meet there and do your kids to

469
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:51.390
Cynthia We: Yes, I was thinking about doing a breakdancing class with them very

470
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.960
Cynthia We: Well, and there's the we have Playstation, which has

471
00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.910
Cynthia We: The dance the dance the dance game I it's funny.

472
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.870
Cynthia We: Um, so yeah i think that that will help

473
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:18.090
Cynthia We: I used to be on so many different antidepressants and I'm just taking the Wellbutrin now for the smoking, but I don't want to go back into the antidepressant.

474
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:20.850
Cynthia We: Saying

475
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, How badly do not want to do it.

476
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:30.480
Cynthia We: Um, well, I'm keeping the option open if the exercise doesn't help.

477
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:42.660
Cynthia We: The option is always going to be open because it did say if but but it's not my first choice. I'm not, I'm not opposed to it. I just

478
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:45.600
Cynthia We: I'd rather not.

479
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:48.030
Cynthia We: Make

480
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you also did the behavioral experiments that you and I, brainstorming here. Why did he roll them out. What if you did them.

481
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As routinely as you take up SSRI. What did you get them with fidelity. What did you actually found out is this stuff going on in therapy worth a damn what did you get it.

482
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.150
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

483
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:22.800
Cynthia We: And meditation every day instead of sporadic very helpful.

484
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You said to me, I, I can't remember where it is. I thought it in notes, I

485
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:37.290
Cynthia We: Think I'm probably doing it like four and a half times a week, but I bet you if I did it every day. It would help me more me

486
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You have said to me, You need to be going to NA NA meeting.

487
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.480
Yeah.

488
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not doing it.

489
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.280
Cynthia We: With chocolate. I go, I could go online.

490
00:49:48.750 --> 00:50:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just do it. Why don't you rule out everything else if depression continues to nudge at you. Well, that all right but if you said, How badly do not want it because could

491
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Just doing it sort of holistically here with this cognitive behavioral stuff and see if there's anything to it.

492
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can really say to this, this guy or this gal. You know, I really tried this stuff and

493
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it every day. And I did this many times today and I did it. I did it in. Still, it just feels chemical because it's true for buprenorphine when you're still on it messes with the serotonin. Okay, so

494
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There are chemical things going on. It's a both. And so how do we

495
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn up the things that we enjoy because it's not happening naturally. I've got to do those things on purpose. And they're inconvenient and I don't want to, but I don't want to be on a medication.

496
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I gotta jump out of here. But I do want to hear from you. Just a quick little self reflection kind of go in inward kind of see the little snapshots. If you can just how I came in.

497
00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: As another few minutes into the session, then this happened and I felt this

498
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I said that, then this just sort of walk yourself through

499
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what the takeaway for today is for you. What's important for you.

500
00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.870
Cynthia We: I feel I'm going to

501
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:34.380
Cynthia We: Really focus on doing things that I would like to do to stay medicine and I'm also going to try

502
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.900
Cynthia We: To be curious with God. Yeah.

503
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's played out. You're probably sick of hearing it but choose curiosity over being right.

504
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll get you the

505
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.070
Cynthia We: So true.

506
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You will look graceful.

507
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.200
Yeah.

508
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will roam on

509
00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:00.840
Cynthia We: I think it's totally is the interaction.

510
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, do you want to meet again next Thursday at 10

511
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. Then I will see you when I see and grew up. I kind of lose track of that timing, but either way. I'll see you next Thursday.

512
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.070
Cynthia We: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
