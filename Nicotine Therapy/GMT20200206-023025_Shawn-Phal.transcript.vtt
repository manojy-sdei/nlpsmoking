Alex Mancini: got away with it.

61
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.350

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.590
Alex Mancini: He was pissed up my sisters for doing it. He lives with one of my sisters

68
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.720

69
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.740

75
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.750
Shawn Phalen: So it's kind of interesting. They want to give you 60 days in patient

76
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.490
Alex Mancini: Even though I'm already doing this.

77
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:48.870
Alex Mancini: Maybe that can be thrown out the window to, you know, yeah. Because I, I believe that you guys sent my attorney like that bright heart sent my attorney, the proof that I'm in the program. And what I'm doing.

78
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.490
Alex Mancini: And then obviously you guys test me so that's there to

79
00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:08.850
Alex Mancini: Me and then I also got the thing from Azure saying that I did their program as well. Okay, so I don't know. Okay, so tell me, why did you start using odysseys.

80
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.380

Alex Mancini: And then

84
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.860
Alex Mancini: Enjoy obviously enjoyed the high from it. So we do it off and on.

85
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.750
Alex Mancini: Because of that,

86
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:44.340
Alex Mancini: And then a couple years ago was like really picked up and I was in like a terrible relationship.

87
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.200
Alex Mancini: And kind of use that to have as numb myself from that.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.500
Shawn Phalen: Do you go to any A, A, an A or a me

144
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:35.700
Alex Mancini: Hey, I usually go to like one or two week. They're not my favorite thing I'm mainly because I kind of brings me down and really like just people complaining about everything and just it just really brings me down, for whatever reason, so I usually go to one or two a week.

145
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:48.840
Alex Mancini: And is there one that you like better. Do you like air and a better. Um, hey, yeah. Yeah, I hear that a lot. Yeah.

146
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:56.910
Alex Mancini: Just for whatever reason I've even though I'm not an alcoholic does seem to enjoy their meetings better

147
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.160
Shawn Phalen: Do you go to speaker meetings.

148
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.790
Alex Mancini: No. Well, what, what do you, what do you mean speakers.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:16.290
Alex Mancini: No, I have not. Those are not bad. You might really yeah I would say just that you check those out.

151
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:28.290
Sometimes they have some really amazing people that speak that have long term sobriety and they don't, um,

152
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:43.470
Alex Mancini: It's just different than a normal meeting where you're hearing people complaining and right exactly stuff that you don't like. So, um, yeah. Try and usually speaker meetings are like Friday or Saturday night. Okay.

153
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.370
Alex Mancini: Well, look, some of them. Yeah. If it's a good meeting. It's packed. Okay.

Um,

158
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.910
It said anytime you wanted to have individual counseling, you can do that.

159
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:29.640
Alex Mancini: That will, and that was part of the reason why you and I met and I asked all these background questions because I'm one of the therapists and I so I could meet with you instead of the group. Yeah, so you'd have to do both. Yeah, okay.

160
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:44.040
Shawn Phalen: Have to do the group that's have to have to have. You don't have to do the individual counseling in less you want and sometimes it just doesn't work for people because they're working, they can

161
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.900
Alex Mancini: Work it into their schedule.

162
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.040
Shawn Phalen: Already just don't want it because they might be working with an outside counsel or two.

163
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.390
Alex Mancini: Could we do that then. Yeah. So do you want to set another appointment. Yeah, if we, if we can, yeah.
