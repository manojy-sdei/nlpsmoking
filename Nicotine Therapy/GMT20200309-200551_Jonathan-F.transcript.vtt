Jonathan Figg: Right.

305
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.690
And so you took

306
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.150
Jonathan Figg: The took the other half.

307
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.550
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, and

308
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.650
Michael Bailey: I was trying to make our time to make your last, you know, did you

309
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.460
Jonathan Figg: Basically at the same time, or with us was that spaced out

310
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.240
Michael Bailey: Well, within a few days, you know,

311
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.130
Jonathan Figg: Within a few days. Okay. So you took the half a stripper or just, you know, by itself, when you took

312
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.880
Michael Bailey: Just to have

313
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.220
Jonathan Figg: The first time did it make you sleepy.

314
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:33.120
Michael Bailey: Yeah, but I took that and do that, let's do it. I'll see your ad opium, you'll see in a minute. I wouldn't do as much opium when I took the A when I did do Sebastian.

315
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.710
Michael Bailey: Know,

316
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:42.120
Michael Bailey: A little bit that I don't see it was it was already like governor strips.

317
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.260
Okay, so

318
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.370
Michael Bailey: There's the bar. I wouldn't use

319
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:54.120
Michael Bailey: The opium as much as ID fighting. They have nothing. No.

320
00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:04.650
Jonathan Figg: No. So let's talk about the medication and let's talk about what we do with bright heart so Suboxone is a brand name for the medication.

321
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.960
Jonathan Figg: Of you moving right buprenorphine is an opiate like

322
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.430
Michael Bailey: OPM is in the

323
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.770
Jonathan Figg: That's the kind of drug. It is as a kind of medication is and it has specific

324
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.880
Michael Bailey: On your brain.

325
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:25.170
Jonathan Figg: So it has a pleasurable sensation opiates. Do they turn off pain they make you sleepy.

326
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.800
Jonathan Figg: Yes, stop you from breathing taken off. Okay.

327
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:41.160
Jonathan Figg: Well that's Suboxone buprenorphine is what we consider it to be a safer opiate because it does not turn off your breathing the way other opiates do

328
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.340
Jonathan Figg: It could make you sleep it off of it, but it has a

329
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:53.010
Jonathan Figg: ceiling effect. So taking more and more and more doesn't have any additional effects beyond a certain doubts and so it makes it difficult to overdose on so

330
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.350
Jonathan Figg: Tends to be safer from that.

331
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.460
Michael Bailey: So,

332
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.660
Jonathan Figg: Tends to have

333
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:07.350
Jonathan Figg: A lower potential for abuse because it doesn't have the same high that other opiates do so it's a little bit easier to keep

334
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.550
Michael Bailey: All of

335
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.260
Jonathan Figg: But

336
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.130
Jonathan Figg: I want you

337
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:20.370
Jonathan Figg: And that currently you are dependent on opiates. If you stop taking them. You go into withdrawal right nothing that we

338
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:27.120
Jonathan Figg: Were do can suddenly change that there's no overnight magic change. So you're currently

339
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:41.040
Jonathan Figg: On opiates and if we change you over and start you on Suboxone you will still be dependent on opiates will be dependent on the Suboxone and if you suddenly stop it, you'll go into withdrawal. I want you to understand that, so

340
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.910
Michael Bailey: Yes.

341
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.880
Jonathan Figg: You treatment. It's a long term plan to slowly to burst, we get people out of withdrawal. So they're not having cravings.

342
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.960
Michael Bailey: To other stuff.

343
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.130
Jonathan Figg: They reuse. Okay.

344
00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:03.420
Jonathan Figg: So that they feel stay all on a doses Suboxone their functional, they can do the things that they want. They don't have to spend all their time and money, looking for other stuff. That's the first thing. The

345
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.580
Michael Bailey: Second thing is that

346
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:14.940
Jonathan Figg: Over the long term. If the plan is to get you off entirely. Then we slowly taper the dose down very. Yes. Okay.

347
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:26.400
Jonathan Figg: So that, though, that there's a manageable plan and so that you have time to be in a support group to do therapy so that you can develop

348
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.400
Michael Bailey: The skills to recovery. Okay.

349
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.080
Michael Bailey: Yes.

350
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:41.550
Jonathan Figg: It's important that you understand. Okay. So the other thing about buprenorphine so buprenorphine Suboxone so when it, when you take it. It has

351
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:58.470
Jonathan Figg: It holds on to the receptor in your brain tighter. And what that means is it has a blocking effect if you're on Suboxone and you take other stuff. The other stuff have the same effect. The Suboxone

352
00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.340
Me.

353
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.300
Michael Bailey: Let me plug my phone in

354
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.640
Michael Bailey: Okay, is losing George

355
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.660
Jonathan Figg: Jones. Yeah.

356
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.920
Jonathan Figg: Let's not let's not run out.

357
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.310
Jonathan Figg: Of battery.

358
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.910
Michael Bailey: Okay, there we go.

359
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.330
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so I want you to understand, one of the one of the

360
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.610
Michael Bailey: useful thing to hear me. Yeah, I can hear.

361
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:30.780
Jonathan Figg: Good. Okay, so one of the useful things is as Suboxone has a blocking effect, it will block the effect of other opiates. So if you're on Suboxone and if you're on a good dose.

362
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.540
Jonathan Figg: Then one you should have less craving to use OPM because you won't be in withdrawal.

363
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:51.390
Jonathan Figg: And two, if you do take opium. It's not going to have the same effect. It's going to have much less effect or no effect at all because it's Suboxone lock it, which is useful because we want you to have every reason to stop using opium right

364
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.190
Jonathan Figg: Hello. Does that make sense.

365
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.310
Jonathan Figg: Religion.

366
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.470
I

367
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.660
Think I lost

368
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.290
I lost the band connection.

369
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.610
pause the recording until he comes.

370
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.220
Back.

371
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.610
Jonathan Figg: You need to turn on your sound.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.620
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me ok I

373
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.710
Michael Bailey: Can hear me now.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.600
Jonathan Figg: I'm gonna I'm gonna stop your video again because it seems to keep us connected better. Okay.

376
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.640
Michael Bailey: Can you

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.100
Michael Bailey: Use these phones, a little charge real fast.

378
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.940
Michael Bailey: When I looked up with I've seen it going down. That's what I mentioned it was

379
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.460
Michael Bailey: Was it wasn't long enough to go off yet. I mean it didn't seem that. Can you hear me.

380
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.080
Jonathan Figg: That's okay. Yeah, I can hear you.

381
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.360
Michael Bailey: I can barely

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.550
Michael Bailey: You need to turn there you

383
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.590
Jonathan Figg: Need to turn the speakerphone back on.

384
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.500
Jonathan Figg: So see if you can see if you can find that option again for the speaker.

385
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.940
Jonathan Figg: There we go. Sounds like you got it.

386
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:41.730
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me.

387
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.060
Michael Bailey: Okay. Mine is not acting right

388
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.890
Jonathan Figg: Now. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay.

389
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.140
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me okay

390
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.470
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me okay

391
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:04.920
Michael Bailey: Yeah.

392
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:11.760
Jonathan Figg: All right. Super. So before we lost our connection. We're talking about the medication and the benefits that it has. Okay.

393
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.130
Michael Bailey: Okay.

394
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:19.560
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so, so the benefits that it has is it's going to get you out of withdrawal. It's going to help

395
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.010
Michael Bailey: Yes.

396
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.180
Jonathan Figg: You can help stop your cravings to use OPM and

397
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.660
Michael Bailey: Yes.

398
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:28.770
Jonathan Figg: And it will block the effect. If you do take opium. Okay.

399
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.810
Michael Bailey: Well, yes.

400
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:41.880
Jonathan Figg: All right the way Brian heart health works. Our organization is it were a recovery program were centered around weekly support groups. So we put people into a support.

401
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.270
Michael Bailey: With us

402
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.820
Jonathan Figg: On over zoom just like we're having a conversation now except with a group of people

403
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.330
Michael Bailey: Yes.

404
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:58.800
Jonathan Figg: Who have had similar issues with opiates and are in various stages of recovery, so they can support each other. It's kind of like an A, we

405
00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:58.980
Michael Bailey: Have

406
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.410
Jonathan Figg: A meeting. It's about an

407
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.250
Michael Bailey: hour long

408
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.380
Jonathan Figg: It meets at the same time each

409
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:11.640
Jonathan Figg: Week and it's led by a counselor or therapist who has a history with addiction treatment. Okay.

410
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.920
Michael Bailey: And it starts. Yes.

411
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:24.300
Jonathan Figg: A check in with your doctor to make sure you're on the right dose of medication that you have a good supply. So you're not about to run out and

412
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:24.900
Michael Bailey: There's

413
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:34.530
Jonathan Figg: Who are in various stages of tapering off their dose that that's done in a slow and controlled manner. So you get lots of contact with your doctor does all of that.

414
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.850
Yes. Okay.

415
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:37.560
Michael Bailey: Okay, yes.

416
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:48.450
Jonathan Figg: One of the important things is we need to understand is to start Suboxone, you have to be in a little bit of withdrawal because

417
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:58.650
Jonathan Figg: If you have opium in your system when you take the Suboxone it will put you into a much worse withdrawal for a little while. It will make you wish you

418
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.250
Ran

419
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.930
Jonathan Figg: Yeah.

420
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.080
Michael Bailey: I read up on. I do a lot of reading on it.

421
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.600
Jonathan Figg: Good. So that's why we talked

422
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:13.320
Jonathan Figg: Earlier. Now your pattern of symptoms for withdrawal and how long they take to start so

423
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:25.380
Jonathan Figg: When you start withdrawal about a day and a half after you've taken your last Stokes, that's when you would potentially okay to take your first dose of Suboxone. Does that make sense.

424
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.860
Michael Bailey: Yes. Good.

425
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:42.510
Jonathan Figg: Based on what you told me about your previous experience with Suboxone I think that half of the strip which is four milligrams would be a good dose to

426
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.990
Jonathan Figg: Start

427
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.960
Jonathan Figg: Because that gets you out of withdrawal.

428
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.330
Michael Bailey: Yes.

429
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.740
Jonathan Figg: But what will determine your dose is so

430
00:35:54.090 --> 00:36:05.040
Jonathan Figg: Once we get the medication. Let's say you end up taking your first dose in the morning, you're going to wait a couple hours after you dissolve that half strip under your tongue to find out. Okay, are you

431
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.290
Jonathan Figg: All are not if you're not on withdrawal. That's fine. You don't have to take any more.

432
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.300
Jonathan Figg: Unless

433
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.020
Michael Bailey: You see us.

434
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:24.690
Jonathan Figg: Having withdrawal symptoms again in the evening or by the next warning when you should take your next dose. If you did start to have withdrawal symptoms and you need to go up on the dose to a full strip

435
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.150
Michael Bailey: Okay, okay.

436
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.430
Michael Bailey: Otherwise, they

437
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:41.100
Jonathan Figg: The same dose of Suboxone every day we want it to feel like any other medication, just like you take your pill for blood pressure every day. We don't want it to be.

438
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:50.070
Jonathan Figg: Okay, it's just a regular maintenance medication to help keep you functional. Does that make sense. Good. We don't want the dose to

439
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.520
Jonathan Figg: Go what

440
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.270
Jonathan Figg: Do you feel okay, good, good.

441
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:54.690
Michael Bailey: Okay.

442
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.100
Michael Bailey: Okay. All right, so

443
00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:07.620
Jonathan Figg: What I want to check on right now with you here with me is we're going to make sure we have the correct pharmacy for you.

444
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.880
Jonathan Figg: Alright is right eight on Gerber road the correct pharmacy for you.

445
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.490
Michael Bailey: Yes yes yes is

446
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.330
Jonathan Figg: The last thing we need to figure out is, which group, you could join now I have

447
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:32.040
Jonathan Figg: Support groups that I'm part of at 3pm on Tuesday and Thursday.

448
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.640
Jonathan Figg: Would I serve those work for you.

449
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.450
Michael Bailey: Tuesday, Thursday. Thursday.

450
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.690
Michael Bailey: Afternoon.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.450
Jonathan Figg: Thursday at 3pm.

452
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.580
Michael Bailey: I have one spots.

453
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.280
Michael Bailey: Okay.

454
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.340
Jonathan Figg: Would that work for you.

455
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.120

498
00:40:48.180 --> 00:41:04.830
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so we talked before that, that some time has to pass between the last time you take opium and the first time you start on Suboxone and then you need to be in a little bit of withdrawal. So we talked about your symptoms. I'm going to give you a prescription medication called Clonidine

499
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.140
Michael Bailey: Help

500
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.910
Jonathan Figg: Decrease the withdrawal so that it's not so nasty.

501
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.590
Michael Bailey: So that you can, they're

502
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.220

503
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.860
Michael Bailey: Okay, good.

504
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:30.330

505
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:31.680
