1
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.400
Dawn Abriel: Good morning, are you, Patrick.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
Dawn Abriel: You have audio.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.400
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I do.

4
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.040
Dawn Abriel: Great, okay. You're Patrick

5
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.109
Galaxy A10e: Okay.

6
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.400
Dawn Abriel: I'm Dr. Aubrey Well,

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.470
Dawn Abriel: We kind of have to rush through this, because you're almost 20 minutes late, so

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.540
Dawn Abriel: Let me get right to it. Okay. Because I have a 10 o'clock appointment.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.830
Dawn Abriel: Yet, look at when was the last time you had any opioid

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.630
Galaxy A10e: Maybe a few hours ago.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.030
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and it was heroin.

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.450
Galaxy A10e: No Suboxone

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.600
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And so that's the boxing that you're getting off the street.

14
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.010
Yes.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.890
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And how much did you take

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.690
Galaxy A10e: Or I take one or two a day but

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.000
Galaxy A10e: I took

18
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.870
Galaxy A10e: I took it home later on.

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.000
Dawn Abriel: Okay, just so you know that's not how this medicine is meant to be taken. You don't divide it up during the day.

20
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.550
Dawn Abriel: You take whatever you need, first thing in the morning, the same time every day.

21
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.240
Dawn Abriel: It, it stays in your body for 36 to 42 hours so

22
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.980
Dawn Abriel: The idea that you're going to have to take it throughout the day just doesn't make sense because it lasts so long and your body

23
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.910
Galaxy A10e: Well, sometimes I don't always have a steady send them out. Like if I will be prescribed, you remember, um,

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.500
Galaxy A10e: Sometimes I don't have like so many to take at a certain time. Sometimes you get one or two.

25
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.560
Galaxy A10e: Right, I understand that, but

26
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.640
Dawn Abriel: I'm just telling you so you don't do that, while you're in the program because it's

27
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.570
Galaxy A10e: Not appropriate

28
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.700
Galaxy A10e: OK, OK. I understand.

29
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.610
Dawn Abriel: All right, and

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.970
Dawn Abriel: When did you start doing the subs.

31
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.740
Galaxy A10e: Six months ago.

32
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.950
Galaxy A10e: About six months ago.

33
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.150
OK.

34
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480
Dawn Abriel: So the, the usual dose, were you doing heroin before

35
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.860
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

36
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.470
Dawn Abriel: Was the most amount of heroin, you had been doing

37
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.890
Galaxy A10e: Maybe a gram a day.

38
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.550
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah. So one strip or one and a half strip tomorrow morning, take

39
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.640
Dawn Abriel: Take another half a strip. As soon as we're done, and

40
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700
Dawn Abriel: Then take one and a half strips tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.170
Dawn Abriel: And let's see if that does it for you. My guess is that that will work for you.

42
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.930
Dawn Abriel: From Billy Graham Okay.

43
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.070

44
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.940

45
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.680
Galaxy A10e: 12 or something. Exactly. Crank pancreatitis, growing up.

46
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.150
Galaxy A10e: And

47
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.850
Galaxy A10e: I'd be prescribed

48
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.960
Galaxy A10e: Opiates for pain management and

49
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.380
Galaxy A10e: Just kind of stemmed from that name.

50
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.820
Dawn Abriel: So you've been on it for

51
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.270
Dawn Abriel: 21 years 22 years

52
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.870

53
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.380

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.590
Galaxy A10e: Never. It was inconclusive it on. I was two years old, dead.

57

Galaxy A10e: Spot or surgery.

58
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.660
Galaxy A10e: They said I ingest something toxic or was

59
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:55.080
Galaxy A10e: altimeter or maybe in a minister, Minister, Tony. Nice way to locate a toddler and they had me to Albuquerque, New Mexico children's hospitals are doing it for 3030 and they really didn't figure it out or nothing, and

60
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:06.750
Galaxy A10e: I would have like attacks throughout the year where I'd be hospitalized for like the week time in extreme pain and

61
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.960
Galaxy A10e: They would send me home with

271
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.120
Dawn Abriel: All right, good. Now let's talk about your program.

272
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:42.960
Dawn Abriel: You're going to have to find a way of setting your phone getting an alarm clock, you're going to have to find a way

273
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.650
Dawn Abriel: Of making appointments because twice a week, you're going to have to make an appointment.

274
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.540
Galaxy A10e: Okay.

275
00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:07.920
Dawn Abriel: This is really tough for addicts, they they blow they blow it off and I will prescribe your medicine, when you show up on time for group, you don't show up, you don't get your medicine.

276
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:28.830
Dawn Abriel: So this is how we we get you in so that you get the therapy. You need because the therapy is the real medicine. The, the Suboxone is the space holder. It gives you your life back enough so that you can, you know,

277
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.300
Dawn Abriel: Go to the dentist.

278
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.500
Dawn Abriel: So that you can find work when this whole thing, you know.

279
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.720
Dawn Abriel: Resolves

280
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:47.400
Dawn Abriel: But you got to get the therapy because the opioid has changed your brain, so, so much. You don't even know what you don't know.

281
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.480
Dawn Abriel: And in order for that wiring to get changed in your brain. You have to be in therapy.

282
00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:03.840
Dawn Abriel: So what you're committing to is one hour a week of group and one hour a week of individual therapy so

283
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.420
Dawn Abriel: Is there any reason why you couldn't come to a group on Tuesday at noon.

284
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay, then let's do that. So you're going to be with me as the physician and a therapist name when I'm here.

285
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:34.470
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to be sending you an email The email will have some really important numbers in it, don't throw it away. Keep the email because you're going to want to refer to it. So your group is it Tuesday at noon.

286
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:44.520
Dawn Abriel: That means you have to do a few things before group, you have to fill out a brief addiction monitor. We call it the BAM.

287
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:59.130
Dawn Abriel: And it's similar to one of the evaluations. You already did. But people can't talk about everything that's going on with them and group. So I look at all their bands. Every patient, every week, every time to see how they're doing.

288
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:06.780
Dawn Abriel: And the, the care coordinators in the virtual clinic where you went. Just before you came to see me.

289
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:15.030
Dawn Abriel: I think it was Jamie, you were dealing with and she will check to see that you did your BAM and

290
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:22.020
Dawn Abriel: Then she'll give you the group zoom number because it changes every week.

291
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:39.930
Dawn Abriel: When you're in group, it has to be like this. The lighting has to be good enough for us to see your facial expression and they're absolutely positively never, ever, ever. Can there be someone else in the room with you.

292
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:58.890
Dawn Abriel: Because if someone looks at your screen and see someone they know in the group that would be a violation of privacy. And if that ever looks like it's happening. We will kick you out of the group because it's against the law so

293
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:09.150
Dawn Abriel: I will write for you to get one and a half strips so that's 12 milligrams and I'll get you to Tuesday.

294
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.070
Dawn Abriel: And

295
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:22.080
Dawn Abriel: It'll take you about three or four days for us to know how your body is responding to that.

296
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.380
Dawn Abriel: Amount.

297
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.770
Dawn Abriel: Don't take more than what I'm giving you

298
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:43.320
Dawn Abriel: Wait till Tuesday. If it seems like it's holding you for 24 hours. That's great. If not, then I can order more but don't take more on your own.

299
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.190
Dawn Abriel: I just really confuses things. Um, have you ever been in therapy before

300
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.010
Dawn Abriel: Okay, well,

301
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:02.760
Dawn Abriel: You're, you're gonna like this therapist. She's I think the best we have in bright heart health. Of course I know know all the therapist but anyway.

302
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.250
Dawn Abriel: You already gave the care coordinators, the

303
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:27.480
Dawn Abriel: Pharmacy, so I'll order that in just a few minutes and every month bright heart health will send you an envelope like this and it when you get it in the mail. Do not open it. If you open it, they won't use it.

304
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:38.400
Dawn Abriel: They'll make you go to a lab to do your urine drug screen, you go to the virtual clinic, the place you went to before you came in to see me to get my zoom room number

305
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:47.040
Dawn Abriel: And you say, Hey, I got this in the mail. What do I do with it. They'll then you'll you'll open this in front of them, you'll take this out.

306
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:53.130
Dawn Abriel: And you'll open this in front of them and it has a urine cup in it, you'll go to the bathroom.

307
00:28:53.610 --> 00:29:05.640
Dawn Abriel: Give us a sample and you'll come back and you'll hold this up to the camera and turn it very slowly and they will read the results. And that's all you have to do once a month for your urine drug screen.

308
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:29.970
Dawn Abriel: We get give he prescriptions electronic prescriptions. So I will electronically write the prescription and submitted to the pharmacy and it takes about 1520 minutes before they receive it. So in about an hour. Well, how many steps do you have left.

309
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:32.850
Galaxy A10e: Um,

310
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.460
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so you could go today and take that other half.

311
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.350
Dawn Abriel: Then tomorrow, you're going to take one and a half, okay.

312
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.210
Dawn Abriel: until Tuesday.

313
00:29:52.890 --> 00:30:10.020
Dawn Abriel: And if you have problems with the pharmacy. Just remember to say it's an E prescriptions. So they go to the computer and look for the script. If you don't say he prescribed. Sometimes they're looking through a stack of faxes and then it's just takes a lot longer.

314
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:24.210
Dawn Abriel: Again, you're going to call a quest. The closest quest lab and say, you know, what are you doing about the coven 19 and how should I show up and when should I show up.

315
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:39.510
Dawn Abriel: I give Narcan by law. We have to give Narcan whenever we order an opioid so remember buprenorphine Suboxone or the generic that you will be getting it.

316
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:50.490
Dawn Abriel: Is a long acting opioids, you're still physically dependent on an opioid, it's just that now you're taking a long acting opioids.

317
00:30:53.040 --> 00:31:04.440
Dawn Abriel: So after we're done here. You're going to go back to the virtual clinic and you're going to do two things you're going to ask the care coordinator. How do I do the BAM.

318
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:16.290
Dawn Abriel: And you're going to do one more survey the ACE AC E. It stands for adverse childhood events. So it's only 10 questions one time.

319
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.360
Dawn Abriel: And

320
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.070
Dawn Abriel: But that needs to be done as soon as possible. Do you have any questions.

321
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:34.560
Dawn Abriel: Okie doke. Then how are you going to make yourself make the Tuesday appointment.

Galaxy A10e: Okay, I get someone else to remind me.

326
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.850
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. For the first little while because your brain. Your brain is not used to

327

Dawn Abriel: Just not used to this kind of commitment.

328
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.190
Dawn Abriel: Right.

329
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:13.380
Dawn Abriel: And I mean, you blew me off this morning. If it hadn't been for the care coordinator calling you, what would have happened.

330
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.000
Dawn Abriel: You you muted yourself.

331
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:26.670

Dawn Abriel: It can only happen so many times. Right. And then we say, well, he's not really interested in recovery. But, and you can always come back. Right.

336
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.310
Dawn Abriel: We never turn people away unless

Dawn Abriel: They don't have good Wi Fi. This is called telemedicine.

338
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.310
