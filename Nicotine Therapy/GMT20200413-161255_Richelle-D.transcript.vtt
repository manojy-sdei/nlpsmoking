00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.210
Richelle Direny: This session.

29
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.720
Richelle Direny: I met with you the first time. The first time was just basically the regular bio

30
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.980
Richelle Direny: Okay.

31
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.270
Richelle Direny: Best Album ID.

32
00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:00.090
Richelle Direny: Okay, so the first session was just us just me gathering a lot more information. Now this session is more of me.

33
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.850
Richelle Direny: You know, just trying to get a better understanding of what it is that you want.

34
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.860
Richelle Direny: In terms of moving forward and your treatment. What is it that you would like to

35
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.730
Richelle Direny: Work on for yourself.

36
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.340
Richelle Direny: As it's related to your alcohol abuse. I know you said that you're willing to attend the groups to do the individuals.

37
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:45.330
Richelle Direny: To be able to identify for the most part, to be able to identify some of the things that you know what you use alcohol to how you use it to cope with a lot of things that's going on in your life from the past past life experiences and just kind of everything is related to that.

38
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:54.720
Richelle Direny: So, you know, just a little bit of it spoken about when we first did the intake. So now it's kind of like being able to identify

39
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:05.670
Richelle Direny: What your goals is and how we're going to work towards those goals. These are would be your personal goals how you would like to work towards them and coming to that place where you're ready to

40
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:15.660
Richelle Direny: Open up and speak about it because that could be also a struggle within itself on coming to terms, not so much. Speaking about

41
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:30.930
Richelle Direny: Speaking about it to someone, but more so coming to terms with some degree of acceptance of things did happen. I'm knowing that there's only so much control you have

42
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:45.090
Richelle Direny: One, you know certain things like even with the with your mom and the different people that came in her life month about those things for your fault on there was no control. You had over it, especially as a child.

43
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:56.130
Richelle Direny: So it's coming to terms with that finding that place where you're ready at least to come to that place of saying

44
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:13.170
Richelle Direny: It happened. I had no control over it. I want to talk about it to free myself into release it. Those things comes in strides slowly but surely is getting toward talking about it. And for you begin the healing process.

45
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.750
Richelle Direny: Now, so

46
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um,

47
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:36.150
Richelle Direny: You did it. Did you you met who was the provided you meet with a Dr. Natalie, or do you did you meet with Dr. Jamison, who did you meet with

48
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.450
Antonio J: And I think it was Natalie.

49
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:49.440
Richelle Direny: Natalie. Okay. And, um, she didn't know in her meeting with her. She didn't discuss you being on anything right.

50
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.320
Antonio J: Any medication.

51
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.920
Richelle Direny: I know you said that you a would. All right.

52
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:13.800
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. So, all right. So let's start. Like I said, from a therapeutic standpoint. What is your goal. Like if you can identify three long term goals that you want to work on those long term goals is where we develop the short term.

53
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:24.390
Antonio J: I know. I mean, I, I can't. I can't. I mean, my goal is just, I mean not to drink, but it's like so much going on right now that I can't even

54
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.730
Richelle Direny: Think about that. Think about

55
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.530
Richelle Direny: What's going on.

56
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.630
Richelle Direny: Just start with that. Well, so what's going on.

57
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.490
Antonio J: Like working and stuff, you know this stuff.

58
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.220
Antonio J: And then I gotta deal with this. I don't, I don't know, like I'm not working and

59
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.130
Antonio J: And then they

60
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.310
Antonio J: Just suck. I don't know why not is cool. I mean,

61
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.240
Antonio J: I've noticed a

62
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.820
Antonio J: Change up everything.

63
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.060
Richelle Direny: Okay, what about it changes everything for you.

64
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.840
Antonio J: Well, I'm not doing nothing, not me. I'm not getting no

65
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.620
Antonio J: No, it's nothing. It's

66
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:16.650
Antonio J: I can't get nothing better when I'm not doing nothing. I can't work. I can't get I can't, I'm not getting paid and just all that stuff.

67
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.360
Antonio J: You know, in the builder still do stuff like that. No. And that's what I'm more focused on right now and not

68
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.070
Antonio J: Not

69
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.390
Antonio J: Thinking about right now mavens Maven

70
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.450
Antonio J: Mindset right now.

71
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.130
Richelle Direny: So right

72
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.850
Right now.

73
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.810
Richelle Direny: So right now, your immediate need is to be able to have some type of financial resources.

74
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.070
Antonio J: Right, that's yeah you know I'm saying, I'm trying to figure that out before I even think about

75
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.600
Antonio J: Yeah yeah

76
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.350
Richelle Direny: But think about it this way, you're, you're absolutely right. So we're going with your immediate need your immediate need is

77
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:06.270
Richelle Direny: Having financial resources to be able to keep the light on to keep to keep a roof over your head to do all of that right

78
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:16.440
Richelle Direny: Um, you were laid off or you were furloughed I think for a lot is where you still have a job, you're just waiting for them to see if you know when you're going to be called back

79
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:25.440
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. So did they give you a time did they say, okay, within two weeks that they see say within a month. Like, what was the

80
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.210
Antonio J: Exam exam made for

81
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.610
Richelle Direny: May 4 which is in almost three weeks.

82
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:54.690
Richelle Direny: Right, okay. So in that time, not being able to do the job that you're used to doing what is something that you can do in the meantime till compensated in terms of looking out for some other type of employment, while you're laid off from just job temporarily

83
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.740
Antonio J: Like no job he's a lot of different employment.

84
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:14.190
Richelle Direny: I know someone just did Instacart. And he, he was telling us in our group that he made way in a week. I think almost 1000 hours.

85
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.350
Antonio J: No.

86
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.580
Antonio J: I was, I can find out where I live in

87
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.410
Richelle Direny: Instacart.

88
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.780
Antonio J: I don't know what that is.

89
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.410
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's kind of like a delivery service. It's where it almost sounds like it's like a

90
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.500
Richelle Direny: Little girl. She was version of grocery shopping for people

91
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:56.580
Richelle Direny: So like you sign up with the different grocery stores like here in Florida. They have Publix, they have Walmart, they have different grocery stores. So people order their, their groceries and you go and pick it up and bring it to them and you get paid for the winner.

92
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.870
Antonio J: Oh yeah, I don't know if we have

93
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.150
Antonio J: That we have one here.

94
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.780
Richelle Direny: You're in Ohio. Right.

95
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.950
Antonio J: Mansfield, Ohio.

96
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:23.070
Richelle Direny: I don't know what part of Ohio. That person was from. But I know that's what and he had shared it with other people and other people that went to sign up. They had looked into it. I just, you know, if you have a driver's license.

97
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:34.560
Richelle Direny: I know one person. He like had one or two obstacles, he had to go over, but there was that, um, what is it they're listening to the grocery stores. You guys have their Kroger

98
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.670
Kroger

99
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:37.980
Antonio J: And Walmart.

100
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:52.050
Richelle Direny: I again. He was doing it through Kroger, I want to say is what he said Kroger, and he said, You just, you just have to just look up Instacart I STA cey RT Instacart.

101
00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:10.710
Richelle Direny: And, um, that is that is one option. It's just a, you know, on, unfortunately, and I don't want to say, unfortunately, is too much. You know, it's kind of sounds bad, but it's we just have to look into creative ways of how to

102
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.180
Richelle Direny: gain some form of income. I know that Amazon is another company.

103
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.070
Richelle Direny: That's

104
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.080
Richelle Direny: They're hiring.

105
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:31.260
Richelle Direny: Is just the means of the question is, what is it that you want to do in comparison to what is out there right now.

106
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.890
Antonio J: I don't, I don't know. It was not even that is not as easy it like

107
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.540
Antonio J: I don't know.

108
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.590
Antonio J: Not an easy job. Good job like that.

109
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.730
Richelle Direny: You're happy you're absolutely right. But the question is, what are you willing to do

110
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.750
Richelle Direny: What sacrifices are you willing to make

111
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.520
Antonio J: To try to get another job.

112
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:14.040
Richelle Direny: Something temporarily. I remember I was telling another guy who is in the same situation is very different because he has like a whole lot of kids.

113
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.920
Richelle Direny: And when I suggested the things he said no he don't want to do know that he just said he wanted to know.

114
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:33.660
Richelle Direny: So it's just like, Okay, well, you know, these are some options. I'm not saying that it has to be long term. I'm just saying that for right now, things that you can do to get a little you know income here and there.

115
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:42.690
Richelle Direny: Things that are open coming to be able to get some income because you're right, talking about my past is not gonna be

116
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.600
Richelle Direny: My when I can't pay my bills.

117
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.400
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so

118
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.360
Richelle Direny: He will. Yeah, I'm not gonna front if I can't pay my bills. I will talk to you about my life. I want to talk to you about how to get shot.

119
00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:04.410
Richelle Direny: So you know I need food my refrigerator. I need all these different things they say they have a similar package coming. The question is when is the stimulus package coming. I have no idea.

120
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.010
Yeah.

121
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:13.470
Antonio J: And then I asked that they just sent the text messages about his comment and it's like my luck is that lifestyle and my

122
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:25.590
Antonio J: They couldn't turn my tax through because I gotta pay for the taxi to h&r block for my textbook can't even go through. So now you're talking like

123
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:42.540
Antonio J: I won't be able to get that stimulus check because my 2018 and 19 hasn't really been filed yet like and that's like, Dang, what is my luck is that I gotta pay on my pocket to pay $400 before even uninstalling my text.

124
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:49.650
Richelle Direny: When did you, when did you when you when you file your taxes. You didn't pay h&r block the fee.

125
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.990
Antonio J: Will be

126
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.540
Richelle Direny: Whatever fee, you're saying that you didn't pay

127
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.760
Antonio J: Right, I haven't paid that

128
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.330
Richelle Direny: So h&r block, but I thought before they process it h&r block typically means you pay that

129
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:10.500
Antonio J: Right there, you I guess they I must old film or something that they can send my texts through

130
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:18.000
Antonio J: So it's just like, I gotta, like, like we got a lot of figuring out to do. And it's like, I don't know.

131
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.250
Richelle Direny: Did you call h&r block and find that

132
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.160
Antonio J: I haven't had a chance to go today.

133
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.070
Antonio J: Just

134
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.720
Antonio J: Last week,

135
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.570
Antonio J: Was just

136
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:37.830
Richelle Direny: Calling buddy. So, so it's making a list. I mean, it sounds easier, but it's making a list and saying,

137
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:49.800
Richelle Direny: If I have because if they're going to give me $2,000 and I'm not able to get $2,000 that quickly. Let me see. All right. If it's an h&r block thing. Let me call since I'm getting a text.

138
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:58.650
Richelle Direny: Calling h&r block, because from 2008 we're in 2020 Do you work. Did you have a return that you were supposed to get

139
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:08.070
Antonio J: I get. I don't know. I guess I just want to follow them, I guess, I don't know. But yeah, I guess I'm supposed to get a return. Oh, no.

140
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.640
Richelle Direny: So when you find it. Don't they tell you right then in there. You're supposed to get a return

141
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:19.080
Antonio J: Yes. You said I was gonna return, but I can, I can. They can finish piling on top $100 for each

142
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:29.070
Richelle Direny: So if. Okay, so, so I'm just and even though it's a lot. It's frustrating, but just follow me because something, some of it. It's all about

143
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:43.830
Richelle Direny: You know, the work you put into it. If you filed your taxes back in 2018 between January to April of 20 of 2019 because 2019 would have been 2018 taxes. Right.

144
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:54.870
Richelle Direny: So between January and April of the deadline date and they said that you were supposed to your return would have been equal to about $3,000 $3,000 is good money.

145
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:04.440
Richelle Direny: That you I'm getting all in a lump sum and I'm supposed to get it within two to three weeks. Have you thought if I haven't gotten my tooth that two or $3,000

146
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:22.680
Richelle Direny: Did you try reaching out to somebody to say, hey, I haven't gotten anything like what's going on at that point they would have said, well, you need to pay the fee until you pay the fee, you're not able to get the return or we haven't process your, your, your taxes.

147
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.350
Antonio J: Right.

148
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:41.790
Richelle Direny: So that's what I mean. Now we're in. We're in April 2020 I know they've pushed back the deadline date from April 15 to, I think, July 15 now. But, you know, calling h&r block to see what what is the

149
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.970
Richelle Direny: Because in the previous year. How have you done it.

150
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.840
Antonio J: I have a file my taxes.

151
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.390
Antonio J: It's in our blood.

152
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.720
Richelle Direny: And have you paid the fee. They

153
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.100
Antonio J: Take the feet from my taxes or whatever they did, I must I owe them.

154
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.530
Antonio J: And

155
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:25.980
Antonio J: I always in our buck and this year. They told me I can't. They can't finish following my tactic to buy old or eight I gotta pay their tax be able to follow my child. She said, I will get. I will not get nothing for 18 but I will get something for 19

156
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:43.440
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, but you just have to call them and follow through. It's just following through to see, you know, how quickly because if it is that they said that whatever the fee is whenever you get the stimulus, they're going to pay you pay whatever amount to them.

157
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:52.950
Richelle Direny: Because when it comes down to the government, they're going to get their money. Regardless, no matter how much you try, they're going to get their money, they're going to find a way to get their money that is one thing that

158
00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:10.980
Richelle Direny: We don't hundred percent, they're going to take our money. So it's speaking to them to figure out, like, you know, whatever amount of money that you're going to get through the stimulus, it will be real beneficial to help you at least one of those you have until

159
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:12.660
Antonio J: Yeah.

160
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.770
Antonio J: I just hope it goes through and I'll be able to still get it i don't know i got going on today. But then I have to

161
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.780
Antonio J: This is so much

162
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:34.770
Antonio J: stuff right here is like, then I gotta call my PO talk to her car I'm doing I'm not worried about fight no pills and stuff right now. Like, this is just

163
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.290
Antonio J: I don't know this word.

164
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.380
Richelle Direny: It's frustrating. It's for color was like I said, call it what it is. Call it what it is.

165
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:59.820
Richelle Direny: And just do it is what it is. It's frustrating. You got to talk to me. You got to talk to your appeal. You got to do, there's just all these things that you have to do, and it's so much that you feel like you have to do, and it's frustrating.

166
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.220
Antonio J: But I don't mind doing i mean i will i can

167
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:17.430
Antonio J: Like if I if everything was going okay like working and stuff. Oh, I'll do group anytime talk about how my days going, but not all that stuff. If I wouldn't have to worry about, like, all this

168
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:32.220
Antonio J: Food and a cable and all that stuff. And it's like, I just moved in here, February. Excellent. Good work. My job and not everything went to a whole plane. And I got to still do all his probation stuff just ridiculous.

169
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.410
Antonio J: And I still pay my files and then I gotta catch up to doing that eventually

170
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:50.490
Antonio J: And it was it was going good. You know what, I'm not drinking want to work every day in our show working my second second job 15 to 20 images went off to nothing.

171
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:03.180
Antonio J: And now I gotta deal with trying to figure out how to get money in the unemployment takes forever to come through. I've been almost two and a half weeks.

172
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.640
Antonio J: I'm just have faith. That's a lot of volume, but it's not like

173
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:24.360
Richelle Direny: You just said, all you have to do is have faith, but my friend faith without works is dead.

174
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:33.720
Richelle Direny: You have to have the faith, but there's the work that you got to put into that faith. It's not just having faith that everything is going to work out.

175
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:45.060
Richelle Direny: everything that you're doing. Listen, whether it is that you have to do this, due to the repercussions of your alcohol is what brought all of this on when it's all said and done,

176
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:55.680
Richelle Direny: The bigger picture. Remove alcohol out of it removed drugs out of it. If you had a wife and children, forget about why if you had children, you got to take care of them.

177
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:03.390
Richelle Direny: No matter what it is the foundation underlining issue that you have right now. Was that your security blanket was taken away from you.

178
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:21.240
Richelle Direny: You had your job was your security. It's what almost based on what you're describing without realizing it is what gave you life. Now that was taken away from you. Your whole world isn't abroad, you don't know what to do. You have no clue what to do.

179
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:32.670
Richelle Direny: Because life for you was taken away from you for you and for a whole lot of other people now have to figure out what am I going to do

180
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:41.910
Richelle Direny: So I have faith that things are going to work out but in me having faith.

181
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.830
Richelle Direny: What else, what is the work that I can put into it.

182
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:54.510
Richelle Direny: To make this faith magnified. That's the reality of it. Faith without works is completely dead.

183
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:10.710
Richelle Direny: It's completely that you can. You can't just do works with no faith and you can't have no faith without works. So you got to do both of them. You really do. It's a hard thing to say, but it's the truth of what is

184
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.570
Richelle Direny: Um,

185
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:20.010
Richelle Direny: You're overwhelmed, your stress right now, not being able, you have to figure out all this different stuff.

186
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:26.700
Richelle Direny: Don't you think that the the need to drink alcohol is eventually going to come forth

187
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.600
Antonio J: Yeah what yeah but

188
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:39.990
Antonio J: I mean, I know that it might be that to drive to do it, but mostly I'm not even focused on

189
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:52.170
Richelle Direny: You know, focus on it today, but the more the stress of the longer you stay home without working the locker realize okay listen, I only got the last slice of bread.

190
00:25:52.620 --> 00:26:08.070
Richelle Direny: The building. They had I mean granted right now everybody's kind of give me some kind of leeway the renter, the cable everybody's given the leeway because they understand the circumstances situation of people are not working. But eventually, all that stuff. Gotta get paid.

191
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.930
Richelle Direny: When it's all said and done, the longer this takes

192
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:22.980
Richelle Direny: Pretty much America is given back to us, the government turns back over the country to each and every individual, the longer it takes

193
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.890
Richelle Direny: The your desire to drown out your thoughts and emotions.

194
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.900
Richelle Direny: Is going to be there.

195
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:41.820
Richelle Direny: So that's why I say let's put things into perspective, it's frustrating. It seems overwhelming, but we gotta work is it what do you need to do right now.

196
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:54.870
Richelle Direny: I need some money. I hear about this money I call so I can suggest the goal as soon as you get off the phone with me call the h&r block's to say hey listen what I need to do because

197
00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:02.700
Richelle Direny: I don't know what I'm gonna go back to work and I need some money because not forget about paying bills. I need food in the house. I need certain things.

198
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.900
Richelle Direny: Because the rent. You can't pay your rent and food not working. And there are a lot. There's things put in place for that.

199
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:22.950
Richelle Direny: If you can't keep your water on you can't keep your light on can pay the cable bill things were put in place for all of those things because people are being laid off a lot of people are being laid off on unemployment numbers are going up every day.

200
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:36.000
Richelle Direny: But in the meantime, what is it that Antonio can do, though it seems hard and though it seems frustrating. What can Antonio do to make some money.

201
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:56.250
Richelle Direny: It means that going to your neighbor. Hey, I'm charging $10 and I run to the grocery store and pick up some things for you as soon as you just got that's $20 that's $30. I'm just saying we have to do what we have to do, which is something I want to do know.

202
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.090
Richelle Direny: Is it something that I must do for right now.

203
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.930
Richelle Direny: Unless there's somebody else can give me another option.

204
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.840
Richelle Direny: Your probation officer.

205
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.860
Richelle Direny: You still got a call and check in, because if you don't

206
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.700
See

207
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.000
Richelle Direny: This is the world we live in. It's the life you know

208
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:29.370
Richelle Direny: If you don't call your probation officer if you don't check in. When you're supposed to check in, there's consequences surrounding that you don't want to ruin it.

209
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.190
You

210
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.120
Antonio J: Know,

211
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.080
Richelle Direny: Sometimes we're so overwhelmed. Let me tell you the reality of life.

212
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:48.090
Richelle Direny: I do it all the time. I wasn't you always talking to somebody else. I do it all the time when you see the mountain in front of you.

213
00:28:51.720 --> 00:29:00.090
Richelle Direny: That you know that you have to do, what do we do do that right and you sit down and you do nothing, the whole day just pass you by. And nothing gets done.

214
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.530
Richelle Direny: Simply because I see the mountain that that I have to overcome I there's a big mountain in front of me.

215
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.230
Richelle Direny: That's just, I gotta climb that

216
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.600
Richelle Direny: I can't, I can't.

217
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.230
Richelle Direny: It is what it is I get you. Trust me, I get you.

218
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.640
Antonio J: Much is it everything you get back better. Maybe I can

219
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.060
Antonio J: Do to, you know, play. I'm going to try to

220
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:40.740
Antonio J: Figure out something about a job, but it's not that easy around saving it all small small they know and

221
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.360
Richelle Direny: What have you tried

222
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.830
Antonio J: I've been trying to get my unemployment. That's what I've been trying to do. I mean, it's only been two weeks since I've been off. I mean, there was really

223
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.620
Richelle Direny: What's that, what's the, what's the when it comes down to apply for unemployment there.

224
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.630
Antonio J: I mean, we've been on a weight every i mean i'm waiting on it.

225
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:14.460
Richelle Direny: OK, but so with unemployment is taking a while.

226
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.900
Richelle Direny: Unemployment only gives you, but so much money per week.

227
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:19.860
Right.

228
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.070
Richelle Direny: So that's just unemployment.

229
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:32.610
Richelle Direny: But is there anything else that you've heard of that you hear people because what I'm suggesting to you is what I've heard other people say.

230
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.200
Antonio J: I mean,

231
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.050
Antonio J: Motor City cities are only so small and you only

232
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:42.570
Antonio J: Know,

233
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.420
Antonio J: We've been talking about.

234
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.100
Antonio J: This shit. Everybody been in a daze

235
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.600
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

236
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:11.400
Richelle Direny: Like I said, because of the group. Well, the one group that I run. I hear people saying, hey, this place is hiring that places hiring and these are the things that they're doing to make a little bit of money. The one other person who heard it in group went to look into it.

237
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:23.100
Antonio J: You can put application in the city of a week, not just like you know his

238
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:27.480
Antonio J: Name.

Richelle Direny: What, what's your trade now.

241
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.850
Antonio J: I'm a welder, and I work at a restaurant.

242
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.870
Richelle Direny: Okay. So when you say a welder. That works at restaurants like would

243
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.620
Antonio J: Work.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.250
Antonio J: I work. I'm a welder, and I work at a restaurant.

245
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.870
Richelle Direny: Oh, two different things. Gotcha, gotcha. And for the most part, a lot of these restaurants are closed.

246
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.690
Richelle Direny: Well, what do you do at the restaurant.

247
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.130
Antonio J: Good.

248
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:06.930
Richelle Direny: Now is it, is it a small restaurant because there are some places that I've seen where the restaurant is the inside is closed, but they're doing takeouts

249
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.160
Right.

250
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.470
Richelle Direny: So you're saying the one that you work out there. Just leave to shut down completely.

251
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.780
Antonio J: No, they're doing that don't

252
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.340
Antonio J: Take out

253
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.370
Richelle Direny: All but it's only so much people they need to work.

254
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:21.690
Right.

255
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.120
Richelle Direny: Okay.

256
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.590
Antonio J: Let's do it don't need me to not a man. Yes.

257
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:38.490
Antonio J: They're whether they're whether you give it to the full time because you can't get and restaurants, you can get unemployment, because they're still open.

258
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.760
Antonio J: So none of our restaurants are really open to doing

259
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.910
Richelle Direny: A welder. You work in construction sites and things of that nature. Right.

260
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.610
Antonio J: I work at a factory.

261
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and all the factories are close

262
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.680
Antonio J: Yeah, all the factors are closed.

263
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:08.730
Antonio J: All the factors are close to restaurants. Only thing is openness Walmart and Kroger

264
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.330
Richelle Direny: Or you wouldn't want to do anything temporary

265

Antonio J: Oh yeah already put an application and they gave my ex girlfriends. We me and my ex girlfriend was application at same time she take a brother job so

266
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:37.230
Richelle Direny: What about another location, are you when you when you apply only apply to the one location. How does it work at Walmart. You play you apply to each location or you just put in an application for whatever location.

267
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:43.440
Antonio J: I put it in one in Ontario and one in particular, we only got to Walmart, sir.

268
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.370
Richelle Direny: I'm fine. They just hire for whichever Walmart.

269
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:56.220
Antonio J: Well, no, no, no, you you'll get calls from vocal buying a coffin up

270
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:04.920
Antonio J: I'm calling like juggling application, but I don't know this place already so small you know they already got their workers but

271
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.170
Antonio J: I don't know. They just don't hire really

272
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.810
Antonio J: It's tough to get a job and

273
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:25.980
Richelle Direny: It's tough to get jobs anywhere. It's tough to get job. I mean, it's a rat race. It's a whole lot of pee, especially now that unemployment is going up. The minute you hear somebody hiring everybody's running to it.

274
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:30.660
Antonio J: So in some places. It's not hard. I mean, I don't know.

275
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.050
Richelle Direny: So, but, again,

276
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:53.850
Richelle Direny: You can look into it, but with the delivery service. I mean, hey, it is something to think about. Because if you have a vehicle, it is, you know, you know, some amount of that money has to go into to gas.

277
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:59.400
Antonio J: Money to get when you get when you get charged for DUI and they drop it down to a

278
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.680
Antonio J: Physical control do you get your license took

279
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.350
Richelle Direny: Till you don't have a license. No. So how do you get to and from work.

280
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.900
Antonio J: I get it right.

281
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:36.150
Richelle Direny: So what is it that you can do nothing. Well, no, because then even listen now seems like everybody is moving towards get like I personally have never used that whole delivery service people have told me about it all the time. You just pull up somewhere and they're loading it up.

282
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.130
Richelle Direny: What about Kroger's like what are they, they, they, hiring for Kroger

283
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.890
Antonio J: Oh, no.

284
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.320
Richelle Direny: You say you apply to Congress and you

285
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.820
Antonio J: Know, Walmart.

286
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.350
Richelle Direny: Or just former

287
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.990
Antonio J: Yeah, I'm just saying Walmart and quarters on one open

288
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.940
Richelle Direny: Have you ever tried to look into progress to see if they're hiring.

289
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:00.630
Antonio J: Minute.

290
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.060
Antonio J: I will felony on my record for trafficking crack cocaine in 2013

291
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.280
Richelle Direny: So that's, that's

292
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.680
Richelle Direny: So then that will be the issue with Walmart as well. Right.

293
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.360
Antonio J: Everything right

294
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.550
Antonio J: Everything.

295
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:19.890
So the banks.

296
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.590
Richelle Direny: Except for factories and except for

297
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.540
Antonio J: Maybe a restaurant.

298
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:31.350
Richelle Direny: But then you wouldn't have known if you so you only applied and you got hired at both of them even though you have a felony.

299
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.140
Antonio J: And getting to factor is no

300
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.320
Antonio J: Restaurant, then we actually

301
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.340
Richelle Direny: Because different places, they look at different things.

302
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.450
Antonio J: Right.

303
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.100
Richelle Direny: They do certain background.

304
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.830
Richelle Direny: Exactly so.

305
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:56.610
Richelle Direny: Depending on the company that you're applying to some of them will look

306
00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.070
Richelle Direny: Not all

307
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.970
Richelle Direny: Right, what you're saying. Some of you said most of them right

308
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.650
Antonio J: Almost on the wire.

309
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.980
Richelle Direny: Both of them, but

310
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.430
Richelle Direny: To you say

311
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.570
Richelle Direny: And forgive my ignorance.

312
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.310
Richelle Direny: Do you same do I try, or do I not try because of what's on my record.

313
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.730
Antonio J: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna try don't

314
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.490
Antonio J: Worry where I noticed

315
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.060
Richelle Direny: You say, so you're not going to try to the places where you know right off the bat.

316
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:43.140
Richelle Direny: They're not going to hire you. Because they tell you that they're not going to hire you. So, but in in your area.

317
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.900
Richelle Direny: Do you know I'm

318
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.340
Richelle Direny: Pretty much most of the majority of the places. That's not gonna hire you.

319
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:54.420
Yeah.

320
00:37:55.710 --> 00:38:03.840
Antonio J: We only have so many places in the city. We have mostly restaurants. We only got so many factories. Yeah, Kroger Walmart. I know.

321
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.000
Antonio J: It's

322
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.630
Richelle Direny: Like a Walmart, you said you say you know Walmart because that a felony.

323
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:15.900
Richelle Direny: Because of everything that you're having on your record, you said that you know but she said, but she just said you apply

324
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.040
Antonio J: When I applied because, I mean, we were both lose both better

325
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.140
Antonio J: That's much answers.

326
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:32.040
Richelle Direny: But so, but see, this is what I'm just saying you Anthony I. That's why I said forgive my ignorance, but you're saying that you're not going to apply to the places that you don't

327
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:38.610
Richelle Direny: That you know it's not going to hire you. But just but then in that same breath, you said you took your chances with Walmart.

328
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.420
Right.

329
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:48.810
Richelle Direny: So then why did you take your why were you willing to take your chances with Walmart, but you're not willing to take your chances with a whole lot of other places that you know

330
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:58.560
Antonio J: Just, just because me and my exits. In here we was going on that online banking. She's is acting up blah blah itself out by but I know it's not gonna work.

331
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.110
Richelle Direny: Faith without works.

332
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:18.540
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen, I hear you, I hear I like you said, I hear. So what was it, why she said, just try even though you know in the back of your mind. Why was it that you try because she told you to

333
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:26.460
Antonio J: Maybe maker. I don't know. We just she was just sitting there doing and I was just sitting there.

334
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:33.060
Antonio J: So they was talking about how much you made at Walmart was I will let me just try it. And I guess.

335
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.020
Antonio J: Knowing it wasn't long word. I told her not gonna work.

336
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, um,

337
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.140
Richelle Direny: What does that 11 like two or three background check that they did.

338
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.660
Antonio J: Here, but I didn't. I mean, honestly.

339
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.030
Antonio J: I know I got time on my hand. But there's no way to really

340
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.670
Antonio J: I'm trying to figure out how to get

341
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:02.610
Antonio J: I've been trying to do this, unemployment for a couple weeks. And that's been more on my mind than

342
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:04.920
Richelle Direny: Anything else

343
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:12.840
Antonio J: Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to get my unemployment figure it out because it's been two weeks without no checks and I'm like, trying to figure out what's going on with his unemployment.

344
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.920
Antonio J: I mean, I understand another job within

345
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.310
Antonio J: Auto. Oh, man.

346
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.110
Antonio J: I'm gonna get it.

347
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.140
Richelle Direny: So what is just that. So with unemployment, you're just waiting for them to call you see here.

348
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.030
Antonio J: I'm waiting for my card. I mean, I already have my weekly or whatever. And I'm just waiting on

349
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:46.260
Antonio J: My car to see if I'm approved or whatever. And I don't know what's going on. So I've been doing this all week and then

350
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:59.430
Richelle Direny: I think there's some degree of the into because if your employer. I think it's something because it will be coming from the factory. That's what would be paying the factory.

351
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.290
Antonio J: Right, I know that.

352
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:10.380
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's so I don't know if it takes whatever they need to submit if they're the ones that's been laying the whole thing, you know.

353
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.070
Antonio J: I'm already doing with that I'm going through the unemployment.

354
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.540
Antonio J: Are waiting on I'm waiting on my call.

355
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.390
Richelle Direny: Oh, the car for them to send it to you.

356
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.520
Antonio J: Then like two weeks.

357
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:43.680
Antonio J: I really do want to figure out this 2018 2019 taxes. That's only thing that's on my mind for real because they sending out that money and they talking about if you haven't file, you won't get it until sep tember hang a sign of waiting till September.

358
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.100
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so then that's I said once you get off this call, you need to call on you need to get a pen and paper.

359
00:41:50.490 --> 00:42:02.550
Richelle Direny: Call them and make sure before you get off that phone that you are clear on everything that they're saying to you because if you were supposed to get a return and you never got the return, then you need to find out why you didn't get the return

360
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.600
Antonio J: Oh, I know.

361
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.050
Antonio J: I know why they get the return because I have to. I have to

362
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.990
Antonio J: I have to pay them in cash.

363
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.130
Antonio J: Before I even finished following my texts.

364
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.920
Richelle Direny: So, and how much was it 400 and something on your side.

365
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.810
Antonio J: Larger for it 200 for 18 and 200 180 349

366
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:33.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, so from 2019 you would drop that whole year. You just paid the 200 AND SOMETHING DOLLARS FOR THEM TO

367
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.400
Antonio J: Dissolve at the same time.

368
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.100
Richelle Direny: Aren't you gonna get penalty for for falling. One of them late

369
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.360
Antonio J: Yes, that's

370
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:58.500
Richelle Direny: Ok ok ok and so now you're in the position that you're in, because you don't have the money to be able to pay them and whatever little money that you do get once unemployment or comes through any little money if you got to submit that

371
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:14.220
Antonio J: Exactly. But that's taking so long. That's why I'm trying to because I'm back behind two weeks of pay for my unemployment, so if I get that unemployment, you know it's coming. They'll give it all to me at once. And I was just going to take that to go pay it.

372
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:26.220
Antonio J: Because even though I'm losing. I mean, it's gonna come back better, but I couldn't pay that fee at the time because I didn't have the money. I just moved in that apartment. And I just, it was just so much going on.

373
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:28.830
Antonio J: And

374
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:39.330
Antonio J: I'm trying to wait on this unemployment becomes, why can just say, like, look, I'll just say h&r block, but I can send my tech through with them check, maybe some

375
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.910
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

376
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.740
Antonio J: Or I'm one of the most likely if anything like today.

377
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.640
Antonio J: If anything, I'll just go borrow with somebody you know I got family that let me borrow it. But I gotta figure out who would

378
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.730
Antonio J: But it's just today. You know this one. I was gonna say when I find out stuff but

379
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.300
Richelle Direny: When did you, what did you speak to them to find out last week.

380
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:14.700
Antonio J: When I did my weekly yesterday. I didn't speak to nobody. Nobody, not, I don't know, you know, speaking of, I gotta call h&r block and see if I can get my Texas from Dell

381
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.480
Antonio J: And maybe file somewhere else.

382
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:41.670
Richelle Direny: On things that you're thinking it's it's finding out from them what are your options. What can you do and if he if you have to. But then, remember, if you're going to borrow. It's from someone. It's just being, you know, knowing that hey listen as soon as I get my check. I'm gonna oh

383
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.500
Antonio J: Well, that's no problem.

384
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.180
Antonio J: Man, it's all fall down to it.

385
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:55.530
Antonio J: I didn't want to do that. Yeah, I've been waiting. I've been waiting on this unemployment, but it's not telling me I don't understand why.

386
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.650
Richelle Direny: I mean, is when you call the number, do they tell you what's taking so long. What's the holdup

387
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.120
Antonio J: Talk to nobody.

388
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.380
Antonio J: Nobody answering the phone.

389
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.190
Richelle Direny: I'm talking about the recording. Usually the recording will tell you what your

390
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.340
Richelle Direny: Situation is once you put in whatever information, to tell you the answer.

391
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.680
Antonio J: No, it's not doing that.

392
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.070
Antonio J: I've been looking online. Oh no, I don't.

393
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.340
Antonio J: Let me just figure it out today. I got a lot to

394
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.890
Antonio J: Talk to her and and she when we come here Thursday and

395
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.680
Antonio J: Thursday. I'm like, man, it's though.

396
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:40.830
Antonio J: They should, they should. I don't know.

397
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.480
Antonio J: I don't know how you got people focusing on groping that and so they might be going on right

398
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:56.520
Richelle Direny: Know, everybody in the same boat you in the old woman, they're stressed, but listen when it's all said and done, like you said,

399
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.480
Richelle Direny: It's prioritizing what it is that you have to do.

400
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:10.800
Richelle Direny: Is prioritizing it if you say you gotta call your appeal as soon as you get off the phone call your appeal, get that out the way if y'all have about once a month call her. Get out the way. Moving on.

401
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:23.670

Richelle Direny: Just but but Antonio when you're frustrated you start thinking about everything you start thinking about everything. You start questioning everything

408
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.330
Richelle Direny: When you call her find out

409
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:20.640
Richelle Direny: How often do I really need to check in with you. If she says every okay buddy. Can I just understand why do I have to check in so many times with you. I got all these other things that are having to hear what she has to say.

Richelle Direny: Because you're frustrated with money every single get on your nerves. Mr.

Richelle Direny: Hill me talking to you is getting your nerves because you need you need to figure out your money.

412
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:48.300
Richelle Direny: Let's be just to be honest, I ain't right. It is good if I'm frustrated about something having a conversation. If I'm talking to you every week.

413
00:47:49.800 --> 00:48:03.570
Richelle Direny: Right now I'm frustrated. I need to try to hear what you have to say right now because I am frustrated and I'll till I do what my frustration anything anybody else has to say to me is going to seem like a thorn in my flesh.

414
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.260
Richelle Direny: Because the one big thing is

415
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:09.060

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:26.430
Antonio J: Be great

419
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:39.150

420
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.720
Richelle Direny: But for right now because of the fact that

421
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.020
Richelle Direny: Your financial future is so unstable. You can't focus on any

422
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.800
Richelle Direny: And it is what is real. So that's why I'm saying to you for right now.

425
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:11.850
Antonio J: Lord

Richelle Direny: Let me bring you right back to me. You got to meet with me for our you're like, Good lord, I got so much to do on that side of me talking to you.

427
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.460
Antonio J: I mean,

428
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.800
Antonio J: I understand. I gotta do this but I mean

429
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.600
Antonio J: Oh man, is the one talking stuff about like down

430
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:44.220
Antonio J: I am I guess no felony. That's what I'd be saying like, what the hell is like a do a burglary or robbery or or you

431
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.410
Antonio J: Know, they just

432
00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:54.480
Richelle Direny: call a spade a spade, you're frustrated. That's what I keep bringing back to you call a spade a spade, you're frustrated

433
00:49:55.050 --> 00:50:09.900
Richelle Direny: You I need money. I can't talk about nothing else unless I'm talking about how many give some money to pay these bills call a spade a spade. It is what it is anyone any money. That's not talking to you about how you can get your money is going to get on your nerves.

434
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.150
Richelle Direny: Call spade a spade.

435
00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:32.130
Richelle Direny: Hey, my feelings. I heard listen to live this too many times call a spade a spade. When I am frustrated. I can't sleep. I can't. My kids get on my last nerve. Everybody gets on my nerves. So call a spade a spade.

436
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:44.130
Richelle Direny: But when it's all said and done, take the frustration out of it as best as you can and then you can, you're better able to know exactly what it is that you're doing.

437
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.190
Richelle Direny: I'm telling you if you remove the frustration out of the picture.

438
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:59.670
Richelle Direny: It makes it you're thinking, clear. It's kind of like what I talked about fear when you have so much fear you think you don't make wise decisions.

439
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:10.170
Richelle Direny: Because you're operating out of fear, but if you remove the fear, then you're able to think clearer and saying, hold up. This will make no sense. Why am I doing this because this will make any sense.

440
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:24.180
Richelle Direny: So listen I ankle ankle keep you, I'm going to keep you because I know like you say you go gotta go up over 40 minutes

441
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:26.670

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.530
Richelle Direny: So,

Richelle Direny: Alright, so when I see you on Thursday. I'll look at because I won't be able to meet with you again until the end of the month.

445
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.430
