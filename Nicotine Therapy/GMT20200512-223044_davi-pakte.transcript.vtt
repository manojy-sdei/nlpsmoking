00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.250
Galaxy A10e: I've been dealing with it for a little bit now and

126
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.190
Galaxy A10e: Whenever I was around the violence.

127
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.080
Galaxy A10e: Or involved in, I get real calm everything slows down and

128
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.870
Galaxy A10e: It's like fight mode, right.

129
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.930
Galaxy A10e: And then now I wake up from dreams are

130
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.950
Galaxy A10e: Zone out and it's kind of like reliving the

131
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:29.790
Galaxy A10e: Flashback and relive it and I feel like I don't know if this would either not, but I feel like it's flight mode at that time.

132
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.780
Galaxy A10e: I can't breathe the heart racing.

133
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.120

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.250
Galaxy A10e: Sleeping.

137
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.520
davi pakter: Okay, well, um,

138
00:15:52.020 --> 00:16:01.260
davi pakter: I think the Suboxone can help with it, it's you know, it's more for the the opioid cravings and that sort of thing.

139
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:10.230
davi pakter: But the, is it possible, can you put your phone down so it's steady. So you're not holding in your hand.

140
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.780
davi pakter: Just like on a table or something.

141
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.550
davi pakter: Yeah, that helps me

142
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.150
davi pakter: Okay, thank you. So

143
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:36.270
davi pakter: But it's not going to get to the PTSD necessarily that's going to require some you know therapy and probably seeing a psychiatrist or

144
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:43.650
davi pakter: Some type of mental health practitioner. Do you have a primary care provider.

145
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.140
Galaxy A10e: regular doctor

146
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.760
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, no.

147
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.960
davi pakter: Okay, so it's going to be important for you to get that going.

148
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.070
davi pakter: Where you said you live in Roseville

149
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.410
davi pakter: Rosedale Rosedale

150
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:12.300
davi pakter: Okay Bakersfield. Yeah, I don't. I'm sure you can if you get online. I'm sure you can find a community clinic there and go get signed up. But that's going to be important because we're mainly what we manage here at bright heart is

151
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:20.190
davi pakter: Did addiction and dependence, which, of course, it's hard to tease out that from the PTSD, but

152
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.800
davi pakter: I think, in order to to get you all the support you need.

153
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:31.830
davi pakter: That's going to be an important piece to look into getting a regular doc, like you said,

154
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.790
Okay.

155
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:40.350
davi pakter: And but we do have therapists here again, they're more focused on on

156
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:53.820
davi pakter: Addiction independence, but we will get you an appointment with a therapist to talk a little bit more about the PTSD symptoms. Have you ever seen a doctor about that before or this is the first time you're experiencing it.

157
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.550
Galaxy A10e: Was been about the last two years, and I, I spoke to the doctor inside

158
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.510
davi pakter: Uh huh.

159
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.430
Galaxy A10e: But other than that, no.

160
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.190
davi pakter: Did they try to prescribe any medicine for you.

161
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.200
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I won't take segments.

162
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.460
davi pakter: Okay.

163
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.960
Galaxy A10e: I've taken I've taken them before when I was younger and stuff. And I don't like them.

164
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.050
davi pakter: WHAT WERE YOU WHAT WERE YOU PRESCRIBE when you were younger.

165
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.350
Galaxy A10e: Once was lol and the other was Cypress

166
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.740
davi pakter: For depression or why

167
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.080
Galaxy A10e: Well, yeah, they were trying to help me figure out why that was using drugs and stuff like that.

168
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.580
davi pakter: Okay.

169
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.890
davi pakter: So tell me a little bit more about your substance use started prior to prison.

170
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.040
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

171
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.710
davi pakter: What were you using when you before you went in.

172
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.540
davi pakter: Methamphetamine. Okay, any other things.

173
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.250
Galaxy A10e: We

174
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.620
Galaxy A10e: Alcohol.

175
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.530
Galaxy A10e: Okay, pretty much anything I get my hands on.

176
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.740
davi pakter: And then the opioids didn't start till prison.

177
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.690
davi pakter: Yeah, got it.

178
00:18:59.370 --> 00:18:59.880
davi pakter: All right.

179
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:11.580
davi pakter: Well, I understand. You don't want to take psych meds, would you be willing to take a medicine that will help with the nightmares.

180
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:13.080
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

181
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.490
Okay.

182
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.290
davi pakter: That that I can prescribe for you. It's called praise or sin.

183
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.880
davi pakter: And Elise, hopefully you can get some sleep.

184
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.170
davi pakter: Which will probably help with most things

185
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.840
davi pakter: But

186
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.910
davi pakter: Yeah, I mean,

187
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:43.380
davi pakter: I think that the medication will get you so far, but it's going to be kind of the more introspective work and maybe working with a therapist or

188
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:45.720
davi pakter: You know,

189
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.870
davi pakter: Doing some

190
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.610
davi pakter: Work on yourself, so to speak, to figure out what's going on with the the underlying feelings.

191
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.180
davi pakter: So because like I said, the, the Suboxone as you know it's not an end.

192
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.320
Galaxy A10e: It's just, you know,

193
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:15.900
davi pakter: The whole picture of what's going on with you and how we can get you functioning and feeling good, to the best, you know, of your potential

194
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.620
Galaxy A10e: I can always I can always find that. And if I don't, then I'm going to end up doing heroin.

195
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.050
davi pakter: What the Suboxone

196
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:25.860
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

197
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.530
davi pakter: As long as you stick with us. You won't have to worry about that.

198
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.370
Galaxy A10e: Alright, cool.

199
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:36.840
davi pakter: Yeah, we'll we can always do that the one issue is going to be that if you're using math or anything else.

200
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.370
Galaxy A10e: It millions anything else.

201
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.200
davi pakter: Oh, you're off the math now.

202
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.450
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I haven't used it for years.

203
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.530
davi pakter: Okay, great.

204
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.960
Galaxy A10e: Goes years I haven't done anything

205
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.990
Galaxy A10e: In the last five maybe five years.

206
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.080
Galaxy A10e: I did, I did heroin.

207
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.730
davi pakter: And then

208
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.010
Galaxy A10e: They started, they started prescribing Suboxone and in the pin.

209
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.020
Galaxy A10e: Uh huh. And

210
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.500
Galaxy A10e: I acquired some and

211
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.200
Galaxy A10e: When I'm on that.

212
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.150
Galaxy A10e: I've tried everything from legal prescription

213
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.540
Galaxy A10e: Just like me as well that stuff drug everything in this abortion makes me feel normal.

214
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:25.050
davi pakter: Yeah, that's your, you're not alone. A lot of people say that. So wait, are you taking the Suboxone right now.

215
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.030
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I'm buying it on the street.

216
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.990
davi pakter: Okay. So when did you take your last dose.

217
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.100
This morning

218
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.100
davi pakter: Okay, so you're feeling okay right now.

219
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.580
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I got two left. And then I gotta go back out.

220
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:49.050
davi pakter: Okay, no problem, we'll, we'll send a prescription in and I'll send some of the medicine for the nightmares, to see if that just helps you sleep a little bit better.

221
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.530
davi pakter: And in the meantime, it sounds like we've got a lot going on with you.

222
00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:06.690
davi pakter: Going for you with the exercise, eating healthy. One thing that you might add into the mix is a little bit of like breathing exercises or relaxation. Have you ever tried anything like that.

223
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.770
No.

224
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:17.850
davi pakter: Okay, well, you have a smartphone. So if you go to, there's an app called insight timer. If you write this down.

225
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.210
davi pakter: I N si GH T insight timer.

226
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:32.040
davi pakter: Yeah, you can download that app for free. And on that app or thousands of guided imagery

227
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:39.570
davi pakter: Guided Meditations, that you can filter by time. You know, if you want to do five minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes or however long

228
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:55.590
davi pakter: And you can find some for stress or anxiety or even for trauma and I think practicing those and learning how to regulate your breath may be helpful to take you out of that fight or flight, like you said that that fight mentality.

229
00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.270
davi pakter: To help you start to learn how to regulate your nervous system using the breath and

230
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:07.620
davi pakter: Learning how to relax. It's going to take a while, probably because there's a lot of attention built up

231
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:20.340
davi pakter: But if you spend just a few minutes every day, learning how to breathe slower down into the into the abdomen belly breathing. That is like the

232
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:30.660
davi pakter: That's the antidote to the fight or flight to the stress response is learning how to slow down that breath and bring it down in the belly. So if you check out that app.

233
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:40.200
davi pakter: There's a lot of good information there and different meditations that you can explore to help working work on balancing the nervous system again.

234
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:57.270
davi pakter: And in the meantime, I'll send over this prescription will keep you going at one, one strip a day and then try the praise of sin. That's the name of the nightmare medicine. It's a lot of my patients find it very effective.

235
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.880
davi pakter: And then we'll also get you connected with one of our therapists here at bright heart.

236
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:19.320
davi pakter: The other thing about our program is that moving forward. All of our visits are going to be in a group. Okay. It'll be just like this on line, except for there'll be other people in the room with us and

237
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.720
davi pakter: So,

238
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:32.610
davi pakter: What what group would be I have three groups right now. Monday or Tuesday at seven or Friday at 11am

239
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.440
Galaxy A10e: These are both in the morning.

240
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.590
davi pakter: No, no, that sorry Monday and Tuesday 7pm or Monday or Friday 11am

241
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.020
Galaxy A10e: Friday at 11 would be great.

242
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.240
davi pakter: That'd be good. Okay, so

243
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:57.150
davi pakter: So then we'll have you follow up this Friday at 11. It's the same thing about joining this group, you just go, No, actually it's different. You go to the virtual clinic. The main number

244
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.230
davi pakter: Instead of coming to this is my, my personal room will go to a different room where the group will be held.

245
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.730
davi pakter: We do need to do some blood work. Oh, did you already do it.

246
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.310
Galaxy A10e: No, it's a patient

247
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.650
davi pakter: You got the order, though. Yeah, so we need to get that blood and urine done

248
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.540
davi pakter: And then we can review it next.

249
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:31.680
davi pakter: On Friday, the one thing is about the program. So we want to make sure that you're

250
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:46.200
davi pakter: You know, engaged in the program. So if you know show to appointments or if you have urine that have things that shouldn't be in there which shouldn't be an issue for you because you're only using the beauty but

251
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:59.460
davi pakter: It if you're if you're not keeping your appointments or you're, you're not following through with what we require, then it means that I will only be able to give you shorter prescriptions so

252
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.710
davi pakter: You have to be going back and forth to the pharmacy. But if you're, you know, following

253
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:19.200
davi pakter: Our recommendations and meeting, you're coming to your appointments and you know your your ends are normal. Then we can space it out and then you just come every month, you know, once we get everything kind of stabilized. Does that make sense.

254
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:28.140
davi pakter: Yeah, okay. It's fine. So for right now, I'll prescribe enough to get you to Friday and then

255
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:41.400
davi pakter: After that, if you can get your labs and your urine done meet with the therapists and kind of get involved in the program, then I can start to extend the prescriptions out

256
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:50.340
davi pakter: Alright, so I'm going to send it. Are you doing brand name Suboxone or the generic

257
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.110
Galaxy A10e: It's a brand name.

258
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.440
davi pakter: Okay, you have, what kind of insurance, you have

259
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:03.360
davi pakter: Medical. All right. Yeah, I think that covers it. So, would an name Suboxone films one daily

260
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:12.780
davi pakter: And it looks like you have CVS on main avenue. Is that correct,

261
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.880
davi pakter: Yes. Okay, great.

262
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.730
davi pakter: Alright, so

263
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.600
davi pakter: I sent enough to get you through till Friday.

264
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.470
davi pakter: And

265
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.870
davi pakter: You just make sure it goes through

266
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.110
Galaxy A10e: So I have a number for a lab. I can go ahead and call after this, instead of that.

267
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.140

274
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:41.880
davi pakter: We're going to start the praises sin as well, have you follow up Friday at 11am and get your labs and urine done as soon as possible.

275
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:58.020
davi pakter: Okay, and then continue the self care, you're doing with your exercise with your good diet and then maybe incorporating some of the guided meditations breathing exercises to start to address the the trauma and the stress.

276
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:58.980
