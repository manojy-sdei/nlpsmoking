00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.070

10
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.000
JESSICA G: Okay, so last month. It was probably every night. And then this month is probably like

11
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.860
JESSICA G: These past like three weeks. It's probably been like

12
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Very similar, as it seemed like they're changing, tell me what's going on in them when they're there.

16
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, man.

17
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so some changes happening. We've got the frequency going down.

18
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But

19
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious. The, the ability to

20
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, do you mind sharing a little bit about a recent one.

21
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.620
JESSICA G: On

22
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.430
JESSICA G: So like

23
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.920
JESSICA G: A dog.

24
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.090
JESSICA G: Recent one. It's always like I i take, I take off.

25
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.760
JESSICA G: I'm out and about, again doing drugs on the streets and stuff and

26
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.910
JESSICA G: I leave my son behind

27
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.880
JESSICA G: And then I like suddenly remembered that I have a son. And I'm like, I have a son, where's my son was born.

28
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.740
JESSICA G: And

29
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.200
JESSICA G: Is non existent.

30
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.780
JESSICA G: You don't have a certain blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Yes, I do. I have a sudden

31
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.050
JESSICA G: And so I can't find him.

32
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.690
JESSICA G: And I'm

33
00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:01.320
JESSICA G: So I'm like, freaking out. And then finally, I'm like, I have him again. And I'm like, See, I told you, and everything's good. Everything's back to normal. But it's not him.

34
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.750
JESSICA G: In the dream, but it's a baby.

35
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.450
JESSICA G: So it's weird. And then there's this other one that I always have stuff freaks me out so much

36
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.510
JESSICA G: Were. OK, so my grandparents.

37
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.900
JESSICA G: Have too long or they used to have to them. They sold one of them to my brother, but

38
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.240
JESSICA G: There's this great one and a black one. The end. The great one.

39
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.250
JESSICA G: Where whenever we're so we're like traveling somewhere in Albuquerque somewhere in the in the north side.

40
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.700
JESSICA G: And

41
00:03:48.960 --> 00:04:07.650
JESSICA G: Somewhere. I've never been before. And then we're having to go like around the city. So where there's like a lot of like mountains and hills and stuff that we're having to go up and down, and it's like really dangerous and we ended up flipping over in the van.

42
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't. How does it was the end of that you flip over, then what

43
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:24.420
JESSICA G: We flip over and this last one we were like going to see one of my uncle's who's like a straight from the family, a strange from the family and

44
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:37.740
JESSICA G: So we went there and it was so super cool, like we had just flipped over. And I know I had the baby in my arms, and I like I couldn't grab ahold of him.

45
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.030
JESSICA G: Because like we were flipping out like I could feel I could feel me flipping over in the vehicle.

46
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.530
JESSICA G: And

47
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.730
JESSICA G: So we get there to see my uncle and it's like this outside like flea market type thing.

48
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.000
JESSICA G: And I see my cousins and stuff. And it's just like if it never happened. And then we're having a goal, but we were, we had to go back and

49
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:16.200
JESSICA G: My grandma's really old and it was cold, so she wasn't doing too good. And we have to walk all the way back to Albuquerque. Dr. Miller one to where I'm having to constantly work on trying to walk walk walk

50
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.030
JESSICA G: Back to my son, and I'm going through downtown and I just can't seem ever seem to get there.

51
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.560
JESSICA G: Yeah.

52
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.050
JESSICA G: And I wake up and then he's like, right there, cut over my arm and on my

53
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.490
JESSICA G: Wake up crying. Yeah.

54
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.260
JESSICA G: Yeah.

55
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.170
JESSICA G: Yeah.

56
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.840
JESSICA G: I wake up paying for those are the dreams. But like I said, I don't have one. So often anymore.

57
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Not for a little bit. I'm going to just kind of move over to a couple areas.

58
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to check on how you're doing physically as far as

59
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.650
JESSICA G: Any

60
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to check on sleep. Want to check on withdrawal symptoms. Want to check on eating by kind of thing.

61
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.570
JESSICA G: So,

62
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.440
JESSICA G: I've been eating.

63
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.660
JESSICA G: Me all kinds of foods, all kinds of vegetables.

64
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.710
JESSICA G: And everything so um

65
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.560
JESSICA G: What I've been eating is

66
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.390
JESSICA G: Like, I got a button on Fat Greek yogurt.

67
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.470
JESSICA G: And then so I add like the

68
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.350
JESSICA G: The blueberries, raspberries strawberries and banana.

69
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.440
JESSICA G: And that's what I'm in granola in there. And that's what I eat.

70
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You are trying to eat late. That was something you were to set an intention for you feeling good about

71
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.270
JESSICA G: Yeah yeah yeah

72
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.260
JESSICA G: I'm I'm feeling good about that. I just make sure to drink like I always have my green

73
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.790
JESSICA G: Whether its water or green tea.

74
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.180
JESSICA G: I have it there by the bed and I just

75
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.960
JESSICA G: Drink that on my

76
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.390
JESSICA G: And then that

77
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:54.360
JESSICA G: But yogurt with the fruit I make quite a bit of it. So I take a few bites of it. And then I put it back in the fridge.

78
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:11.550
JESSICA G: And then like a couple hours later. I'll take it out and I'll put it back and eat some more. And so that's what I'm kind of munching on throughout the day and then I've started incorporating like more vegetables into the food that I'm making my boy.

79
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can end up sneaking in foods. I know sneaking in spinach and kale. I've been able to sneak it into smoothies. I can see it in the eggs soup chili. I just put it in tiny little bit steam it and sneak it in

80
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.150
JESSICA G: Yeah.

81
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.790
JESSICA G: That's a good idea.

82
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I can

83
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.690
JESSICA G: Try that.

84
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, whatever. Like even if you do grilled cheese.

85
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Once it's steam because then it won't have that bitter taste, you can sneak it in put little bits in there.

86
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.300
So,

87
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

88
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me how many milligrams this box on your on today.

89
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.890
JESSICA G: So, okay, I had an incident. I had a bit of a regression. Okay.

90
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:20.580
JESSICA G: So one of my friends that on the box into she came to me and she was like, hey,

91
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:29.760
JESSICA G: I'm out of my script. Do you think I can borrow some because I get some this day and I'll give them back to you.

92
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.480
JESSICA G: And so I was like okay, that's fine. Just as long as you give them back to me. So yeah, so the day came when was it was like on a Friday.

93
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.690
JESSICA G: When she was going to get her script.

94
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.600
JESSICA G: And we had this conversation on Wednesday.

95
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.940
JESSICA G: And so Friday came around and she gave them back to me and everything was fine. Um,

96
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.230
JESSICA G: So I was taking them. I took them for two days. And then I was like,

97
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:12.870
JESSICA G: I, they were a bit strong for me. Okay, so I checked. I checked the

98
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.250
JESSICA G: The, what's it called the brand and there was a different brand.

99
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.320
JESSICA G: A different brand.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.250
JESSICA G: I'm

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.810
JESSICA G: The one the brand that um

Gwenevere Abriel: We normally take

105
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:48.810
JESSICA G: I don't know what it's called. I don't know. I don't remember what it's called but I know that it was a different brand. You know, it's

106
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't think you have that package, the little

107
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. It's Dr. Reddy is one son those is one

108
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lofty yeah

109
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.340
JESSICA G: Let me check. I'll do have one actually

110
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.790
JESSICA G: Yep, yep it's Dr ready. Okay, so the one that I get is Dr. Ready.

111
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:29.190
JESSICA G: And I'm the one that she gave me was My land. My land.

112
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.610
JESSICA G: And so, yeah.

113
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.160
JESSICA G: And also I saw in there that they weren't my dosage that they were eight milligrams

114
00:11:47.490 --> 00:12:00.660
JESSICA G: So after the two days that I took the eight milligrams. I was like, holy cow, like I've been taking so much. And so I went back down, like the next day I cut it in half so

115
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days were you taking I just give me the total amount, let's say,

116
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be handy if you had a piece of paper.

117
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I would kind of break this down a little bit.

118
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's Monday and we got to get all the way I guess from Wednesday, a change happened.

119
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we gotta kind of track this

120
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.830
JESSICA G: A little bit, yeah.

121
00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so Wednesday was think that's when it started, you wait a women's first day that you took something other than your prescribed medicine which day was it

122
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Saturday. All right, Saturday was the eight. So that's two eight. And now the total number of milligrams, you ended up taking was what

123
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.680
JESSICA G: Eight milligram. Okay.

124
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And and what was the difference in feeling, what did you notice the difference

125
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.510
JESSICA G: You know I

126
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:48.870
JESSICA G: I really didn't like I just felt a little bit more drowsy, but I was I was moving around. I was I was making a big dinner because my nephew's came over and my brother came over. And so I had to run to the store. I was cooking running around trying to get everything ready

127
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.660
JESSICA G: So by the time I was able to like sit down.

128
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.870
JESSICA G: And actually relax. That's after cleaning and everything I was ready to go to bed.

129
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.110
JESSICA G: It was probably like around

130
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.880
JESSICA G: 12pm whenever I everything like done

131
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.260

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.230
JESSICA G: my pick for and then

148
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.300
JESSICA G: What happened.

149
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you message, your doctor that this happened to our mind. The first, you're telling

150
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.560
JESSICA G: You're the first

151
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And was there some concern about that is that kind of why needed to maybe focus on that and maybe it's hard to talk about or not just what's it like for you to tell me

152
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.690
JESSICA G: Um,

153
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.160
JESSICA G: I don't know. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it because I'm

154
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.030
JESSICA G: Because I want to go back to like my normal

155
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.270
JESSICA G: Like routine and my normal dose and everything. So I didn't really want, you know,

156
00:15:50.220 --> 00:16:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we talk a little bit about any, of course, go back to that you're years you're going to be the only one that's going to experience you either will or you won't experience the difference. I don't know whether you

157
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You just added more opiate receptors and those are going to be screaming at you.

158
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

159
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.430
JESSICA G: Is that how it works.

160
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just set yourself back. Now listen, Jessica. So, don't. It's not an absolute even though I'm saying these words. I don't know if you can tell in group but everybody's different.

161
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So you maybe you won't because there's plenty of people, Jessica. Set, Go and have a surgery.

162
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: They have a surgery and they say, Okay, I'm really committed. I don't want to go back to the short acting opiates and for a time, they'll do something with Dr. Gabriel and they'll raise the dose quite a bit.

163
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they'll quickly come right back down. And I'm like, Wow, that's amazing. Isn't that something there wasn't this big long tapering process. So it doesn't mean it's going to be the same. You maybe you'll not notice it at all. All I'm saying is, pay attention.

164
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. Okay.

165
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's look a little further, let's examine this a little bit more because there's more behaviors that went on. So let's say analyze a little bit what worked, what didn't work about your decision.

166
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: With this friend of yours.

167
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:17.760
JESSICA G: Um,

168
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.230
JESSICA G: Why that everything is fine. I was like, okay, you know,

169
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.140
JESSICA G: I got him back. She said this was a one time thing.

170
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So, did you know that it's illegal to do that.

171
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.010
JESSICA G: No.

172
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's start there.

173
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.730
JESSICA G: I did not know that.

174
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

175
00:17:45.690 --> 00:18:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right when when a physician gives a patient on prescription, they have. They know their biology. They know their disposition for country and educated medications and so they're basically saying for you. This is clinically appropriate

176
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And in a way, and it just sort of follow me here you acted

177
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of as a physician with this person by giving away your medicine to someone else citizens for you, a physician assessed. You are ability to benefit from it and you gave it and you took it for yourself. And you've been taking it, something happened when this friend came to you.

178
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, now you didn't know that it was illegal. So that's added information. Now, you know,

179
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.200
Oh, yeah.

180
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:39.660
JESSICA G: Well,

181
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's cover it from just that level. And let me check it. There's other pieces you didn't know. Did you know that it's illegal to sell it.

182
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.070
JESSICA G: Yeah, I know it's illegal to sell like your medication to people.

183
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And did you know that it would be considered a slip, which is similar to a relapse relapse is kind of something that continues on and on and on and just, you know,

184
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't get interrupted and and and you may months or years can go by, but a slip is when we take less than were prescribed or we take more than what's prescribed so you accidentally had one, but let's just see. Let's just analyze that a little bit further, let's say,

185
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you wonder to yourself. I wonder why I didn't check

186
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why I didn't check the milligrams. Look how important milligrams are to watch right when we're about to taper how important it is, like, oh,

187
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Little fraction so important. Just this little sliver so important as we're tapering and no doc. I'm not ready. Yes, I am. No. Or you can hear there's a big focus on the but notice with your friend that wasn't there. You just different packaging.

188
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Different packaging that didn't catch your attention and you didn't look to check because this was not prescribed for you.

189
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your media, what did you notice we've only touched on just illegal. We've just touched on just those bits. So what are you thinking about right now. What's that making you think about

190
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:27.840
JESSICA G: Um, well, whenever I actually seen the packaging and the dosage and everything. Like, I know that I was considered a slip

191
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.820
JESSICA G: And that's why I'm talking about it. I know that because I'm taking more than

192
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.100
JESSICA G: I was taking more than what I

193
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:43.260
JESSICA G: Should have been taking yeah okay um but so I've kind of had that

194
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.350
JESSICA G: Inner like

195
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.050
JESSICA G: Like that inner dialogue like I took too much.

196
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.300
JESSICA G: I backtrack.

197
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.160
JESSICA G: You know,

198
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.850
JESSICA G: And then not only that, but I was helping her out because she's obviously

199
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.480
JESSICA G: Like not doing what she's supposed to do and

200
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.320
JESSICA G: I'm hoping

201
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's stay there for just a second.

202
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the right thing by sharing it right, you're sitting here and maybe feeling some discomfort even talking about these details. This is very useful actually for a lot of people because it informs what they need to protect even more around their recovery. So for you.

203
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this your best friend.

204
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.810
JESSICA G: This woman, um,

205
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.690
JESSICA G: I wouldn't say my best friend.

206
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.840
JESSICA G: But she's, she's you know a friend.

207
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you started to think she's in a program to. I wonder how good she's doing if she doesn't have enough did it right. Is that what came to your mind.

208
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.830
Yeah.

209
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you decided to put your own recovery in jeopardy.

210
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To give it to her. So tell me, is that that part right there. And that has to do with sort of our confidence. Our assertiveness.

211
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That has to do with boundaries that has to do with self esteem, like all kinds of things can be going on in her personally this woman. How long have you known her and tell me about how close you guys are

212
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.040
JESSICA G: Um, I've known her. She's a childhood friend.

213
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.330
JESSICA G: So I've known her for a while.

214
00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.700
JESSICA G: We just

215
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.740
JESSICA G: Like talk over

216
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.600
JESSICA G: Text my messenger through Facebook. We come up dead.

217
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:20.070
JESSICA G: Okay. And hey, I'm doing good. Now, only to, you know, it's good. And so at first.

218
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.260
JESSICA G: It was like

219
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.820
JESSICA G: Just text messaging and then and

220
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.120
JESSICA G: And then

221
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:41.220
JESSICA G: So she knew that I was on the program and everything I talked to her about that. And I was like, I'm doing really good and I think a friend.

222
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:51.690
JESSICA G: Like, you know, go to counseling and everything. So that was that we just talked about, just say hi every day and everything.

223
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.720
JESSICA G: And then

224
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.470
JESSICA G: Out of nowhere. She's just like, Hey, can I ask you for a favor. And I'm like, Yeah, sure.

225
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.820
JESSICA G: And that's whenever she told me, just like we're gonna get him back. I was like, okay.

226
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.070
JESSICA G: Fine.

227
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but now you have new information. What do you do with how much you have done it differently, or would you have done it differently.

228
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.870
JESSICA G: Probably, yeah.

229
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How so I

230
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.660
JESSICA G: Said no

231
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would you have said no.

232
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.990
JESSICA G: Because I just interrupted.

233
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.130
JESSICA G: You know my

234
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.800
JESSICA G: My

235
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.070
JESSICA G: Routine

236
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.070
JESSICA G: Well,

237
00:24:51.150 --> 00:25:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, for a lot of people, Jessica, they will end up saying yes when they don't want to say yes, because they are avoiding conflict, maybe for you when you know your own personality you know your own sort of confidence around that.

238
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How difficult, might it be for you the next time. It's possible, it will happen again.

239
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:15.930
JESSICA G: Oh, yeah.

240
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:28.110
JESSICA G: I have no doubt. I have no doubt about it. Um, I don't know. This time, I'm just gonna say no or not even text her back or not even talk to hear me.

241
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're. It sounds like all the sudden she's not that

242
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Close of a friend, all of a sudden, if you're not texting someone back. That sounds like the friendship, all of a sudden doesn't sound quite as important as your recovery. It's starting to sound.

243
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.070
Okay, yeah.

244
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now do you think she knew that it would that was illegal to do

245
00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:00.660
JESSICA G: I don't think I don't know. I don't know if she knew. I don't know what her thought process was, I don't

246
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.330
JESSICA G: Have no idea

247
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.350
JESSICA G: All I know as a she was like

248
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.440
JESSICA G: Kind of desperate.

249
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

250
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you sound confident right now, like, Oh, I'll have any problem. I won't even answer her

251
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why these can be kind of informing

252
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.380
Informing

253
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You right because if this might not have known.

254
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you know. And now we can set clear boundaries and in fact if you decided to so the sort of ideal in recovery is we tell everyone around us. We fight we stay away from, from any kind of shame activation. Indeed, we say

255
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm working in recovery program, I have to protect it and protect it means

256
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't be around, you know, toxic negative people. I need to be around people that helped me grow and develop and I'm

257
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.060
JESSICA G: Sorry, the

258
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.020
JESSICA G: Tablets dying from Nicole cricketing okay

259
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go look for a

260
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now, you kind of did this this role play with me and you sounded like you didn't have any problem being able to say to this friend know

261
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If she is, let's say,

262
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: In her authentic self. She might say to you. Oh, I get it, I get it. I'll respect you. But if she's not if what's present is addictive behavior.

263
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to probably be pissed off at you because the addict inside of us doesn't care about your needs. It doesn't care. You are inconveniencing me I need it, you gave it to me before. What's your frickin problem now.

264
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So being ready for that and being able to see is this woman right now, my friend and cares about the things that I'm working on, or is the addict present and all she cares about is what she wants. When she wanted and she wants it right now. So be really mindful of that.

265
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But she she puts your she put your by asking you, right, she's putting your recovery in jeopardy.

266
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving them to other people, is a is a you know a discharge criteria in this program. I'm not pursuing that with you, but it is, it's real.

267
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's really important that it did not happen again.

268
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.780
JESSICA G: Oh,

269
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.040
JESSICA G: My god.

270
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is she knows exactly what's going on.

271
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just want to get into I'm having a little trouble finding it. I got a snoop around on my desktop here a little bit more. I want to find

272
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: My hopeful knows there's a nice little list like people to have handy. They have a hard time saying no.

273
00:29:52.710 --> 00:30:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I mean like letting people off easy kind of a nice nice thing to do. So we do a little snooping here.

274
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a lot of my desktop. I need to clean it up.

275
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To

276
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: See

277
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I mean as far as right now. Just, just keep keep communicating

278
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: About how you're feeling physically. I mean, you have fortunately, you have for tomorrow. So you have nice short

279
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: turnaround time

280
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:33.720
We'll be able to see how you

281
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys are known

282
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.000
JESSICA G: For me, I mean,

283
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.110
JESSICA G: I mean, it was only like two days, so I don't

284
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said, you may have zero effect.

285
00:30:49.470 --> 00:31:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope that's the case. I really do. Yeah. Okay, so let's take a look at this. These are kind of go for some people. Now when you assess yourself. How easy is it for you to say no to people.

286
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How easy is it for you in general.

287
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.240
JESSICA G: Um,

288
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.750
JESSICA G: It's pretty hard.

289
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.390
JESSICA G: Word.

290
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And so that's what happened, I think, is it didn't occur to you, maybe to protect you, to protect the all this hard work you put in

291
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead, it was maybe feeling for what this woman was going through a sheet. Oh gosh, I wouldn't want her to be in withdrawal. I certainly wouldn't want to be in withdrawal and you didn't have this awareness that it was

292
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Illegal. So I think these are pretty cool because sometimes you don't want to just say, No, we want to do with a little finesse

293
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you decide to do a print screen of this you have it handy in your phone and I would invite you over the coming weeks to play with these a little bit with your sweetheart to right

294
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So let's try this one on

295
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say friend calls texts. I can't give you an answer right now, but will you check back with me now this one. There's a phrase here. It's called keeping

296
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The exit open keeping the door open this you know what this says that this woman, for example would be getting back with you again and again and again and you would expect.

297
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear from her over and over. So, this one might not work for the refusal skill, but it might work for someone who is just about timing. Let's say it's your sweetheart, and he wants you to get on the bus and go somewhere, do you really just just

298
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: can't quite get myself together right now, but check back with me.

299
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't give you an answer right now.

300
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you check back with me. That's a nice a nice way to let someone down

301
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How about this, I want to buy I'm unable to now that one might work for her.

302
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.430
Yeah.

303
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, she might say, Well, why you say, Well, I didn't know before

304
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's illegal, my you know they they want me to take this particular dose and I really wasn't, you know, paying attention to that before and I need to be really, really careful that I stick with exactly what my doctor told me

305
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And someone that loves you. Jessica is going to say, I got to girl.

306
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if they

307
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:39.210
JESSICA G: Only

308
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Care about what they want. Well, then all you are is just in the way and you just need to hand it over. I mean, that's not caring about you.

309
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to know very quickly the response that you get back when you set your boundary

310
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The third one.

311
00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this wouldn't work for her, but you could picture. Let's say someone wants you to babysit.

312
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The third one might work for that one. You know what, I'm not able to commit to that right now. Or it or it might work with like me, like, let's say I send you an invitation to have an appointment.

313
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're like, Oh, I just, you know, you're thinking, geez, I feel in the back of my head. Like, I have this other thing going on. I just don't have my my

314
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: My schedule in front of me, this would work right. I'm not able to commit to that right now and then, can I text you you know in an hour, you might say, This is nice. I can't do it. Now I can't commit to it right now.

315
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I really appreciate you asking me, but I can't do it.

316
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe volunteering at a school, this might come up, something like that, it would be, you know, can you bake Blondie blah blah

317
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

318
00:34:53.580 --> 00:35:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I appreciate you and He, um, but I can't do it and period. You don't carry on and on. And with this big long explanation. We just say it, we say are no I can't do it. Yeah.

319
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the other person has to work it out. That's the way life is, sometimes it's know we've got to give only what we have to give you gave more than what you had to give

320
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.590
You know,

321
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one. I understand you really need my help, but I'm just not able to say yes to that. I'm sorry. Oh my gosh, that was so perfect for her. That's a good one right there.

322
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because she look here's the help word

323
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really sweet. I understand you really need my help.

324
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not able to say yes to that. Oh look, it doesn't even say no, it just says, I'm not able to say, Yes, I like this slip slip, you don't actually have to say no.

325
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. I'm not able to say yes. Well, yes, you can just sit it

326
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

327
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I can't. Okay. I like that one that's best the slick.

328
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this one very firm. I'm going to say no. For now, I'll let you know, something changes. Well, that that's not going to work for for someone who's trying to score, but it would work for

329
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe someone was asking that you babysit for someone, you might say, call me and I'm going to have to say no to that for now, but I'll let you know if my schedule changes, something changes. That's nice. Right.

330
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm honored that you would ask me. Let's say they wanted to do a speech or something. But you truly do not have it to give it would pull from so much time so many resources from in your research to do this reading, Baba.

331
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you say, I'm honored because right. It's a privilege to have an ass. You don't want to negate that but my answer is no, that's pretty firm.

332
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Then this one. No, I can't do that. Oh, this is one of my favorites right here. This is the redirect. But here's what I can do.

333
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This is interesting. So it's no I can't do that. But here's what I can do. Tell me something, Jessica. Can you picture any domain of your life with anyone with this might work or this would be like the perfect fit. Where you redirect to something that you can do.

334
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.880
JESSICA G: Um,

335
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.400
JESSICA G: When

336
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.330
JESSICA G: When my auntie wants me to babysit her

337
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.110
JESSICA G: Her step grandkid

338
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.960
JESSICA G: At home.

339
00:37:53.610 --> 00:38:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And so beautiful, so you say no, you know what I can't do that. And then you say, but here's what I can do. And then guess what you give what you have to give freely without resentment. But what I can do is on

340
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Him on Sunday for a couple hours.

341
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You can share what you can do and that's a nice easy way to let someone off because

342
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It just doesn't end with no it's we're in another option. And the person's like, Oh, well, yeah, I guess I hadn't thought about that. Yeah, that could work we've put in their head. This alternative besides right now.

343
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.080
JESSICA G: Yeah, like I could babysit him here on my home.

344
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it. It's yours but but you know what, if you're welcome to bring them over here between 12 and three

345
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.330
Yeah.

346
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

347
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.630
JESSICA G: I get it.

348
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.440
And you

349
00:38:53.820 --> 00:39:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: See how firm and Claire i am i'm not mean and nasty. I don't need to be because my know stands alone, but I'm redirecting and saying, but here's what I can do. And then they're like, they're like, No, actually, that, that, that won't work for me. Okay. Well, you're the ones I know now.

350
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.080
JESSICA G: Yeah, because this, this weekend okay cuz it

351
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.130
JESSICA G: My auntie is just like, oh,

352
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.700
JESSICA G: Well, what, like the whole entity entity in herself.

353
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.690
JESSICA G: You know, like a force to be reckoned with.

354
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom personality.

355
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.560
JESSICA G: Yeah, she has so much

356
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.910
JESSICA G: Just she has issues and everybody knows that. And so

357
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.830
JESSICA G: Okay, so there was a couple weeks ago.

358
00:39:48.300 --> 00:40:01.260
JESSICA G: She needed me I guess she takes care of these kids, and she needed me to take care of them. And so, and her step grandkid because the man had to go to the hospital. So, and my son was coughing and I let her know that

JESSICA G: Take a look at it.

394
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And pick one that seems like would be comfortable for you to try on

395
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: With your auntie.

396
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see a couple of them may be working pretty well. And you can kind of fine tune it a little bit to make it work for her.

397
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.330
JESSICA G: Any of those that I would tell her she would stop talking to me.

398
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.960
JESSICA G: Okay, get her feelings hurt and stop talking to me.

399
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's talk about that. This is really important stuff.

400
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would be the problem with that.

401
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: These are real questions because I have no idea. Tell me, what would be the problem.

402
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.390
She stopped on

403
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.630
JESSICA G: It. She stopped talking to me.

404
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.460
JESSICA G: I wouldn't have her anymore.

405
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you have when you have her. What do you get

406
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:55.920
JESSICA G: Um,

407
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.630
JESSICA G: I don't know.

408
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she do

409
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you've got this contentious relationship with mom but you have this thing with your auntie. So is it serving something for you, but is

410
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't enough. Are you getting a reciprocal relationship with her.

411
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.350
JESSICA G: And I just, I love, I love her, you know,

412
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, we

413
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Can love people. But it doesn't mean we like them.

414
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.990
JESSICA G: I love her to death. We have our issues in the past.

415
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about those past ones. We don't have a lot a lot of time. This next client usually spot on Me ask you

416
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys had disagreements before

417
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did she not let you go. Then stop talking to you forever.

418
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but she said

419
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:03.930
JESSICA G: She freaked out. She freaks out and she's just I'm telling you. She's like that.

420
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica. She's going to freak out. Anyway, it doesn't matter what you say. Do you understand, you said it clear, you said, I want to know when

421
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a heads up when you're on route so that I can prepare specifically for this. You were incredibly inconvenienced by cleaning until two in the morning, and she doesn't even know that she has no idea of how she's affecting you.

422
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to freak out, regardless of what you say.

423
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it in a nice way, doesn't matter what you do. She don't freak out.

424
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.380
JESSICA G: Yeah. Yeah, I know.

425
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just a little

426
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.960
JESSICA G: Yeah.

427
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little reality check there.

428
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So the cost benefit for you. There's something about having her still in your life. That means a lot to you.

429
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:52.800
JESSICA G: Yeah.

430
00:47:53.220 --> 00:48:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's family. Right. Is that what it is you got some family. It feels good. But, Jessica, your ability to be honest with yourself and not sacrifice giving more than what you don't have to give

431
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Us. It really, it's important to it's important

432
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That you. Be honest with yourself.

433
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:18.150
JESSICA G: Yeah.

434
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because people will only respect to credit as much as you respect yourself. And right now, you're not setting a clear limit with her. And I can tell you what with this woman, you'd have to be pretty clear for her to even see it.

435
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:54.120
JESSICA G: Yeah, I mean, it's like this and then I have this whole thing in my head. Like, I know what she's doing. You know, she she thinks she's manipulating manipulating me. I'm just going to play along. So I know what's going on, but I do it.

436
00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:03.720
JESSICA G: Because I know I didn't know I love her, that makes you see myself you know I love her to go along with it.

437
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pick this up, you're bringing up some pretty important things I would like to also kind of take a look at some of this.

438
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Content of the dreams again when you're up for it, but I think today was really about you're kind of saying, Okay, I had this slip we've analyzed the context in it. We've taken a little bit of a look at your boundary setting skills. I think let's let's keep working on those

439
00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you loving you is at the center of it all.

440
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Understand, I want you to value you more than anything.

441
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think she's going to go away because you love yourself.

442
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. Doesn't that math doesn't add up.

443
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is, I know the subtlety. I know, I know the kind of person you're talking about thing.

444
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what you're talking about. Don't think I'm being naive about this.

445
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pick it up again next Monday.

446
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

447
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.890
JESSICA G: Same time you for much for everything.

448
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You bet. And do you need me to send a message to your doctor about medication.

449
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.310
JESSICA G: Um, I think I can wait till tomorrow.

450
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sorry. Yeah, I forget sometimes people are seeing right away. All right. I will see you early bird tomorrow.

451
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.260
JESSICA G: Okay, thank you.

452
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.370
Bye.

453
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm just gonna run to the ladies room just two seconds.

454
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:35.790
Bethany Shadid: Sure.

455
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.020
Right back

456
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:39.630
Here.

457
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.150
And accounted for.

458

Gwenevere Abriel: So we my seeing you in your apartment.

459
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.530
Yes. Very cool.

460
00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of

461
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Space, are you in sort of in your mind and in your emotions today.

462
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:12.330
Bethany Shadid: So I woke up with a debilitating.

463
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.200
Bethany Shadid: Migraine

464
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:19.530
Bethany Shadid: And muscle.

465
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.970
Bethany Shadid: spasms, it's been

466
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:25.680
Like that.

467
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:33.390
Bethany Shadid: Not this bad but it's been that way for this whole week I've had really bad migraines.

468
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the last one I had one come into

469
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.260
Bethany Shadid: Play. That's right. So,

470
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:57.300
Bethany Shadid: Yes, definitely. I know it's it's tied to all the stress with work and but at the same time, I have had my first period in like four months.

471
00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Normal for you.

472
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:25.500
Bethany Shadid: So I have PC iOS, which is polycystic ovarian syndrome, but it's it's actually like a metabolic disorder, they just label that when it they, you know, it was mainly that women would with this disorder had lots of cysts, I, I've only had one

473
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.500
Bethany Shadid: Um, but

474
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:40.440
Bethany Shadid: It's characterized by the hair loss weight gain acne, things like that and irregular periods and

475
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:48.270
Bethany Shadid: Because of insurance reasons I'm the generic birth control that I'm on to manage it.

476
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.430
Bethany Shadid: Was switched by

477
00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:01.080
Bethany Shadid: The pharmacy and they haven't been able to change it. So it's, it makes it

478
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:07.320
Bethany Shadid: How would you say my yeah my

479
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:15.120
Bethany Shadid: Disorder is not being well managed, which only contributes to everything else.

480
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:16.800
Bethany Shadid: But

481
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:24.420
Bethany Shadid: I've been pretty miserable when it whenever it's delayed like that. And then I have a period. It's like

482
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:34.080
Bethany Shadid: 10 times worse. Oh, yeah. And it's also the PCs is characterized by really bad periods. Um, so that

483
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.020
Bethany Shadid: But, um,

484
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.570
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I

485
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:45.300
Bethany Shadid: As much as I have been working on self care.

486
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.840
Bethany Shadid: I know that this stress is

487
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.240
Bethany Shadid: Manifesting

488
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.200
Bethany Shadid: Physically

489
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.060
Bethany Shadid: And

490
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:07.590
Bethany Shadid: I had a pretty stressful week i'm not only because of the

491
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:14.250
Bethany Shadid: Work stuff, but a lot of other stuff is going on. I

492
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:35.520
Bethany Shadid: There's a whole piece that's happening with my rent. I was trying to make my last rent payment online and I couldn't get the login to work and I was trying to communicate with them, but apparently the email and I had for them.

493
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:44.190
Bethany Shadid: Doesn't work or something, I don't know. And so I got a call on Friday.

494
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:51.150
Bethany Shadid: With the lady from the office telling me that they were going to file court.

495
00:55:53.070 --> 00:56:07.800
Bethany Shadid: Papers, because they're not receiving my graphics and mind you, I, I've been on top of it and calling and trying to figure it out. And I even asked, Do I need to just bring in a check right now or

496
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:22.080
Bethany Shadid: Can I am I still try. Can I still file it online. She was like, Oh, yeah. So anyway, I'm I'm I'm dealing with that and I I was up till two in the morning.

497
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:31.380
Bethany Shadid: You know, writing an email to the manager explaining my situation. And I think, you know, when it was all said and done, I was like,

498
00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.180
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

499
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.790
Bethany Shadid: This is affecting my stability. So that's, you know,

500
00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:47.760
Bethany Shadid: Cause for the immense stress and then this feeling of not being believed you know

501
00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:55.020
Bethany Shadid: There's so many things that play into it and and i'm aware of it, but it

502
00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:07.380
Bethany Shadid: hasn't made it easier. So I also went into work you know after talking with you last week and I

503
00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:15.930
Bethany Shadid: Was feeling, you know, ready to quit. And then one of my co workers.

504
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.500
Bethany Shadid: approached me and told me that she had talked to my manager out

505
00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:26.700
Bethany Shadid: And she's like a

506
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:37.710
Bethany Shadid: No BS. The point kind of a gal and for whatever reason, the way that she

507
00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:43.620
Bethany Shadid: communicated with him, made a difference and

508
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:55.080
Bethany Shadid: She let him have it and he was there all week and attentive and I told him towards the end of the week, I was like, well,

509
00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:01.650
Bethany Shadid: How should I say I'm getting used to the fact that whenever he asks me how I'm doing

510
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:08.670
Bethany Shadid: It's a situation where he knows and I know there's no time to talk about it.

511
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh geez.

512
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.650
Bethany Shadid: You know what I mean. He'll pop in. Oh, I gotta run to such and such. But I want to see. How are you doing, you know, and you're like,

513
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:24.120
Bethany Shadid: Okay, yeah. So I said, Well, you know what, it's really been nice having you here this week.

514
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.410
Bethany Shadid: And so the the work environment was a lot better. This week,

515
00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.120
Bethany Shadid: I'm

516
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:39.540
Bethany Shadid: The girl that causes a lot of daily tension and stress, she was out sick.

517
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.710
Bethany Shadid: And so that made it better, but I think

518
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.850
Bethany Shadid: What I took on internally.

519
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:49.830
Bethany Shadid: Was that

520
00:58:50.880 --> 00:59:11.340
Bethany Shadid: I have a medical assistant that they keep taking away and giving me back and taking away and giving me back and she made it clear to me that if they don't, if they take her away or they want to put her somewhere else. She's gonna quit cheese. And so that's a lot of pressure and

521
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:22.050
Bethany Shadid: My friend at work that I told you about in her awful situation with her husband, killing himself.

522
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.300
Bethany Shadid: And her little baby.

523
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.050
Bethany Shadid: She's had a breakdown. So my manager.

524
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:42.900
Bethany Shadid: He you know he wanted to talk to her and see how she was doing and you know i've communicated a little bit with you about her trying to get help and our system being so messed up that

525
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:55.830
Bethany Shadid: She, she broke down to him and was crying and it was like, I just need help. And as much as I tell people I need help.

526
00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:13.830
Bethany Shadid: I'm not getting the help that I need. And so he asked her is like are you suicidal and she's like, Well, I thought about that, you know, and I think about my husband and stuff because she says, but you know I haven't made a plan so

527
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:24.330
Bethany Shadid: Sorry, anything like that. I don't know exactly what their conversation was, but I got to work and found out that

528
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.460
Bethany Shadid: She wasn't there. And I didn't know what was happening.

529
01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:48.900
Bethany Shadid: And it turns out that he sent her home and then called the cops on her. And so she was as she got home and had her child, and then the cops were at her door and they took her to the hospital.

530
01:00:50.220 --> 01:01:00.900
Bethany Shadid: And she was, you know, committed for a few days and I didn't know exactly what was going on. And so that was a stress and

531
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.480
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, there's just a lot

532
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.570
Bethany Shadid: Going on and

533
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.820
Bethany Shadid: I feel overwhelmed. A lot

534
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:19.350
Bethany Shadid: I'm you know working on

535
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:29.310
Bethany Shadid: What I can do for me to reduce my stress, but it's definitely taking a physical toll.

536
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.200
Bethany Shadid: And

537
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.440
Bethany Shadid: I've been having

538
01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:38.370
Bethany Shadid: Pain a lot

539
01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.100
Bethany Shadid: Trying to

540
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.820
Bethany Shadid: Stay on my dose with the Suboxone and

541
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:59.400
Bethany Shadid: I haven't had, you know, trying to reduce the amount I haven't had it so bad. Before I don't know if I've just reached

542
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.190
Bethany Shadid: A certain threshold, that is, is my body doesn't want it.

543
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:20.700
Bethany Shadid: work well with me, but the muscle spasms and tension, I think, are just know magnified with everything going on. Um,

544
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.620
Bethany Shadid: It's to the point where like

545
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.580
Bethany Shadid: Saturday and Sunday. I was

546
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:36.030
Bethany Shadid: in so much pain that I couldn't go to church and

547
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.250
Bethany Shadid: Just really sad and

548
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.940
Bethany Shadid: The so it's

549
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:47.880
I'm

550
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.870
Bethany Shadid: I think my struggle on a daily basis is

551
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:06.000
Bethany Shadid: Feeling like there's so much that I need to do that. I have a lot of responsibilities to take care of.

552
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.810
Bethany Shadid: But feeling like I can't physically

553
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:11.700
Bethany Shadid: Do it.

554
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.320
Bethany Shadid: And that's been really tough.

555
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.720
Bethany Shadid: I've been sleeping a lot this weekend.

556
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.710
Bethany Shadid: More so than normal like

557
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:39.360
Bethany Shadid: I'm not for sure that I'm passing kidney stones, because I know that whenever I'm in withdrawal.

558
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.520
Bethany Shadid: I can get those pseudo pains, because my body.

559
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:55.920
Bethany Shadid: Has done that in the past, but it's gotten to the point where the pain will hit and I am throwing up

560
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.280
Bethany Shadid: And so it had to take a lot of nausea medication, lots of migraine medication.

561
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:14.070
Bethany Shadid: And so I decided today that I was just going to take my regular dose to function.

562
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:18.960
Bethany Shadid: How many milligrams. So I meant the 5.5

563
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:28.950
Bethany Shadid: I tried the going down to the 5.25 and yeah

564
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some timing on that just

565
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you have a few too many things kind of coming at you.

566
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Normally, it would be, you know. Well, that's life. You know, you've got to just sort of meet it with your new skills, etc, etc.

567
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't see any problem with just sort of staying there for a little bit longer, you know, just tell Dr. Gabriel. It's what you want to do and don't don't overanalyze that just that's what you're doing. That's that you've made up your mind to just

568
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're about

569
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:03.750
Bethany Shadid: I think the others into his

570
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.240
Bethany Shadid: Last week in our group meeting. We talked about doing two weeks at a time.

571
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:14.970
Bethany Shadid: And I went and picked up my last dose and it was only good for a week again.

572
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.650
Bethany Shadid: Push.

573
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Translate somehow

574
01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.460
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, um,

575
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:22.560
Bethany Shadid: And

576
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:29.460
Bethany Shadid: So I'm, I'm not, I'm not getting enough to

577
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:40.140
Bethany Shadid: Have a little bit in case I do have a kidney stone episode, you know, and I'm only getting a week at a time so

578
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:45.210
Bethany Shadid: I think that also played into my stability and security.

579
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.470
Bethany Shadid: That something's wrong and that you know there's constraints and I'm mean, you know,

580
01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:59.610
Bethany Shadid: More of a strict, you know, probation here, Mary, period. And so that

581
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:06.210
Bethany Shadid: concerned me, I know that in in relation to bright heart health.

582
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:28.080
Bethany Shadid: Financial I can't continue to pay for this out of pocket financially, so I I think after this week at work. I learned a little bit more about how insurance works and

583
01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:37.560
Bethany Shadid: I might. I might have a better grasp on what I can do to see if my insurance will pay for it.

584
01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:48.240
Bethany Shadid: But in the meantime, you know, like today, I checked in. And the guy said, I told him the situation. I was like, I need

585
01:06:49.200 --> 01:07:07.740
Bethany Shadid: To get my insurance to, you know, approve this because where they sent me before they don't manage any of this. And so they should cover this. I said, but I didn't know how to do that before and I think I do. And so, you told me that I had to get it done within a week.

586
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.590
Bethany Shadid: And so, you know, all those factors. Just make it

587
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:25.170
Bethany Shadid: I don't know. It's the accumulation of all of those things that play on my core in security with stability.

588
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:27.960
Sorry.

589
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.570
Bethany Shadid: Because I know the last thing I need right now is to, you know, not, not, have you guys

590
01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So some just some reality testing in that space has to do with

591
01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Your ability to set up some sort of plan with the finance folks.

592
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That, you know, and Brian heart.

593
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're working out, you know, does this need to be funneled through a primary care physician they recommend. I don't know what little nuance thing is going on.

594
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've been on the witness side of watching various people sort of navigate

595
01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Their finances. I've been on this side of it for a while and watching for the most part, and I know it's they're changing is brighter gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It's less accommodating. I am watching that happen.

596
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm also watching people that are making payments. They've accrued this bill and there. They've said, Okay, well, I need to bring it down. But I also need to pay the copay so there they have an arrangement established

597
01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:59.340
Bethany Shadid: Okay, can you

598
01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Get with them right now. Do you have like an outstanding debt with my heart.

599
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:05.340
Bethany Shadid: You know, I think I do. I

600
01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:25.860
Bethany Shadid: Paid a lot of it, but it's gotten me into, into a place like where right now I don't have any savings because of it. Does that make sense. So I went and tried to pay it down really fast. And then, you know, you just accumulate more and more each session so

601
01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:34.770
Bethany Shadid: But I haven't made an arrangement. I just been trying on my own until I got I think the liens email.

602
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:35.700
Bethany Shadid: So,

603
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:45.120
Bethany Shadid: What's turning billing know it's just like billing it bright her health or something that was going to email them after we talked today.

604
01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Other person. I think that you want to connect with me see if I've still got her name here if you don't use a name in Slack, it disappears. For a while I think her first name is

605
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I just see if it's Calista

606
01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:01.230
Bethany Shadid: That would be great to know who to contact

607
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.490
Bethany Shadid: Because I haven't. I will say, I haven't really been

608
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:07.650
Bethany Shadid: Given

609
01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:15.330
Bethany Shadid: direction on how to resolve it other than well how are you going to pay it and

610
01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, they're not necessarily trained to to do all that piece so

611
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really, it's just you want to have the right person for the right conversation. So those folks are not the right people, they might be able to do a drug screen.

612
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: They can do a real quick reminder. These your outstanding things you can't clone grew up and guess unless you get them, but just be assure you it's really there's people that are just doing the accounts and things like that so

613
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:45.900
Bethany Shadid: I just see something

614
01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.740
Bethany Shadid: You can't find it. Now, either you can always text me later.

615
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.390
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

616
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:06.570
Bethany Shadid: Because that's that's fine too.

617
01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.460
Bethany Shadid: I just, you know, I think it

618
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's nice

619
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I start the conversation now that it gets moving is a weighted

620
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:23.730
You might

621
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.420
Bethany Shadid: So it's good to understand that.

622
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.460
Bethany Shadid: Yes.

623
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can just remember this woman. It's not the way I think it's spelled.

624
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:38.820
Bethany Shadid: I will tell you while you're looking for that.

625
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:39.570
Bethany Shadid: And that I've

626
01:11:39.930 --> 01:12:01.050
Bethany Shadid: done a lot of work since last week on the imaging of the protector nurture and the wise my advisor. Yeah, I've changed a little bit, which I think is helped you know solidify. It is mine.

627
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.090
Bethany Shadid: Because you know in my faith.

628
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.540
Bethany Shadid: You've heard of the Trinity.

629
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:13.620
Bethany Shadid: Uh huh. And so there's the god

630
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.610
Bethany Shadid: The Father, Jesus, and then the Holy Spirit are considered all one but it kind of aligned as Jesus being the nurturing figure

631
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:28.920
Bethany Shadid: And

632
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:42.960
Bethany Shadid: The Holy Spirit being the wisdom internal you know you have the Holy Spirit in you to help guide you and things and then God being the protector.

633
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:48.420
Bethany Shadid: Kind of just aligned really beautifully.

634
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.590
Bethany Shadid: And so I I tried to

635
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.880
Bethany Shadid: Keep that in the forefront of my mind, this week.

636
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.330
Bethany Shadid: Which was next. Right.

637
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah you know and i would i hear mostly I hear you, I hear what you're saying, but I hear I hear a lot of the but the but being what you end up doing.

638
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You

639
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:14.640
Bethany Shadid: Know I

640
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: made contact with it, but

641
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this what you end up doing is still questioning it. And and and

642
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece that I see is

643
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So ironic because I happen to know you're going to be okay.

644
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how you forget that in those moments.

645
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have this powerful Trinity, right, you can have this this amazing connection. But you still minimize that strength.

646
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

647
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: More than okay

648
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.090
Bethany Shadid: I haven't translated it into my

649
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:21.030
Bethany Shadid: Day to date when I when it's come up, it's thinking in reflection about what happened and then I have that imagery. It's not in the moment.

650
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't let it go. You don't actually let go and let God, you don't. It doesn't look it looks

651
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like you, you go to this hurts. This hurts. This hurts. How could this be hurting. Again, look how could this be look at how these things and and now it's hurting and I'm I'm truly justified to hurt.

652
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You are justified to hurt you can you can dip into just give right around the corner, you could pull something to feel to feel sad about you have plenty

653
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But the big aha experience is going to be you're sick and tired of it.

654
01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sick and tired of this sad and being in going there.

655
01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To me out here is this witness of this beautiful intelligent powerful, strong creative woman is just every time. JUST BAFFLED

656
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And how you're just not a witness to it yourself. I, I, I, I'm always like, what

657
01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so old.

658
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You come in, in, you have these stories, right, the same way it is, which is, hear me see me. See look, look. You want me to see and hear and validate and I get it.

659
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But I truly do believe that this, this

660
01:15:48.990 --> 01:16:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Work that we were beginning to do with the desensitization is going to be a key part of you getting some distance from memories that you can't even find a label for

661
01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:02.850
Bethany Shadid: Right.

662
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I really do think

663
01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting distance from it.

664
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because all of it just stacks up and stacks up I

665
01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the logic.

666
01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, doesn't look like a happy life.

667
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:28.050
Bethany Shadid: No, I will say, I do think it helped in

668
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:34.770
Bethany Shadid: How do I, I was thinking about it, just a second ago. I'm

669
01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:42.870
Bethany Shadid: The desensitized. These sensitizing because we focused

670
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.150
Bethany Shadid: I was able to come into work.

671
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:57.660
Bethany Shadid: And be okay with the idea of walking away from it.

672
01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, yeah, that's it.

673
01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:02.130
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and

674
01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:05.550
Bethany Shadid: Even with the thought because like

675
01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:10.440
Bethany Shadid: Even with my friend like

676
01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:20.130
Bethany Shadid: The thought of her hurting herself and this other girl you know her job being dependent on me.

677
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.240
Bethany Shadid: I was able to

678
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:30.810
Bethany Shadid: I was a lot

679
01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.220
Bethany Shadid: Stronger in okay in

680
01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:40.680
Bethany Shadid: Not

681
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.850
Bethany Shadid: Like the comments, the communication. I had with my manager.

682
01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.680

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going up.

840
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's bring in the Trinity now.

841
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is calling upon your faith.

842
01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is where you meet your life right now we get to find out how much faith. What is this faith.

843
01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it just a rehearsal for some other moment or is this is this it

844
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Faith now.

845
01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing in that protection.

846
01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That all along.

847
01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: God is there.

848
01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Never really letting that penetrate and touch your core.

849
01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.580
It never did.

850
01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're there.

851
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurtured

852
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy Spirit.

853
01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconditional love

854
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Jesus Christ.

855
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: feel what it feels like. If you gave yourself permission.

856
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To be with that at all times.

857
01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Be with that now.

858
01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with it.

859
01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring up that negative thought that image and be present with

860
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This force.

861
01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm apologize. I'm going to slow it down better when it slower when we're doing some positive

862
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.140
Make sure I'm going in the right direction.

863
01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Even faster.

864
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:12.840
Bethany Shadid: Go SLOWER. OKAY.

865
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to start to pull up the negative image, you had that shark picture worst part of it. And now be present surrounded embodied with the quality of all of that faith in the Trinity.

866
01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

867
01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together.

868
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Got some big feelings going on.

869
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

870
01:38:56.970 --> 01:38:57.330
Bethany Shadid: Well,

871
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.050
Bethany Shadid: What came up was some

872
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:03.690
Bethany Shadid: Of the moments I

873
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:07.980
Bethany Shadid: I i

874
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.750
Bethany Shadid: believed in God and Jesus

875
01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:15.420
Bethany Shadid: Was

876
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:22.200
Bethany Shadid: The only way I can describe it is a little bit of pure clarity.

877
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.620
Bethany Shadid: About my life.

878
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:30.780
Bethany Shadid: I was in college and

879
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.740
Bethany Shadid: There was a lot going on.

880
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:37.080
Bethany Shadid: And I think

881
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:44.370
Bethany Shadid: I was really confused and I realized after this moment.

882
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:51.510
Bethany Shadid: Of clarity about my life. It was like my life kind of flashed before my eyes.

883
01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:56.520
Bethany Shadid: And all of a sudden all the negative stuff that had happened to me.

884
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:04.680
Bethany Shadid: I saw how God used it to make me

885
01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:07.560
Bethany Shadid: The person that I am.

886
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.120
Bethany Shadid: And how beautiful it was

887
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:16.290
Bethany Shadid: And how he was always there.

888
01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.740
Bethany Shadid: And how it could have gone so much differently, but

889
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.540
Bethany Shadid: That these negative things are these things that make me feel

890
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.240
Bethany Shadid: Happy adorable or

891
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:39.270
Bethany Shadid: Disabled that I have a harder time with others.

892
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.640
Bethany Shadid: May be

893
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.080
Bethany Shadid: A more empathetic and compassionate person.

894
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:47.490
Bethany Shadid: So I

895
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just thought, I believe.

896
01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

897
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I am compassionate and empathetic.

898
01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.640
Bethany Shadid: And I have the

899
01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.200
Bethany Shadid: Ability. Yeah.

900
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.090
Bethany Shadid: To

901
01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.950
Bethany Shadid: Understand

902
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:10.230
Bethany Shadid: People

903
01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.250
Bethany Shadid: Going through things that

904
01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:18.870
Bethany Shadid: You know, I've been through, and

905
01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:23.550
Bethany Shadid: That's why I enjoyed their scenes so much

906
01:41:27.690 --> 01:41:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So how, what level of distressing that right now.

907
01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.760
Bethany Shadid: Well, I'm not to stress.

908
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.520
So it's

909
01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.690
Bethany Shadid: Like a 30 okay

910
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, down to a 30 How true is it this belief about you right now. See if you can find what the one is, what do you believe about yourself right now.

911
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:55.500
Bethany Shadid: That I have a purpose. Okay.

912
01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.280
And

913
01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.170
I have a promotion.

914
01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am

915
01:42:02.490 --> 01:42:03.570
Bethany Shadid: I looked

916
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah How true is that

917
01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: One to seven, this is a different scale. How true is it, seven. It's absolutely true.

918
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.280
Bethany Shadid: I, I, it's absolutely true.

919
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:21.060
Bethany Shadid: I just

920
01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.800
Bethany Shadid: This I lose sight of it.

921
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I am I am I am loved and now

922
01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with that truth of seven.

923
01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: One bird. It was forgotten. It's remembered and pull up that piece that one.

924
01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Represents a pattern with your mother and very invalidating moment my words, of course.

925
01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Pulling that up. I

926
01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Am

927
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

928
01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll take these last few minutes and share a little bit about where you're at now what you're finding now.

929
01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:16.950
Bethany Shadid: So I noticed that when I tied it together with

930
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.520
Bethany Shadid: The original thought

931
01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:23.700
Bethany Shadid: I got hot again.

932
01:44:24.930 --> 01:44:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but

933
01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.930
Bethany Shadid: It was almost more of like an angry hot

934
01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:34.920
Bethany Shadid: Like in my ears.

935
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: pulsing

936
01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:41.310
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and

937
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:46.890
Bethany Shadid: I remember the event only with

938
01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.290
Bethany Shadid: You know the other piece in mind and it felt like

939
01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:58.890
Bethany Shadid: None of it could get in. After that, that those were her

940
01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.910
Bethany Shadid: That was her thing, but it wasn't true for me.

941
01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

942
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:08.130
You know,

943
01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.160
Bethany Shadid: Oh, how do I

944
01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just stay with him. Don't

945
01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:16.890
Like

946
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing something really important

947
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That was hers.

948
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I am loved and protected and your showed up to protect it. Okay, you didn't have a right in your family of origin to do that.

949
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, I love, I don't go crazy. I'm right here and I'm protecting it right that's what anger does protect something really precious and important you on top of that weren't allowed to show that

950
01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:52.680
Right.

951
01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Allowed to have boundaries.

952
01:45:57.450 --> 01:45:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: weren't allowed

953
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, get to do that in your life now.

954
01:46:04.110 --> 01:46:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to that core, it means something important is going on.

955
01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you decide whether it gets affected and contacts made with the outside world, but it's a register something importance going on.

956
01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you go to the imagery of I am loved and you

957
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring up images.

958
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And you find you've done this before. You found your way to making it your own to making sure that it is the absolute truth.

959
01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You doing this for you. You

960
01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do know what's right for you. We

961
01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that you make sure you're clear with me you melt does not the right word that my right, it's this, this trinity. This is what it is.

962
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You do know.

963
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.230
Bethany Shadid: You have a

964
01:46:55.890 --> 01:47:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: History of invalidation after invalidation. And it keeps getting played out in the workplace and

965
01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You caught a glimpse of it when you said, well, he can just, I'm so busy. He can come contact me later. That's faith.

966
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's faith.

967
01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was almost unconscious and you can have the rest of your life doing that.

968
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine how freeing that would be

969
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:29.940
Bethany Shadid: Oh, yeah.

970
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to say something quick. Oh, just say that this is not what I meant. Let me rephrase that. Maybe it's that or

971
01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're even short with someone. So what

972
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.450
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

973
01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You to get to be short, YouTube, you have the same right as the rest of us.

974
01:47:57.030 --> 01:48:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To not be taking care of everybody else, you get to pay attention to what's right in front of you. I prioritize this. This is my full attention. I have competing

975
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: urgent, important things coming at me. I have decided this is what needs my attention. I did that. That's what I'm going to do and I'll be right with you.

976
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here.

977
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.950
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

978
01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your assessment of what to do.

979
01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.500
Is perfect

980
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.730
Bethany Shadid: I think I

981
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:34.500
Bethany Shadid: This is a really great way to proceed.

982
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:44.790
Bethany Shadid: What initially when I felt that heat. Again, I thought oh no it's not working right. My imagery

983
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:50.700
Bethany Shadid: And so I I know I need to trust myself.

984
01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:55.320
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I didn't see it right away. How that

985
01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:01.080
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I, I, I do think

986
01:49:03.690 --> 01:49:05.610
Bethany Shadid: This really did a lot

987
01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, going to the things that work a safe place.

988
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All your resources there in your tiny little in your tiny house all of the resources that you need visiting there over and over again. And literally detoxing

989
01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: From all of that that analysis of questioning, can I handle all these coming things coming out and all of that. Just push it to the side.

990
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You go into this tiny room. You feel all of the strength and vitality and love of the belief. I love and you do your problem solving their you write your to do list there. I know you're capable

991
01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I i've been witness, you're quite you have handled so much adversity. Imagine being able to solve problems without all that negative stuff in here.

992
01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Without all of that weight.

993
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to just go to the next right thing just go do it. Hmm.

994
01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.090
Bethany Shadid: That does sound very appealing.

995
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.410
Bethany Shadid: Right, your, your
