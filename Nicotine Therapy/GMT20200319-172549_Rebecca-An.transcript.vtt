00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I thought that they were

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isn't there something in place to suspend

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any kind of disconnect. Notice through this whole thing.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.610
Trisha G: I'm not sure. I don't know.

12
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't. Yeah, I think that there is actually

13
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. So if you come across it again maybe explore it you know through this process while you're

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.720
Trisha G: There. Well, it's a call to

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.980
Trisha G: to suspend it

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, to suspend any kind of shut off while

17
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Quarantine or the

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mandated homestay is going

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the utility companies. And I think also for the landlords. If you can't

22
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.740
Trisha G: Read it.

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

24
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can also read look into it a little bit further, but I'm leaving so that it came straight from

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the top to make that happen.

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.050
Trisha G: Yeah.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.480
Trisha G: Okay, okay. Yeah.

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So to know

29
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's everything going with you. I feel like I haven't seen you in a long time.

30
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.040
Trisha G: Well, everything's been better with my sentence. It's been a little better.

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:12.660
Trisha G: I took him back to his doctor and they have him on the shot like once a month that he takes it plus medications. The shot is that hello pure doll or something like that. But I have to give him that shot once a month. Well, now they increased it to twice a month. So that's helping

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.510
Trisha G: Because it keeps some more calmer.

33
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:27.300
Trisha G: You. So that's helped me some and then I've been checking into trying to get some Penner caregiving help that so far. I wouldn't have luck on that yet. I mean qualifies, but

34
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.720
Trisha G: See, I'm also on disability.

35
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.890
Trisha G: So kind of like makes it hard.

36
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

37
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.300
Trisha G: For me to be able to get that type of help for him.

38
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have that type of help for you for yourself.

39
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.740
Trisha G: No, my disability, all I am on therefore is for depression or severe depression.

40
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.510
Trisha G: So they don't i don't qualify for none of that that

41
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:08.670
Trisha G: He does, he qualifies for all of it because he's a kid. So frantic and he's got a brain injury and stuff from a car accident. He was in

42
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.910
Trisha G: See me I can advise for a lot more. Yeah.

43
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, you definitely look a lot better from the last time that I saw you not yesterday, but the last time.

44
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.490
Trisha G: Yeah.

45
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You definitely alive a calmer, you know,

48
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.510

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's getting better.

52
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.060
Trisha G: Is so far I haven't had no more that episode. Since I talked to you.

53
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, so

54
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what about your mom.

56
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.290
Trisha G: She's so she's doing okay. I mean, she's sick and stuff. She's, she's 90 years she's gonna be 90 years old in June. So just getting that age she gets

57
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.690
Trisha G: Like pneumonia. A lot

58
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.910
Trisha G: Because her lungs are really

59
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.360
Trisha G: That she's doing okay she's still working full time.

60
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.850
That's amazing.

61
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.380

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where does she work. What does she do

67
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.190
Trisha G: Okay, she's a home health aide she takes care of a man that is he's 96

68
00:04:41.010 --> 00:05:00.330
Trisha G: The previous does everything herself, but she just like cooking meals and stranger's house up if he has any other points to take them to those other than that. You don't have to really do much with him. He's pretty self sufficient. And he's 96 I think he's in better health and her actually

69
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.270
Trisha G: Funny.

70
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.410
Trisha G: I got everything happens to him. I don't know what I'll do, how will I get another job. I'm like, we don't need to get another

71
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.830
Job.

72
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.210

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, that's so funny. She's funny.

75
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it rocks. I think it's great you know definitely

76
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.810
Trisha G: Funky your mom's on funding that's what keeps her going is all that work she's

77
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.170
Trisha G: Staying busy there.

78
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:43.830
Trisha G: After my dad passed away. She, she was like real down depressed a lot and she got that job, and she's been working ever since. And she's that's what's helped her keep her going and stuff. I think

79
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.980
Trisha G: They were married for like 66 years and

80
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.200
Trisha G: They were all in the steel and everything.

81
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.180
Trisha G: It's unusual to see that. So yeah.

82
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really good.

83
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.900
Trisha G: There was hard for her. Yeah.

84
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really good. So how has everything been going for you as far as your depression and

85
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm with you in general. How have things been

86
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: progressing along the last couple

87
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.100
Trisha G: I my depression hasn't been that bad.

88
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.190
Trisha G: It's been doing okay.

89
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.380
Trisha G: I don't know, I just been like I've made myself.

90
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.220
Trisha G: You know they'd like they told me you can just get into it. You have to force yourself to keep doing what you got to do.

91
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:44.910
Trisha G: Real stiff, like it or otherwise, I can lay down and knock it out of my bed for a long time. If I just gave into I did that before and that wasn't good. I was like, one time I was in bed for two weeks. I wouldn't get up that

92
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.240
Trisha G: I won't do that. No more. I don't let myself.

93
00:06:49.260 --> 00:07:03.720
Trisha G: So I just find it, you know. Yeah, it's I'm doing a lot better now than I have in for a while and I still get the thing of funny about increasing my marriage is because I still get the cravings for bed at night.

94
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like, by the time

95
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:20.940
Trisha G: It's like seven or eight at night, I start wanting to get get something. And that's not good because I'm by myself. Usually, and my son by the animals just at the end of the day. No, no, it's just

96
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.550
Trisha G: I don't know.

97
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.670
Trisha G: It's wearing off so

98
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.120
Trisha G: I don't know what to do. I just like I fight that too because I won't give in to that anymore.

99
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.880
Trisha G: It's just like I'm determined not to

100
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: let that happen again. So

101
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.030

102
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

103
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.050
Trisha G: Are you taking it to the evening, a little more of a lot a lot like

104
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.260
Trisha G: Yeah, like

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.830
Trisha G: I get one and a half strips a day.

106
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:07.410
Trisha G: I think if I had to a day I would be good because then I take the other half, like in the evening, and I'd be all right then till morning. No. Yeah.

107
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:17.520
Trisha G: I don't know. I don't like to ask her, because we're in group and I don't like to talk in front of a bunch of people. I'm just, I get a barista and shy.

108
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.850

Trisha G: Okay, yeah. The pills. I can feel I tried those before and you

153
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:35.040
Trisha G: Know they made me sick with some of them. I can't take pills. Anyway, I'm bad about pills. Now, since I quit. During the Percocet.

154
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:43.350
Trisha G: Yeah, there's like makes me think of that more. And so I I stay away from pills. If I can do that. I don't take any pills.

160
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.970
Trisha G: Seems like everything I tried typing over my computer or anything is like, Wait a minute, how was that

161
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.210
Trisha G: I never had problem spelling before

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:43.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can spell right i mean either. And now you know the last couple years I seem to train switch the wording around on things. It's

164
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely crazy, you know, certain words. I can't help it is like repetitive. I gotta change it but

Trisha G: My family's good support system, mom. My mom and my brothers and sisters that none of them have ever even done drugs or anything so or been in trouble like me. So it's like they they are real supportive trying to help me to make sure I stay good. They don't want me to mess up, you know,

171
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.840
Trisha G: You know I gotta take care of my son and

173
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:43.440
Trisha G: My mom especially she don't want me to mess up because then it falls back on her and she has enough already.

174
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.110
Trisha G: Know,

175
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.540

Trisha G: Oh yeah, I was checking that out the other day.

181
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.640
Trisha G: You just found that out. I didn't know that.

182
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.140
Trisha G: That's pretty good.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, go to your meetings, you still have that option to okay yeah

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so that way.

193
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can get that piece handled, but I want to just point out to you that you're really doing a good job as far as self.

194
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to pull yourself out of

195
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those cravings, you know, distraction is is one of the biggest things to get us out of our head. No, no.

196
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No matter what

197
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

198
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.490
Trisha G: Seems like it's the only thing that really works with me. So if I just

199
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.880
Trisha G: Find something that I know has to be done. I've been putting off. And I'll just start working on it that way before. I know I'm doing

200
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.790
Trisha G: I'm not even thinking about what I was thinking about

201
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:43.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, yeah. Good. I'm glad that's important. Yeah. And you having a sober support system just for you, you know, is important to you know what I mean.

202
00:16:43.740 --> 00:17:00.840
Trisha G: Yeah, I have one friend that I talked to a lot to she's my age, but she has been through it, too. And she's glance over now. And she's she helps me a lot. She's like, anytime I get like real bad on this color and show you there come over, or we'll just talk, you know,

203
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good.

204
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.420
Yeah.

205
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good, good, good. And what other healthy things are you doing for yourself.

206
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:26.430
Trisha G: Um, mostly that because I've been trying to like a better like they say if you are on a better diet that helps you to. So I've been eating a lot better and healthier things like fruit salads and stuff that I didn't eat before usually just eat a bunch of fried food.

207
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.690
Trisha G: I started changing my diet up like that.

208
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

209
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.220
Trisha G: It does a difference. I have more energy. Yeah.

210
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so in eating that breakfast in the morning, you know, definitely is a big piece. A lot of times people miss the don't eat breakfast. You know, they don't get hungry till later but breakfast is is definitely an energy booster for your day.

211
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're working on managing your sleep, which is good.

212
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I can't. But your volume kind of went down. Okay.

213
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:09.000
Trisha G: I keep I turned it off on the settings that is still keeps going off. Is that what it is is

214
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.000
Trisha G: Auto codes for my car for insurance. I had already gotten I have insurance, but

215
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:31.530
Trisha G: This message came up that because I haven't had no tickets and all this in three years or anything that I could get it lower price. So I put in my information I'm gotten. I don't know how many calls, one after another. I don't know. It's like I shouldn't ever done.

216
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you get blown up I'll sudden every company wants a hold of you. Right.

217
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.420
Trisha G: Those know

218
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're crazy and

219
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are some of the things that you want to work on with me.

220
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.750
Trisha G: That you and I can work with you, um,

221
00:18:53.550 --> 00:19:02.730
Trisha G: Well, just talking to you, like I am, I don't know, just after I talked to you, I feel a lot better, because I feel like I'm doing the right things.

222
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:15.330
Trisha G: Yeah, you know, like you advise me and stuff like tell me about the women's group and everything. I didn't know about that just stuff like that. I think you've made a lot and we might be pressured into so

223
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:16.800
Trisha G: Just

224
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.340
Trisha G: That's mostly, I don't really have much else going on in my life.

225
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.830
Trisha G: I don't have a boyfriend or anything like that. So I just, it's just me and my son.

226
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.760
Trisha G: I don't know. He helped me a lot just talking to you about him and about my personal stuff.

227
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, if you think of anything specific that you want to start working on that. Maybe I can bring you know different you know tools to the table, then let me know, okay.

228
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we will definitely implement that in and it's important you know, Tricia, that you have support.

229
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, your friend, I think is awesome to be able to have that person to come to you and be able to

230
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:02.670
Trisha G: Their own

231
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have that outside entity, because if you don't take care of yourself. You can't take care of your son.

232
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.540
Trisha G: Right, right.

233
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.170
Yeah.

234
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:29.550
Trisha G: Yeah, like I thought I could do what I was doing and take care of him know that don't work doesn't work at all. And when he knows that I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. He gets even worse. He gets more upset more of a control over so I can do that around him ever

235
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's that piece, but also, you know, keep in mind that, you know, taking care of you does take care of him.

236
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

237
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so I'm glad that you are, you know, trying to eat healthier implementing, you know, veggies and fruit and stuff.

238
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your diet that's important and watching your water intake. How much water you're drinking

239
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.450
Trisha G: There.

240
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, be mindful about you know about that piece is huge because we're made of water right

241
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.360
Trisha G: When I don't drink any water so

242
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:20.910
Trisha G: Like yesterday, went to plus it took me an hour and a half. And I was like, wow, this takes a long time. And that guy said, Well, it's because you're, you don't have enough water, you're not enough water, that's what's taking so long and I didn't know that made a difference.

243
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, oh yeah for your plasma.

244
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.470
Trisha G: Does

245
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.790
Trisha G: start drinking more water.

246
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:36.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, like said, and this is just a few suggestions to help you with that because I struggle with drinking water too. But I will get it.

247
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know, maybe a half a half a jug a pitcher really is what I do have water and I put it in the place that I'm at the most.

248
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which would be at my desk, of course.

249
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you know, I put it there and it keeps it in my mind that I need to be drinking that

250
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it just keeps it in the forefront and I just start drinking sipping on it all day.

251
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's a good idea. Yeah, so that way I know and I'm being mindful that I have to get that in my body.

252
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, throughout the day. Right. And it does help with blood draw, it helps with mood, it helps with the way that our body processes things fights off things

253
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it helps in so many different ways. Yeah and there's

254
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Other ways that you

255
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Enjoy all that. Yeah, definitely like

256
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.780
Trisha G: Whenever you're

257
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.520
Trisha G: My I've been

258
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've been what

259
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.150
Trisha G: Oh, I've been a

260
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:45.900
Trisha G: Pretty like I put lines. Squeeze lines in it or lemon has the flavors at some and I like lemon and lime. So that's helped me a lot. And I don't think that hurts. It does it

261
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.340
Trisha G: You know,

262
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's actually good for you to

263
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can put strawberries in it. You can put blueberries in it, you know, you can put

264
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: cucumber slices of cucumber in there. You can put you know what I mean anything to give you the flavor that you're looking for, for, for that day.

265
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.580
Trisha G: So don't taste like water.

266
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's more attractive.

267
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they're actually selling bottles of water with strips of cucumbers and I'm nowadays.

268
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.530
Trisha G: Which I thought was pro. Well, I haven't seen have

269
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:27.840
Trisha G: To check that out. I've gotten some of those flavored waters that I need to see because I would like that. I love cucumbers.

270
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely you can

271
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: actually buy a cucumber cut it up and put it in a bottle of water. You know what I mean, it's like if you pre plan to do these things, you know, for yourself, then you're more prone to be aware that you need to be drinking it. You know what I mean.

272
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And it's like, no more money. It's not going to do spending more money.

273
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.050
You know,

274
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's probably actually cheaper to buy a cucumber than what it is to buy a bottle of cucumber water.

275
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:02.700
Trisha G: Yeah yeah and I get a BT so I can get that with those, you know,

276
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.770
Trisha G: Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah.

277
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that

278
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:20.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's something that you should definitely work on. So you're upping your water intake and, you know, checking out making sure that you're consistent with going to your support.

279
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Groups and you're reaching out to your support person. You know what I mean, all of those things because, again, if you're miserable or you're not doing well, emotionally, mentally, or even physically then

280
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know everything suffers everyone around you. So we've got to make sure that Trisha is in tip top shape.

281
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again,

282
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

283
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:42.480
Trisha G: That's true.

284
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And definitely working on taking care of herself, you know,

285
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.800
Trisha G: Right. I've been trying so

286
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Obviously you have you're implementing good food in your in your diet. You know what I mean, you're still going to your meetings. All of those things are

287
00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are positive reinforcements, you know,

288
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.170
Yeah.

289
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.720
Trisha G: Good doing all that

290
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Anything else that you can think of that would help you

291
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:22.770
Trisha G: Know I pretty much checked everything out that I thought I would need that I want to check out that women's group online now.

292
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.090
Trisha G: So since you told me about it because that sounds good. That

293
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:28.620
Trisha G: Yeah.

294
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.350
Trisha G: I can't think of anything right now.

295
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially if

296
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, right now, if they start closing groups and stuff and

297
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think they meetings and stuff that I keep hearing that they're going to too. And so there has to be some kind of alternative

298
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For that can every like

299
00:25:47.100 --> 00:26:01.290
Trisha G: All of our stores now even Walmart and Walgreens or closed at nine o'clock at night and they used to be open all night. But now under the you know the close them early and so I'm sure the meetings are going to stop to

300
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.120
Trisha G: Enter in the evening.

301
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.570
So,

302
00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's her backup plan.

303
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.840
Trisha G: Yeah, that is a good plan. Sure.

304
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

305
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything else that you that you want to bring to the table today.

306
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.070
Trisha G: Know that that's about it. And that's the only thing I really had any concerns about

307
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.960
Trisha G: Everything else is going pretty good. So, okay.

308
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I haven't gotten anything back from her yet so

309
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She might be in a group or no line or whatever. But definitely, I'm hoping that I'll get a response. And then I can email you and

310
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let you know what the plan is, whether it be a 15 minute med follow up, you know, for you, or whether she's just going to do it a lot of providers will just do it but

311
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.900
Trisha G: You know, again, some I think when I got it increased I

312
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.580
Trisha G: She had a meeting with me.

313
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.770
Trisha G: And they increased it

314
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.930
Trisha G: Okay, yeah, that's fine. To the way I could explain to her more.

315
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.080
Trisha G: Yeah, I just don't like to do in front of everybody in the group.

316
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah and there's nothing wrong with that. Definitely. You know, so we'll do it this way.

317
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay. And in the meantime, just

318
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing just keep doing what you're doing, Tricia, as far as being able to manage and getting out of your head a little bit. The more you practice that the more the better you get at it. Right. And so you want to keep trying to do that until we can

319
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you always want to keep on it. You know, you always want to do it and have those those tools and skills, but

320
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's see what the doctor can and is willing to do. Okay.

321
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.420
Trisha G: Okay.

322
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.130
All right, so

323
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.510
