44
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.490
Melonie Hamilton: I got days they used to do that. And then they would hold up a prescription one doctor verification

45
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:34.470
Melonie Hamilton: And then it would get held up for a day and then. So now I think we're pretty much all that kind of stuff. And we're just so and because there's 31 days in this month. It actually should be getting on Monday night, I believe they

46
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.170
Melonie Hamilton: Don't have resourceful.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.720
Richelle Direny: What was the argument about like what, what about what we talked about creating an argument.

53
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.280
Melonie Hamilton: You don't see he didn't do it that way, like, oh, I heard you know this or that is just attitude of

54
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.950
Melonie Hamilton: Just like I've got the TV on mode downstairs and things like that. He's in the kitchen. I know he can't hear me know. You know what I mean.

55
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.170
Melonie Hamilton: You can't get up the stairs to hear me. I would hear PDF turned down.

56
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.950
Melonie Hamilton: There's just two. There are 300 you know

57
00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:05.220
Melonie Hamilton: This, you know, you know. Cows love this kind of crap and work and feel that I said yes, you fucking are you how you brought this on yourself and

58
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.310
Richelle Direny: What specifically

59
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.920
Melonie Hamilton: Basically may not have sex. Basically, and sleeping on the couch with them.

60
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.900
Melonie Hamilton: And just like

61
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.990
Melonie Hamilton: I really don't care what you think.

62
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:32.880
Melonie Hamilton: Or what you want. You know, he did this to me, and I told him that you did this. You were the one express trust you are the one that broke this and

63
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.030
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know if I'll ever get that back for you.

64
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.680
Richelle Direny: So he wants to maintain and wants to maintain the marriage.

65
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:56.160
Melonie Hamilton: Oh yeah, I want to get naked for him and I don't I don't trust them at all. I don't really trust my body. I'm feeling, you know, I happen.

66
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.550
Richelle Direny: Because of the trust of infidelity.

67
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.270
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, it was just that he messed my entire freakin life up

68
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.520
Richelle Direny: So how was it after the argument what transpired after that.

69
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:27.420
Melonie Hamilton: Um, well, I went to my sister's house she moved to Georgia and she's going through a really bad breakup.

70
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:35.670
Melonie Hamilton: With her boyfriend. And so I went there for all the way

71
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.650
Melonie Hamilton: And

72
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:53.460
Melonie Hamilton: That was a nightmare because her this man, you know, put him in jail. And then, you know, dropped all the charges on him and the restraining order and everything and then he shows up the morning. The next first date. You know that data was there.

73
00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:04.980
Melonie Hamilton: In the morning and clears your house. Out of all of our furniture that works dryer trying to take us, all of us as there and then

74
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.470
Melonie Hamilton: Half my tooth broke off. Well, try to eat something.

75
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.290
Melonie Hamilton: No, no tomorrow.

76
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.140
Melonie Hamilton: After your oral surgeon

77
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.900
Melonie Hamilton: I can't afford

78
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:22.560
Richelle Direny: It.

79
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.940
Richelle Direny: Because of that,

80
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.830
Melonie Hamilton: It broke, broke. Like it's, there's nothing in the back of the tube. It's just like, it's

81
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.710
Melonie Hamilton: Just the layer of that to there and a little bit on the side that

82
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.280
Melonie Hamilton: Is just there, barely.

83
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.590
Melonie Hamilton: So,

84
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.760
Melonie Hamilton: Probably whatever they are going to do is eat up all

85
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.480
Melonie Hamilton: Their just put away for my bankruptcy attorney.

86
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.800
Richelle Direny: So how far are they with um

87
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.560
Richelle Direny: You said that he doesn't help you with anything right. You have to figure it out, based on the money that you make.

88
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.770
Melonie Hamilton: No, he pays for everything that's here has, you know,

89
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:23.400
Melonie Hamilton: This is like we made a lot of sense to me when you were just like, you know, everything that happens here. You know, he pays the easiest to like build up the water, you know,

90
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:36.120
Melonie Hamilton: I just read that the bathroom two bedrooms, you know, and but you know he's only in that these this is his house at the end of the day.

91
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:45.360
Melonie Hamilton: And it was what you said, you know, it doesn't really matter what I do you not know he's not doing any of that for me. He has to maintain his home.

92
00:09:45.900 --> 00:10:06.510
Melonie Hamilton: He makes dinner because he's hungry. You know, he let me go ahead and read paint and you know put together all the stuff. So, you know, you know, literally, pulling the cabinet process and everything. Standing on and get them right but new handles on paint. No, no, because

93
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.630
Melonie Hamilton: Now our values is how

94
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.940
Melonie Hamilton: Everything edgy.

95
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.500
Richelle Direny: I'm

96
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.290
Richelle Direny: So, what, what about the conversation like what transpired between us meeting you having an argument with him.

97
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:42.540
Richelle Direny: And like even today that made me really think about, you know, are putting it into perspective that everything he does, he's really doing for him because he lives in the house in his house. He has to maintain his life. So what made that like someone

98
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.780
Richelle Direny: circle back around where you thought about you did.

99
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.450
Melonie Hamilton: You did.

100
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.360
Melonie Hamilton: Has a stroke on

101
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.700
Richelle Direny: So in thinking that

102
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.990
Melonie Hamilton: There's truth to that.

103
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:21.000
Richelle Direny: So in you thinking about that. Like, what was your takeaway like after you said it struck home and you thought about legal was your takeaway. After that, like in terms of you working on a better tomorrow for yourself. Ultimately,

104
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:29.160
Melonie Hamilton: Well, I mean, I'm starting to work work actually go back to work for

105
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:41.280
Melonie Hamilton: A half to get the bankruptcy done and get this done. I mean, there's some things that I have to get done. It's not many options, you're making. I can do right now.

106
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:52.320
Melonie Hamilton: And because we are married, even if I try to go find assistance they count his income for everything, even though

107
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.250
Melonie Hamilton: So I don't qualify

108
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.340
Melonie Hamilton: For anything

109
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:09.150
Melonie Hamilton: Like when I lived in in Florida, you know, if I needed to see the dentist. I could go to community health and see it then.

110
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:22.080
Melonie Hamilton: It would take, you know, two months or whatever to get an appointment, but so you know when I would put it on a sliding scale based sliding fee based on my income so

111
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.170
Melonie Hamilton: You know, things like that where I was able to get help there because I wasn't married and I didn't have to include anybody come with me.

112
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.330
Melonie Hamilton: No.

113
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.480
Melonie Hamilton: That's just not how it works. Now, and even a

114
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.180
Melonie Hamilton: Filing we thought, you know, I have to file my taxes and such a way that we're

115
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.060
Melonie Hamilton: married filing separately.

116
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.080
Melonie Hamilton: So that he doesn't get caught up in my bankruptcy.

117
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.340
Melonie Hamilton: Not really, I think, I think I made

118
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.580
Melonie Hamilton: $4,000 last year.

119
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.030
Melonie Hamilton: And that'll work.

120
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:14.460
Richelle Direny: So, but even with funding and taxes, whatever amount that you can't, you will get get any good amount. Like, what is your plans with

121
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.440
Melonie Hamilton: With whatever bankruptcy attorney.

122
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:31.590
Melonie Hamilton: Like oh my wages in my money, any, any of my money or everything is going to be, you know, $500 down

123
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:43.110
Melonie Hamilton: And that's sitting there in the bank and a bunch of it's going to be enough even, even though I have dental insurance doesn't cover these major thing.

124
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:56.040
Melonie Hamilton: This is considered an emergency. So I'm hoping it will cover quite a bit of it. I don't know. So I can't do it one way or the other right now. And until I see that dentist tomorrow.

125
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.400
Melonie Hamilton: Or I mean the surgeon. I'm sorry, the oral surgeon

126
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:12.570
Melonie Hamilton: And they, but even then they can just, they can yank it and put something, do something temporary the anything they do to fix it, which is because it's so close to my front teeth. And I have another

127
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.620
Melonie Hamilton: Pair, you know, they want to put in a

128
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.930
Richelle Direny: Crown or temporary

129
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:30.240
Melonie Hamilton: Yes, or even a, what are they called it things to come out adventure, like a you know a

130
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.800
Melonie Hamilton: Piece of adventure. There were just some

131
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:57.030
Melonie Hamilton: I don't you know I want to do is I've already gone to the dentist and then realize this was going to happen. But they, you know, sent me out the theme show and $12,000 versus our work. I need. And that's not getting like, you know, transplanted teeth in sense with like bench.

132
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.900
Melonie Hamilton: And trying to keep my front teeth, you know,

133
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.180
So,

134
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.620
Richelle Direny: And you said that he wants to pay for it, or the insurance companies.

135
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:27.960
Melonie Hamilton: Won't the insurance is going to pay for it and then anything else to come out of money I have with back you know that $500 that was supposed to secure my attorney.

136
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.660
Richelle Direny: How long have you been gone through bankruptcy.

137
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.800
Melonie Hamilton: Well, how it started a half to retain my attorney and because they just want

138
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.020
Melonie Hamilton: I want to see three weeks ago and had him come pick the car.

139
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.820
Melonie Hamilton: So that's going to auction.

140
00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:11.160
Melonie Hamilton: What's, what's going on right now is they they could take me to court to get a judgment, so that they're not doing that yet. I'm just not that far gone, you know, I just quit paying things are just charging off. Now, other than a car, you know, cuz I just told them to come get it and

141
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:21.390
Melonie Hamilton: But now we're to the point once that car's gone to auction already. I'm sure I should be getting the notice I may have it downstairs even already. I just have opened it.

142
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:31.920
Melonie Hamilton: And how much money I owe them. And the thing is, without having a job which I haven't had there was no asset to attach not worth their time.

143
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.690
Melonie Hamilton: You know, they'll just send it to an agency until they catch me with a job or something.

144
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:45.480
Melonie Hamilton: And now that I'm going to start working. They, you know, I was a bill collector for 15 years though consider that a job and an asset that they can take

145
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:53.490
Melonie Hamilton: And so once I start getting people that want to take me to court. I have to retain an attorney, which

146
00:16:54.210 --> 00:17:04.050
Melonie Hamilton: I guess. Either way, it doesn't matter because, you know, I haven't. I'll have some income coming in. So I guess I'll make it up. It's just, just putting on me behind

147
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:15.450
Melonie Hamilton: And I, and I didn't want to start with a bankruptcy attorney before I was working because you only have six months from the time that you start with him.

148
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:27.780
Melonie Hamilton: You know, to get that 1500 dollars paid off and have bankruptcy files do all your stuff. So until I started working. I didn't want to do to retain them. They didn't want that concert running out on me.

149
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.900
Melonie Hamilton: Know,

150
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.570
Melonie Hamilton: Maybe a blessing in disguise. I

151
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.500
Melonie Hamilton: Don't know.

152
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:59.190
Richelle Direny: I mean, it seems like, I mean, I know that the financial piece of it is a big thing because you saw it seems stagnant stagnant and stuck not able to do a whole lot

153
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:11.010
Richelle Direny: Um, so I guess I definitely get that piece. Um, but the question is, is there any other

154
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.350
Richelle Direny: I know last week I made some suggestions on

155
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.060
Richelle Direny: Other kind of employment that you can do.

156
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.950
Richelle Direny: I know you didn't want to go back into the advocacy.

157
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.720
Richelle Direny: Right.

158
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.280
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah.

159
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:54.840
Melonie Hamilton: You don't want to do. Then I got my email that said, you know, from a, like a car dealership to go sell cars, you know, the call for an interview that I don't want to do that either. I want to work six days a week in this cutthroat talking, you know, I don't want to do that you can do.

160
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.820
Melonie Hamilton: It just, you know,

161
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:08.010
Richelle Direny: But, so this is the thing. And so the reality of it is that you don't want to do certain things and I think we all get to a point in our lives where there's just certain things. That's kind of like a no no or

162
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:25.290
Richelle Direny: You know what you don't want it to, um, and by no means am I telling you to go sell your soul. But what I'm, what I'm saying to consider is that giving the position that you're in, given that the situation that you're in.

163
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:32.310
Richelle Direny: You know, especially in a relationship where it sounds to me if I am

164
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:44.760
Richelle Direny: You know, summarize it correctly, you sound some, it seems as if like you're you're trapped in a situation and have no way out, because you don't have the financial resources to cut to get out.

165
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.740
Richelle Direny: Um,

166
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.480
Richelle Direny: So you're kind of stuck.

167
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.330
Melonie Hamilton: In the situation so you can things can get better.

168
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.580
Melonie Hamilton: So there's no

169
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.140
Richelle Direny: Need to get additional income if it's just

170
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:09.600
Richelle Direny: If it's just temporary. Why not think about it, instead of just completely just writing it off.

171
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:22.830
Melonie Hamilton: Well, the cure was the other thing, because I want I've already committed myself to these other dogs which don't have a felt like I said, We'll schedule yet things I get like free

172
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.180
Melonie Hamilton: Three emails a day showing new things that are out there.

173
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:40.140
Melonie Hamilton: But right now I'm committed out through March 14 on on on almost every weekend for literally one literally one weekend, which is not

174
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:53.100
Melonie Hamilton: I can't back out of what I've just committed to them either. I can't go even to that other job and do that. So even if I were to look at it realistically and go okay you know what

175
00:20:53.550 --> 00:21:14.880
Melonie Hamilton: Your schedule tomorrow right and then go don't do anything after March. Yeah, because at least have some work history behind me again. And as long as I don't mess up, I'll have a good reference because a short for the shift I scheduled myself for do a good job on those shifts

176
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:22.410
Melonie Hamilton: That I could get a good reference as long as I don't go back on them or not show up or do something stupid, right.

177
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:34.650
Melonie Hamilton: And that's really where I need to get back to because I keep, you know, the jobs. I lost for, you know, being angry and

178
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.660
Melonie Hamilton: Then bullshit people

179
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.820
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah.

180
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:59.460
Richelle Direny: I mean, I understand, you know, you do have the commitment you want to maintain it. But you so you're committed until at least January March the 14 so that's literally like a month and a half, because before you know it never is already knocking on the door.

181
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.710
Richelle Direny: Um, so it's just looking at, you know,

182
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.520
Melonie Hamilton: If I'm through.

183
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.460
Melonie Hamilton: Until the 23rd through

184
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.190
Richelle Direny: THE 26th of February.

185
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:22.740
Richelle Direny: March. Okay. Okay. But either way, so you have a tool to four months. That's already accounted for in terms of the work that you have, but that so

186
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:32.430
Richelle Direny: As the days progress your life just quarter financially becomes a little bit more difficult, where you have to find your way through it.

187
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:50.520
Richelle Direny: It's saying if something else comes up. That seems a little bit more stable. The income increases. I'm more guaranteed then just say I'm interested. But I won't be available until

188
00:22:52.410 --> 00:23:08.280
Richelle Direny: And that's a conversation that you can have, because even though sometimes companies. They're looking for someone to start a job, oftentimes they're in no rush for the start date, at least they have you working on the process they have someone else in the works.

189
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.290
Yeah.

190
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:19.860
Richelle Direny: I mean it is something to think about. Like you said, you want to be able to get this bankruptcy behind you. And that's going to be a longer process. But you have to be able to come up with the money.

191
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:27.150
Richelle Direny: And when you're not when you're only coming up with a little bit at a time that can be frustrating as well.

192
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.600
Melonie Hamilton: Right.

193
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.400
Melonie Hamilton: I mean I can call on and call them.

194
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.630
Melonie Hamilton: You know, I could do that, you know,

195
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.880
Richelle Direny: You said that you only in this job. It's only two on the weekends, you said

196
00:23:46.470 --> 00:24:00.930
Melonie Hamilton: No, no, that's just the one for the Walmart and then the writing. I'm doing from February 2 to the six and they may add some more photos in there. And then I put it on March 23 to the 26

197
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:08.250
Melonie Hamilton: Let's see. I don't really want. Those are like for to midnight. So that's why I picked it up. They allow me to still do my

198
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.090
Melonie Hamilton: Therapy or, you know,

199
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:19.860
Melonie Hamilton: Try to schedule around other things. And because I'm gonna have to make a doctor's appointment for me to

200
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.010
Melonie Hamilton: Have to go back

201
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.990
Melonie Hamilton: And I have to redo my back doctor appointment I missed that December.

202
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.810
Melonie Hamilton: Know, I went in there. I don't know when that next appointment as I can't find it, don't

203
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.110
Melonie Hamilton: Know my

204
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:47.820
Richelle Direny: Life to adjust the times that you attend grouping. So when you meet with me. You can always adjust it to earlier in the base needs.

205
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:57.810
Melonie Hamilton: Okay i mean i i understand that that might, you know, right now I'm trying to get my foot in the door and I'm just trying to get some time underneath my belt.

206
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:09.090
Melonie Hamilton: That shows that I'm responsible and reliable that I go to work right now. I'm not working at all. The last job, I have bad reference from, you know, they fire. These pressing whatever and

207
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:18.660
Melonie Hamilton: You know, I need to get past that and the other thing is, I didn't want to overload myself right now because I'm trying to step back and

208
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.030
Melonie Hamilton: You know, I don't have

209
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.870
Melonie Hamilton: I don't have the temperament.

210
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:35.040
Richelle Direny: I think you're pacing yourself. These are good. That's a good thing. I definitely agree with that you want to pace yourself. You don't want to go full throttle.

211
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:43.290
Richelle Direny: And then you get burned out. So you definitely want to pace yourself and get used to going back in the workforce and being around people, and

212
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:54.060
Richelle Direny: Just dealing with the hustle and bustle of getting up working and doing all of that. So definitely Pace yourself, take it very slowly. Once you get to a place where

213
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.560
Melonie Hamilton: Like you could go

214
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.340
Richelle Direny: Full Throttle then, most definitely.

215
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:09.300
Richelle Direny: I know one of the things where you don't you've never used to go out a lot. Like how is that for you now like being out and about in the community interacting with

216
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.940
Richelle Direny: Like, what's your anxiety level went

217
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.360
Melonie Hamilton: through the roof.

218
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:22.260
Melonie Hamilton: That's why it around. That's why I lose my temper. This is why you know is that

219
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:32.820
Melonie Hamilton: You know, they basically took away and you know my Xanax all my stuff, you know, I'm on two milligrams a day when I used to do six. So that's it.

220
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.860
Melonie Hamilton: It's just like taking away like it doesn't exist. It certainly doesn't work for me.

221
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:49.830
Melonie Hamilton: And that was the one thing, so it doesn't medication on different levels of whatever we've switched it to different medications on that. That was the thing that kept me get out of the house. Wait, literally.

222
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.490
Melonie Hamilton: Nobody cares. They just want to welcome call me a drug addict and say fuck you deal with it. Well, it doesn't work that way.

223
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.710
Melonie Hamilton: There's real issues of why I don't leave the house and I don't leave the house.

224
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.960
Richelle Direny: So you said that you saw your who prescribed Xanax on Dr Jameson.

225
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.370
Richelle Direny: When you're on two milligrams right now.

226
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:30.420
Richelle Direny: Okay. I mean, so, you know, I know, in speaking to Dr. Jamison, just in general, just from a you know a program standpoint and just what's best for each patient that will work with it's

227
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:38.790
Richelle Direny: That's why I asked you, like, what is your anxiety level like it's because it's slowly working through it like processing.

228
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:54.300
Richelle Direny: You know at what points during the day and what is the situation like kind of walk me through the sequence of events when you start feeling anxious. What is creating the anxiety and speaking through that. So you're

229
00:27:54.450 --> 00:28:00.150
Melonie Hamilton: Gonna want to ever wake up. You don't understand, you know, like I'm happier in Dreamland.

230
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.340
Melonie Hamilton: I don't want to wake up.

231
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.290
Melonie Hamilton: I slept I slept for two days, two

232
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.040
Melonie Hamilton: full days.

233
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.970
Melonie Hamilton: I just slept for two full days.

234
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.960
Melonie Hamilton: Not like a heavy deep sleep, it's like

235
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.410
Melonie Hamilton: I just don't want to get. I don't really have

236
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.500
Melonie Hamilton: No one to do anything.

237
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:31.770
Richelle Direny: So outside of the anxiety. There's the major depression. You don't want to, you know, you just want to kind of lay in bed and not get up, but

238
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.290
Richelle Direny: What is

239
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:47.790
Melonie Hamilton: The very thought of having to get a think. The only reason I got in the shower today was go ahead and get on here with you and I think you wanted to look at me from having been sleeping for to fucking days like that.

240
00:28:51.990 --> 00:29:06.000
Richelle Direny: What is surrounding that. And I'm not trying to beat a dead horse in the sense that that I'm not aware of all of the different stressors that you're presented within what's on your mind or ways down on your mind, daily, but

241
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.830
Richelle Direny: Like what is that main

242
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:25.800
Richelle Direny: stressor that keeps you laying in bed that keeps you kind of in this very low depressed mood that when you think about it increases your anxiety, like what is that

243
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:36.210
Richelle Direny: The primary stress or the primary issue that keeps you like once that makes you feel like you want to just disconnect from life.

244
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:57.510
Richelle Direny: Is the feeling of not feeling wanted not be giving the attention that you're in a relationship that is somewhat like a dead end relationship is it

245
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:10.110
Richelle Direny: You know, what is the there are many problems that we all have. But there is that one key one that just kind of keeps us in the slum all the time and makes it very hard for us to

246
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.210
Melonie Hamilton: pull ourselves out of it. I don't

247
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.440
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know how to explain to you why I have been that way for like six years for that. No.

248
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.680
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know too much bed. She has happened.

249
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.610
Melonie Hamilton: Works out everything goes to shit.

250
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:40.560
Melonie Hamilton: Now I'm just getting fucking all they want to rip the teeth out of my head, and I feel ugly and my kids didn't test all the time and I don't want to do it.

251
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.080
Melonie Hamilton: So many free

252
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:57.540
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And you're saying a lot. You're saying a lot each each piece of what you said can be broken down into different you know situation but

253
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:07.380
Richelle Direny: You're saying that 15 years ago is when you started feeling, what was that significant event that kind of like start everything started going downhill for you 15 years ago.

254
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.930
Melonie Hamilton: Native Born

255
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.430
Richelle Direny: From your first met. How long were you with your that's your first husband.

256
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.210
Melonie Hamilton: My daughter.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:26.550
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, we were together. We were married for 15 years so we worked together for years, but he was an island.

258
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:32.970
Melonie Hamilton: You know, and Samantha wanted to stay with him. He didn't be her

259
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.110
Melonie Hamilton: So no, I didn't even fight that. And I was

260
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.050
Melonie Hamilton: A kid and brainwashed it

261
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.790
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know.

262
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.130
Richelle Direny: You have two children.

263
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.590
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Then the two children are from your previous marriage.

264
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:03.390
Melonie Hamilton: Well, I had us through when I was 15 and when I was 16 I had him.

265
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:11.730
Melonie Hamilton: Took me 10 years to get the nerve up to it again bows and never bring another child and poverty.

266
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.890
Melonie Hamilton: Which I then I brought her into an abusive. She relationship.

267
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.260
Melonie Hamilton: So you're probably

268
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.890
Richelle Direny: Your first husband is NOT YOUR SON'S FATHER.

269
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:24.570
Melonie Hamilton: No.

270
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.400
Richelle Direny: Okay, now

271
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.680
Richelle Direny: How long were you with this your first, your first

272
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.200
Richelle Direny: Like how long was the relationship

273
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.510
Melonie Hamilton: With us and

274
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.200
Melonie Hamilton: With us since that

275
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.640
Richelle Direny: No.

276
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:49.470
Richelle Direny: You said that it started 15 years ago in that relationship was he was abusive and violent that relationship.

277
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.060
Melonie Hamilton: For roughly 15 years

278
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.580
Melonie Hamilton: Before I finally walk

279
00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.830
Melonie Hamilton: Oh, and then he followed me

280
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.940
Richelle Direny: And that's the relationship that he was very abusive.

281
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.100
Richelle Direny: And then after you

282
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:16.380
Richelle Direny: mustered up enough courage to walk to leave the relationship you said your daughter chose to stay with her dad.

283
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.940
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, she came and stayed with me in Florida for a year, a whole school year.

284
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.600
Melonie Hamilton: And then her dad came down

285
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.600
Melonie Hamilton: Like four months into it.

286
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:32.520
But

287
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.810
Melonie Hamilton: Even when Daniel and I went through our divorce and stuff, you know, when I moved out. I moved into the same subdivision.

288
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:49.740
Melonie Hamilton: So that she wouldn't change a daycare she wouldn't have to enter school should lose your friends or family, which was his family, but that was what she had grown up with

289
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:57.870
Melonie Hamilton: And so I always made sure to stay. You know, there. So when I move, move, you know, here she is.

290
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:22.530
Melonie Hamilton: She wanted to know if you if you go from Colorado Springs to the Florida. Keep it is it is a culture shock. It never pulled down. You know what I mean, it's so hot. It's like a three year adjustment period and my son came with me. So he was on a train back to Colorado within two weeks.

291
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.360
Melonie Hamilton: So it was not their world.

292
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.700
Richelle Direny: So for you.

293
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:49.710
Richelle Direny: It was this feeling of a loss of a relationship abandonment, having no because of the years that you were in this abusive relationship you lost your self worth. You lost value within yourself full

294
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:51.780
Richelle Direny: Mean

295
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:59.670
Richelle Direny: Your self esteem. Sounded like it went down because it sounds like you, you put everything into this relationship and it was

296
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.750
Richelle Direny: A complete loss and then your children.

297
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.340
Richelle Direny: So abandon you. Is that what I'm hearing

298
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:23.220
Melonie Hamilton: And we all know Dustin went to jail. And they kept going back to jail. And then he finally went to prison for them and he just got out of prison, I, I talked to my son. He's in Colorado and

299
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.050
Melonie Hamilton: He just got out of jail, about four months ago.

300
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.690
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, so maybe five now.

301
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.660
Melonie Hamilton: Or prison, I should say.

302
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.800
Melonie Hamilton: Because that amount. Early on, for all

303
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:50.640
Richelle Direny: Of your son being out of prison. I'm just saying for you. Because remember, I'm looking at like your

304
00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:02.340
Richelle Direny: Your primary suppressant like what keeps you down. What keeps you in the slum. Like, what is it that weighs you down.

305
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:09.540
Richelle Direny: And that's and you refer to. You said 15 years ago.

306
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:23.310
Richelle Direny: You're pretty much still back 15 years ago in this relationship that was abusive and everything kind of that went on and now fast forward 15 years later, and you're somewhat in the same situation.

307
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:43.980
Melonie Hamilton: What do you want me to say. I mean what, what, you know, you look at the, how many suicides ahead, and then I succeeded, and you have to go because I get up and I'm working for what I'm doing for what

308
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.940
Melonie Hamilton: You know, when my family around. I don't have any friends I have

309
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.840
Melonie Hamilton: No grandkids. So there's nothing

310
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:02.550
Richelle Direny: So then the question is, you ask yourself what is it worth like what is

311
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.600
Was my life.

312
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.150
Richelle Direny: So you feel like your word.

313
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:11.280
Melonie Hamilton: I go like, it's not worth a shit. Why am I even here.

314
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.160
Richelle Direny: Is there any point in. Is there any time that you felt

315
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.610
Richelle Direny: It Sunday, a time that you really experience and you just felt

316
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.730
Richelle Direny: Happy where you felt some degree of joy, where you are not feeling the way you're feeling all the time.

317
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:30.600
Melonie Hamilton: What

318
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.080
Richelle Direny: Is it that you you can't express how you're feeling

319
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.780
Richelle Direny: Now, you feel

320
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:47.880
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah.

321
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.420
Richelle Direny: You don't have headsets.

322
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:53.460
Melonie Hamilton: Huh.

323
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.990
Richelle Direny: You don't have headset.

324
00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:57.930
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah.

325
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.090
Richelle Direny: Oh,

326
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.520
Melonie Hamilton: Okay, so

327
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:14.010
Richelle Direny: Tell me about a moment ago even whether it lasted maybe five minutes 10 minutes what brought it on like a time where you felt worse you felt worthy.

328
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:22.680
Richelle Direny: You felt beautiful or you felt happier you felt joy and you weren't feeling as depressed or anxious

329
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.160
Melonie Hamilton: There never really has been a journey.

330
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:50.250
Richelle Direny: All right, well, then tell me about the beginning of this current relationship because in order to get into it. Maybe there was a point where you felt a lady you felt happy you felt like my life is going to be a little bit better now its relationship may work.

331
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.260
Melonie Hamilton: Like

332
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:53.850
Melonie Hamilton: Lately,

333
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.080
And I'm having

334
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.430
Melonie Hamilton: A tough them lately and you know you're

335
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.680
Richelle Direny: You're moving the phone so I can hardly really it's not coming up very clear, you're saying

336
00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:17.880
Melonie Hamilton: When this relationship. I've known my whole day no for many years, even though we weren't dating or things like that and

337
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:27.180
Melonie Hamilton: Just as being as close as we were he was always there for me always there for me if I needed something

338
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:42.360
Melonie Hamilton: You know when I got out of my last relationship. And after all that hurricane. And I had to, you know, start moving in all the stuff he was this person I call the help me, you know, and that's it's just I had trust in him in a way that

339
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:50.430
Melonie Hamilton: This marriage would have worked. Had he not done the things we did

340
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.040
Melonie Hamilton: Quite literally

341
00:40:54.630 --> 00:41:01.860
Melonie Hamilton: Two weeks before we were supposed to move here to this House that we picked out and in down you know all the stuff we had planned.

342
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:12.810
Melonie Hamilton: And that's what happens when I built myself. I was like, you know, I was happy I was looking forward to getting out of the Florida Keys. And out of that just

343
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:23.040
Melonie Hamilton: Away from all these people and having a real home and property and stuff. Take care of things to do and wanted to just

344
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.800
Melonie Hamilton: Be happy morning

345
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.160
Melonie Hamilton: And planning for it together.

346
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:40.980
Richelle Direny: So you're saying that in the beginning when you really needed him to be there. He was def definitely there for you. He was always there for you, helping you.

347
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:42.810
Melonie Hamilton: Mm hmm.

348
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.130
Richelle Direny: And then

349
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.390
Melonie Hamilton: Especially like even when when I decided, you know,

350
00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:54.660
Melonie Hamilton: To throw myself into a detox center so I could, you know, come on.

351
00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:05.070
Melonie Hamilton: Doctors killing me. And I heard about Suboxone and all this stuff. I didn't have insurance and

352
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:13.830
Melonie Hamilton: You know, he was the person where, you know, if I didn't have the money to get you know my oxygen, you know, he would help me.

353
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:25.770
Melonie Hamilton: If I couldn't get up to my doctor and Miami, I could drive this truck, you know, things like that. Like just things that normal people that don't care about you just, they don't do

354
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:36.630
Richelle Direny: So even now being in this program. He is somewhat supportive of what you're saying.

355
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.170
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, I mean, I mean it's just

356
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:48.660
Melonie Hamilton: me who my issue with all of this has been my doctor had me so for both

357
00:42:51.570 --> 00:43:02.490
Melonie Hamilton: I had to look at every to. So, where, where were they going to take me when I was 50 or 60 you know they had me max out. I had a doctor wanted to put me on on

358
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.150
Melonie Hamilton: Them like that for people who are dying.

359
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:21.330
Melonie Hamilton: In you know in so I decided, You know, I didn't know about Suboxone once I started doing my homework. It's really all about it. I like that. It just looks like such a better alternative

360
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:31.410
Melonie Hamilton: You know, and especially with everything else you know that I take, you know, when I because I have my Xanax and all these things and the

361
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:47.160
Melonie Hamilton: Respiratory problems and accidental overdoses. And I think like that, you know, and I wanted it. I wanted it to go away. You know, I wanted my life back. And I saw that as my way. And so I did that, you know,

362
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.440
Richelle Direny: And

363
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.380
Richelle Direny: Even with the beat on the Suboxone program.

364
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:07.200
Richelle Direny: Um, you know you're doing the you're on the mat, then you're getting the the scripts for it, you're doing

365
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.900
Richelle Direny: Well, you're, you're doing the work.

366
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:21.780
Richelle Direny: Though, you're not necessarily feeling like there's, there's a whole lot of accomplishment or you're not feeling this early any better, to some degree, you're still

367
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:30.570
Richelle Direny: very depressed and you're still, you know, feeling anxious and you still feel somewhat low but your work. So there is that part of you.

368
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:49.680
Richelle Direny: That wants things to get better. You want to trust and believe in yourself. Again, you want to just be whole again. So you are doing the steps to get there. If I think that is just tapping within yourself to know that there

369
00:44:51.330 --> 00:45:01.620
Richelle Direny: There is more. And that you are worth more. And it appears through a fortnight, it appears. I mean, through years of abuse and being talked down to.

370
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:21.120
Richelle Direny: Um, abused physically abused, emotionally, mentally, the sense of this feeling of abandonment by everyone around you. Um, and then coming back into a relationship where you felt like it was your Redeemer and it ends up being somewhat similar to what you just left.

371
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:42.270
Richelle Direny: It puts you back in that state of mind or that frame of mind that I'm maybe I'm really not worth it. Maybe I'm not valued. Maybe I cannot be loved. But the question is, with all of that. And with all of that. The question is, do you love yourself and how much do you love yourself.

372
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:43.830
Melonie Hamilton: Like

373
00:45:47.160 --> 00:46:00.690
Richelle Direny: But that's really that that's the real like that's the question you have to ask yourself, do you love yourself. And I think you say not very much and I believe that there is a greater part of you that do love yourself because you're doing what you need to do.

374
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:12.120
Richelle Direny: To become whole again to feel better, you're processing what we talked about maybe what you learn in group or what you hear and group you are processing it you're thinking about it.

375
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.460
Richelle Direny: I just think that you

376
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:27.750
Richelle Direny: You just need to some form of, you know, to encourage yourself self motivator. Like, do you have like one person in your life that you trust and speak to

377
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.770
Melonie Hamilton: Me and my mom, my mom's a disaster. So

378
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.800
Melonie Hamilton: It's hard to talk to her, because you know I love her a trust her. But it's some

379
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.440
Melonie Hamilton: You know,

380
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.970
Melonie Hamilton: A lot of this is learned behavior from her.

381
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.930
Richelle Direny: Your mom was is very depressed as well.

382
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.490
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, so

383
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:11.880
Richelle Direny: So okay, so I can see the learned behavior in terms of just how to cope and how to deal and I know one of the sessions that we spoke, you talked about having belief in God. And I think didn't choose to go to church or something like that.

384
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.970
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, but I'm not there. I don't

385
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.220
Melonie Hamilton: Know I don't you know

386
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.260
Richelle Direny: Not anymore. Right.

387
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:32.400
Melonie Hamilton: Well, I mean, there is a belief there, but it's not the religion bullshit hate this.

388
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.250
Richelle Direny: One that's talking about from a religious aspect, just a belief in

389
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.010
Richelle Direny: Power higher than yourself.

390
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:50.640
Melonie Hamilton: Don't know when I killed myself and I died. There was no, wait, wait.

391
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:52.860
Melonie Hamilton: While you're here, nothing.

392
00:47:53.790 --> 00:48:00.600
Richelle Direny: You're here. So that means that you still have a purpose. That means that you still have a worse. So, in

393
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:05.070
Melonie Hamilton: Number of all that means is the doctors just brought me back after I begged them not to

394
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:08.370
You

395
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.960
Richelle Direny: You still have a purpose. And I think it's working on

396
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.210
Richelle Direny: bringing that out of your users. You have

397
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.210
Richelle Direny: If the situations and the circumstances.

398
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.490
Richelle Direny: Are just making it very hard for you to see you and for you to believe it.

399
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:40.380
Richelle Direny: I have a question right now you're actively working on getting through.

400
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.330
Richelle Direny: I'm

401
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:52.140
Richelle Direny: Getting through this financial barrier, the bankruptcy. What, in your mind, what is your plan. Once that is resolved.

402
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.060
Richelle Direny: Is that going to make you less depressed less anxious happier.

403
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:07.740
Melonie Hamilton: Is that, well, I don't, I'm not gonna say anything about that. I'm going to say that it's going to take some pressure off as far as what

404
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.660
Melonie Hamilton: I am able to do if I do want to do it.

405
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.640
Richelle Direny: The one thing that you want to do if you're able to do it.

406
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:23.610
Melonie Hamilton: No.

407
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.860
Melonie Hamilton: No, don't say

408
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:35.190
Richelle Direny: The reason why I'm asking that. Because if it is, whether it's changing your where you live.

409
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.260
Melonie Hamilton: Oh, dress. Yes.

410
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:43.980
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you know, but the but this is the reality. Even if you want. If you change your address. So, financially, you know,

411
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:55.020
Richelle Direny: Here's somebody is coming to hand you a miracle and the miracle is now you are financially. You are free of all of your financial burdens right

412
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:57.360
Richelle Direny: You're

413
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.140
Melonie Hamilton: You're seeing us but you know

414
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:10.290
Melonie Hamilton: I'm just saying, you know, right now I don't have even, even with a bankruptcy, though they go back. There's no evictions or anything like that. I have to get rid of that.

415
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.630
Richelle Direny: That's something you do

416
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.330
Melonie Hamilton: In our market. I don't know. I would be afraid to be alone.

417
00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.250
Melonie Hamilton: But, but

418
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:28.950
Richelle Direny: What I'm saying to you in our minds, we look at our circumstances. And it's kind of like, okay, I want a car. I'm going to give an example. I want a car.

419
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:37.260
Richelle Direny: So what are my stressors right now. It's like, right, I need to get to work. I need to get to the grocery store. I need to take care of my children. I need to do this and I need to that, but I need a car.

420
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:48.420
Richelle Direny: And so my stressors ways. Now, my mind is that I need a car because I can't see past all of my issues in my circumstances because I need a vehicle.

421
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:56.520
Richelle Direny: I need this mode of transportation to get me from I need to get from A to Z, and the only way for me to get from A to Z. I can't do that with work.

422
00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:07.170
Richelle Direny: And I can't do that on a bus, and I can't do that. I need a vehicle and everything that shows up in my life just reminds me each and every time that I need a vehicle.

423
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:14.220
Richelle Direny: And so that's I'm thinking in my mind is the cause of my depression, so somebody comes along and says, Okay, I'm going to give you a vehicle.

424
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, I have the vehicle. I feel happy. I feel good.

425
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.890
Richelle Direny: A month into it, I go back to feeling bad.

426
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.660
Melonie Hamilton: So then that's my point like it things, things aren't going to make a difference.

427
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:44.310
Richelle Direny: Exactly, things are not going to make a difference. You got my point, things are not going to make it different. Yes. It relieves have maybe an ounce of the pressure. Yes, because now I don't have to worry about, where's the next dollar going to come from to pay these bills.

428
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.660
Richelle Direny: But

429
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.690
Richelle Direny: The truth of the matter is the core is the war that's inside of you.

430
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:57.960
Richelle Direny: And what is continuing to fuel that war this region inside

431
00:51:59.160 --> 00:51:59.700
Richelle Direny: You have

432
00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.110
Melonie Hamilton: A test.

433
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.720
Melonie Hamilton: I'm angry.

434
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.930
Richelle Direny: What's fueling that fire so you're ablaze. What is fueling that fire.

435
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:26.400
Richelle Direny: Until it's kind of like the force is burning down what is causing this fire. Every time I pour water on this it blazes I pour water it Blazes, I need to get to the source.

436
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:46.110
Richelle Direny: Of the fire and until I get to the source and remove the source, the fire won't stop coming on. And so what is fueling your fire. What is fueling your rage. What is it that you're having to dear life that you're finding. It's so hard to release it so that you can breathe again.

437
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.310
Richelle Direny: So that you can see life clean or just see

438
00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.600
Richelle Direny: What is in front of you a little bit clearer to get past

439
00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.950
Melonie Hamilton: Them, I hate them men all they've done is fucked me over.

440
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.320
Melonie Hamilton: And they take advantage of me when I'm down underneath me some more.

441
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.970
Melonie Hamilton: And then they want to make me feel bad because I'm not giving them what they need.

442
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.730
Melonie Hamilton: Well, you know, when you're a fucking predator. That's pretty much how that works for you.

443
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.820
Richelle Direny: And this has always been like that for you when it comes on to men.

444
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.830
It's just, yes.

445
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.190
Richelle Direny: Well, that's just how it's always been like that for you.

446
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:34.080
Melonie Hamilton: Yes.

447
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.470
Melonie Hamilton: Nothing has ever worked out.

448
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.460
Melonie Hamilton: And that helps me out. So that's not always done you know it takes talking to

449
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:49.710
Richelle Direny: So,

450
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:58.590
Richelle Direny: I have this one question and I don't know this is kind of we're kind of at the end of our session. So to bring up this might be

451
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.730
Richelle Direny: And we will definitely address it again.

452
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.110
Richelle Direny: In our next question.

453
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.860
Richelle Direny: But I'm gonna, I'm going to take you back, way back for a moment.

454
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.020
Richelle Direny: What was the relationship like with your father.

455
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:16.680
Melonie Hamilton: Normally

456
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.260
Melonie Hamilton: Pretty much.

457
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.170
Melonie Hamilton: So we were way older than he came to Colorado.

458
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.330
Melonie Hamilton: And then

459
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.270
Melonie Hamilton: You know,

460
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.600
Melonie Hamilton: Try to get back into our lives.

461
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.360
Melonie Hamilton: Many has cancer, lung cancer, anytime

462
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:45.090
Richelle Direny: A. How long did you know him, or had a chance to have a relationship with him before he died.

463
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:53.070
Melonie Hamilton: About two years. It really take advantage of that.

464
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.040
Richelle Direny: And you said you tried to take advantage of what

465
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.590
Melonie Hamilton: I don't really know.

466
00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:59.430
Richelle Direny: How is

467
00:54:59.520 --> 00:54:59.940
Living

468
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:01.770
Melonie Hamilton: Huh.

469
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.510
Richelle Direny: How old were you when you met him.

470
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.570
Melonie Hamilton: About all

471
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.620
Melonie Hamilton: Those kindergarten, first grade.

472
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:12.570
Melonie Hamilton: And six

473
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:14.220
Richelle Direny: And then he died.

474
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.190
Melonie Hamilton: Oh, that's so nice. That was when I was a little kid, you know, I remember meeting him.

475
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:28.110
Melonie Hamilton: When I was a little kid, you know and remember where we live. I had to be going into first grade.

476
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.470
Melonie Hamilton: So then

477
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:50.790
Melonie Hamilton: You know, he said away with the nerve, a child or, you know, even when he got sick with a, you know, lung cancer, he was a veteran. So he had veterans like no social security in never was working on a book so that he didn't have to pay child support Weaver over

478
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.500
Richelle Direny: And so throughout the end. So how old were you when

479
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:56.040
He died.

480
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:12.270
Melonie Hamilton: Hey, we know you're I was just like so many things out.

481
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:14.970
Richelle Direny: And so

482
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.290
Richelle Direny: Who

483
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.680
Melonie Hamilton: Who do I blame.

484
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:23.460
Richelle Direny: Oh no, I thought you said you blame I thought that's what you said so.

485
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:41.370
Melonie Hamilton: I blame her for a lot anyway but yeah but no I blink it like I I'll have plenty, but I don't remember. Like, I can't I just put it away, right, like when I was talking to my sister. She's telling me all these things that happen. And I'm like,

486
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:44.100
Melonie Hamilton: I didn't remember any of them.

487
00:56:44.970 --> 00:57:00.090
Richelle Direny: And so in that time where your father was somewhat in and out of your life. Did you were there other men that maybe your mom was involved in was, that was kind of in in in the visual you affection or treated you like

488
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:08.520
Richelle Direny: Or did they more take advantage of you and your sisters and your mom or like what was that in terms of a male role model growing up.

489
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:15.630
Melonie Hamilton: My mom is okay my current step father who I call my dad came into our lives.

490
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:28.200
Melonie Hamilton: Right when I was about 12 years old. That was her first marriage and I can't even count the boyfriends. I have or the middle on awesome I have

491
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.070
Melonie Hamilton: I couldn't count them. And I don't remember. Molly way.

492
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:46.350
Melonie Hamilton: So that was her marriage and she works for the airline all over the place we you know we had a step dads. You know, I don't remember the forms. I was really little.

493
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.540
Melonie Hamilton: And then

494
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.820
Melonie Hamilton: She married a pilot, you just step dad and

495
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.130
Melonie Hamilton: Then they got divorced

496
00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:06.030
Richelle Direny: So throughout your life, you had all these different men and an out of your life, none to really call you their own to say

497
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:18.330
Richelle Direny: To, to be a true role model to show you what a decent loving, caring husband's father looks like.

498
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:28.080
Richelle Direny: To you have nobody that really your mom wasn't necessarily based on what you're saying wasn't necessarily the greatest example of that.

499
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:34.590
Richelle Direny: Because she had as you're seeing so many men coming in and out of you and your sister or how many of her siblings you have

500
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:46.860
Richelle Direny: In an out of your life. So to have someone to show you true affection to show you and tell you that you're beautiful, and you're worth something, and pretty much mold.

501
00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:59.850
Richelle Direny: The concept of what a man really should be in a woman's life or in a child's life, you have no true example of that. So now when you look at your upbringing between mom and dad.

502
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:06.270
Richelle Direny: Whether via dad or all of the different men that were in and out of your life.

503
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.550
Richelle Direny: You sounds like you're pretty much mimicking to some degree.

504
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:14.820
Richelle Direny: Your mom's footsteps.

505
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:17.430
Richelle Direny: Sick. You're looking for love.

506
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:38.940
Richelle Direny: And affection route. Amen. Because you don't know what that looks like to be loved and the affection, the attention that you're seeking out in your own relationships with the different people that you've been around, you're really truly seeking back from

507
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:40.770
Richelle Direny: Your father

508
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.720
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know.

509
00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:56.550
Richelle Direny: It's a, it's a far. It's a question because based on what you're saying.

510
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:58.800
Richelle Direny: A lot of that.

511
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:16.020
Richelle Direny: Comes from what we lacked from the parents will roles that were placed in our lives that the parents of figures that were placed in our lives. And if they didn't do a very good job at that we tend to seek it out.

512
01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:20.700
Richelle Direny: In the different relationships that we get into

513
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.870
Richelle Direny: Because we create what it should look like in our minds, based on what we see other people do.

514
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:30.720
Richelle Direny: And what they get us recreate that

515
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:31.950
In these relationships.

516
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:46.830
Richelle Direny: So you're looking for in all of these relationships that you're in. You're looking for love and affection, you're looking to be told that you're worthy you're looking to be told that you are something that

517
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.320
Richelle Direny: You're just looking for love.

518
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.900
Richelle Direny: Because you really don't know how to love yourself.

519
01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.260
Richelle Direny: So you're looking for someone to love you.

520
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.660
Melonie Hamilton: Don't know.

521
01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:05.280
Melonie Hamilton: Maybe

522
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:23.700
Richelle Direny: It is food for thought. Um, it's something because again it's identifying the source in order to heal in order to start the healing process. We have to find the source of your fire.

523
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.170
Melonie Hamilton: Your goal.

524
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:38.250
Melonie Hamilton: Is not to be hearing process and we can have it for six years old.

525
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.210
Richelle Direny: It's it's it's a start.

526
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.280
Richelle Direny: It's a start.

527
01:01:46.530 --> 01:02:00.300
Richelle Direny: Up. Very a lot of in what you said. Like, you, you, you know, you don't want to think about it. You don't want to, um, are you block a whole lot of things from your mind you block. A lot of the hurt and the pain you suppress it

528
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.790
But

529
01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:08.040
Richelle Direny: The reality is, no matter how much we try to suppress something it wants to come out.

530
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:24.390
Richelle Direny: It wants to come out. It wants you to give birth to it. He wants you to release it so that you can become whole but like you said, it is a healing process. It's not going to happen overnight. It's not going to happen in the next month or two, it is a process and

531
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:28.890
Melonie Hamilton: When you say I like my fingers and maybe I'm just accustomed to them.

532
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:36.870
Richelle Direny: And you are. And you're absolutely right, you're accustomed to them. And you know why you're accustomed to them because that's all you know

533
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.170
Richelle Direny: No one has ever said to you.

534
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:47.250
Richelle Direny: Know, you don't have to live with this particular demon for the rest of your life. It is okay to release it.

535
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.430
Richelle Direny: To demon is asking to be released.

536
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.690
Richelle Direny: But then, because you're so accustomed to it. It is your normal

537
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.030
Richelle Direny: It is your normal

538
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.870
Richelle Direny: You know know a better until someone tells you

539
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.310
Richelle Direny: Hey. You ever thought that maybe this is what's going on.

540
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.360
Richelle Direny: Have you ever thought that that may be what fuels your fire.

541
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:19.890
Richelle Direny: So you're absolutely right when you said that you know you're just accustomed to it.

542
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.970
Richelle Direny: You're absolutely right. It's your normal

543
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:32.250
Richelle Direny: Then, do you want a different normal is the question. Do you want to know what a different normal feels like in look like

544
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.600
Richelle Direny: That's the question.

545
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.340
Richelle Direny: And are you willing to go through the

546
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.760
Richelle Direny: Process to get away. That's the question.

547
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.390
Richelle Direny: So, um,

548
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.120
Richelle Direny: I would definitely love to explore it a little bit more during our next session.

549
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.910
Richelle Direny: Um, well, just think about it. Do you

550
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:06.840
Richelle Direny: Can we try something for our next session or that you can work on

551
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.390
Richelle Direny: And I think we did. We talked about it. The last time telling years each day.

552
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.240
Richelle Direny: Telling us some one positive thing for the day.

553
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:27.420

558
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.890
Melonie Hamilton: Well, I'm not a really big firm believer in line. So

559
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:48.510
Melonie Hamilton: I'm firm believer in lying to myself so

560
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:51.810
Richelle Direny: What it's a start.

561
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:58.050
Richelle Direny: Because until you learn to love yourself, it's going to be very, very hard.

562
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.020
Melonie Hamilton: To cross over it. Why

563
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.340

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.430
Richelle Direny: It could be alive.

566
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.740
Melonie Hamilton: It would be allowed to

567
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:15.120
Richelle Direny: Do you want to learn how to

568
01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.140
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know if this sucks.

569
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:21.390
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

570
01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.120
Melonie Hamilton: I don't know. This sucks.

571
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.720
Melonie Hamilton: Talking about this.

572
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.380
Richelle Direny: Why do you need it.

573
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.980
Richelle Direny: What, what about it makes you hate it so much.

574
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:47.670
Melonie Hamilton: Be vulnerable.

575
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.750
Richelle Direny: Vulnerable to getting hurt.

576
01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.710
Melonie Hamilton: Yeah, they have it.

577
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.190
Melonie Hamilton: They all dollars shipping happening even try to remember it.

578
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.120
Melonie Hamilton: You don't want to remember it. There's a reason

579
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.530
Richelle Direny: But this is what it's doing. See right now.

580
01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:22.860
Richelle Direny: Think about giving when you were giving birth to any one of your kids and the doctors have Melanie, but you got to get it down. You're like it hurts too much. I don't

581
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:24.870
Richelle Direny: Know, I don't want to have to go through

582
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:42.360
Richelle Direny: But you know, I don't. But if you don't, you are going to die. You have to release it and I know it because I have three kids. So I know you got to get it out and you're like, No, it hurts so

583
01:06:43.710 --> 01:07:05.250
Richelle Direny: It hurts. But in the end, when you finally allowed yourself to release it. You loved what the end result was but you just have to pump one point to say I want to take a chance and I want to trust the process I just take a chance. That's it. Just take a chance

584
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:10.860
Richelle Direny: You got it.

585
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.270
Richelle Direny: One at a time, one of the time, not all at once. But one of the time.

586
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.910
Melonie Hamilton: I feel like I'm doing right now is showing up.

587
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:31.710
Richelle Direny: At you're absolutely right, you are absolutely you are thousand percent right just by showing up and doing this and keeping to your plan, you are

588
01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:44.430
Richelle Direny: That even though it's very hard for you to tell yourself that I love, I love Melanie is even though it's hard, you're showing Melanie that you do care and you want a new normal.

589
01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:51.420
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I believe that I showed up today.

695
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.650
Yeah.

696
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:58.470
Richelle Direny: So that's how we. That's how we roll in Florida.

697
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.000
Richelle Direny: So you're always welcome to move to Florida.

698
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:04.140
Brittany Mount: If you hate the smell and

699
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.380
Brittany Mount: I would love to. For real. I would love to.

700
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:11.490
Richelle Direny: And I'm sure your daughter would love it because then the beach is everywhere.

701
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:14.100
Brittany Mount: Yeah. Yep.

702
01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.670
Richelle Direny: So did you did you

703
01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.780
Richelle Direny: Come up with what you're going for.

704
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:31.020
Brittany Mount: For this to plan a trip. I haven't decided on where exactly yet.

705
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:41.040
Brittany Mount: I don't, I don't know if we're going to go to Florida or if we're going to just stay up here like around Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

706
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.630
Brittany Mount: But I'm trying as of now to say like $20 a week.

707
01:18:49.650 --> 01:19:10.770
Brittany Mount: And like, I mean if I don't have it that we got to still have that. Yeah. If I've got got it and I can put back 20 every week and then that will help out like tremendously. And then I'm taking probably 500 out of my tax money and setting it back.

708
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:17.430
Brittany Mount: And so there's like my little jumpstart and then 20 a week and

709
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.600
Brittany Mount: If not, just give me a short vacation.

710
01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:24.510
Richelle Direny: Right, whether it's shorter

711
01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:31.590
Brittany Mount: No matter how right yes i just want to take don't care if it's only two days or three days. I want to take her

712
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:39.750
Brittany Mount: But depending on where we go, I think. Either way, we're going to drive it takes

713
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.700
Brittany Mount: 16 hours to get

714
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:52.650
Brittany Mount: To Florida from where we're at, like, you know, down to were kind of in the area where I'm thinking I'm

715
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.160
Brittany Mount: So 16 hours.

716
01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:03.150
Brittany Mount: Debate Between like we're wanting to go so oh he was from

Brittany Mount: I don't know. He's in the shower. I'll ask him every gets out where he's from something like that, especially the be or

719
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:16.650
Richelle Direny: Where

720
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:18.720
We're headed boyfriend.

Richelle Direny: And we're in Florida. He's fun

724
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:36.660
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I'll ask him here in a few minutes. He's in the shower but yeah

725
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:42.150
Brittany Mount: When we're gonna go down like that area. He is. He has a sister down there.

726
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:54.720
Brittany Mount: With the possibly stay with her kind of save money or which I'd rather get a room is I work for Hampton, and I can get rooms cheaper. So

727
01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:01.380
Richelle Direny: You work for the Hampton, you can get. Do they still have I used to work for Hilton properties. Years ago.

728
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:04.290
Brittany Mount: Yeah, that's, yeah, we get the employee discount

729
01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:07.890
Richelle Direny: Is it still like $39 or something, some crazy amount

730
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:12.630
Brittany Mount: Yeah. Well, I think it's what after tax. It's a

731
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.020
Brittany Mount: I think we pay

732
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.690
Brittany Mount: 51 after tax.

733
01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.250
Brittany Mount: $45 and then after tax 51

734
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.100
Richelle Direny: Also they increase that a little bit, but even

735
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.010
Brittany Mount: Even that saves you a lot.

736
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:32.460
Richelle Direny: Really nice as well.

737
01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:41.400
Brittany Mount: Yeah, and most of them have or sell them like if you said embassy. They got a lot of them have the restless thing like hot

738
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.650
Brittany Mount: Like when you made the order

739
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.440
Richelle Direny: Cook to order. I used to work. They have the cook supporter in the mornings early in the mornings, like they have

740
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.720
Richelle Direny: And then the

741
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:59.910
Richelle Direny: Is it the Hamptons know it's it's there. There's, there's another one that they have a kitchen in the room.

742
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:04.110
Richelle Direny: What is the call, not the head that the Hamptons

743
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.450
Brittany Mount: Home too sweet.

744
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.430

746
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.930
Richelle Direny: Little kitchen liquor with refrigerator.

747
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:13.770
Kind of like

748
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:21.330
Brittany Mount: So dishes. Yes. We stayed in an embassy that have that no

749
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:28.920
Richelle Direny: It has to be Homewood suites and pants and doesn't have it embassies, the only one that does the cook to order.

750
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.400
Brittany Mount: Yeah, they did the kitchen and the room and what and hold two is a

751
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:40.140
Brittany Mount: Lie embassy, but it's like it's kind of like embassies

752
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:42.660
Brittany Mount: I forget what

753
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:53.550
Richelle Direny: Whooping only has the embassy Homewood suites. I'm the Hampton Inn, just the Hilton, they don't i don't think that they have any other property.

754
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:57.660
Brittany Mount: Yeah, there's a hold on Stefan.

755
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:05.490
Brittany Mount: When we stayed in Guam as well is that hotel, not the embassy with the other real nice one.

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:11.400
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

759
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.040
Richelle Direny: Well, we'll treat family friendly, I think.

760
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:16.410
Brittany Mount: Yeah, it's more

761
01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:22.800
Richelle Direny: I think that's how they define it for more like the rooms are bigger, it's more accommodating for family it at home with sweet.

762
01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:33.120
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah. They had a kitchen. And there's also, which was kind of it was a little bit smaller than the home to sweets, but or Homewood suites.

right about that.

783
01:24:55.470 --> 01:25:01.380
Richelle Direny: So how's everything going with your mother with your parents. I know with your mom, you can't really be around for too long.

784
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:02.430
Yeah.

785
01:25:05.190 --> 01:25:14.040
Brittany Mount: I mean something bad. I haven't really been around her too much. My daughter stayed over the weekend or

786
01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:26.520
Brittany Mount: Yes, he came to Wednesday. I'm over there for a few nights and then stayed back here on the weekend and then today.

787
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.360
Brittany Mount: I took her and went over there and all that, that

788
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.850
Brittany Mount: Mom was hoping to do homework. The other night and

789
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:54.720
Brittany Mount: She called me, and I had to do it like over video chat with her is my mom and her doing homework together is horrible mom just she don't want to do it. So she's instantly.

790
01:25:55.770 --> 01:26:04.770
Brittany Mount: Just a total but about the whole thing is yelling out of the whole time like this, it's nothing. Nothing yelling and screaming and

791
01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.950
Brittany Mount: Crying and my mom smacking her and

792
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:16.710
Brittany Mount: I said, how is it, how can anybody culture like that. And then if I'm. They are also or even like me on the phone.

793
01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:23.070
Brittany Mount: I was sitting there trying to tell her like talk to her and guide her through it. My mom standing right over top over shoulder

794
01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:30.990
Brittany Mount: yelling and screaming the whole time. And I was like, Mom, just walk away from the phone walk away. Don't say nothing.

795
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:43.980
Brittany Mount: Let me handle this. Like, I'll do it. I can try to maybe show understand if I the way I'm going to tell her. Well, finally she got the hint and walked away and just let me do it and everything was

796
01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:55.320
Brittany Mount: Fine. She was starting to understand it because she's not real good like she's an IP and stuff, but I see not rather with a multiplication well

797
01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:17.370
Brittany Mount: Now the classes started doing like division. So my mom called me and silly. The first thing she can't do it. It's just over her head. She can't do it. No mom didn't want to take the time out the extra time to sit there and try to help her. You know what I mean dagger through it.

798
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:19.470
Brittany Mount: Helper more

799
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.780
Brittany Mount: Once you

800
01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:40.350
Brittany Mount: Got to try to get her to write something like it, even though the wrong be better than not doing it all while I'm just wondering, take the paper back into our health teacher like

801
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.020
I'm

802
01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.180
Brittany Mount: So happy you're

803
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:47.640
Richelle Direny: Reading the process.

804
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:50.820
What is it

805
01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.720
Richelle Direny: No, I said, did your daughter. What she getting frustrated with your mom.

806
01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:04.620
Brittany Mount: Leather yeah row. Yeah, it's always the team also his homework or says something about homework. It's, it's in

807
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:17.100
Brittany Mount: My off the rip their fears of dread bit and then because she if she hesitates if you don't jump. Well, my mom says homework, then it's

808
01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:29.940
Brittany Mount: Yeah, it's crazy. I said there's no way to learning anything with you screaming and yelling and snappy, the whole time. No way.

809
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:36.210
Brittany Mount: For me, regardless

810
01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I know what ready to ship and when you don't when you don't understand something for

811
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:47.850
Richelle Direny: She's in fourth yeah when you don't understand something you definitely get a little bit more frustrated

812
01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.090
Richelle Direny: When you don't understand her

813
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:53.970
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

814
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.190
Brittany Mount: Yep.

815
01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.900
Brittany Mount: Mama. She don't think she can do something

816
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:12.660
Brittany Mount: She like she's like she she can't new obligation. She can't do division or she, she can't do multiplication. So she won't be able to do division. She's just not email do this. And I'm like,

817
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:28.380
Brittany Mount: Woman Maybe if see you like dollars to the point where she would understand maybe that would make for multiplication easier, somehow or something like

818
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:45.990
Brittany Mount: I hate them doing homework together or being around them whenever like mom's helping or something that evening or however, she's like they're trying to hold work. I am

819
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.640
Brittany Mount: I dread for my daughter like important thing

820
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:53.250
Richelle Direny: So do you

821
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:56.340
Richelle Direny: So why not to go and you doing

822
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.990
Brittany Mount: Right.

823
01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:13.350
Brittany Mount: Yeah, that's what I've been trying, you know, the most if I if I, if there's a way around it that I can and I will say, if I have to, like, if I have to work late, you know, something like that. I can't, then

824
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.990
Brittany Mount: Mom, mom, half season.

825
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.840
Brittany Mount: I tried. I even tried to get my foot. My dad. He quit school and like a street.

826
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.480
Brittany Mount: So, and he's

827
01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:40.770
Brittany Mount: Not a good speller and not like he can do some math and stuff, but a lot of it is over my dad's head. And I mean, so I graduated in some of this stuff she rings home. I'm like,

828
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:51.510
Brittany Mount: Doing this in fourth grade, and like I don't even remember how to use some have it so I have to like refresh myself before I can help her. And so

829
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:57.900
Richelle Direny: Don't worry. My son is in pre kindergarten, then they're teaching him how to add three five plus three.

830
01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:01.650
Brittany Mount: Oh, wow.

831
01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.970
Brittany Mount: It's, it's a little crazy.

832
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.430
Richelle Direny: Pre kindergarten, they want

833
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:15.600
Richelle Direny: It is not, you know, they're teaching them how to read a whole doggone sentence like, seriously.

Brittany Mount: Bunch of different things.

858
01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:49.080
Brittany Mount: Which we were friends for a while.

859
01:33:50.550 --> 01:34:08.940
Brittany Mount: Before like I'm there since we went to rehab them together and 2013 12 2012 2013 so like I've known her for and I knew, I knew her before that we're from the same town so

860
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:18.240
Brittany Mount: Yeah, we've known each other a long times and everybody was kind of like you guys have been friends like I don't know if that's a good idea for a sponsor to

861
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:31.710
Brittany Mount: The know she puts me in my place and she's not afraid to tell me how how she is feeling your thinks about something or any of that I

862
01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:37.320
Brittany Mount: Had any problems so far with her being up front with me.

863
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:39.840
Brittany Mount: She don't hold that

864
01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:41.520
Richelle Direny: Um,

865
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:47.790
Brittany Mount: Well, that's a good thing, sometimes the things you might dig it harder on me than she does or other responses.

866
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:51.060
Brittany Mount: Because we have

867
01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:54.900
Richelle Direny: Is it because you guys have known each other a really long time.

868
01:34:56.910 --> 01:35:13.020
Brittany Mount: Yeah. Yeah. And then it was just like I was to the point I'd went. I've been trying for so long to find one. And then I did find one she came to one of the meetings I go to and I had her or

869
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:16.860
Brittany Mount: Maybe a month and to relapse.

870
01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:27.810
Brittany Mount: And then it was just, I just, I was having a hell of a time kind of on a sponsor and we're to our town small like it's hard to find and there's

871
01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:51.570
Brittany Mount: Our group has maybe 20 people on a good night. So, and then to find somebody that had numerous years and are you know more than a year clean something or they are clean and all that, like somebody that I can click within kind of trust a little bit. It was just, I was almost next to impossible.

872
01:35:55.230 --> 01:36:01.470
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, I mean it's, it seems like you're really in a good place. Though Brittany and maybe that's the reason why

873
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:03.330
Richelle Direny: You know, maybe

874
01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.720
Richelle Direny: She kind of holds you more accountable than

875
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:09.330
Brittany Mount: Maybe the other sponsors that she has. Yeah.

876
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.160
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like you raising the bar reason the expectation

877
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:19.200
Richelle Direny: With you, because you're further along in

878
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.030
Richelle Direny: Your, your journey.

879
01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:25.740
Brittany Mount: With her other sponsors, he has

880
01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.890
Brittany Mount: And I think she just got her nine months.

881
01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:38.910
Brittany Mount: Or he tagged. So I think she's got about 10 or 11 months clean

882
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:44.130
Brittany Mount: Yeah. Yes. Like I

883
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:46.470
Brittany Mount: Do what

884
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.960
Brittany Mount: Others fancy. What is it,

885
01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:51.690
Richelle Direny: You said, yeah, yes. I think she had like

886
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:55.890
Brittany Mount: You know, kind of, I was like 10 or 11 lines.

887
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:12.150
Richelle Direny: So what are you doing outside of like once of the support groups and what have you, or even meeting up with your, your sponsor. Like, what are some of the things that you're doing to help maintain your sobriety.

888
01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:13.740
Richelle Direny: Or just like

889
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:15.510
Richelle Direny: Doing

890
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.390
Brittany Mount: journaling.

891
01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:29.430
Brittany Mount: Like self taught us like right and she has me like great will sticky pad know things and like, put them on the mayor or like

892
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:38.850
Brittany Mount: Get up in like each day look in the mirror and tell them, like say a positive thing about why so for

893
01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:42.510
Brittany Mount: I have you been doing that.

894
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:47.430
Richelle Direny: For you doing

895
01:37:49.980 --> 01:38:00.960
Brittany Mount: Well, we just got started doing that. But yeah, I can't. I think a little bit cuz I don't know. We're trying to work on stuff with like confidence, self confidence and

896
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.470
Richelle Direny: you struggle with your self confidence.

897
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:11.760
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah. I don't know what, like I just always have even from like a young age.

898
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:23.280
Brittany Mount: I don't, I don't know if that kind of played into me like getting on. I kind of think you'll play a role me getting on drugs because I tried to fit in, and then

899
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:28.920
Brittany Mount: Like playing sports and all that. Like I helped me lose way.

900
01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:39.690
Brittany Mount: Just different things in school, cuz uh yeah I just kind of feel like it played a role with myself confidence about me. Get on drugs like

901
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:41.940
Brittany Mount: A young age.

902
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.750
Brittany Mount: When you also talked about 1213 years old so

903
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:50.130
Richelle Direny: We also talked about with your, with your mom.

904
01:38:50.490 --> 01:39:02.550
Richelle Direny: And kind of what they're always kind of been like a relationship. And, you know, my understanding is that she was not very a very positive light in a lot of things for you.

905
01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.180
Brittany Mount: Know, she she wasn't

906
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.840
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I mean, there was, there's a couple different factors. I think your plane.

907
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:16.140
Brittany Mount: Every, everything combined and

908
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:22.680
Brittany Mount: Different things that kind of led into me like getting started with the drugs and

909
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:28.560
Richelle Direny: Not specific then but with more. So the cell phone because you said you were only child. Right.

910
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:34.530
Brittany Mount: Now I have a younger brother, he's five years younger than me. Okay.

911
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:36.150
Richelle Direny: But you're talking about what

912
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:38.400
Brittany Mount: To your self confidence.

913
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:52.230
Richelle Direny: You said that you feel like that was all said and done, but you know when you start the first time you got introduced to any type of drug whether alcohol and then matter what kind of drove you did.

914
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:58.440
Richelle Direny: Right. Um, there's all ways multiple factors that

915
01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:08.970
Richelle Direny: broke your barrier down brokers found that allowed you to say, Oh, I like this and you keep doing it and you keep going. There's always multiple factors.

916
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:10.980
Richelle Direny: What is the main

917
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:18.690
Richelle Direny: What was the main one, like you have your primary, secondary, tertiary, and that you kind of go that way.

918
01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:30.690
Richelle Direny: And you look at your, your, like you said, you still struggle with your confidence, your self confidence. And if you don't start working through that like your sponsor isn't working, you know, on that.

919
01:40:32.190 --> 01:40:35.820
Richelle Direny: That can take you back to the road less traveled

920
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:37.020
Right.

921
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:38.850
Richelle Direny: You're saying

922
01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:51.840
Richelle Direny: Yeah. If that was your primary thing is your self confidence. If that's your weakness. Then someone can come back and it might be something that says something that's done.

923
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:54.960
Richelle Direny: And then it puts you kind of back in a slump.

924
01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:59.400
Brittany Mount: Yeah, and maybe like the way

925
01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:18.540
Brittany Mount: She was like, even up to now just being so negative and everything. I think maybe like she played a role in my self confidence, like we haven't low so providence and to lose my mind way like you had to be

926
01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:28.740
Brittany Mount: A she's even started this with my daughter and I told her, I said, Don't do it. Just stop now is in my nose not overweight, but she's always telling her like

927
01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:36.000
Brittany Mount: You're going on a diet like we're gonna stop eating so much and you got to get up and get off the computer which I mean, yeah, she doesn't get up and

928
01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:38.370
Brittany Mount: Come here a little bit.

929
01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:43.860
Brittany Mount: racy fine. It's not like she's like so coming from Stony all day.

930
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:58.890
Brittany Mount: For tracking them suffers a few hours later on when she's at school. They have, have you seen this one says mambo hate. They don't eat them that like she's used to dad in

931
01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:11.760
Brittany Mount: High school kids are nothing to compare the World Cup. All right, so before we even when she comes home and just yeah she's always on her A better way. And I'm like, she's

932
01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.500
Brittany Mount: Like she's doing

933
01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:22.830
Brittany Mount: Is she's very short now well always set up a little bit and then so sprout up well.

934
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:40.560
Brittany Mount: No robo quicker now alarms, like, yep. Very good. I didn't look like that when I was planning, everything's different mother, like we got maybe she's fine. There's she doesn't have a weight issue like

935
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.810
Yeah.

936
01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:44.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

937
01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:53.700
Brittany Mount: Whatever order an adult know what we got like a Quarter Pounder meal gone so that's too much for her. And I'm like,

938
01:42:54.720 --> 01:43:02.940
Brittany Mount: Rolling kids like if she can eat it, she can eat. It's not gonna be 500 pounds negotiated double cheeseburger her

939
01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.380
Richelle Direny: Maybe, maybe.

940
01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:16.140
Richelle Direny: When we have our own internal struggles we kind of display that on someone else to make them feel bad.

941
01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:30.030
Richelle Direny: Because of how like little struggles. So sometimes you know if the question is, Is your mom super hard on you and your daughter, because that's how she grew up, if that's all she knows

942
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.820
Richelle Direny: So if negative being negative nancy and I'm

943
01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.190
Richelle Direny: Overly

944
01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.710
Brittany Mount: Critical about certain things. I don't know, like where I don't

945
01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.070
Brittany Mount: I we've never really talked about it. I don't know, like

946
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.020
Brittany Mount: I know my mom. My mom stayed really small until

947
01:43:53.310 --> 01:44:00.570
Brittany Mount: She had a hysterectomy, and she was probably 35 she had to have a hysterectomy, because she had a tumor.

948
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:20.460
Brittany Mount: And then like she started gaining a lot of like not sad that she put on some weight. I just got bigger than it had ever done and but I'm not sure. Like when she was a kid like if it was something like to tell she's tired or, you know, I'm not sure about that. I

949
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:22.680
Brittany Mount: But I just

950
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:26.400
Brittany Mount: I know like even one

951
01:44:27.570 --> 01:44:29.550
Brittany Mount: Till I was

952
01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:37.710
Brittany Mount: Let's see. My brother was us five and one brother was born, I was probably 1213

953
01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:50.160
Brittany Mount: No, I was about 15 whenever she got her hysterectomy. And then, yes, when she started going her way and stuff. And my dad would kind of

954
01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:58.770
Brittany Mount: Ride her about her, like, just joking around with messing with her about her way, which I know that hurt her feelings, because she wasn't used to be in

955
01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:17.310
Brittany Mount: Having no kind of thickness. She was tiny size like zeros and ones, my whole life. And then up until then. And then it was like she got now she's like supporting the 10 or 12 which means you're not big. It's just big and once you do

956
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.110
Brittany Mount: And

957
01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.810
Brittany Mount: So he would turn to ground for a mess with her and now it's

958
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:29.280
Brittany Mount: Oh no, she's. I don't know.

959
01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:38.880
Brittany Mount: I just she's on a 10 year old about me and she's like, I just, I didn't look like that. Well, doesn't matter what

960
01:45:42.330 --> 01:45:43.440
Brittany Mount: You put your

961
01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:45.150

01:46:42.690 --> 01:46:58.770
Brittany Mount: Okay, I don't know, I started like if somebody tries to call while I'm on this. It's like my volume goes completely out like and I can, I can barely hear you and then you won't be able to hear me.

966
01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:06.900
Richelle Direny: Okay, so it's the volume. Someone should try calling you.

976
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:08.130
Brittany Mount: I don't know. My daughter is eight years old, probably for Greek word and they split up like six months of me and

Brittany Mount: It says she will try. It's like she won't even try to move past it really is. She said she is. But she is all the time bringing in a or if the girls names mentioned

982
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.140

Brittany Mount: Like yeah

01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.820
Brittany Mount: She's stuck on it.

Brittany Mount: And then they're taking help and take care of my grandmother, which is my dad's mom and my mom's parents are both on so she every time she does something for his mom. Well, I don't have parents so

986
01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:09.930
Brittany Mount: And I'm like, you can't take that out on my on her is your parents in the home like

987
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.460
Brittany Mount: Your dad, anybody can change your

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:16.590
Parents are still together now.

989
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:24.120
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah. They're back together. Now they he had left it. They were split up for about six months and then

990
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.040
Brittany Mount: Come back.

991
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:41.040
Brittany Mount: And they were supposed to be working on it and work past that and all that which I mean they did good for a little while and then it got to the point where she was right back to

992
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.010
Brittany Mount: Bring it up like this on his face all the time about it.

993
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:59.130
Brittany Mount: Just now, she's and that's, that's when she started drinking more and just over the years. She just drinks all the time. And like the other night it was over there.

994
01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:10.620
Brittany Mount: And see my daughter. One of the way down in there but like they were watch TV and living your instance. Yes. So you can go away in their bedroom. Well, mom, threw a fit dad's like

995
01:50:11.490 --> 01:50:18.090
Brittany Mount: Yes. You can't sneak in there and sip on our bottle because seer, isn't there. And I was like,

996
01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:26.430
Brittany Mount: She's hiding the bottle in the bedroom. Now, and he's like, I guess is what I'm fine like to I found out found one day and it was like so.

997
01:50:26.970 --> 01:50:34.920
Brittany Mount: Why she hiding it. And then all of a sudden, he was like she don't want me know and she's drinking. As soon as she gets home from work until she is the bed.

998
01:50:35.490 --> 01:50:54.240
Brittany Mount: I was like, Yeah, but everybody knows because Mommy is three shots and she starts running her mouth are getting like she's saying this, you know what I mean time tickets are different, you'll always know when she's had more than two shots like you just know and

999
01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:09.330
Brittany Mount: But I mean, she's even like the sneak in the bathroom and smoke a cigarette. After 20 years of everybody know and. She smokes like. Show me, show me a lot. Just a couple cigarettes a day but

1000
01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:32.430
Brittany Mount: Yeah, she's still and that my dad. I don't care if you smoke. He smokes, like you're not gonna say nothing to her and she for some reason just won't come out and smoke a cigarette in front of him, or let him know that. She smokes what so like she does not like I'm in now.

1001
01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:46.170
Richelle Direny: I mean, but how this whole with her drinking and with her. So hearing you speak. It's like, you think about, like you said there has there were many factors. So you talk about your self confidence.

1002
01:51:46.680 --> 01:52:01.950
Richelle Direny: Talk about the marital issues that your parents went through maybe how it had an impact on your mom how maybe she treated you and your brother at the time, or how much responsibility, she may have placed on you, of being the oldest child.

1003
01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:14.370
Richelle Direny: To her drinking or using alcohol to cope with her hurt in her pain, even up to today. So a lot of that in terms of when you look at your own struggles

1004
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:25.920
Richelle Direny: Um, what was your normal growing up is a direct relation to how you were brought up and what you were exposed to throughout the years through your mother.

1005
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:28.560
Richelle Direny: And you and your mother having such a

1006
01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.090
Richelle Direny: Kind of like a hot and cold relationship. It sounds like

1007
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:38.460
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah, it's either good or it's bad.

1008
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:48.720
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. And so, but that's so growing up. That's always that's like, so your normal is whatever however life.

1009
01:52:49.830 --> 01:53:00.150
Richelle Direny: In your growing up, how it was presented to you. So it wasn't that hard for you to turn to.

1010
01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:03.720
Richelle Direny: That vehicle of

1011
01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:11.880
Richelle Direny: Of how you coped with your issues and your different things that you encountered that made you ultimately choose to

1012
01:53:13.170 --> 01:53:23.310
Richelle Direny: You know, started using whatever substance that you use opiates at whatever it is that you use. It was like, What else did you know growing up.

1013
01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:26.430
Brittany Mount: What, what, wait.

1014
01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:35.550
Richelle Direny: What else were you exposed to mom seems to still be stuffing a lot of her issues, you know, she hides a lot of back

1015
01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:38.700
Yeah.

1016
01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:43.470
Richelle Direny: And so

1017
01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:53.970
Richelle Direny: That can help you to motivate your for you to look at it is, do you think that that's a healthy way for her to do with her issues.

1018
01:53:58.770 --> 01:54:00.930
Brittany Mount: She definitely means a counselor.

1019
01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:02.640
Brittany Mount: And

1020
01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:04.710
Brittany Mount: Stop drinking

1021
01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:09.090
Brittany Mount: But definitely sound or

1022
01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:23.010
Brittany Mount: Maybe even talk to somebody like so. My dad or me or somebody

1023
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.460
Brittany Mount: Like it was always

1024
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.420
Brittany Mount: Like hush hush and the family. You don't talk about what goes on house and then like

1025
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:45.240
Brittany Mount: basically talks about yourself or with the family, then go on and talk counselor do it, which now, my dad like

1026
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:52.500
Brittany Mount: And that like they're more like they know like a counseling. I need you know, stuff like that.

1027
01:54:53.610 --> 01:55:07.740
Brittany Mount: But that one like growing up like you didn't talk about what went on inside the home like to other people like work that out with the family, the family and that's what to say so.

1028
01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.810
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I don't know, like she's gonna be

1029
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:17.280
Brittany Mount: And try to figure it out.

1030
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.040
Brittany Mount: It's not going to get any better.

1031
01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:28.170
Brittany Mount: It's not going to get any better, worse.

1032
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:32.280
Worse.

1033
01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:47.610
Brittany Mount: Something about we have he brought it up saying something about she needed to go and get like antidepressants, or some, some, like, you need to talk to a doctor, maybe about getting put on some some time.

1034
01:55:48.990 --> 01:56:00.720
Brittany Mount: And which I don't disagree one she probably doesn't make something for depression and stuff. And then I said that you can't just shove a pill in your mouth and think that that's all going to make it better.

1035
01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.180
Brittany Mount: Just like your album all

1036
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.430
Brittany Mount: I said was like what a counselor some sleep.

1037
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:23.730
Brittany Mount: And then I was like, Mom, you can't just do that. Like, you're gonna have to talk to somebody about it and get it out.

1038
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.960
Brittany Mount: In yourself is

1039
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.860
Brittany Mount: Not getting yourself nowhere and

1040
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:42.060
Brittany Mount: He's fine with me. I was there, like the foundation. I didn't want to get tossed into every year.

1041
01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:53.760
Richelle Direny: Because what it based on what you just said. What was the learned behavior because everything is about a learned behavior based on with the statements that she just made. What was your learned behavior.

1042
01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:57.330
Brittany Mount: That

1043
01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.360
Brittany Mount: You have to talk to people and

1044
01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.080
When

1045
01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:02.550
Brittany Mount: About

1046
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:14.460
Richelle Direny: That's not what you said you said that that's what you like when you were in your active addiction, you didn't want to talk to anybody. You didn't want to share anything with anybody. What was your behavior, growing up.

1047
01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.120
Brittany Mount: Oh, to hold it in and to

1048
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:19.410
Brittany Mount: Keep

1049
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:27.090
Richelle Direny: Don't talk about keep to yourself. And then what happens when you keep it to yourself and you not talk about it what ended up happening.

1050
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.810
Brittany Mount: It explodes into something that

1051
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.500
Richelle Direny: You're dying on the inside.

1052
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:46.140
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you are tearing apart because it's like you need to get rid of it. You need to release it, but they're saying, nope. You gotta hold in got a whole ton

1053
01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:51.000
Brittany Mount: And that's just

1054
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.310
Richelle Direny: And you know, it's funny. We just use this analogy with someone and I don't know if this was a story, but

1055
01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.280
Richelle Direny: I remember there was

1056
01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:00.270
A point where

1057
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:10.200
Richelle Direny: When I was giving birth to one of my kids. And I remember like you they tell you, like you, because I had a I

1058
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.380
Richelle Direny: Don't feel anything. And they said, you know,

1059
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:28.230
Richelle Direny: The doctor tells you the doctors, looking at the machine tells you when to push because they've already dead in the area. So there's not a whole lot that you can feel so I remember

1060
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.880
Richelle Direny: There was a point where he says, Don't push and I'm like, but I feel like I need to release it and he

1061
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:42.390
Richelle Direny: Says no you can't. Right. Hey, I know I need to. And he was like, You sure. And I'm like, yes, I need to

1062
01:58:42.810 --> 01:58:51.600
Richelle Direny: And he was like, Okay. Then if you feel it, then go ahead and and I use and as you're talking, I think of the analogy that sometimes we need to release it.

1063
01:58:52.320 --> 01:59:02.850
Richelle Direny: Even though the people on the inside is the other people are telling it. No, you hold it to know I need to release it. Like, I'm telling you, this is what needs to happen and so

1064
01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:12.780
Richelle Direny: You in so as you keep pushing and as your birthing this even though, like in this state is a baby. But even though you're bursting this problem.

1065
01:59:13.230 --> 01:59:20.730
Richelle Direny: You know, at the end of it all. Once you birth, all of your problems. You're going to feel better, you're going to have a sense of release.

1066
01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:32.280
Richelle Direny: You're going to have your self back, you're going to feel normal again. You just need to birth, the issues. But while they're saying, Don't you got to hold it. You got to do what I tell you to do it, know

1067
01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:48.750
Richelle Direny: My body and what's going on inside of me and saying, I need to do it now. And that's what happens like you got to that point in your life where you say, I cannot continue like this, I cannot go on like this. I need to birth.

1068
01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:54.840
Richelle Direny: These issues, whatever is going on in the inside of me. I need to birth it

1069
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:56.010
Brittany Mount: It's not just about

1070
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:57.870
Not just about

1071
01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:04.470
Richelle Direny: You know, shoving a pill and thinking that my problem is going to go away. I have to release it.

1072
02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.940
Richelle Direny: And so that's just kind of how you know for your mom.

1073
02:00:09.210 --> 02:00:10.560
Brittany Mount: You or for anyone.

1074
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:11.910
Richelle Direny: That you know

1075
02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.530
Brittany Mount: Just they

1076
02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:27.300
Richelle Direny: Have a lot of issues and they're using other mechanisms to cope with it. That's not your answer. It's a temporary fix. It's a mandate. Ah, but then you know what you got to get it down. You gotta deal with it.

1077
02:00:27.810 --> 02:00:28.560
Brittany Mount: And I'm great.

1078
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:33.870
Richelle Direny: Deal with it. You're always going to reach for the next best fixer

1079
02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:37.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that

1080
02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:45.510
Richelle Direny: Doesn't work. I gotta get another one. What that band aid doesn't work. Let me go get what you know what you're running out of mandates, my friend. Yeah, need to deal with it.

1081
02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:48.840
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

1082
02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:56.310
Brittany Mount: I think

1083
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:00.390
So, but

1084
02:01:01.650 --> 02:01:02.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

1085
02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:07.320
Richelle Direny: But you're on the road to recovery, maybe you can just be that

1086
02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.320
Vehicle on what we'd

1087
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.850
Order.

1088
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.580
Brittany Mount: Yeah hopefully something I can say, oh,

1089
02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.660
Brittany Mount: start seeing something in her head. Get on

1100
02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:54.120
Brittany Mount: Like being more mature about things and then with the whole addiction part of it either seen a drastic change in the last few years with me so that
