81
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if, by chance, they

82

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.990
And

303
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.220
Ken Olsen: I could grab a beer anytime I want you, I want

304
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, yeah.

305
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So you haven't been dealing with any triggers or cravings.

306
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.290
Ken Olsen: No.

307
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.120
Ken Olsen: No.

308
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.120
No, we

309
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.990
Ken Olsen: Got hope, I hope it figures as way right

310
00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:05.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that you know through this process. And if you would tell your, your cardiologist that you do have Naltrexone that has been prescribed for you.

311
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:13.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just find out. First off, if you can take it. I don't think that they would have prescribed it to knowing your history medic medical history if you couldn't but

312
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:21.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, let them know that you have it as a backup plan because if you do find yourself getting into that spot where you know you are

313
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dealing with a lot of triggers inside your head and you know physical cravings, then that is an option for you to be able to be able to utilize to help with that.

314
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:32.640
Ken Olsen: Okay.

315
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, yeah.

316
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

317
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep me informed on whether or not you get into

318
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A residential treatment and. And when you think about it, I mean you and I can build a we can build a relapse prevention plan.

319
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can identify you know your triggers.

320
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To drink and you haven't had any current suicide. That's

321
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.200
Ken Olsen: No.

322
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:05.730
Ken Olsen: No.

323
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, last two weeks.

324
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:14.190
Ken Olsen: Though just except time before I turned myself as detox. I turned myself into detox for a couple days. Get out and have artifact.

325
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.330
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

326
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's when I think you know what I hear is that it was a wake up call that it is time to do something different, you know,

327
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.040
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I guess, is either a suicide attempt or a cry for help wanted to do.

328
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.510
Ken Olsen: Yeah, yeah. So either way, I'm glad to be where I'm at today.

329
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so how can I assist you.

330
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.520

Ken Olsen: Something oh there's somebody talk to, you know, and

332
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.610
Ken Olsen: You know, somebody, don't be the smartest one in the room and

333
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.690

Know,

335
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.190

347
00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:04.620
Ken Olsen: Right now I take a bike ride or I'll try to read or look forward to a meeting or clean the house and just do some you know you a little small little

348
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:06.480
Thing.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.850
Ken Olsen: Leave me, I pray to God, a lot when I was going to your management to do a class I was going to do my classes and anger management, the same week for a year.

352
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:32.940
Ken Olsen: 2012 as a Christian based program for six months, six months in Christian based program or six months in jail, like I did with police chase, little one. It was something or that guy didn't hit nobody except wrecked my car, my head.

353
00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:34.860
Ken Olsen: But, uh,

354
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.570
Ken Olsen: So,

355
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:44.700
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I believe in a higher power and as much shit, as I've been through like everybody else. She had and it might, you know,

356
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:55.260
Ken Olsen: It'll pass. I've been to a lot of shit. You know that that I'd never get out of my good so I taught me a lesson that you know just

357
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.920
Ken Olsen: One day to time and face your fears.

358
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:00.930
Ken Olsen: Sober

359
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Silver. That's right, no matter what.

360
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Are you planning on working the steps with your sponsor.

361
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:21.570
Ken Olsen: He hasn't really brought him up because I think he knows my history a little bit about my you know my service. I used to do a lot of service of the church. We know food closet hope for homeless and

362
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.930
Ken Olsen: Accepting that God is a higher power.

363
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:32.460
Ken Olsen: You know, it's a lot to do with it right there making amends with people, which I'm trying to do because I didn't leave that too much of a message time

364
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:48.690
Ken Olsen: I kind of caught it. I'll use my credit cards. One thing I knew what I was using my credit cards that shits going to get bad so I caught myself. I only would think I spent $300 on my credit card and I stopped it. So I knew it was going down. I knew I was in trouble and

365
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:57.150
Ken Olsen: We find you that much. That's why I turn this over to detox like I gotta go with this. I'm going to date myself. I have a daughter. That's 22

366
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:03.930
Ken Olsen: grandsons, it's three going to be three. And I don't want him to ever see me drunk, you know, like my daughter did so.

367
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He doesn't get goals.

368
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:15.930
Ken Olsen: You know, they just live like two, three miles down the road I hardly ever want to go see your you know I was here, but I wasn't really here.

369
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:16.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

370
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:22.200
Ken Olsen: You know, but I do a lot more with them because I'm in touch with her almost every day. Pretty much every day.

371
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:30.990
Ken Olsen: Good. I enjoy being I really enjoyed being a ground on it, Dad, you know, so sort of a somebody that's trying to hide it and be an idiot.

372
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:43.950
Ken Olsen: Now this time, I didn't get a DUI or have to stand in front of a judge you know that I've done that five times with the de Lys through the years. It's been eight years since my last DUI.

373
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.650
Ken Olsen: But I got to back to back.

374
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:54.660
Ken Olsen: But I got three in the early 90s. I got three in the early 90s and I got to, I got one to 2011 2012

375
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:05.430
Ken Olsen: Yeah for 20, believe it or not, 1000 2011 it was 2011 I got a DUI. On April 19

376
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:13.140
Ken Olsen: And in 2012 I got a DUI April 20 2012 even the judge was like damn

377
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Oh, wow.

378
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.890
Ken Olsen: Yeah. What she realized one year apart. I'm almost to the day

379
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.330
Ken Olsen: On for 2420 I always stay at home. I don't smoke weed.

380
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.610
Ken Olsen: My roommate heard of smokes, drinks but

381
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.410
Ken Olsen: I know what at seven o'clock in the morning I'll still like it.

382
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As a bother you know

383
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.100
Ken Olsen: I don't like it smelled doesn't bother me. I think it stinks. But it doesn't bother me.

384
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. I'm glad.

385
00:29:50.340 --> 00:30:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you again and over this next week, identify or try to be mindful about your emotion regulations.

386
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know about your ups and downs highs and lows.

387
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know about your thought process when you are experiencing those those high anxiety moments, or those low depressive moments or

388
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The irritation and aggravation that can come right before you know our response or reaction with anger, but just really pay attention to that. And if you don't experience them great

389
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.050
You know what I mean.

390
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.930
Ken Olsen: I guess when you asked me if I have a roller coaster of emotion, I could say, yeah, like

391
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:38.640
Ken Olsen: You know,

392
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.060
Ken Olsen: Every day I probably do you know so

393
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you're not alone. No.

394
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know that.

395
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean that

396
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.600
Ken Olsen: Are longer though I've been around long enough to know that.

397
00:30:52.770 --> 00:31:00.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you also know that it can take almost up to a year to get some kind of normal regulation going on.

398
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

399
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.600
Go ahead.

400
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ahead. What were you gonna say

401
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.500
Ken Olsen: I said I have saw four to six months 2012

402
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.040
Ken Olsen: So I knew what it felt like felt good.

403
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.580
Ken Olsen: Anyways, go ahead.

404
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing that's different this time than what it was in 2012 is you now are dealing with it you know your heart stuff to

405
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And so just kind of pay attention to it and you've got the ability and the skill to be able to pull yourself out of those negative thought processes. When you get into them, you just explained it to me on how you do it.

406
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you kind of get busy, you start doing things

407
00:31:45.420 --> 00:32:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just identify and notice how often you're going through them and let's really kind of work on different avenues for you to be able to continue with that regulatory emotional stuff because it is going to be, you know, tough over the next year and I this

408
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, I'm not gonna lie. It's

409
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.660
Ken Olsen: About for myself. I know.

410
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.550
Ken Olsen: I got damn I'm sorry to cut you off.

411
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, that's okay. No.

412
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, you know, we can work through it, we can work on it. Have you ever

413
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: dove into any kind of mindfulness

414
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.570
Ken Olsen: Explain that.

415
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mindfulness is just when you are finding yourself.

416
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your head, finding yourself in that negative headspace

417
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where you just keep ruminating over over past stuff or you keep

418
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in. Yep. Oh no. Another

419
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.820
Ken Olsen: Defeating anxiety when I started, you know,

420
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.800
Ken Olsen: But nothing I could do about it. You know, I just tried to make it better.

421
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's it. You got to pull yourself out of that thought processing state.

422
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.800
Ken Olsen: The past is this will pass this will pass this will pass you know

423
00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.940
Ken Olsen: And I know that will pass so I know it will. And I kind of run. Actually, you

424
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.130
Ken Olsen: Know my guys and see what you can and

425
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.780
Ken Olsen: About it, you know, and everything is not going to go your way.

426
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

427
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:18.360
Ken Olsen: I can deal with, you know, it's not going to go my way all the time. Yeah, I'm just gonna have to deal with it to life.

428
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm glad that you have the ability to change, you know, the thought process when you do get into it.

429
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:30.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and combat it with this is a moment in time, you know, that's important.

430
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're able to do that.

431
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.840
Ken Olsen: And working on it.

432
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It takes practice. It takes a

433
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lot of practice. If you ever

434
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:43.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it, you know, but don't stop practicing. You know what I mean, don't stop doing it.

435
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:52.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mindfulness really kind of brings you back into the present moment. You know it when you focus inward. When you focus on

436
00:33:52.620 --> 00:34:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: your five senses, you know, in this moment. It's like, what am I hearing what am I feeling, what am I seeing what am I smelling. Right. What am I touching. And so, be able to pull yourself out of the past or out of the future is really sitting in the present moment by self check

437
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and paying attention to your five senses really listening for sounds around you really smelling for different sounds around you.

438
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, really being able to whatever your hands are on being able to really touch it and feel it.

439
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:36.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is one one skill that can be developed to help pull you out of those negative thought processes.

440
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if you're focusing on what you're doing right here in this moment. You can't be sitting in the past and you won't be sitting in the future.

441
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:52.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Career. And so there's one tool. And the same thing with driving. I don't know about you, but on autopilot getting from point A to point B and not

442
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking time to basically smell the roses, as you're going is another piece that we kind

543
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:21.030
Ken Olsen: It's hard. Good. I got people that smoke in the house. You got people that drink in the house, but the smoking part I didn't drink, and I don't think you know one day time for that. Like the smoke and stuff is

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

548
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.900
Ken Olsen: But you gotta want to

549
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.890
Mm hmm.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.020
Ken Olsen: I want our want to but

552
00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about

553
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.740
Ken Olsen: Well, oh yeah.

554
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.710

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let me know.

556
00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you get to that point, you actually

557
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

558
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:04.890
Ken Olsen: Yeah yeah

559
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We'll see how it goes.

560
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:09.540
Okay.

561
00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They say the doctor said the other day, and group that it usually takes people about six or seven times of trying to quit before I finally grabs a hold, and they can actually do it.

562
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.440
Ken Olsen: So, yeah.

563
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But cigarettes.

564
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.370
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I went to jail for

565
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:37.620
Ken Olsen: Two weeks and I didn't volume. It's not around, but I don't know. I don't know. They get cigarettes in there, but he do what you smell it, it

566
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.470
Ken Olsen: Smells good. But, uh,

567
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.200
Ken Olsen: You know one of them are around it, or it's easy to do when you're not around. You can't get them, you know,

568
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

569
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.040
Ken Olsen: It's like cigarettes and alcohol are on every corner.

570
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.900
Ken Olsen: Yeah, so

571
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is definitely one of the toughest things to

572
00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To break free from

573
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.250
It well

574
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't, I can't confirm or deny that.

575
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.680
Ken Olsen: I'll take that as a maybe.

576
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't confirm or deny that I just know that, I know the struggle, and I know that it's real.

577
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm definitely not one to point fingers or the judge.

578
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:23.850
Ken Olsen: Good.

579
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, definitely to walk you through when if you get ready to do something different.

580
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.020

Ken Olsen: Yeah.

597
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But now,

598
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.670
Ken Olsen: You know,

599
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.680
