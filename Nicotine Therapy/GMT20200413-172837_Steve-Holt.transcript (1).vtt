8
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.040

Steve Holtsford: Yeah, for sure. Alright, I'm going to lock the meeting.

10
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.180
Steve Holtsford: So hopefully we don't get

11
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.610
Steve Holtsford: Follow back with something inappropriate.

12
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.100
Steve Holtsford: Have you heard of that happening.

13
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.730
Yeah.

14
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.040
Steve Holtsford: Alright, okay. Alright, so it's very nice to meet you.

15
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.810
Steve Holtsford: You too, so

16
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.270
Mary Holland: Just my story's a little bit more convoluted than most of the people that you're probably talking to

17
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:58.620
Mary Holland: Okay. Um, I was on. I have been on methadone maintenance therapy for about five or six years.

18
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.240
Mary Holland: Okay. Um, and then over the last year and a half. I've been detoxing from that.

19
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:09.780
Mary Holland: Okay, because I want to my husband and I would like to have another baby and I want to be awful the meds for that.

20
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.840
Mary Holland: Okay. Um, but about

21
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:21.150
Mary Holland: A month or so ago when Cove, it started happening. My methadone clinic is in East St. Louis, which is next to St. Louis.

22
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.520
Mary Holland: And that areas really bad and I was getting two weeks of take homes at a time.

23
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:44.580
Mary Holland: Okay, so, and at the time I am I, when I first started, I was all 110 milligrams. The clinic got me down to 40 milligrams. And then when I couldn't get there anymore because of the coven I took my took my last two weeks and got myself down to 15 or 20

24
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.870
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay.

25
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:56.490
Mary Holland: And basically what I need is I just and I'm, I, I misinterpreted the amount of time the half life of the Methadone I forgot to account for that.

26
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:56.880
Steve Holtsford: Yeah.

27
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.770
Mary Holland: I work in mental health to every coach for bipolar schizophrenia, stuff like that.

28
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:12.180
Mary Holland: Oh, Austin and I am getting I'm currently finishing my bachelor's and working on my master's in psychology. I'm stable, I'm married to have a kid.

29
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.100
Mary Holland: Got it. My life is good. I

30
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.800
Mary Holland: Just can't just gotten sick. The last couple of days. And I thought, I can handle the withdrawal, but I can't.

31
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:20.640
Steve Holtsford: Okay.

32
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.050
Mary Holland: And I can't. Well, I could, if all I had to do with sleep, but I still have to go to work. So

33
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.790
Steve Holtsford: Got it, got

34
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:33.060
Mary Holland: I talked to my local physician, but he's very conservative and was very hesitant to help me.

35
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.780
Mary Holland: He gave me some soap for the nausea.

36
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.320
Steve Holtsford: Okay.

37
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:47.400
Mary Holland: And then, who gave me some met resolve for like antacid it he gave me hydroxyl scene for like anxiety and

38
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.540
Steve Holtsford: Sleep. Yes.

39
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.540
Mary Holland: And it helps them. It helps a little bit for the first couple days. But now that I'm at, like, day three day four, it

40
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.230
Mary Holland: Helped me

41
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.490
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay.

42
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:05.580
Mary Holland: So what I really need is just a plan and maybe like if you could help me figure out, like maybe a week or two of, say, you know, take this much for this couple of days and then. Yeah.

43
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.470
Steve Holtsford: Yeah okay okay and your primary doctor is not wavered. He can't write buprenorphine.

44
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.490
Mary Holland: Now he can't

45
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.750
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay.

46
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.170
Mary Holland: I don't, I don't think he would even if he could. He's very

47
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.110
Steve Holtsford: Conservative. Okay. All right.

48
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:27.660
Steve Holtsford: And in terms of going back to the Methadone clinic. You say it's very bad in terms of coronavirus or in terms of

49
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:39.570
Mary Holland: For several reasons. One, they're just a terrible clinic. It's not run by a doctor. It's run by somebody used to be a prison warden. So you can imagine they're not very understanding with things interesting.

50
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.070
Mary Holland: Okay. And, but, yeah, they're also hit really bad right in that area of St. Louis with

51
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.690
Mary Holland: Kobe. And that's bad for me because I have to go back and work with my patients.

52
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.250
Steve Holtsford: Yes. No.

53
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:56.370
Mary Holland: I think the idea of the buprenorphine. You know, being easier to step off of than the Methadone

54
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.550
Steve Holtsford: I think that's probably true. You know, I think.

55
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.590
Steve Holtsford: There may not be great evidence that that's true but it, but it makes sense.

56
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.610
Mary Holland: I took my

57
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.290
Mary Holland: Temperature and BP and everything at work a little while ago.

58
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:20.190
Mary Holland: My but I temperature has been kind of fluctuating at a low fever, nothing over 100 but over 99 so like 99.7 or so.

59
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.650
Mary Holland: Okay, um, my last EP was

60
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.610
Steve Holtsford: Okay.

61
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.950
Mary Holland: And I'm just, I'm really feeling

62
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:36.000
Steve Holtsford: You're feeling bad, got it, got it. Okay. And, and so how did you hear about bright hearth health

63
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.280
Steve Holtsford: Google. Google. Okay.

64
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.120
Mary Holland: I guess there was such a thing as a virtual clinic for this in Illinois.

65
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.430
Steve Holtsford: And it just, I mean, it's hot off the press. I mean, it just got approved.

66
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.190
Mary Holland: You know, because of all this, I think, yeah.

67
00:15:50.820 --> 00:16:10.050
Steve Holtsford: And maybe I mean they've been working on it for a while but but but yeah the timing is is has been has been perfect so I'm just to kind of give you a little bit of background. I'm a, I'm an ER doctor up in the West suburbs of Chicago. And then I do addictions, kind of on the side.

68
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.040
Mary Holland: Took my addiction brochures Chicago bad right now. Yeah.

69
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:22.590
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, exactly. So I'm and I'm actually in the process of sort of doing less er work and more addiction work, you know,

70
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.190
Steve Holtsford: That's cool, as we as we move forward. Yeah. Yeah, so it's

71
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.760
Mary Holland: Every coach for a residential treatment facility.

72
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.090
Steve Holtsford: Very good. Outstanding. Outstanding.

73
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.920
Steve Holtsford: So now in terms of having a baby.

74
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.070
Steve Holtsford: You know, you obviously don't have to get off meds to get pregnant.

75
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:55.260
Mary Holland: I know but i and i know it might be anecdotal. But from where I've been in the clinics. I've been in over the last seven years, the babies haven't been as healthy as other babies.

76
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.230
Mary Holland: You know, born plus in some states. I'm not sure about this one.

77
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.060
Mary Holland: I know that mothers born with babies on methadone automatically opens a CPS investigation.

78
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.370
Steve Holtsford: Oh, I don't think so.

79
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.220
Mary Holland: Yeah, I've heard that that can be the case.

80
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.850
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, no, no. I think probably in in years past that might be the case, but but now

81
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:22.560
Steve Holtsford: That would not, you know, I've got a couple patients that are pregnant because I am I work in a regular clinic to. So I've got a

82
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.980
Mary Holland: Couple of patients. So you think methadone or Suboxone would be better.

83
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.530
Steve Holtsford: That is

84
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:43.470
Steve Holtsford: You know, the latest they're probably about the same, they're both pretty darn safe and the evidence is pretty clear that staying on the medication is better than getting off the medication.

85
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:50.250
Steve Holtsford: Of course, you're a little bit of a different breed because you've been super stable and and so

86
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.370
Steve Holtsford: But there's, there is in terms of

87
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.410
Mary Holland: Like infant how they have anything, one way or the other.

88
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.920
Steve Holtsford: That the the time in the hospital.

89
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.860
Steve Holtsford: Seems to be a little bit less in the buprenorphine group as opposed to a methadone group.

90
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:21.810
Steve Holtsford: The amount of false Neonatal Abstinence Withdrawal symptoms seems to be is leaning towards buprenorphine rather than methadone. Long story short,

91
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:32.790
Steve Holtsford: But I don't I don't think the American Academy American Society of Addiction Medicine is like pregnant women should be on buprenorphine not methadone, you know, it's not that strong of a recommendation.

92
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.560
Steve Holtsford: But

93
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.980
Steve Holtsford: But it's certainly, you know,

94
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:50.040
Steve Holtsford: Babies are born to moms that aren't people in our field all the time. The only thing that that and they all do well. The only thing is the baby's just got to be watched a little bit longer, you know,

95
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:58.710
Steve Holtsford: The baby's watched for you know 356 days just to just to make sure you know again with the long half life.

96
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.690
Mary Holland: Just to make sure. Right. That

97
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.480
Mary Holland: Suboxone doesn't have as long as a half life does it

98
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.950
Mary Holland: It does. Oh, yeah.

99
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:12.540
Steve Holtsford: I could never yes Suboxone is 24 to 36 hours. So it's about the same as method out same

100
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.790
Steve Holtsford: So i mean i i completely

101
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.970
Steve Holtsford: You know support you in your in your

102
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.620
Steve Holtsford: Goal to get completely off meds, but

103
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.310
Steve Holtsford: If you get pregnant, you get pregnant and and it's a

104
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:29.910
Way.

105
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.710
Mary Holland: That. But as I get off for my career because I know by the time I'm starting to apply for certain jobs, that's going to be a problem.

106
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.880
Steve Holtsford: Is that right

107
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.380
Mary Holland: Okay, yeah, I have to have like a controlled carry permit for because I have to drive clients around

108
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.920
Steve Holtsford: And, you know,

109
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.630
Mary Holland: Test for certain things.

110
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.740
Steve Holtsford: I see.

111
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:47.550
Mary Holland: So,

112
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.190
Mary Holland: I mean, there's other reasons why I want to get off the meds to

113
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:58.080
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Alright, so let's just can you kind of give me a brief history of your use history.

114
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:08.250
Mary Holland: I'm a few I have airlines download syndrome. Okay. And also, arthritis related to that. Several years ago, probably eight, nine years ago I was at a traditional

115
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.320
Mary Holland: pain management clinic. My husband was in the military. At the time, so we had tried care.

116
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.410
Mary Holland: And then my husband broke both his legs.

117
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.820
Mary Holland: And when we lost

118
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:27.120
Mary Holland: The they were micro fractures. Not like full on break. But anyway, he got discharged. So we lost her health insurance. I could no longer afford to pay the pain management doctor

119
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.300
Mary Holland: He was also not a very good pain doctor it

120
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:37.170
Mary Holland: I didn't know this at the time, but it really was kind of a pill mill. It was 40 people sitting in a waiting room to talk for five minutes.

121
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.520
Mary Holland: He took me from

122
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:46.140
Mary Holland: A reasonable five milligram percocet to several like 2448 milligrams with a lot at a day within a few months.

123
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.420
Mary Holland: So, and then when I suddenly lost health insurance had no money couldn't afford it.

124
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.510
Mary Holland: For these are buying pills from your friends and then you start doing heroin, because it's cheaper and, you know, so you end up

125
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.440
Mary Holland: In that cycle because you don't want to be sick and you're in pain from your disease.

126
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.550
Steve Holtsford: And how many years ago.

127
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.680
Mary Holland: That was about eight, nine years ago.

128
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.410
Mary Holland: I started methadone treatment probably seven or eight years ago.

129
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.170
Mary Holland: At a clinic in DC, which is where I was living at the time.

130
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:21.330
Mary Holland: Got it. They started me pretty low and worked me up to 110 eventually the ice stabilized it about at to feel OK.

131
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:33.000
Mary Holland: OK, and then we ended up going to one tennis tolerance came God and then I moved here to Illinois to be with my family, my whole family came with me, but to be with like my father and stuff like that.

132
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:41.970
Mary Holland: About two and a half years ago and I transferred to the clinic in East St. Louis, because it's the only one anywhere near me, and I have to drive an hour and a half to get to that.

133
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.780
Mary Holland: One. So, yeah, it's bad, that's the other part of it. I just don't want to be there anymore because it's so much of a hassle.

134
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.770
Mary Holland: Okay. Um, I was getting two weeks of take home at a time.

135
00:21:53.010 --> 00:22:08.640
Mary Holland: And I asked them a year and a half ago or so to start detoxing me the doctor started bringing me down one milligram a week I asked her to bump it up to two milligrams a week. We did that for a while, went back to one milligram a week when I started to feel a little sick.

136
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:23.970
Mary Holland: They don't water it down, they just give you the straight liquid so I knew it was 10 milligrams per milliliter. Yeah, once I got my last two weeks to take homes and realized that I wasn't going to be able to go back. I just took myself down by about half a milligram a day.

137
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:37.290
Mary Holland: And got myself down to about 20 okay and I haven't had anything and about well spent about three days. I did have half a Viking in from a leftover dental procedure last night, and that's about it. That's

138
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.370
Mary Holland: Given me

139
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.810
Steve Holtsford: I appreciate your honesty.

140
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.370
Mary Holland: I'm going to be honest, because I

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.510
Mary Holland: Felt like shit.

142
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:51.450
Steve Holtsford: Oh, so. So now if if zero is no withdrawal symptoms and 10 is the worst you can imagine where, where would you say you are

143
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.400
Mary Holland: An eight I took a cow's

144
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.170
Mary Holland: Tail. It was about 36

145
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.720
Steve Holtsford: Wasn't really. Holy cow. Okay, you're ready.

146
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.430
Steve Holtsford: All right.

147
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:00.990
Steve Holtsford: And

148
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.050
Mary Holland: Her family would agree, cuz they're like, please just

149
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.070
Steve Holtsford: Are you crabby

150
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.820
Mary Holland: Like, oh god.

151
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.560
Mary Holland: Like wanting to break things

152
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.980
Mary Holland: We're all stuck in here together so

153
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.480
Steve Holtsford: I know rid of them.

154
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.130
Steve Holtsford: Right, so

155
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.490
Mary Holland: Because I said if I could just spend the next week sleeping through it. I would

156
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.050
Mary Holland: And I'd be happy with that. Yeah.

157
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:22.050
Mary Holland: And I still have my college classes attending online.

158
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.850
Mary Holland: God, and I still have to go to work.

159
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.830
Steve Holtsford: So, all right now.

160
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.120
Steve Holtsford: The besides the herb analysts any other past medical history.

161
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.060
Mary Holland: I had a C section with my daughter in 2009

162
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.810
Mary Holland: And a few years ago when I was still doing heroin. I ended up with a very bad Merce infection.

163
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.150
Mary Holland: Others hospitalized for about a week and a half.

164
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.630
Mary Holland: Okay. Other than that, nothing significant

165
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.310
Steve Holtsford: And that was just IV antibiotics.

166
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.840
Mary Holland: A lot of them. Yeah.

167
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.100
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, got it.

168
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.310
Mary Holland: And I guess. Well, a few weeks ago months ago, they discovered a large cyst on my left ovary.

169
00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:03.630
Mary Holland: Okay, and they're still trying to figure out what to do about that. But because of the coded stuff. I haven't been able to get into. See the specialist

170
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.720
Steve Holtsford: Jada Jada smoke cigarettes.

171
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.790
Mary Holland: Yes, about three quarters back a day.

172
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.160
Steve Holtsford: Drink

173
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.210
Mary Holland: Nope. Not at all. It actually anything with tannins, and it makes my face swell up

174
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.970
Steve Holtsford: Gun KNOW, BEN'S those

175
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.730
Mary Holland: Other than the hydroxyl saying that the doctor gave me

176
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.190
Steve Holtsford: Okay yeah that's that's an anti histamines

177
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.220
Mary Holland: I know when it has seen that already. So I want to be honest about it.

178
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.880
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, got it.

179
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.920
Steve Holtsford: No stimulants.

180
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.520
No.

181
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:32.910
Good.

182
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.020
Steve Holtsford: And did. What meds. Do you take precise methadone.

183
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.420
Mary Holland: Just what He's given me.

184
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.160
Steve Holtsford: Just those. Yeah.

185
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.000
Mary Holland: Ones that I mentioned.

186
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.430
Steve Holtsford: Just and those are all kind of PRN

187
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.890
Steve Holtsford: Those are just as needed.

188
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:53.460
Mary Holland: Right, yeah. Okay. Well, except for the map resolve the antacid that's one today. Okay.

189
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.990
Steve Holtsford: Are you allergic to anything.

190
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.220
Mary Holland: Not that I'm aware of.

191
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.980
Steve Holtsford: A family history of substance use disorder.

192
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.490
Mary Holland: No, no, my mother died when I was 13 from colon cancer.

193
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.210
Okay.

194
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.030
Steve Holtsford: All right.

195
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:27.270
Steve Holtsford: So you're going to feel you're going to feel much better. So, so you you're aware of buprenorphine kind of how it works and how it's you know, it's, it really is.

196
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:39.150
Steve Holtsford: It works very well you know it's a partial agonist. So, so it goes to that new receptor stimulates it but just stimulates it enough to make you feel better.

197
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.050
Mary Holland: Right.

198
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:52.200
Steve Holtsford: And it's got a long half life. So once or twice a day dosing is plenty. And then it's got a very high affinity for the receptor that's that's what why it's particularly good

199
00:25:53.550 --> 00:26:00.120
Steve Holtsford: For especially the unstable population because when they you know use heroin on top of it.

200
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.100
Mary Holland: Now sick.

201
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.590
Steve Holtsford: Know that if they can't get high.

202
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.860
Mary Holland: What right, there's no behavior ism response.

203
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:15.960
Steve Holtsford: So, so exactly so the so the buprenorphine the affinity is very high, the heroin can't displace them people in morphine.

204
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:27.090
Steve Holtsford: So, you know, you sort of tell people that there'll be wasting their money, blah, blah, blah. So, so it's sort of a deterrent. That way to kind of a visit trial like deterrence, even though they're actually getting some organism.

205
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.810
Mary Holland: You know, I don't. I know this is probably unrelated. We just had a

206
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:39.360
Mary Holland: Giant fight and my behaviors in class the other day because of the study that showed that people that overdose typically do it and someplace that they don't typically

207
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:46.380
Mary Holland: They aren't so if they shoot up in their house and then they overdose in their car there was like a study about that we had a big fight about it was interesting.

208
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.370
Steve Holtsford: Is that right

209
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:54.150
Mary Holland: Yeah, so they found that the overdose rates are much higher if you're in a different environment because your behavior has changed.

210
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.580
Mary Holland: It was real interesting.

211
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.440
Steve Holtsford: That's very interesting. I, you know,

212
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.150
Mary Holland: I'm not, that's not related. I just

213
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.530
Steve Holtsford: I have not heard that. That's that is very interesting. It's very interesting.

214
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.650
Steve Holtsford: So, so that's basically how it works and and you know

215
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.410
Mary Holland: Typically, do the the tablets or the stripy

216
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.700
Steve Holtsford: Things. It's up to you.

217
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.470
Mary Holland: Okay. Which one's cheaper.

218
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.770
Mary Holland: Whatever's cheaper that's

219
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.430
Steve Holtsford: Okay, so do you have insurance or no.

220
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.990
Mary Holland: I do, but it's through my college

221
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.340
Mary Holland: At the clever things more expensive. Okay.

222
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.460
Steve Holtsford: Are you still there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm here.

223
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:45.930
Steve Holtsford: So the cheapest is some new techniques which is just buprenorphine. It doesn't have the knocks on in there, you know, then the last one, of course, is just to prevent diversion.

224
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.480
Steve Holtsford: Right, so you know that

225
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.640
Steve Holtsford: sublingual it is

226
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.780
Steve Holtsford: Yes, yeah.

227
00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:01.350
Steve Holtsford: They're both sublingual and I don't suddenly text for you is fine. You know, you're, you're very stable and you're not going to

228
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.950
Steve Holtsford: You're not going to dissolve your subjects.

229
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.390
Steve Holtsford: And

230
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:07.920
Mary Holland: Also that

231
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.940
Steve Holtsford: Exactly.

232
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:19.620
Steve Holtsford: Exactly. So in terms of in through the years, you've never you've never taken a sub you tax or buprenorphine.

233
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.760
Mary Holland: I have before. Once you

234
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.160
Steve Holtsford: Okay. Do you know the dose that you took

235
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.540
Mary Holland: I think it isn't it like four milligrams for the strip. I took the stripy ones wasn't like

236
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.700
Steve Holtsford: Okay, yeah, there it is. It's 248 an extra they have a 12 now too.

237
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.350
Mary Holland: I remember taking a four milligram on at some point time ago.

238
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:52.740
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, in Europe, you're already down to 20 milligrams of methadone. So, you know, I'm just thinking out loud here that that may be two milligrams sub detects in the morning and two milligrams in the evening at least to start out

239
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.970
Steve Holtsford: Might be a might be a decent dose.

240
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.750
Mary Holland: I'll take it take to get off of it.

241
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.680
Steve Holtsford: Everybody's different. Everybody's different. Mary

242
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.950
Steve Holtsford: Again, I wouldn't put I wouldn't put pressure on yourself.

243
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.630
Mary Holland: I only pressure at this point is considering the $700 deductible.

244
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.060
Steve Holtsford: Oh, gotcha. This for for the bright heart.

245
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.800
Steve Holtsford: Yeah. Oh, I see. Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. See, I don't I don't deal with any of that.

246
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.000
Mary Holland: Right, that's not

247
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.870
Steve Holtsford: Yeah. Yeah, I feel, yes.

248
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.110
Steve Holtsford: So,

249
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:57.120
Steve Holtsford: You know, if you if you Google, we need myself off of Suboxone. There are so many theories on how to do it and no none is better than the other really that the key is, take your time. Don't put pressure on yourself to do it.

250
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:05.070
Steve Holtsford: Just, you know, we could we could you know let's let's see how four milligrams goes

251
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.820
Steve Holtsford: A day

252
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:18.210
Steve Holtsford: And then if that if that's works well, then maybe we do that for a month and then try to go to three and then two and then and maybe, maybe you're completely off in a few months.

253
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:18.870
Mary Holland: Okay.

254
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.540
Steve Holtsford: You know, and then I again.

255
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.450
Steve Holtsford: You know, if, if you're ready to have a fucking baby just have a fucking baby.

256
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.070
Mary Holland: Okay.

257
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.200
Steve Holtsford: It is what it is you know it's it's safe.

258
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.360
Steve Holtsford: Okay, safe. We do it all the time.

259
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.380
Steve Holtsford: Okay, and

260
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:48.720
Steve Holtsford: And it's not gonna it's there are no, you know, I guess I would probably if you're new to town. I would probably do a little research in in terms of obese that are comfortable

261
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.300
Steve Holtsford: You know, taking care of patients.

262
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.250
Mary Holland: Are pretty rural area so it gets

263
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.010
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, I had to. I had to MapQuest Chester.

264
00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:58.770
Mary Holland: The home of Popeye.

265
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.140
Mary Holland: Oh, man. Yeah.

266
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.420
Steve Holtsford: You're right, with the forearms.

267
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.070
Mary Holland: Yeah, that's our claim to fame.

268
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.470
Steve Holtsford: I'll be darned I'll return so

269
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.530
Steve Holtsford: You know, I would probably do that.

270
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.790
Steve Holtsford: But you're not how far you from St. Louis, or an hour, an hour, an

271
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.750
Mary Holland: Hour and a half.

272
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.190
Steve Holtsford: Hour and a half, okay, you know, worst case scenario would be and then

273
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:28.740
Steve Holtsford: So you know if you're at. If you are at a stage in your life where you and your husband want to have a baby.

274
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.500
Steve Holtsford: I wouldn't let four milligrams of subjects, get in the way of that.

275
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.840
Mary Holland: Okay, yeah, I appreciate that.

276
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.830
Steve Holtsford: Yeah yeah

277
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.310
Mary Holland: And I mean I do feel a lot better at that than 110 milligrams a method

278
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:48.930
Mary Holland: Yeah, that the equivalence of that I'm like Jesus. I didn't realize how much that was like 400 bucks a day.

279
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.360
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, your tolerance was up there.

280
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.620
Mary Holland: It was bad, so I'm

281
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.530
Mary Holland: I mean, I feel pretty proud of having gotten down this far.

282
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.120
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, yeah. And how much you know, back in the day, how much hair when we're using it today.

283
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.370
Mary Holland: As much as I could afford

284
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:09.060
Mary Holland: Got it. Usually, it was TWO OR THREE CAPSULES at a time, and I was in living in Baltimore area. Okay.

285
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:14.940
Mary Holland: I did the gel cap things. So it was like two or three per shot and then three or four shots a day.

286
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.850
Steve Holtsford: Got it, got it. Okay.

287
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:25.290
Steve Holtsford: All right, so I should have I'm new to this whole thing, so I should be able to

288
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.980
Steve Holtsford: Did you give them your pharmacy information.

289
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.400
Mary Holland: Yes, there's only one Walmart here in Chester, Illinois.

290
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:42.450
Steve Holtsford: Walmart okay and Walmart, just so you know socks. They suck in terms of of buprenorphine and getting buprenorphine.

291
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.590
Mary Holland: Oh really,

292
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:50.670
Mary Holland: Yes, we have another local pharmacy that has a drive thru. I don't know if that would be better. But I mean, again, it's small rural pharmacy.

293
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.810
Steve Holtsford: So we can

294
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.240
Steve Holtsford: We can try.

295
00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:05.820
Steve Holtsford: But, but they, they, in general are just, they don't stop very well. And so, but but I'll just, I'll send it all electronically so

296
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.160
Steve Holtsford: We'll, we'll work it out.

297
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.780
Steve Holtsford: And then let's see, did they did they give you. I apologize. I'm on I'm new to this, they gave you

298
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.670
Steve Holtsford: You know you can you can contact somebody a bright heart if you have

299
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:28.320
Mary Holland: They sent me some emails. They talked about doing like having to do group meetings, but I don't think I need to. I actually already do DVD on my own.

300
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.480
Mary Holland: With a group therapy so

301
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.370
Mary Holland: Yeah, and I don't believe in, like, Well, for me personally I don't do. I'm not religious.

302
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.530
Mary Holland: So I don't like a so I do, I do.

303
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:49.320
Steve Holtsford: Gotcha, gotcha. Okay. All right. So, and I and I can't. And I would agree with you and talking to you that that groups are probably not going to benefit you that much. But I don't, I don't know.

304
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.360
Steve Holtsford: Right hearts policy and stuff. You know what I mean.

305
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.460
Steve Holtsford: I mean might have to jump through hoops.

306
00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:54.900
Mary Holland: Find out

307
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.100
Steve Holtsford: Yeah. And then, but we'll, we'll, we'll get through it so

308
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.370
Steve Holtsford: Okay, I think that's about

309
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.280
Steve Holtsford: All I need, and do they have you spoken with a therapist yet.

310
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.140
Mary Holland: Not from you guys. No.

311
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.170
Steve Holtsford: Okay. All right. I think they asked

312
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:17.250
Steve Holtsford: You know, suicidality, you're not suicidal.

313
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.050
Mary Holland: Suicidal not homicidal breaks and stuff maybe

314
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:24.060
Steve Holtsford: But not kill anybody.

315
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:24.450

316
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:32.490

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.830
Mary Holland: It's nice that they're allowing doctors to do the Collins for the SEBI text now.

324
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.280
Steve Holtsford: Yes, yes, it really

325
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:13.710
Mary Holland: Especially in these rural communities like it's very difficult for us to find help for people

326
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:25.860
Steve Holtsford: Yes, and that that's what's most exciting about this potential is that, you know, I, I do a lot of training for waiver training so

327
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:42.480
Steve Holtsford: You know, as I train these dogs. I will tell them you know hey there bright heart health, you know, if you've got a you know a couple half days a month, we can you know get patients stable throughout the whole state in the middle of nowhere.

328
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:54.720
Mary Holland: Right, I'm actually distances, the first time I've encountering this and it's been so nice. I'm my I work for the county for our county mental health or the Human Services her

329
00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:01.320
Mary Holland: Job. I'm gonna bring that up to our county and see if they can help put it in inflammation.

330
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:10.230
Steve Holtsford: Right. Right. I mean, I'm just, I'm just starting to talk to people throughout the state to make this available because you know I have a

331
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:24.270
Steve Holtsford: I have a limit of 275 patients and in my, in my Lighthouse recovery, where I work. One, one day a week I have about 50 so I have more than 200 spots that they're available.

332
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.380
Mary Holland: To people with yeah

333
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:40.650
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, I could be helping people in counties that have zero providers. And then when you multiply that by by, you know, my 20 friends that are waiver. I mean, you're before you know it, everybody should, should you know have care.

334
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.180
Steve Holtsford: So,

335
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.380
Steve Holtsford: All right, all right, Mary, so I

336
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.410
Steve Holtsford: am gonna so I think we're done.

337
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.460
Steve Holtsford: I will

338
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.140
Steve Holtsford: I will send the meds.

339
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.630
Steve Holtsford: To the pharmacy and you should assuming they have it.

340
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.490
Steve Holtsford: You should be able to

341
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.500
Mary Holland: Find it at a Walmart somewhere around here.

342
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.620
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, yeah, you should be able to to pick it up with within an hour or so and then

343
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.350
Steve Holtsford: I'll just

344
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:22.650
Steve Holtsford: And I can contact you through through bright heart. I have to figure out how to do that. But so really take two milligrams

345
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:39.510
Steve Holtsford: Maybe wait 3060 minutes. See how you feel if you if you feel significantly better maybe stop there. If you, if you need to take another one which is four milligrams, that's fine, don't view it as a as a failure at all. We're just, you know,

346
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:46.320
Steve Holtsford: If we go four milligrams twice a day that's still not a very high dose. Just so you know, you know,

347
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.670
Mary Holland: Just a PM.

348
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:55.110
Steve Holtsford: Exactly, exactly. And then, and then in a bit. We can probably decrease the one today dosing, but don't put

349
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:13.680
Steve Holtsford: You know, we want you to feel like you're supposed to feel. Don't put too much. Don't be like, oh no, I can't believe I'm on eight milligrams. Don't worry about it. I guess we get to feeling good. And then we then we taper slowly and then you get pregnant squared on a kid and silver. Okay.

350
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.560
Steve Holtsford: Go. Yes, yes. Exactly. Okay. All right. Very nice to meet you. And we'll be in touch.

351
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.850
Mary Holland: Thank you. Bye bye.
