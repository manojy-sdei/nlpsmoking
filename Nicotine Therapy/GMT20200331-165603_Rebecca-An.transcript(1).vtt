65
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I hope not.

66
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:37.590

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.870
Angelo Sanchez: Like that, you know,

71
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.570

72
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Caring about yourself. It's not about caring about other people. It's about

73
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not wanting

74
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.180

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thinking about playing the tape forward. ANGELO with not responding or reacting to your to, you know, issues with your neighbor and being able to not be in trouble and not have any new criminal charges and nothing happening to you.

80
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's really the direction that you want to go right. You don't want to go the direction

81
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

82
00:07:51.090 --> 00:08:03.150
Angelo Sanchez: Working on it. Yeah, there's just an idiot doctor in the mental hospital down hospital. She wanted to be the damn as she came out and said, oh, yeah, I'm going to put up that block for you to

83
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:13.200
Angelo Sanchez: Go through a bunch of hoops and stuff to go and be able to legally purchase a firearm where they give you a background.

84
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Check and

85
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.680
Angelo Sanchez: It registered my name, but you Mexico.

86
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.250
Angelo Sanchez: Doesn't have any law that requires

87
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:32.940
Angelo Sanchez: A firearm to be registered to anybody. So I could just buy one off the street and whatever, you know, as long as no one got shot or killed with it. I could just, you know, be fine with it anyway.

88
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you and you're serious, you're serious about buying a gun up the street, you're serious.

89
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:53.730
Angelo Sanchez: Um, well, I mean, yeah, people want to f with me that bad, you know, I'm just going to get really tired of it and have, like, really, you know, I'm not going to randomly go off.

90
00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:08.610
Angelo Sanchez: She whoever everybody. People want to like start problems. I already call the police on those Mexican people. He said, there's nothing I could do but maybe soon. So I'm going to get firearms and then maybe sue them and if they want to come see our problems. I'll shoot him, you know,

91
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that won't help you know you'll be the one that gets in trouble.

92
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:25.140
Angelo Sanchez: With a gun on me and you know tell the cops you questioned or get arrested or ever, and it'll come out in court, you know, that's how I would guess for people are so

93
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.270
Angelo Sanchez: I'll just, you know,

94
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.580
Angelo Sanchez: Let them have it, you know.

95
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really not what you want to do, right.

96
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.720
Angelo Sanchez: Um, well, I

97
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just want to be

98
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:57.720
Angelo Sanchez: If they will bother me that bad or message me bad enough, I may just go out and you know something. I was like, No, I'm really tired of people and to take advantage. I'm tired of animals, trying to take advantage. I mean, trying to take advantage, you know,

99
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.470
Angelo Sanchez: I mean, I guess this is the place to talk about it, but

100
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Who do you have that is a support for you.

101
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:12.960
Angelo Sanchez: Hmm.

102
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who do you have that support for you.

103
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.190
Know early

104
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.340
Angelo Sanchez: Myself, I guess.

105
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anybody that you can any friends or family members that you can talk to when you're starting to struggle with your neighbors.

106
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.190
Angelo Sanchez: Ever I might have, like,

107
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.270
A friend.

108
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.100
Angelo Sanchez: Maybe

109
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.640
Angelo Sanchez: And then my little brother is kind of supportive to where he is. Want me to do drugs and so

110
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.900
Yeah.

111
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.230
Angelo Sanchez: And I say, that's all.

112
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Refresh my memory. How old is your brother.

113
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.240
Angelo Sanchez: I mean you help out. And so

114
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.460
Like

115
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.180
Angelo Sanchez: Help me get on the right direction.

116
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.190
Angelo Sanchez: If she first straight

117
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

118
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.000
Angelo Sanchez: Safety you first. Right.

119
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:19.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And part of that is getting out of that with the way of thinking. You know what I mean. Instead of playing the tape forward on what you could do to your neighbor.

120
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:31.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because your frustration, maybe think about how you can distance yourself from them and not engage in, you know, the back and forth and us to keep yourself safe. It's not about them. It's about you.

121
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:40.230
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, it's really not about them. They're just causing problems being annoying stuff trying to make it about them, or whatever.

122
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:53.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you obviously you know you're making better choices as far as you're using and, you know, you think about that, that says Angelo that you care about what happens to you.

123
00:11:53.790 --> 00:12:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know what I mean, engaging with them in in the back and forth. And this doesn't do anything to escalate the problem and

124
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.340
Angelo Sanchez: Feeding adding fuel to the fire.

125
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you don't want to do that.

126
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.840
Angelo Sanchez: You're going to life to look like the bad guy, you know, all the neighbors that kind of favorite me or whatever. So

127
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They gotta stop that stop engaging, don't let them push the button.

128
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

129
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You better than

130
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.940
Angelo Sanchez: We were assured neighbors new favorite me now.

131
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

132
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's about keeping your side of the street clean and letting them, you know, do whatever they're going to do and

133
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And the truth comes out.

134
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.630
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah.

135
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just by keeping yourself safe.

136
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

137
00:12:48.180 --> 00:13:00.120
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't even know. I mean, is like really honestly I've been trying to legally go out my voluntary of fuel forum for purchasing firearms things to that doctor who's a

138
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.840
Angelo Sanchez: Grill doctor and

139
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:12.390
Angelo Sanchez: She even says she didn't like me. So she just causing problems, you know, so I mean if something does happen, you know,

140
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:21.990
Angelo Sanchez: He's going to be the one who gets in trouble with me because of it. I've seen unlike world's craziest to well this video's doctrines get shot at all the time. I think it was a doctor.

141
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:34.770
Angelo Sanchez: At the hospital that I've actually flipped out at, you know, hit the doctor, not a doctor really F de person that shouldn't have even been working in that profession, you know,

142
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:46.260
Angelo Sanchez: Honestly, I entirely shattered the person knows and before that tried to break two chairs over his face or at every two and he still didn't want to go down. So I said, Okay.

143
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.060
Angelo Sanchez: You know, and

144
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.440
Angelo Sanchez: Next thing you know, I just thought real blood going out the exit door.

145
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long ago was that

146
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.970
Angelo Sanchez: I'm probably right around when I turned 18

147
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So few years back.

148
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:04.950

Angelo Sanchez: Enough like calling me down and you know

191
00:18:53.370 --> 00:19:09.390
Angelo Sanchez: Even three strips today probably wouldn't be enough to really like bring me to a real calm state. But I mean, these strips today, at least, like how it should have been. To begin with, would have been nice. Now, that makes me feel like I feel like

192
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:17.490
Angelo Sanchez: Maybe go for relapse. But I don't even want to, you know, I was hoping the doctor work with me. Now, I don't really

193
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:28.200
Angelo Sanchez: Like the nested Dr Solomon's doc string or whatever methods.

194
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.250
Angelo Sanchez: That dogs actually listen to the patients.

195
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:47.460
Angelo Sanchez: You know, and then other ones that don't and ones that I think listen to the patients, saying, you know, patients will tell they've tried this or ever. It works for them. The doctor say okay, sure. I'm all for it.

196
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.920

199
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:19.860

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not, you know,

202
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:50.400

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:27.660
Lauren Kelly: I'm, you know, I've been finding really cool stuff. So it's not like you know I forgot I had. And, you know, things like that. So that's been kind of fun, but um yeah really kind of boring, not, not too much. Sure.

434
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.490
Yeah.

435
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.530
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, no, no crisis is nothing like that.

436
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:46.230
Lauren Kelly: I had just a couple little things where my catastrophic thinking spiraling kind of started, but I was able to stop myself, you know, like for example.

437
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:54.000
Lauren Kelly: So like things have been not great with like Paul in his ex wife, you know, she's, she's really mad about everything and

438
00:40:54.360 --> 00:41:00.480
Lauren Kelly: So when he goes to try to see the kids usually she'll kind of start yelling at him and he'll be back here pretty quickly.

439
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:09.120
Lauren Kelly: But like last week he had gone over there and he ended up staying for like six hours and like I didn't hear from him, or six hours so

440
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:18.600
Lauren Kelly: I start spiraling in my head, and of course my head's like is he even coming home tonight. You know, like, you know, and I'm smiling and smiling and him not contacting me didn't help.

441
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:24.480
Lauren Kelly: But I mean, he was with this kid and he hadn't gotten quality time with them, which I'm aware of, like, he had kept trying to

442
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:30.750
Lauren Kelly: Go over there and within like a half hour if you back of house because it was strong, and you know, like that's not helpful to the kids. So, you know, so

443
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:41.790
Lauren Kelly: So, you know, I didn't want to be mad that like this one day I guess she had just gone upstairs to like her rooms. We got to spend time with the kids like on his own. So he wanted to like, you know, stay as long as he could, which I totally support.

444
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:51.930
Lauren Kelly: But I kind of caught myself in that, like, you know, it brought me down like I was kind of expecting back in a couple hours. So it's all excited for him to be back. And then as the hours away. I'm like,

445
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.280
Lauren Kelly: You know, he got my brain kind of started spiraling and it's like, you know,

446
00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.810
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. So by the time he got home, I was just kind of like sad and whatever, you know, and

447
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:10.770
Lauren Kelly: And it wasn't anything you know either wrong or anything, but I told him like next time that happens like you need to contact me, you know, get them like better about setting boundaries so I'm like, you know, it's fine that you're there for that long.

448
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.290
Lauren Kelly: But you need to contact me. So I don't spiral, you know, and he's like, you know, you're totally right. I totally get that

449
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.520
Lauren Kelly: And the other thing I told him is like here I'm moving all my stuff in.

450
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.260
Lauren Kelly: And when we originally came back or he said he would have all this stuff here with them like 48 hours and

451
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:34.530
Lauren Kelly: He's only brought like one bag of food since then. So I told him like, Look, I'm not moving in here by myself. I don't want it to feel like a hotel where you have a few bags here. You know what I mean, like, I need

452
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:44.070
Lauren Kelly: All of your shit hit like that's important to me. I'm bringing all of my shaker. I need all of your shift here to, you know, and he's like, I totally get that like I will absolutely do that. So,

453
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:49.980
Lauren Kelly: I'm thinking to speak is going to be doing that. So again, like those are things I wouldn't have said before, you know, I wouldn't

454
00:42:49.980 --> 00:43:02.460
Lauren Kelly: Like stood up for myself, like, no, you need to do this, you know, so, um, so, yeah. Instead of me. Just like spiraling and like, you know, thinking, what does it mean, or whatever. I just say, Hey, this is what I need you to do, you know, and

455
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.300
Lauren Kelly: So he hasn't been back there since we had that conversation, but

456
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:16.560
Lauren Kelly: You know, I'm pretty sure I mean I told him I don't want to nag you. I want to know. This is important to you. This is literally the last time I'm going to bring this up to you. I need to see that it's important to you. So

457
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.820
Lauren Kelly: You know, we'll, we'll see what happens there, but I'm I'm confident that it

458
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:31.320
Lauren Kelly: Will do that and and he told me, like, I like that you're telling me this, you know, I'm going to that every knows that I'm not gonna you know I'm human. I'm not going to be perfect but you know when you tell me in a healthy way.

459
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:36.150
Lauren Kelly: I don't, I'm not screaming. I'm not yelling at I'm not crying. It's just, hey, I need this from, you know, and

460
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:48.510
Lauren Kelly: And he's, you know, there haven't been you know any issues. So I mean, like that's like the biggest thing that's happened and it wasn't even a big deal. You know, so, um, yeah. Other than that, I feel like I'm better at

461
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.020
Lauren Kelly: Kind of catching myself before I get to that point. And I'm not packing bags and running out the door. You know what I mean there any

462
00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:04.500
Lauren Kelly: Man, so that's growth to me. But the one thing that I thought would maybe be important to discuss with you today that I've noticed

463
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:16.350
Lauren Kelly: Is kind of an issue. This was a big issue for me in the beginning. And I think it kind of took a backseat while I was focusing on other things. But it's kind of something I've started dealing with again is

464
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:23.550
Lauren Kelly: That to like the guilt in this self forgiveness. Kind of stuff that's really hard for me, like so. An example is

465
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:29.820
Lauren Kelly: I think it was like Saturday or Sunday Paul and I were home because, you know, we're on lockdown. So it's like all of us here all day.

466
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:37.830
Lauren Kelly: Which we were reading an article that like divorces up right now in the country because like people can't see me with their significant other. And we're like, we're loving it. So it's like

467
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.220
Lauren Kelly: You know,

468
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:51.300
Lauren Kelly: It's awesome, or the opposite end of that spectrum, but I would we were watching this reality show. And there was this girl who had gotten hotline to her boyfriend and she was it's this show 90 day fiance. Have you ever heard him in

469
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:58.860
Lauren Kelly: So there's this Russian girl who's dating this American man and she told him she wasn't data and any other Americans.

470
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:11.700
Lauren Kelly: And then one of her friends kind of brought up in Russia, when he met her friends. Does he know you were talking to another American and and so he got really mad and and she's like, well, he only has my Instagram and he was like the dudes, like, well, that's funny.

471
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:20.160
Lauren Kelly: I saw like an American talking in English pop up on your WhatsApp up app or whatever her and she was like, oh,

472
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:28.500
Lauren Kelly: Well, like totally lied. And so I just kind of made that comment is that what it was like when I used to lie to you but you know like was I like that bad of a liar. Was I like

473
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:34.620
Lauren Kelly: Whatever and and it just kind of, and he would. And he was like, you know, I don't want to talk about it or something and I kind of see like

474
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:41.610
Lauren Kelly: You know, if we didn't get into that I could kind of see like, that hurt. And as I'm like, thinking of that sort of thing. And it was my bad. I brought it. I was one who brought it up.

475
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:48.570
Lauren Kelly: But it just seemed like the hurt, and his eyes. I just like started crying and I like had to go in the other room for like

476
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:55.770
Lauren Kelly: A half hour and I was just like crying. And then he had to come, give me like baby for past it were rapacity you know like when we decided to come back here.

477
00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:02.910
Lauren Kelly: You know, we decided to forgive each other for all of that and like you have to learn how to stop doing this to yourself because I'm like

478
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:10.680
Lauren Kelly: I'm not beating me up. I'm beating you know and I might I need to I get. It's not like a, you know,

479
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.970
Lauren Kelly: One size fits all. Oh, this is what you do step ABC and you'll forgive yourself.

480
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:26.670
Lauren Kelly: I get that, but like, I'm just so I guess certain things will happen. And I realized like, I'm so far away from like being anywhere near that. And I just still carry so much Phil and it's nothing. He's doing you know it's not. He's not

481
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:34.500
Lauren Kelly: bringing it up. I brought it up. He's not, you know, beating up with anything he's helping to like pull me out of that, but I need to get to a point where like

482
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:43.920
Lauren Kelly: We can have conversations where I'm not just like oh my god, I'm a piece of shit. I don't deserve anything good. You know what I mean. And that's what I do to myself so

483
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:51.810
Lauren Kelly: There's that. And then I asked him before we got on the call. Is there anything that you think I should talk to her back about. And he said, you know, he said.

484
00:46:52.140 --> 00:47:03.870
Lauren Kelly: And I said, I'm going to talk to her about the guilt and self forget to send us like I think that's really important because I hate seeing you do that to yourself, because I don't deserve that. And then he he thought it was important. I bring up

485
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:12.600
Lauren Kelly: That he thinks I have unrealistic expectations of where I should be, and he thinks that they put way too much pressure on myself and like click the other day, I

486
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:21.690
Lauren Kelly: Was I didn't know this, but I was about to start my period so Sunday, I kind of woke up like really kind of gloomy old and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Come to find out like Monday morning, I start my period. I'm like,

487
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:28.170
Lauren Kelly: That's, that's what that was but I felt all of this pressure because again I have all these boxes. I need to go through

488
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.950
Lauren Kelly: And I kind of kept trying to push myself to do that, but I just felt so like

489
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:40.230
Lauren Kelly: crappy like I just want to lay down or something. But, and he's like, why don't you and I'm like, because I feel like I was a piece of shit that later bound and just watch TV.

490
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:51.870
Lauren Kelly: And nap. And it's a while I was a drug addict. I don't feel like I have room for one day of that I have to be productive every day. I don't deserve to do that. And he's like, dude, everybody gets like needs and that'll help everybody needs a day to just like

491
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.150
Lauren Kelly: Watch TV and not like you're putting way too much pressure on yourself, you've accomplished so much in 90 days.

492
00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:03.600
Lauren Kelly: Like if you're allowed to have a day. And I'm like, No, but I'm not. I did that for so many years. I'm not allowed to have a day where I don't

493
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:10.590
Lauren Kelly: Accomplish, so much so that that was something he thought like I'm putting like way too much pressure on myself like I should be so much further along when like

494
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:21.390
Lauren Kelly: If he thinks I'm doing great. And, you know, not, not, like, oh, don't care, don't you know put those things as a priority, but like, I'm just pushing it too much, you know, and I'm

495
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:37.110
Lauren Kelly: Honest, I mean like unrealistic expectations, like I should be so much further along, and I'm not realizing, like what I have done and what you know a great job. I have done, how far I have all I think of is like what I haven't done and how much further, I still have to go in

496
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:46.860
Lauren Kelly: Yeah. And those are things like I guess I had thought I had kind of come further along. But I realized like, I saw a lot of work to do there. So that was something so

497
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:57.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about your catastrophic thinking when it comes to Paul. You also have that same thought process around yourself.

498
00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.320
Lauren Kelly: Yes, definitely.

499
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you know that you've been beating yourself up since you were a kid.

500
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:15.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and so that pattern has been built. So now you've got to turn around and the same exact thing that you're doing with your relationship with Paul, you have to do to do with yourself.

501
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:35.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to tell yourself. You know what I do deserve a day. I do deserve to relax for a little bit. I do not feel good self care is the number one most vital important thing in recovering early recovery. Number one, and it's one thing that we fall short on in early recovery.

502
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:37.440
Lauren Kelly: You know,

503
00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and

504
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.750
Lauren Kelly: I ain't nothing for so long. I don't. I feel like I don't have a date for that yet.

505
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's unrealistic. It is unrealistic expectations, even people that you know work, five days a week have a full time job get two days off.

506
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:53.790
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

507
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. So, you know, when you put it in that perspective.

508
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get two days off to you don't always have to be doing something big and make up. There's no making up that times gone

509
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. This is about living a life that's healthy

510
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: clutter free of all the junk of the past.

511
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:30.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And realizing that. All right. Maybe back in the in your using days you were unproductive. Now you've been sober 90 days and accomplish more in 90 days, then you have and how many years. Yeah.

512
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.890
Lauren Kelly: Combined, like, you know,

513
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:32.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

514
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:39.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is huge. You've got to give yourself those credits. And so when you don't feel like giving yourself those credits.

515
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You, you really have to keep doing it. Even if you don't feel like it. It's like when you got to go to work, even if you don't feel like it. You got to get up and go to work.

516
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

517
00:50:49.290 --> 00:51:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you got to have that same thought process when it comes to this stuff to, you know, you don't have to complete a big huge storage unit in one day or one week. It's going to be there waiting for you.

518
00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. It's not going anywhere. Yeah, right. You've done so much in the past 90 days you deserve a break when you don't feel good.

519
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You deserve a Sunday laying around with your partner watching movies and just sharing intimate time together because that's how we build relationships with our partner and with ourselves, right, it's

520
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.150
Lauren Kelly: Like I hear the words, you're saying, and they make

521
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.330
Lauren Kelly: Sense, but when I tried to internalize it. My head says

522
00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:38.070
Lauren Kelly: No, like right. I'm like, as you're saying that I'm listening and like she makes sense. And I have like, but no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. And I don't I don't get

523
00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:55.980
Lauren Kelly: How I make that grow because as soon as I I think that's great. And it makes sense for anyone else but then when I tried to like internalize that, to me, it's like, oh, but not you. You don't deserve you know in it. I don't know what that is, that just won't allow me to like Phil. Okay.

524
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you think about how long you've been

525
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pretty much beating up yourself and everyone around you has been beating you up, you know,

526
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At 10 years old you were told you were, you know, the problem of the family that has ingrained in your head. It's going to take practice and practice and practice changing. Just that alone.

527
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:30.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you don't tell the child that you just don't because that really kind of set off this whole pattern of, you know, self doubt of low self esteem, self worth.

528
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of those things that really put built was the foundation that really kind of built all that negativity. You've got to unpack that negative for the

529
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Little bit out of time. Born a little bit out of time, you're doing an awesome job you're setting boundaries and your relationship. You know what I mean, you're, you're expressing your needs in a healthy way.

530
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you're staying sober you're showing up your suiting up you're doing all of these good things.

531
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to combat those thoughts with. Why don't I deserve them. Yeah, if I, if the past had nothing to do with it. If you didn't have a doorway to the past, why wouldn't you deserve a day of rest.

532
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:24.030
Lauren Kelly: But those my next thought is that those things are there. The things are there. And that is my past, and that is what I'm trying to make up for. So I again.

533
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:35.040
Lauren Kelly: totally makes sense. But for a second. I tried to apply it to me. But then there is the past, and I can't ignore it and I still feel like a piece of shit for it. And I don't know, like it.

534
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:42.180
Lauren Kelly: And, you know, Paul says he's forgiven me yet. You know, I feel that he has him like his actions but

535
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:55.500
Lauren Kelly: It's just the way he treats me and the way you know when I start beating myself up. He reminds me of everything I've accomplished and he's really great at building me back up and everything. When I get, you know, in that

536
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:56.250
State of mind.

537
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:12.480
Lauren Kelly: But it's me and and i just i just i honestly feel like all you never get like I feel like that's the one thing I'll never be able to do is say, like, I'm a good person and I deserve good things, and I forgive myself like I just don't

538
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:28.890
Lauren Kelly: It fills unattainable, it doesn't it doesn't feel like like the dishonesty thing that being overwhelmed thing like those things. I felt myself accomplishing things and progressing and I just, I, I just feel like I'm not progressing in the guilt and the

539
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:41.070
Lauren Kelly: Just not being able to forgive myself or feeling like worthy of things. And no matter how hard I try again. Like I'm listening to the things you're saying, and they all make sense. But the second I'm like internalized

540
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:50.370
Lauren Kelly: There's just his voice screaming in my head, but not for, you know, you're, you're a different story. You're the worst person in the world and you were willing to

541
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:57.690
Lauren Kelly: Her and manipulate the people who love most and you don't say anything. You know, like, and I

542
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:06.690
Lauren Kelly: I just wish like I could make it at least like a baby step of progress in that. And I just, I feel like I have so many other aspects of my life but

543
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:16.830
Lauren Kelly: I kind of just push that one down and push that one down, and then something like you know that conversation the other day comes up and then I'm just, it's just right there and I can't keep my emotions in tech and I just

544
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:25.020
Lauren Kelly: Am in this deep dark hole, you know, and then I'm going over everything that I ever did in my head and everything hurtful I ever did, and

545
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:33.480
Lauren Kelly: You know, and you know it's like it's like, you know, with the Nico thing like I finally made a decision to just pull the trigger, like on that's done with because

546
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:42.480
Lauren Kelly: What I realized is he was okay with being my friend when even when I explained to him that I was a drug addict that I had lied to him that I had manipulated him.

547
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:50.670
Lauren Kelly: It wasn't until I really do that hard line of like a romantic connection is never going to happen that all of a sudden he doesn't want to be my friend.

548
00:55:50.940 --> 00:56:00.780
Lauren Kelly: So it's like I said almost accepted and respected more and saying, wow. You lied to me you manipulate me. I don't want you in my life like that I could have respected more that he was okay with that.

549
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:10.350
Lauren Kelly: The only thing he can't isn't okay with is that, like, you know, I don't need him the way I needed it before and that he can't control me in any way. And like

550
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:16.740
Lauren Kelly: get what he wants out of me and that I can't respect, you know, like, oh, because I can't force myself to

551
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:22.590
Lauren Kelly: Have a romantic connection with you. You can't. You don't want me in your life like that's a shitty person you know they need like

552
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.410
Lauren Kelly: That and I finally realized like, I couldn't have respected you not wanting to be my friend because of the lies and manipulation.

553
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:39.810
Lauren Kelly: But just because I can't be romantic with you in a camp or set and you know I'm in a serious relationship. But again, like I didn't want to wait to have you on the positive because in his mind. He would think, Okay, well then a polygon she'll want me like I needed to

554
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:50.040
Lauren Kelly: You know when I explain it to them. It has nothing to do a call it has. I mean, obviously has something to do with your secondary relationship but like more 99.999% of it is that I

555
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:55.290
Lauren Kelly: Don't look at you that way. And I never well and I'm sorry for that. But, and then that's where

556
00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:02.790
Lauren Kelly: Can be disrespectful and just blowing me off and just doing all this stuff, all of a sudden started. So to me, I can't respect that, you know, so

557
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:05.910
Lauren Kelly: So like but but then like my next thought will be

558
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:15.810
Lauren Kelly: You know, but you mean you should trust tip you. Maybe you should try a little harder because you did hurt him and all that, but like I actually have become okay with the fact that, like, no, that's a friend and I don't

559
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:22.230
Lauren Kelly: You know, like, then that is not conducive with my recovery. He literally he wanted a minute, but he wants me to be a meeting.

560
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:29.880
Lauren Kelly: And it never dawned on me that when I got clean, there would be people who wouldn't be happy about it, you know, and I mean like if my close friends.

561
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.510
Lauren Kelly: People who I thought really cared about me getting my life together and

562
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:41.760
Lauren Kelly: Being like an honest reliable dependable friend. I thought that would be something that would be like, welcome. You know, I knew it would be hurtful to explain to people like

563
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:49.260
Lauren Kelly: The hurtful things I did, but I thought at least when they saw me you know accomplishing things in anybody else I've talked to is oh great, Lauren. This is

564
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:58.320
Lauren Kelly: Awesome only have it cannot be happy for one accomplishing and I gave it actually seems like angry when I talk about things I've accomplished on my own.

565
00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:02.910
Lauren Kelly: With Dan and and it's like, that's just

566
00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:16.200
Lauren Kelly: That I just can't respect that I like he would literally want me to force myself to be like physical with him and that would make him happy. And because I can't do that is like a few and. Okay, cool. Goodbye, you know,

567
00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.060
Lauren Kelly: But then there's still that voice in my head. That's like well you did her him, and you did do all that, but

568
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:34.530
Lauren Kelly: You know, so it's like even it almost is to the point of me feeling like I should let people treat you like shit because I deserve that. Because I did that to them for so long. And I don't know how to like tell myself like no you don't deserve that, you know,

569
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I can tell you that actions speak louder than words. And even though you don't believe the words that

570
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Should be going through your head the actions that you're taking shows that you're learning. You're learning that you're important

571
00:58:54.180 --> 00:59:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That your voice does matter that you as a human need to be respected. Your friend is, you know, he acts as a predator. Yeah. And that is an unhealthy relationship you for you to be in you know people like that do thrive on people needing them.

572
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah and you know they have one ulterior motive in you know one motive inside their head and no matter what eventually at the end of the line. You know what I mean. His plan was to you know get with you one way or the other. Yeah.

573
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if it was out of

574
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.950
Lauren Kelly: Desperation yeah because

575
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:40.980
Lauren Kelly: Once a week. Lauren to for like for that to ever. I mean, it never was a consideration in my head, but I he, I think he thought the weaker. She is the better my chances are, you know what I mean. So, this

576
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:47.520
Lauren Kelly: For you sees me getting in the morning he sees me accomplishing. It's like, oh shit this is this is going the other way, you know. Yeah, and

577
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:52.380
Lauren Kelly: And there was a just for today that I read a little while ago and it was talking about how

578
00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:58.590
Lauren Kelly: They've been self sufficient and how meetings are, you know, self supporting and self sufficient. And it's like, you know, when we were

579
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.750
Lauren Kelly: addictive. You were okay with like, you know, using people and meeting things and kind of

580
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.840
Lauren Kelly: Trying to get something for nothing, all the time and that sort of thing. And that once we start like paying our own way.

581
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:20.610
Lauren Kelly: We can eat whatever we want. We can live wherever we want we can drive whatever we want. We can hang out with whoever we want because we're, we're in the driver's seat. We're taking control of that you know and and

582
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:26.010
Lauren Kelly: It's just so you're saying it never dawned on me that people wouldn't be happy about me.

583
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:38.130
Lauren Kelly: I never thought people would be mad that I got my shit together. You know, like, or that I mean I can't quite say got my ship, but that I'm getting my shit together, you know, and so I mean that just blows my mind, but I'm

584
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.350
Lauren Kelly: 100% like the biggest point that I realized is like he was okay with the legs and

585
01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.130
Lauren Kelly: Manipulation.

586
01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:57.990
Lauren Kelly: But he's not okay with me getting my life together and actually having control of my life ruins, you know and and i mean he won't say it, but it's true. If you would rather you just relax and be an addict and then half the column every day because hey, I need help with dog food.

587
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.810
Lauren Kelly: And then I have to hang out with him for a couple hours because he helped me

588
01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:07.320
Lauren Kelly: Hey, I need some help with some groceries and then he gets to come over and just like hang out and linger forever. You know what I mean. And then in his life.

589
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:15.270
Lauren Kelly: Oh, she's hanging out with me. That must mean there's a chance or something, even the ones in 100%. No, but now that I have control of that.

590
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.400
Lauren Kelly: And that I can

591
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you got to remember that when you start making changes in your life.

592
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:33.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the better the toxic and unhealthy people that you had in your life. They won't stay. Yeah, because you know toxic breeds toxic.

593
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah.

594
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They love misery. They want you right there with them. Their goal is to, you know, you be back in that miserable Miserable spot with them.

595
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And when you're setting boundaries with toxic people. This is the kind of behavior that you get

596
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get these behaviors.

597
01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because

598
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want you healthy

599
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:58.920
Lauren Kelly: I had like a handful of girlfriends that I thought were my closest girlfriends. Just because I either saw them or spoke to them on a daily basis.

600
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:06.330
Lauren Kelly: They usually had to do with paid you have any pills AG or I can get pills you know them, helping me get those me helping them get

601
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:16.350
Lauren Kelly: And as I've gotten clean. Guess who never calls me anymore. You know, and I mean, guess who wants nothing to do with because who, like, you know, has no need for my friendship anymore and

602
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:23.130
Lauren Kelly: And those are friendships. I'm not sad about losing because what am I really losing here I'm losing someone who's going to manipulate me if I to me.

603
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:30.930
Lauren Kelly: You know, just this completely one sided friendship like obviously when I was on drugs. I convinced myself. These people are friends, but I mean it was within

604
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.880
Lauren Kelly: One or two that I realized it didn't even take like a month it was immediately but I realized

605
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:42.690
Lauren Kelly: Those people that have no need for me anymore and and they would get a couple times. I wouldn't talk to them, they would make comments like, you know,

606
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:51.120
Lauren Kelly: Cool. You know, how are you doing with the Suboxone or whatever. And I think, you know, great. It's changed my life. Like, you should really look into it like I have this awesome therapist and

607
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.830
Lauren Kelly: I love my doctors and you know this is, I mean, I don't even think like I never thought

608
01:02:56.130 --> 01:03:02.280
Lauren Kelly: I would get that thing out of my head, where the first thing I woke up in the morning, all I thought about was darcos like I thought, even if I got thing that would always be my head.

609
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:09.570
Lauren Kelly: That's not even in my head anymore. You know, there's days I get till 10 o'clock at night and I realized I haven't even taken my soapbox and yet you know and I mean because it's not

610
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.550
Lauren Kelly: Like I don't have the payment. I don't think about until I tell them, like, think of having control of your life back. Like, think of how valuable that is in

611
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.490
Lauren Kelly: And their comment will be like it's almost like

612
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:31.830
Lauren Kelly: They're angry that I'm doing well with it and then it's like, well, you know, if, like, if you did mess up like you know I wouldn't judge you, and it'd be okay. So it's almost like nerd instead of encouraging. Wow, that's great. You're doing so well.

613
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:37.980
Lauren Kelly: Like going forward. It's like will you know if you do take 20 million says sec. I'll be here for you, you know,

614
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.450
Lauren Kelly: Something there'll be here for

615
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:53.040
Lauren Kelly: The setback, but not for like the comeback you know really what you know. So it was really easy for me to say like, I'm not losing any value here, you know, like these are people care about me. These are people want to watch myself. Yeah.

616
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.770
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, so those those friendships have been like an easy like cool. I'm good. You know what I mean, wash my hands for that, but it's it's the self stuff and I'm happy. Yeah.

617
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.720
Lauren Kelly: The hardest time with and

618
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:07.920
Lauren Kelly: I don't know.

619
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:13.230
Lauren Kelly: What to do that, but I think you're right. Like, you know, a you made this comment.

620
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:20.100
Lauren Kelly: It was, you know, over a month ago, I was like, wow, and it will be. We're having a conversation about my guilt and all that. And you were seeing like

621
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:27.240
Lauren Kelly: The fact that I show it to group the fact that, like I got my teeth pics that I was doing like that my eyebrows, like all those different little things like

622
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:40.620
Lauren Kelly: It, whether I want to admit it or not, like, if I didn't love myself and I thought I was just a piece of crap and whatever. Like I wouldn't be doing those steps, you know, so maybe my subconscious like feels better about myself and my conscious mind does, but

623
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:46.920
Lauren Kelly: When I think about like how I feel about myself, it's just they're ugly cops. You know, I didn't mean there.

624
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:54.810
Lauren Kelly: And I mean, I can't remember a time in my life that I've ever felt a good thought about myself that I ever thought like

625
01:04:55.410 --> 01:05:04.860
Lauren Kelly: I was a good friend. I never thought I was a good girlfriend that I ever thought was a good daughter or sister or you know that i don't know i just think

626
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:16.770
Lauren Kelly: Just really ugly. It's whenever I enter so I try not to think anything about myself and just kind of focus on the task at hand that day or, you know, things I need to do. But that something will happen that just reminds me

627
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:22.350
Lauren Kelly: Of the mistakes in my past. And I just, I just fall apart. And I can't pull myself out of it.

628
01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:34.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So a piece of this, you know, is that's part of what the work you know part of working the steps is for two is being able to clear your closet.

629
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to own your past behaviors and learning to forgive yourself. Yeah, and it is a process. It's not something that happens. I mean,

630
01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're in a relationship with somebody and you're hurt. It takes time to to forgive to build forgiveness. Right. It's something that you have to work on.

631
01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every day to saying, Oh, that is in the past. I don't have to think about that right now. It's over and apologize. You know, you go through that that

632
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: monologue in your head when it comes to forgiving somebody else, you have to do the same thing with forgiving yourself.

633
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:33.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you've been dealing with this for so many years, you know, so many years that it is a learned behavior, a learned thought process. And so, step by step, with every thought that you're not worthy that you deserve to be treated badly. You have to combat that.

634
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:37.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to, you have to change that inside your head.

635
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:38.910
Lauren Kelly: And how do I do that.

636
01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:45.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thought at a time. Just like staying sober one day at a time. Sometimes one minute at a time.

637
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, seriously, it's the same with your thought process. And here's a little trick that I learned to

638
01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That little girl.

639
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you were

640
01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was hurt.

641
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are things that she didn't get when she was a little girl when she was that age.

642
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.510
Lauren Kelly: There's a lot. Yeah.

643
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so really, when you are finding yourself in a emotionally stressed state and it's about those things are directly connected to that little girl.

644
01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to give yourself permission to go back and to give that little girl what she needs whether it be a hug, whether it be consoling and let her know that the things that she were taught was taught was not right.

645
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's about really meditating, but sitting in that space and connecting with her and saying, you know, I'm here. You know, I've learned a lot.

646
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:57.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love you. You're perfect. There's nothing wrong with you and you have to go back and tell that little girl that

647
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those things that she that she needs to hear that she needed to hear that she needed to feel loved, she needed to know that she wasn't the family's demise into heaven. She needs to know that she is okay and secure.

648
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

649
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.010
Lauren Kelly: It does. I have a really hard time with

650
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:34.860
Lauren Kelly: With meditating, because when I tried to do. I've always been this like million awesome minute person. So whenever I try to do it on my projects to go to like I try, I try, I try for a few minutes and then all of a sudden, I'm planning dinner tonight and I'm going over the list of

651
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:48.120
Lauren Kelly: With laundry load needs to be done and you know when I just I've literally I've tried a bunch of times and I've never been six within five minutes I'm, I'm just on to what needs to get done and I, I have a really hard time doing that so

652
01:08:48.930 --> 01:09:01.170
Lauren Kelly: Um, I don't know if it's just like, I need to practice more what I need to do, but um yeah i mean i mean it does make sense because Yeah, lots of times. Like you feel like that.

653
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:12.750
Lauren Kelly: Vulnerable little girl like you said, um, you know, comes out in me a lot, and I find myself doing insane things because of like

654
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:19.740
Lauren Kelly: The lessons or the lack thereof, that, you know, I was taught you know at that time of like being

655
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:28.080
Lauren Kelly: Worthless and being on you know the problem in the field and everybody would be so much, you know, I was like suicidal at 12 years. You know what I mean like I

656
01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:37.170
Lauren Kelly: I attempted multiple times in like, you know, like 12 like for a little kid. So want to try to kill themselves. You know what I mean like it you know

657
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:44.610
Lauren Kelly: And that blows my mind now and I think about it because like I i haven't attempted, you know, since I was like, well, you know, and to know

658
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:54.240
Lauren Kelly: That I was in such a dark place of, like, there'll be so much better. That was the message. I mean, I, it wasn't the message I got, I was told that they were so much better off without me and like

659
01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:06.570
Lauren Kelly: That you know I made them look bad at church if it was just my mom, my dad, and my perfect brother, you know, they would be perfect but I make them look bad. I you know ruin the family name. I'm the reason they're not going to get into heaven. So, you know,

660
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:11.760
Lauren Kelly: The message is, you know, if you weren't here, we would be a lot happier and you'd be better.

661
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:28.500
Lauren Kelly: I like, I don't think that's ever left no matter how are you know and so then when I screw up something in my adult life like my relationship or friendship or just anything. It's like, I go back to that thought of, like everybody you know and

662
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because everything you know

663
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it with every hurt it confirms what you were told, when you were a child.

664
01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.260
Lauren Kelly: Yeah yeah

665
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it's like what, there it is.

666
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly what you know exactly what I was told. This is exactly what they were talking about. I'm not worth it. What, you know, why am I even trying. And you go right into that negative headspace and stay there and there is your spiral down

667
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:52.620
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, right.

668
01:10:53.580 --> 01:11:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you get in that emotional state and you feel that stuff coming up really in your head. Visualize you as a little girl being told.

669
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What she was told, and you walk up to her and you love her and you tell her it's lies don't believe anything that you're told you're a good person. You deserve to be loved, you're needed and you're wanted in this world and you have to repeatedly repetitively tell her that

670
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because eventually you'll feel the calmness internally when you do that.

671
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It makes it just makes a difference. And I'll tell you, I know that from my own experience.

672
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:57.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so when you start getting down on yourself and saying, Yeah, but I did this wrong. You've got to combat that and say, Yeah, but I did this, right. You have to Lauren your perfect Lauren, you have to understand that that there's good in you. You're not a bad person.

673
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:03.870
Lauren Kelly: That lays girl, and he said told me it was like nothing good I ever did would matter because of all the bad you know

674
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.760
Lauren Kelly: I hear that every day.

675
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:16.620
Lauren Kelly: I had, you know, every, every time I screw up or think about the screw ups. I've done and like, yeah, I just like more than a day when I think about, like, I've heard all you know like I just

676
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's. Listen, there's a book that's called the child within

677
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is what it's called. And

678
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I went through this therapy.

679
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mine was a little baby.

680
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Little baby that was thrown away.

681
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I had to literally sit there and go back and Iraq, the baby and love the baby and the more at first I thought this is stupid. Why am I do. Oh my god, you know, the more that I did it the better I FELT INSIDE about who I was becoming who I wanted to be. And what I had to offer this world.

682
01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

683
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did I lose you.

684
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you there, Lauren, Miss Lauren

685
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.450

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I lost her soon as she comes back all push report again.

688
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:54.240
Lauren Kelly: I'm sorry, I just shut off out of nowhere. My whole tablet just turned off. I don't know. I tried after we got off the call. Last week I tried updating everything. And so I was hoping that wouldn't happen. I don't know what I'm sorry.

689
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay, I want to show. I want to show you something. See if I can give it

690
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. You see what I'm saying.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:12.510
Lauren Kelly: I'm yeah that yeah this TED talks in

692
01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:16.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so here's the book that I was talking about the child within

693
01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Okay.

694
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Discovery and recovery.

695
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Discovering the child within

696
01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:37.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is, this is what you do what you, what do you say to your inner child acknowledging the inner child means treating him or her with respect and love.

697
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do do so by saying when you are in there. When you're connected with your inner child. I love you, I hear you. I'm sorry. You feel this way. Thank you for being you all positive self soothing things that you can tell that little girl.

698
01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then here look inner child work might take the form of dialogue and talking with your inner child journaling from your inner Child's voice.

699
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In other words, going back and thinking about what that little girl felt when she was being told these things.

700
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And talking with the therapist from the inner child's perspective which you really have told me that things that you have

701
01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You experienced and at what age and the spiral of it all. So, you know, you're doing that, meditating to feel in touch with your inner child, you can work with a pillow or a stuffed toy or you can do it just inside your head.

702
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just by talking to her, you know, telling her you're okay. I know you're 10 the person that is supposed to be protecting you is the one that's telling you these and there lies.

703
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to just start combating those

704
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.580
Thoughts

705
01:15:51.810 --> 01:16:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, that there are different. This is the book, but there are different TED Talks TED Talks amazing if you ask me. Yeah.

706
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:02.670
Lauren Kelly: I watch those

707
01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so look at there are several of them that you can go in and you can you can listen to and this one right here I think is a how to every four seconds. You know what I mean, they don't take very much time. They're not hours of it.

708
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:22.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just a little bit of self you know affirmation for you that can help you on this in this process.

709
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wanted to point something out.

710
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right here. Here 15 self love tips you can try today discover how to love yourself and be confident. I don't know if this is surprised yourself.

711
01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But okay, learning how to love yourself by saying no to others.

712
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So by saying, you know, know Nico.

713
01:16:49.380 --> 01:17:01.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Obviously. You're not my friend and I don't need to end my life, our relationship isn't what I thought it was. You're actually putting love into yourself by doing that. Yeah, you're saying I matter.

714
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:16.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So even though you still have that internal dialogue that tells you you don't you're acting as if and behaving in a manner that is congruent with learning how to forgive and love and heal yourself.

715
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense. Yeah.

716
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:26.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're all you're doing it. You're well on your way. You've got to know that.

717
01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:42.240

718
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Psychology Today deep secrets in the inner child. See, there's three of them right here that I can point out

719
01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:50.460
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

720
01:17:51.030 --> 01:18:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see, and there are several more and it's about continually putting that positive affirmation in your head continually talking about it continually loving that little girl.

721
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.800
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, because nobody did when I hated a oh

722
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:08.760
Yeah.

723
01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:15.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so now you've got to go back and give her what she needs. And I'm telling you, you're going to feel so much better.

724
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So much better.

725
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:27.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just by going back and saying, Hey, you know, the people that that should have loved you and taking care of you and cherish do as a little girl.

726
01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:36.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They didn't so much they did the best job they could do or what they thought they can do you can give them that credit, but the same sin.

727
01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.700
Lauren Kelly: I don't know if I can give them that credit

728
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.240
Lauren Kelly: I think you know better than to to like

729
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:55.890
Lauren Kelly: Tell your child, they're worthless and to tell them to like jump out of a moving vehicle while you're driving 90 miles an hour, then to you know i think i think i think they knew better, I think. Yeah, I don't think I can say that they

730
01:18:56.610 --> 01:19:03.510
Lauren Kelly: I think they knew what they were doing, at least to some degree. There's no way they thought that that was, you know,

731
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and there's a piece of it that says that

732
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I hear is that she you know your mom was probably agree had things of our own that she hadn't dealt with and here's Lauren

733
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, this little girl and she took the blood. END OF THE THINGS THAT YOUR MOM WENT THROUGH.

734
01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because think about it. I don't know her parents, but you know what was the behavior that she had to endure from her parents when she was growing up was this you know how they treated her

735
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's a possibility. Yeah, you know, and so not really knowing that aspect or being there for when she was younger. What created this whole you know dynamic in her head.

736
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I do know for a fact is that it wasn't Lauren

737
01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what you've got to to get to that point and get to that place. You know where you realize that you are not the problem, you were a little girl.

738
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you had no control your life is in the hands of people that said things to you that were horrified that no little girl should ever have to hear ever

739
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:30.690
Lauren Kelly: And I can, I guess I can accept that and like work on that. But then, like, how do I connect that to the horrible decisions. I mean, as an adult, like those things I'm completely responsible for and like, why couldn't I have turned like

740
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:48.060
Lauren Kelly: You know those native experiences as a kid to like being really successful in doing good things and in my adult life, like what, why did I have Twitter. It's just been such a fuck up and running everything and like there's no excuse for that you know like

741
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want you to think about what you just said. And think about what I just said to you, this is a pattern that has been developed in your head, since you were a little girl.

742
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This isn't something that just all of a sudden when you started using drugs was there. It was already there. The seed was planted and grew when you were young.

743
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:21.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So why would you think that you deserve to anything but crap. Why would you, you know, why would you expect anything good to come into your life. You've been told your whole life that you're worthless.

744
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why would you

745
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You weren't given those tools to do something different, Lauren.

746
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:31.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You weren't, you know, the prize, brother.

747
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are Lauren

748
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about that. That's why. And I'm not giving you an excuse or an opt out of, you know, anything I'm saying that it's a core issue. Yeah. Underneath at all. That's a core issue.

749
01:21:51.180 --> 01:22:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what needs to be dug out and healed because when you start healing that stuff from back then you start feeling better about who you are and what you're doing. You're becoming the girl, the woman that you should have always become

750
01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:18.390
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I guess, ages when it comes to like traumatic stuff for me. Like when I went through like a really abusive relationship where like, I almost died a couple of times. Like at his hands like

751
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:26.850
Lauren Kelly: I had friends tell me like you need to go to therapy for that, like, you'll never have a healthy relationship with the man until you deal with that. And my thought on that was like

752
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:34.440
Lauren Kelly: I barely survived it the first time, the last thing I want to do is because I relived things when I talk about that I

753
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can't

754
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:42.630
Lauren Kelly: Just like talk about them and not have the emotion like go there to where I am there in my hair you know and and

755
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.030
Lauren Kelly: It then all of a sudden, I'm having nightmares about it and it's it, you know, and

756
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.060
Lauren Kelly: It's, it's, I don't know if it's easier or better for me to like not talk about that stuff, but like

757
01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:06.420
Lauren Kelly: I but the child said, I feel like I barely like survived it like, you know, I was a little girl like taking a bunch of pills, doing whatever I could to just try to end it. You know what I mean. And and and

758
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:25.890
Lauren Kelly: I know I just, I'm almost scared to revisit all that because I get in such a dark place. And I've been working so hard to get out in that dark place in the focus on the positive stuff into, like, just go back and focus on all that, like, super dramatic stuff and it scares me.

759
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, well of course it does. But you remember this that you and I, we talked about you getting engaged with em Dr therapy, you told me that you weren't ready I agreed. You were absolutely not ready and

760
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.070
Lauren Kelly: You might not your therapy. Again, what was that

761
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Em, Dr.

762
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:43.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oz. I'm it

763
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:50.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Em, Dr. Okay movement record record. I can't say the last two more.

764
01:23:51.360 --> 01:24:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But em dark end or therapy. It really takes you back to the to the event and D tangles the emotions around the event.

765
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And allows for healing, because the way it sits right now right with the things that you're experienced as a child with the abusive relationships, you know, all of the trauma that you've experienced it sits there, think about

766
01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think of it like a volcano inside your chest. Okay, so you've got compacted trauma impacted trauma can practice trauma and when

767
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: These memories and thoughts and emotions come out. There's a little release and then they settle back down and everything is good for a little bit, something happens catastrophic thinking, you know,

768
01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Happens and then boom, it's up again a little bit of release. So every time that you go through this. You're just releasing a little bit out of that volcano out of that volcano, you got to go in there and with a shovel.

769
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've got to, you know, say, I'm tired of these things.

770
01:24:55.020 --> 01:25:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Only me I am better than these things. I am not that person. I didn't deserve that. And you've got to start digging in and healing from that stuff.

771
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:12.990
Lauren Kelly: But what if I still believe all those things that you just said to say I'm not that person. I don't deserve this. What if I think I am not person. What if I think I do.

772
01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, because I i 100% don't think that you believe that in your core. Because if you really believed that in your core. You wouldn't be doing all these good things that you're doing for yourself right now.

773
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:39.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You. I think that yes, you have a huge attachment to that stuff in the past. And that is a direct effect. So you're thinking about yourself.

774
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But your behaviors are showing something different, your behaviors are saying

775
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can matter.

776
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can treat myself better I can be with in a healthy relationship and be with somebody that will not hurt me.

777
01:25:57.390 --> 01:26:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean by acting in that manner. It's like totally combating what you were taught as a kid.

778
01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are worthy and you will start to believe that you are, you're already acting as if you're beginning to believe that you are

779
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But again, it's like learning how to be transparent, learning how to, you know, tell the truth, all the time, even when you make a mistake, being able to say, well, stop.

780
01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

781
01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that was a process to

782
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to learn how to do these things before you get good at them. Yeah, you know. Yeah.

783
01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:46.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of times people in recovery don't even start this process and you know until they're six months to a year in recovery and still can't figure out why.

784
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:55.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they feel miserable about themselves, or why they, you know, have done all this work, but yet there's still something in there that's not making them okay with them.

785
01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why, because you still have strings attached to that little girl, you always have strings attached. That little girl. But right now, they're painful strings. Yeah. What you want to do is is revive her, give her life. Give her love.

786
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The things that she wasn't getting when she was, you know, when in that day. Give her those things that she desperately means because what that does is fill those voids within you. The adult Lauren the adult Lauren feels the effects to

787
01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's relieving yeah that makes sense.

788
01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:39.570
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I'm just because even this conversation like I'm sad. I'm sad now and like I

789
01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:45.690
Lauren Kelly: But I'm I'm scared of delving into this stuff, you know,

790
01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.760
Lauren Kelly: And like not being okay you know

791
01:27:51.240 --> 01:28:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so instead of diving into all of it dive into the little girl just start giving her love. First thing, don't, don't do anything else, but just give her love. Give her hugs let her know, You here let her know that you're there, let her know that you know she is a good girl.

792
01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:21.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She deserves a good life, you have to start putting positivity into her head into your head. Yeah.

793
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The. And again, watching these TED Talks taking a little bit of time putting headphones in your head in your ear and just

794
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:45.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: being present with what you're hearing, the more that you hear those things. The more that you listen to what other people say, because you're not just going to hear it from one person, you're going to hear it from every, you know, every one that how to heal that little girl.

795
01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How to Make her feel better.

796
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:52.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're feeling put that positivity in there.

797
01:28:53.250 --> 01:29:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like a great understanding and trying to figure out, you know what and who Lauren is and why she responds and reacts to the way she does.

798
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:03.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's because of that little girl.

799
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

800
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's what we want to focus on the rest of it will come later. Later on, yeah. You know, you don't have to dive into the rest of it right now at all.

801
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just about going back and giving that little girl what she needs to start the process of healing.

802
01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:25.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you.

803
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense

804
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:29.670
It does.

805
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna watch a few TED talks.

806
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:37.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

807
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let me see, where is the this one I want you

808
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:51.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To

809
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Copy this for

810
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.780
Me see

811
01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here is the first one that we just looked at.

812
01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:32.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, and, again, is all you have to do in Google is healing the child within

813
01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that will bring up the book and I think it can even

814
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go back. I think you can kind of go through it a little bit. It's not a really big book or anything, but it definitely gives you

815
01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See there's previews.

816
01:30:51.720 --> 01:31:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't realize this is what it looks. Looks like I didn't realize what it meant. At first when I first started doing this work and

817
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:13.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When it was over with. I couldn't believe how good you know it made me feel. Yeah. So, and you can even the role of stress, the post traumatic stress disorder.

818
01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Parental conditions that tend to stifle the child within

819
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How can we heal or heal the child within beginning to deal with core issues.

820
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So these are the things right.

821
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Excuse me.

822
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you want to get you see this

823
01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.230
Lauren Kelly: It popped up that like you had sent me an email. But I can't see it. Oh.

824
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, all I'm like talking to you, like, you're still sharing my screen.

825
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.850
Lauren Kelly: I can't see that. Sorry.

826
01:31:54.390 --> 01:32:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you go to Google and you put in healing the Todd within you'll have you'll get this the book and then you'll, you'll say preview and then you can go in and take a look at some of the chapters and what they're on

827
01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And be able to kind of review it a little bit. Um,

828
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's the start of this healing process.

829
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:18.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to know that just the very start.

830
01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're getting, you know, you're getting you're sober life down pat.

831
01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're finding happiness.

832
01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

833
01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: have you and I ever came into a meeting together and you said no issues came up this week, a couple little tiny things but that's it.

834
01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing. Don't you think

835
01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:41.460
Yeah.

836
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:42.690
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

837
01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Part of that is because of what you're continually doing

838
01:32:46.920 --> 01:33:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And remember when when you refuse to give yourself time because you don't feel well, time to rest time to relax, you're depriving yourself of a basic self care need. By doing that, these are things that you need.

839
01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:19.080
Lauren Kelly: Hey, I guess I'm so like I spent so much time being selfish and just getting nothing done that, like it's just hard for me to wrap my brain around doing that now because I feel like every day needs to

840
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:28.140
Lauren Kelly: Make Up For so much of the time that I lost you know an everyday needs to have something huge accomplished or

841
01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:40.320
Lauren Kelly: Or it's almost like I feel like I'm living as an addict again because the old attic or would make. I used to always make an excuse for why I want to do something today. Oh, I could do that tomorrow, I can do that next week, I can do that.

842
01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:48.060
Lauren Kelly: You know later. And I tried to kind of flip that mindset of, like, why can't I do this now, you know, and so even if I'm feeling like crap or

843
01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:56.760
Lauren Kelly: You know something's going on, like, I don't give myself that like credit or that room to be like okay with Hey I just feel like crafted and that's okay. It's like

844
01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:09.030
Lauren Kelly: Well, who cares if you feel like crap you didn't feel like crap and you laid around and got nothing done for years. So you don't have time to feel like crap. Now you push through it and get over it and get it done and get together, you know,

845
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:26.850
Lauren Kelly: And it's just this constant like pressure and guilt and if I don't get so much that I just feel so guilty about it and I feel like I'm going to let Paul down. I feel like I'm gonna let myself down. I just, it's nothing. He's putting on me. It's something I'm putting on myself, you know,

846
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:29.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me that you just didn't sound like your mom.

847
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:36.480
Lauren Kelly: I mean, yeah, maybe a little bit. Yeah.

848
01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the first thing that came inside my head was she sounds like your mom. These are the things that your mom was telling you

849
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:53.760
Lauren Kelly: Yeah yeah yeah I hear her in my head all the time.

850
01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:07.680
Lauren Kelly: And the negative shit, it will the, I guess. There isn't really anything positive ever so I'm just the constant like negative self talk is that i mean they're almost always verbatim things

851
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:08.730
Lauren Kelly: That she said to me.

852
01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:17.040
Lauren Kelly: You know that I just, you know, the it nothing good you ever do will matter because of everything bad you die here that 100 times a day, you know,

853
01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:28.590
Lauren Kelly: In it. So yeah, I guess, I guess I do that a lot, and I don't realize what I'm doing now, I must own them as my own, you know, and I think I put there, but they are you know

854
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:29.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're not

855
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because if they if if to your core Warren, you're really, really honestly believe there's a piece of you and I bet you tend to one. It's that little girl.

856
01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is really helping you act in a manner that you do care for yourself because she wants to heal to, you know, she does.

857
01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And knowing that knowing that the things that you're that you are repeating in your head negative about yourself or things that you were repetitively told when you were a kid.

858
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:10.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They are lies just like your disease when it starts talking to you. And there's another key that I want you to know that the longer that you stay in that negative thought process.

859
01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:24.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more chances your addiction, has to grab ahold of you and make you bad yeah you so by breaking that chain by healing from that stuff you loosen your addictions control.

860
01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

861
01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've done everything that exactly the way that you should have you're on top of your game, you're doing things like you're supposed to, you know, you're sober.

862
01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:43.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All these things that you've changed. You've got the, you've got to to recognize the good that you've done.

863
01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.040
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, Friday was my 90 days.

864
01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:53.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's fine. Happy birthday. I know it just is amazing 90 days. Can you believe that

865
01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:55.500
Lauren Kelly: I really can't really can't.

866
01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I also want you to realize that you used for eight years you've been miserable since you were a baby, since you were young. Yeah.

867
01:37:04.710 --> 01:37:14.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is time, it is time Lauren to find what you're happy looks like and go for it 100% without fear.

868
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, without fear. It is time because you have the rest of your life to live. Yeah, the rest of your life. This was a moment in time, and it's gone.

869
01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That chapter is closed, you were, you were doing exactly what you should be doing to get free and to live a life of sobriety and a life of happiness. Yeah, you're on the right path.

870
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've got more time ahead of you. Thank God, then you do behind you.

871
01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:47.130
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

872
01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:48.900
Lauren Kelly: You know, yeah.

873
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:50.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember that.

874
01:37:52.710 --> 01:37:57.510
Lauren Kelly: Right. I just feel like it's just so much timeless last. It's just so hard to make worry and

875
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god. Quit trying to make up for for a book that's already written and start writing the next chapter in your life.

876
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Start looking forward to what's coming, the good that you can do with yourself with your relationship for others and you're recovering

877
01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:19.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've gotta quit sitting in the past and start focusing on your future.

878
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get a

879
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.440
Lauren Kelly: Voice in me that's like, it wouldn't be like honoring the people are respecting the people that I heard if I didn't

880
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:40.020
Lauren Kelly: Feel like crap about it and I didn't finish like like I can't just be like, Okay, well, that's the past, you wouldn't like no I hurt people. And, and, like, That's never going to be okay. You know, and

881
01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then that's never going to be okay. But is it really okay that you're hurting yourself to because you're still hurting people.

882
01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's hurting you.

883
01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:55.350
Lauren Kelly: What I that's, you know, for the longest time you when you're using. You don't take accountability. You don't even stop and think.

884
01:38:55.650 --> 01:39:05.550
Lauren Kelly: How you're hurting people. So yeah, now's my time that stop and feel like crap and think about how I've heard people, you know, I feel like that's, that's, you know, I did the crime. I've got to do the time now, you know,

885
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, when do you think your prison sentence might be over with, because we have time to live.

886
01:39:10.170 --> 01:39:10.650
Never

887
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not true.

888
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is absolutely not true.

889
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:28.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've been in prison for. Let's see, since you were 10 that I know for a fact. Yeah, you know. So now it's time for freedom.

890
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now it's time to change that thought process.

891
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:36.420
Lauren Kelly: I just still don't feel like I deserve that I still feel like I have a lot of

892
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:40.530
Lauren Kelly: Press price to pay. And a lot of times, you know,

893
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, my hope through this process for you watching videos for you, learning how to do things like you're doing and will help alleviate that a little bit more

894
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, as time goes on.

895
01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just takes time. It does. You've had this thought process ingrained within you. We've got to now pour some, you know, recovery on it and yank those out.

896
01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean and replant some some good seeds some happy seeds because you deserve it more than, you know, most people, you know, lived a life of. I can't even imagine you know I can't imagine being a 10 year old girl.

897
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And having your parents.

898
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Throw that kind of responsibility on you. It's just not fair. And it's a falsity because I don't know about you, but my higher power. He doesn't work that way.

899
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:40.350
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

900
01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:40.980
It doesn't

901
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.720
You know,

902
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I want you to think about that too, you know.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:50.370
Lauren Kelly: Really try

904
01:40:51.480 --> 01:41:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're going to watch your videos right you're going to take a look at the book that I suggested you to look at. Try to find it to where you don't have to

905
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, buy it but you can review it and you know what I mean. Pay attention to some of the things, and you'll learn so much about yourself.

906
01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll learn so much about your thought process and why you think the way you do. Why that catastrophic catastrophic thinking happens. Yeah. Why that internal dialogue goes continually

907
01:41:22.530 --> 01:41:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, you'll learn those things and then when they start happening. You'll say, Oh, I know what this is.

908
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and you'll be able to to stop it from taking you back down that that rabbit hole that you're trying so desperately to get out of

909
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:58.950
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I just gotta like you said before about like the running thing like that road isn't page. Yeah, I've gotta like hate that road, you know, because the road of like taking. It's all my fault. And I deserve to like beat myself up rapper about it is this move that I know you know

910
01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:04.560
Lauren Kelly: Really like work on the road, I don't know, and building that

911
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where you're doing a really good job. I want to tell you that one shell one dirt shovel at a time, you know, you're doing it.

912
01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to give yourself credit for the for the good things that you're doing. You have to. You gotta go love that little girl. Yeah, you know, yeah, just start, start there.

913
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just start there, you know, and when you when you find yourself not feeling well.

914
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay attention.

915
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:47.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, give your body, mind, spirit, give it what it needs. If it needs to sit down and rest.

916
01:42:49.050 --> 01:43:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to give yourself permission to do that. That is quality good self care and that's how your body heals. That's how it your immune system stays up. That's how it fights infection, you know, is by giving it what it needs. Yeah, right.

917
01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

918
01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.200
It does.

919
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got some homework.

920
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.280
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, definitely.

921
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, just listen to what those videos. Say listen to what they're telling you, you might not believe it and that's okay. But the more we talk about it, the more that we start changing that internal dialogue that's been created.

922
01:43:32.190 --> 01:43:35.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The better you'll start feeling. Yeah, yeah.

923
