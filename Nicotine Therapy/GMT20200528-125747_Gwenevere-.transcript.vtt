Gabriel L.: So I'm running a little late today.

3
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sometimes that happens with these morons early morning hours.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.620
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

5
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.930

Good.

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I had a second to look over our last note and we were constructing the alcohol use.

8
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Be constructing

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The slip

10
00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How has this week, then tell me about went ahead and kept using or kept blinking or mindset. I'm on point, like we've been in there.

11
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.550
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I kind of had a chance to

12
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500
Gabriel L.: Go over how everything is everything is gone and

13
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.760
Gabriel L.: I hung out with Ashley's family.

14
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.650
Gabriel L.: And

15
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.310
Gabriel L.: We went to Oklahoma City.

16
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.760
Gabriel L.: For a little bit for like a couple days.

17
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.770
Gabriel L.: After her

18
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.570
Gabriel L.: And her family was leaving, so we just went with him to hang out a little

19
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.440
Okay.

20
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.440
Gabriel L.: That's pretty cool.

21
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's a story and it's not quite the answer to my question, but I like it.

22
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.110
Okay.

23
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.630
Gabriel L.: Um, yeah, it's it things have been going well. Things are going to like talk to them. Yeah. I talked to, I talked to him and my family about

24
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.220
Gabriel L.: You know what's been going on and

25
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.720
Gabriel L.: I told her I told Ashley. When I say finally guess I just mean actually

26
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.280
Gabriel L.: I told Ashley that

27
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.890
Gabriel L.: That I shared my relapse with you that she was happy with the she said the Julia said, Yeah.

28
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.950
Gabriel L.: You know, felt really good to tell somebody.

29
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so that didn't actually create an argument. So there's something there that she likes

30
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.060
Gabriel L.: When you do. Okay.

31
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And does she interpret that as an investment in your recovery when when you tell your treatment provider that you had a slip

32
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.500
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I guess.

33
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.940
Gabriel L.: I didn't, I don't know, I just

34
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.830
Gabriel L.: I just told her.

35
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.550
Gabriel L.: What she asked me how I feel. Usually after our meeting.

36
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.130
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I said, I feel good. And I told her I told her what happened.

37
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.030
Gabriel L.: She seemed a bit surprised.

38
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.380
Gabriel L.: But if again. So let her know to

39
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm having to not have to keep things to the self and we don't maybe call it lying, but we call it omitting

40
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Belief to not have to be holding secrets, just like it's all out.

41
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about this notion of

42
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The people that were sending you tax and it was now is going through emails and uncle. I think any any shift in that

43
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.780
Gabriel L.: No.

44
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.270
Gabriel L.: Not at all.

45
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So how many shots or beers have you had in the last seven days.

46
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.420
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

47
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you accomplish that.

48
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we know you were busy with family.

49
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are they drinking around you.

50
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.740
Gabriel L.: Well, they don't drink.

51
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.910
Gabriel L.: Drink or brother doesn't

52
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.500
Gabriel L.: Nobody does.

53
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an interesting thing. So do you see that that when it's not a family gathering and there's not already beer. There is no right already there. Is it easier for you because it's those those visual cues. Aren't there to drink.

54
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.980
Gabriel L.: Really

55
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't make a difference. Well, how did you do it because you weren't weren't doing it before. How did you pull this off.

56
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.260
Gabriel L.: Well, we just

57
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.660
Gabriel L.: We just hung out. We went to a place called

58
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.230
Gabriel L.: Was a call Turner falls, we just say, busy, busy.

59
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.370
Gabriel L.: Busy, we went to a

60
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.470
Gabriel L.: There's a place in Amarillo that big Texas steakhouse, you're just

61
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.840
Gabriel L.: You know, just kept busy.

62
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Over there any places close that you are really had your heart set on

63
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.220
Gabriel L.: You know,

64
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.920
Gabriel L.: We went over there because because they're there.

65
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680
Gabriel L.: They like open up the restaurants already and you know done a lot of stuff like that.

66
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.650
Gabriel L.: Here in New Mexico. Still, I'm still experiencing the

67
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.440
Gabriel L.: Just the quarantine is

68
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

69
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So also over these last seven days. How many times were you and Ashley in an argument or voices were raised.

70
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.710
Gabriel L.: Oh, you got a big argument, all the way back.

71
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.050
Gabriel L.: From there,

72
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you, you didn't think oh we did you have a thought. I want a shot.

73
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.680
Gabriel L.: Oh yeah, I think that all the time.

74
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And Boy George

75
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the opposite thought. So you had. Oh, I could have a shot right now. What was the opposite. How did you counter it in your head.

76
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.830
Gabriel L.: I'm driving cross with my family.

77
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the tricky bit those. Yeah, that's true. But that's circumstantial like if you happen to have had the argument at a restaurant.

78
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.350
Gabriel L.: No, it wasn't. It wasn't really an argument.

79
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You try again. That was a convenient circumstantial construct or in a car driving

80
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The argument happen in a restaurant with a bar, how might that have been different, because you couldn't have us

81
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why it's not just looking around at my circumstances because that those will change, but you are the consistent thing.

82
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That brain of yours to counter it as fast as possible.

83
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.800
Gabriel L.: Yeah, here I'm you know I'm thought about the

84
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And this is at the core of what long term recovery will be like because wherever you are.

85
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about oh I can't do it. Now I can do it. Now I can do it. You know, I want to do it now. Look at this, look at this, can I can I can I

86
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it I'm not driving the car with the airlock, who now I can get away with it. Right. It's, it's, that's all circumstantial stuff. This has to do voice saying

87
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I feeling right now that I think alcohol.

88
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say alcohol. I need pills to just

89
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean any mood or anything. Yeah. So what am I feeling right now that that substance is a solution for this pure and simple go inward to see

90
00:07:45.570 --> 00:08:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in an argument with Ashley this frickin sucks. I want out of this feeling I feel helpless hopeless. I can't find a solution. Oh, I can drink. So we say feeling we go to that and say, My automatic thought is, and I want to

91
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Reach

92
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Out to myself.

93
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And the tricky bit is to take care of that actual core emotion.

94
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you are arguing

95
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally, when did you get back like I want to know how recent that that was

96
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.840
Gabriel L.: Day before yesterday evening.

97
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.090
Gabriel L.: Tuesday evening.

98
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're driving you're upset with each other you the only are you just use your proper

99
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.010
Gabriel L.: Oh, it's me, Ashley her grandma or brother, you

100
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: In the car.

101
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.490
Gabriel L.: It's a car.

102
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just saying because an argument. So how he could have gotten. I don't know how your family roles in an argument. Y'all yelling with everybody in the car.

103
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.500
Gabriel L.: Well, no, just kind of

104
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.410
Gabriel L.: Back and forth a little bit

105
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You called it a big one, so I thought maybe this, it got heated like yelling

106
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.980
Gabriel L.: Um, no. But we said summer for things

107
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's it like whispered in the front seat like you

108
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.130
Gabriel L.: type thing, because we were just like, right here next to each other.

109
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, she's

110
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.860
Over

111
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. So now let's do it now, as if we were back then. What was the emotion sitting here. She says hurtful things you hold on, let me just check them, what's up, dude.

112
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.600
You just work.

113
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

114
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.800
You

115
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.640
Gabriel L.: Probably a lot of anger and resentment.

116
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.040
Gabriel L.: Okay.

117
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now these are ones you're familiar with you spend a lot of time with these guys, anger and resentment, you

118
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, yeah. So oftentimes this is where the cognitive behavioral piece can be helpful, which is so we say, okay, I'm feeling anger and I resent

119
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is it resent something. It's only in the moment I resent that nasty remark, or is it I wasn't years and years of something. Is it something more than just this simple interaction, right there in the car. What's the big resentment, or is it just an in the moment, resentment.

120
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.390
Gabriel L.: I think it's a little both

121
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.340
Gabriel L.: Okay, both

122
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Little one

123
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: With the sub, she said.

124
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.690
Gabriel L.: What's up,

125
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the little resentment and then I'll go ask the big one.

126
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.990
Gabriel L.: Um, you know, just the way things are.

127
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.870
Gabriel L.: The way I can't voice my opinion without getting

128
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.430
Gabriel L.: You know yelled at, I guess, for lack of a better term.

129
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is it a little bit. Can I have content, like you said, Let's go take I five. And she said,

130
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.420
That's a stupid idea.

131
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.690
Gabriel L.: I wanted, I wanted to leave sooner.

132
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.720
Gabriel L.: And I wanted to get back to work.

133
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:23.640
Gabriel L.: And she said, no, the gen seen her sister in a while. So we have to stay and I said, what's the big deal. We've been here for she's been in Mexico. We've been there. So why can't we leave, you know, when I asked.

134
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

135
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You mean can we pay attention to that content that's pretty pretty interesting stuff. I'm just curious how you said it. So if I'm her. How did you say I want to leave.

136
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:36.690
So,

137
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:45.720
Gabriel L.: What are we, what are we leaving Oklahoma City and she said Tuesday when I said, why can't we leave Monday morning.

138
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

139
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.120
Gabriel L.: And I said, she said, all because I want to spend time with my sister and I was like, what's the big deal. You spend time with your sister.

140
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.680
Gabriel L.: And then he got back to the one she sent to and she

141
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.580
Gabriel L.: hangs out with my family's there and what she's done stupid.

142
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so can I can I offer

143
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Some input right in between.

144
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.920
Gabriel L.: You two talking to each other. Mm hmm.

145
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

146
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going back to sort of fundamentals about why we

147
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Why asked for why we

148
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Get up when we don't get

149
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we have are motivated by anything

150
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hiring

151
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Let me tell you, myself, if you could have gone home.

152
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier like Monday.

153
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you have felt, do you think

154
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.670
Gabriel L.: I felt

155
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.980
Gabriel L.: Like her

156
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.490
Gabriel L.: Like, like my opinion matters.

157
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.570
Gabriel L.: You know,

158
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:07.860
Gabriel L.: We are actually argue back and forth because you know my opinions, like, Whatever she says goes like my opinion doesn't really matter.

159
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

160
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see

161
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're talking about

162
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

163
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were in Texas or Oklahoma. Sorry, where you

164
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch the feeling you were having while you were there.

165
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not your family. Family grew five. I'm fine.

166
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the reason sort of the emotion going on there.

167
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That you longed to have a different one and go home and work. What were you feeling when you were there right at the time when you said, hey, when it, when are we heading back

168
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.850
Gabriel L.: All that feeling when I asked that.

169
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's a key, a key one

170
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.750
Gabriel L.: I'm sure was feeling

171
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.370
Gabriel L.: Just

172
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.430
Gabriel L.: Let's brainstorm ago

173
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, now that see that I want to go home. That's a solution to something you were feeling so let's throw some out I'll brainstorm you come up with your own

174
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Like any mind. Cool. But that's the solution. I want to go home, you're, you're a grown man you know how to solve your own problems. Right, sure. Like, I want to go. But there's a reason you want to go wondering to yourself, why not I will stay longer.

175
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some going on. Yeah. So I saw some out your solution is I want to go home, you're something

176
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Left out lonely.

177
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Isolated

178
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.220
Gabriel L.: This probably born I was born, maybe

179
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:45.450
Gabriel L.: Board. Yeah, because we had already spent time with them. And, you know, after a while, I don't want to spend more time with her. She was on a leave

180
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt board. Yeah.

181
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:48.630
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

182
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We do sort of a philosophical thing you know in your heart of hearts, Lord of heart of hearts that you have a right to be bored.

183
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:00.930
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

184
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

185
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.870
Gabriel L.: Me too wars.

186
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you know what to do and you in your mind, you go, well, I have a solution calm early like working or maybe it really wasn't work. But you said it anyway. Hey, I can get back to work. And I think you get a lot of

187
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: work you do. Well, that was your. So notice that it was the feeling is, I'm bored.

188
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And wanted to feel heard and that your, your opinion on the fact you felt board, isn't it.

189
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Not an opinion.

190
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.280
Gabriel L.: You know, I just, I was just starting out, though, I want to go home or

191
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.920
Gabriel L.: Beautifully my own be my own stuff.

192
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I hear the way let's just assume that you to set pretty much just the way you told me, which is, hey, when we, when we go home.

193
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh so central to stay till Tuesday. Oh, I want to go on Monday. Oh, because I want to spend time with my sister. You spend enough time with your sister already, haven't you, okay. So notice that neither one of you in this scenario.

194
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: One another.

195
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were listening.

196
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like if the therapist was in the room, or one of you embodied it for a second. This is what might have happened.

197
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

198
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You want

199
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The same thing you want, which is she wants to have this good feeling. And she wants to be heard and understood. It's kind of weird, but right in the same moment that you're feeling not heard and understood

200
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: 99.9% of time. That's the same thing the other person is going through. So the tricky bit

201
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.260
Gabriel L.: Are the

202
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: fundamental things that I teach, which is

203
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember them on communication, the basics. See if we can remember

204
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.180
Gabriel L.: Listen.

205
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Super important

206
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I can go over it again. I just assumed pop quiz. Just to see though I'm not repeating myself and boring people

207
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. I feel

208
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.180
Gabriel L.: I feel

209
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So, watch how this is different. I'm just asking her what the plan is because that's how I did it before, but instead. This time I spoke Ashley, I'm feeling bored a little antsy

210
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you feel about leaving a little, maybe they were you thinking of, of going

211
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And she might say, let's assume she makes no change. Let's say she doesn't know about the I feel. And she says, No, we're, we're gonna leave on Tuesday was one was spend more time with my sister.

212
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now remember, you're the one with the new skills. Not only have I have I said I feel bored kind of kind of thinking maybe we could had a little earlier.

213
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I use the second skill which is

214
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you said listening.

215
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way for me to know that you're listening unless

216
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You say something back

217
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.490
Gabriel L.: Well, of course.

218
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

219
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.560
Gabriel L.: Of course,

220
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But not not but not a why question that's not listening. Listening is, I think, and this is a skill obviously is a zillion ways to listen. But one really cool way is we mirror back and we we say it like this. Oh, I see.

221
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Ashley. You want to stay till Tuesday, because you want

222
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Then guess what she feels heard and understood

223
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now watch would be lovely. If you both were doing this still have I feel to the core feeling and and we can hear.

224
00:18:53.970 --> 00:19:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything, because when you're just doing it on your united mean you might kind of feel like I'm doing it, but she's not showing that she's listening to me. What would be ideal that to you the sequence went like this.

225
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm bored. This is you.

226
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of bored can be like how maybe on Monday.

227
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She says,

228
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so you're

229
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of bored and whatnot out a little early did

230
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You say, yeah, I know you kind of probably enjoy spending time with your, your family, but I kind of a kind of stern getting antsy kind of want to work. And she said,

231
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get that.

232
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I really want to spend more time. I really miss her. And then you mirror

233
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so. Hmm. You haven't had quite enough time with your sister. You want to kind of hang out with me Tuesday.

234
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's two pieces.

235
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see how just that part will go into problem solving in a second. But do you just see right there. The two of you because you talked about. And in fact, that she knew how to say the I feel like sale. I feel I'm

236
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad. I miss my sister still really want another few more hours with her. I smell.

237
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That I might leave a bitter. You might be able to identify a feeling associated with wanting to linger and

238
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back. How do you think it might have talked to each other like that portion of it.

239
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.180
Gabriel L.: I feel like we talked to each other like that.

240
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see.

241
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You said when we, when are we going home.

242
00:20:52.740 --> 00:21:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: She said we're going to stay and you said why I want to why or something like that. What are we leaving. Why can't, why can't we have leave Monday morning. I want to spend time with my

243
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just why an explanation why explanation why no one says how they feel.

244
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.570
Gabriel L.: Oh, I see what you're

245
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So guess what we do we keep showing each other how we feel.

246
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: will pop up even bigger minds, really important. What is real important instead of

247
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually could say, I'm like crazy on Gabriel, I, I know you. And is there anything we can do here goes more to be more interesting.

248
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To spend time

249
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we got to the core emotion of it. The reason it's not just about

250
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

251
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, you still see them is the same.

252
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.730
Gabriel L.: I guess, not really because

253
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.920
Gabriel L.: You know that it doesn't leave a reason for why we say that way.

254
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're telling each other. Aren't we, because I've missed her very much

255
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'm bored. I'm sorry about that would be hearing with my work. My feelings and my concerns, and then there's we don't really have to ask why do we, because we're already sharing

256
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Shared our feelings which is the motivation when our feelings or emotion or more

257
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm bored. I'm hungry, I'm angry. I'm I'm lonely sad. I'm frustrated. I'm anxious. That's why I'm talking I'm solving

258
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to solve your boredom. She's trying to solve.

259
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what the feeling is a miss. Somebody lonely sad, or I don't know what it is.

260
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Happening.

261
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe she's excited to see her sister hang out with her sister, you know,

262
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

263
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.370
Gabriel L.: They were having a good time like us.

264
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But so, so here might be part of the issue of

265
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff. I know I've taught this before, but it didn't stick

266
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't stick, maybe because you're thinking you're already doing it.

267
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't try say

268
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't the same. Now I want you to imagine

269
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If it had been where you talked about your boredom and she talked about her.

270
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: She feel sad if she

271
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Might have gone that discussion.

272
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.590
Gabriel L.: I don't know, I think it would have gone the same

273
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.110
Gabriel L.: This is a stubborn person.

274
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:57.660
Gabriel L.: You know, she said in her way is that once you decided that we're leaving Tuesday. It's wondering when we left

275
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.180
Gabriel L.: That's, that's another reason why we get into arguments, because

276
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.280
Gabriel L.: If I disagree with her or something like that.

277
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you you right it's back to this, this sort of power that she has or this illusion that she has

278
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Rights.

279
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To decision.

280
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts.

281
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.490
Gabriel L.: I'm sorry you're cutting out

282
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To try to get them.

283
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.380
Gabriel L.: Because it keeps doing it.

284
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.620
Gabriel L.: Now, what about her.

285
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This time it could be, it could be

286
00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Controlling controlling you.

287
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

288
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours away.

289
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.350
From

290
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:12.690
Gabriel L.: I'm sorry.

291
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, how many hours away.

292
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.130
Gabriel L.: Okay.

293
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours away, were you from the place in Oklahoma City.

294
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.670
Um,

295
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.820
Gabriel L.: We were about eight hours.

296
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

297
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:53.910
Gabriel L.: I'm

298
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like in this bottom

299
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.910
Gabriel L.: jump around.

300
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.770
Gabriel L.: And get a better connection.

301
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm gonna wait. Cuz that some

302
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of a bad connection.

303
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:05.790
Yeah.

304
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna look in

305
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, test, test, test, how are you doing

306
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think it might might have improvement there.

307
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.680
Gabriel L.: Eight hours from where she lives where her sister lives or sister Elizabeth

308
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

309
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

310
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel. Can you hear me.

311
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.440
Gabriel L.: I can hear well

312
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: When you just let's take away all of the conversation part I still think it needs some some discussion, but just take the this feeling of boredom.

313
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.710
Gabriel L.: And

314
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the first time I've heard from you that when you get bored. It can be

315
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: A trigger for years you're drinking or using. You don't want to be bored.

316
00:27:47.040 --> 00:28:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the only way to solve our boredom, let's think through what you could have done then and what you could do the next time boredom comes up, what could you have done or what did you end up doing to solve the boredom.

317
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:12.570
Gabriel L.: Oh, well, you know, I was just hanging out my nephew playing video games with skateboarding for a little bit, um,

318
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.330
Gabriel L.: rode a bike round.

319
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.170
Gabriel L.: Look at the city there wasn't. I mean,

320
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.990
Gabriel L.: I don't find something new.

321
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.210
And you did.

322
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.800
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

323
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So boredom is gonna come up again. We all get it.

324
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And the only solution that I have ever seen is kind of what you did. It means if I'm standing in line waiting at the motor vehicles.

325
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I find something interesting. And I'll analyze these people that I'm around

326
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All start thinking about something I haven't thought about for a while, but I, I am responsible for my boredom. I've got to solve it. And much like what you did play video games and went skateboarding you handled it.

327
00:28:59.250 --> 00:28:59.910
Gabriel L.: Huh.

328
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So I like I like what you said you took care of yourself.

329
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But the bigger piece that it's going to probably continue. It's been there. It's been a source of stress for you.

330
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Are the power differential between you and Ashley.

331
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any interest to have a couples therapy like two or three of them with her.

332
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.700
Yeah.

333
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.250
Gabriel L.: I'm that

334
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.170
Gabriel L.: Before

335
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now she here's how it could go. I'm going to tell you how oftentimes the spouse because I do it with a lot of my clients like just like this.

336
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll come in and I'll meet with them. It's an intervention. I'm not your couples therapist forevermore. But I am is I'm addressing because it's it's a primary stressor for you. Gabriel

337
00:29:51.090 --> 00:30:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling I think helpless. At times, almost like the victim I she's got this power. Michelle, take the keys, blah, blah, blah. With the lease. I can't. My say my opinion. My feelings of

338
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want our second always to hers 90, not always, but so that dynamic continues to show up over and over and over and I am concerned about your sobriety, you had

339
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't just one day you've had days you're you've been having those those shots and then pills and it got to the point where if they were around, you might have kept going. So I'm concerned.

340
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And as a therapist, I think, Well, I want to address the underlying emotions, the distress the cognitive distortions anything that's going on underneath so that alcohol and pills are not the best solution for you that you can remember and think of Oh snap, I can go to these other things.

341
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But the dynamics between you two concerns me

342
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.560
Gabriel L.: Yeah, it's a big issue.

343
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.920
Gabriel L.: Sometimes I'll just

344
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.550
Gabriel L.: entertain the thought that I'm leaving and

345
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.950
Gabriel L.: Building a new life and

346
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so just imagine that's the worst case right leaving this this this marriage. So just imagine

347
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That somewhere before. That is, listen, Ashley.

348
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I see a therapist. She's a marriage and family therapist. That's her formal training, she's been doing this for over 20 years she's interested in creating an opportunity for us to talk to each other about

349
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, or for us.

350
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now here's the thing. I will tell you, Gabriel, most people, most spouses and girlfriends or boyfriends. This is what they're thinking. I, my guess is Ashley will think this there is no way I'm talking to when she's on your side.

351
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's called a bias and she's right.

352
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I happened to be really good at being objective, so no one would actually see it, but I always announce it, I say, no matter what, I'm always going to be Gabriel's therapist.

353
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Rest of my life. That's it. Done Deal. Once I I signed on with you, forevermore. That's the case unless it's like when

354
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You anymore actually can work with you. You know what I mean, like, there's a real significant event that happens, it doesn't just

355
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Become this thing, it's, it's, for me, it's very intentional and deliberate. Everybody knows what's going on. So I say it out loud, and I say, you know what, yes. Ultimately, I want

356
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I want Gabriel's goals to be reached and and it seems like there's some tension between you two that just kind of keep showing up. And what I'd like to do today is teach the skills.

357
00:32:51.840 --> 00:33:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's what I say. Gabriel, I say, I'd like to teach some basic communication skills. I will teach skills. If you guys decide to not talk about any content.

358
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: meanie Gaga you guys could talk about fluffy stuff for all I care because it's about you guys having these skills because, wouldn't it be nice.

359
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If Ashley had the same I feel skills and mirroring skills. And what about validation. What about problem solving, wouldn't it be amazing if you two could talk to each other. Both of you using those skills.

360
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You would feel heard, she would feel heard, each person feeling respected.

361
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of you feeling like a one down position so often. So it would be me teaching

362
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I say. I say we, okay, you guys. You can either talk about big heavy stuff. That's your choice. I can handle it. But

363
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to be able to teach the skills so you can talk about. Listen, I like the toilet paper rolled under and you like it over and it's

364
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a know painful topic that you know an easy breezy or, you know, I like the plates, blah, blah, blah, blah. Something that's really neutral.

365
00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're nobody's getting pissed off. I say you can pick an easy breezy one or a fictitious one that's fine, just to learn the skill or if you want to seize this opportunity.

366
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go for it. You can talk about deeper ones we just won't be able to get as far into the to the skills, but I let you guys decide if if you feel safe enough to do it.

367
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But mostly, the first time is a neutral topic, something like you know who washes the car. This week, something that's not going to really get anybody in a in a ruffle.

368
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be a neutral topic for you to that you think you could use this content.

369
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.040
Gabriel L.: Maybe the the the

370
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.940
Gabriel L.: Place. We're moving to she likes talking about that.

371
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you like talking about it.

372
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.100
Gabriel L.: Why don't make them happy. So I thought,

373
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there's okay there's enough of a difference because what will happen is, she would say,

374
00:34:50.580 --> 00:35:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I feel happy talking about, you know, shopping and exploring and going on Zillow and Baba, Baba. And then you would say, oh, let me see if I understand this Ashley, you feel happy and excited when you get a chance to sort of shop and sort of fantasize about the house, you know,

375
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.600
Your house.

376
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be you mirroring and then you would do one. Okay, what would be what would be a kind of not a hot topic, but something that you could share how you feel.

377
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Not too hot.

378
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.110
Gabriel L.: Vacation. I like talking about places we have a vacation to

379
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, and then. So you would say, Hey Ashley. I like I like talking about all the different places. We can go, what would you feel excited when we talk about going to Peru and you know all the preparation for it and and she would say, so let me let me get this right. Gabriel

380
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't happy.

381
00:35:49.470 --> 00:36:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when we get to talk about crew and all the different mountains and all the different people and all the logistics of it and you say, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, now. So then you get those skills and then I would want to know.

382
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of tension topic, not a hot one not 100 if it's zero to 100 just an itty bitty, one that's like you kind of get that lawyer, not a big grow but a little one.

383
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.600
Gabriel L.: Just an irritation.

384
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't we're not creating this really intense moment but one where you can actually say, I feel anxious, a little irritated frustrated sad, lonely, something like that.

385
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Little

386
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:38.460
Gabriel L.: Um, once you leave my phone calls and that really bothers me.

387
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.400
Gabriel L.: Yeah, we're gonna privacy or I can't talk to, like,

388
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.380
Gabriel L.: My mother on a personal level, because she's screaming everything I say there.

389
00:36:46.770 --> 00:37:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so notice you catch yourself saying that really bothers me so that might be a little hot. See if there's a slightly less one maybe something around the house that she does that is only on the ear, not really bothers me. But just annoys

390
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.630
Gabriel L.: When I'm not listened to, when my when I know my opinion doesn't matter.

391
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.160
Gabriel L.: When I get a feeling that my opinion doesn't matter that bothers me.

392
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I know, but it isn't a little that's huge. You're so funny. Do you have any smaller rotations, like I hate that she leaves the hand tell on the counter.

393
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: One.

394
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.220
Gabriel L.: I don't think so. I think

395
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

396
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.700
Gabriel L.: Dear what I'm liking a little girl.

397
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I have seen that. Here's the neat thing if she goes for it. It does mean that she has to trust what you're saying that I'm a safe person that she can talk to in that she will not be attacked by me.

398
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the truth because on some level, she may know and

399
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Enjoy this power differential that she has over you.

400
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to be a scary person who might call her out on that. But that is not what I'm going to do it is only about helping her feel hurt. So if you want to sell this idea, this is how it goes. Hey Ashley. You know how sometimes you don't feel heard from me.

401
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And this might be a great way for you to actually be able to really feel heard, meeting whenever you're an eye for a couple interventions or just a meter was just to get a feel for it. She wants to teach these sort of fundamental communication skills, would you be up for it.

402
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it how it would be about helping her

403
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:34.410
Gabriel L.: Okay.

404
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.000
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

405
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd have to be generous Gabriel, you'd have to do the one you'd be the one mirroring and it would be for the purpose of helping her feel safe in here.

406
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You get that you already are safe. I mean, no. I know you still get like pissed off of me now. And again, but for the most part you you know

407
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, you know, I'm not going to cut you down. I'm not going to make funny. I'm not going to

408
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: come at you with with blame and shame and so she needs to have that feeling too, and she won't stay if we don't start with helping her feel heard, that's how this works because you already have me right

409
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got to get old on it. You're a salesman, you get this right.

410
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He feel safe. She'll talk

411
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If not, she'll be defensive all humans, all of us do that.

412
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to feel safe. Number one, nothing else can come before it.

413
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.540
Gabriel L.: I think she'll be up for it.

414
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:41.580
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

415
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.590
Gabriel L.: Like an understanding person, but I just whenever I challenged her opinion, it's, it's like she's always right.

416
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that's what

417
00:39:52.860 --> 00:40:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This structure puts constraints on the way people talk to it isn't just like well I think it did it. Now, it slows time town where normally we can have crammed in all kinds of back and forth statements justifying why we're right

418
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It slows time down to about two sentences. Doing it sits right there possibly for the whole hour and you've seen me do it with you too. I'll take something you said, and we'll just like pick it apart.

419
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just acting it to its at all.

420
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

421
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm excited. Now, here's my other question, so what you saw is you have enough sort of confidence that Ashley can can overcome maybe uncertainty and fear and that she might be able to learn these skills in here. What about your

422
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want to say, I don't know that it's pride or ego but need to be heard. Can you sit with me, starting with her first can you be the mirror and listener. First, or will it hurts your phone.

423
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.420
Gabriel L.: Yeah, yeah, this will work best. Yeah, of course. Oh.

424
00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I've stripped I'm pretty strategic about it, I do it very intentionally because you already. You're like, yeah, just talk to her. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool.

425
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tell her. But you already have that report with me. She is going to be like, is this lady Gwen going to attack me

426
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people are like that, they don't know, they don't have a read on anybody right when you first meet someone, do you wonder I'm thinking to be judgmental. I mean, right. So we want to create safety for girls.

427
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.250
Gabriel L.: Or

428
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You can set that aside for you then. So go for it. Anytime you let me know you can my texting is just dead I my phone is just worthless to me right now.

429
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I was in Albuquerque. The text everybody I blasted everybody for today's appointments and then i i don't know what anybody said back to me because I ain't got no reception.

430
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm really hard to get ahold of but I'm, I'm, do you have my my email to

431
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.720
Gabriel L.: You know, without a big, so you know, I don't think so.

432
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you take it down. I have a feeling because of your name Gabriel. My email is going to probably memorize really

433
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.690
Gabriel L.: Can

434
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You text you and I will do it. If for some reason, it actually goes through that would be groovy. I'll try.

435
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:15.750
Okay.

436
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's Gabriel at

437
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Bright heart health, no spaces com so bright heart at bright heart health com Gabriel at bright heart health. Want to see if this actually goes through over here in Santa Fe.

438
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.210
Gabriel L.: But you said here in Santa Fe right now.

439
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.720
Gabriel L.: That's cool. How are you liking it.

440
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm liking it.

441
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really

442
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:54.330
Gabriel L.: I like Santa Fe. I used to work in Santa Fe, a lot. Now go out there once a week. Oh yeah, I got

443
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so our text because Mine's blue. So it says, do you have an iPhone.

444
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. I think that's one of my text succeed because when people have an iphone eight they actually get delivered. Otherwise, I get this big red exclamation mark saying not delivered lady try

445
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, so. Okay, that's good. Hey, let me know if you guys want to meet. I'm, I'm really proud of you, though for for getting through that argument and not and not having a drink.

446
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.070
Gabriel L.: Yeah and you know it was funny, talking about, you know, actually, said the same things like I'm really, really proud of you.

447
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.730
Gabriel L.: Talking to whine about what happened.

448
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.180
Gabriel L.: Older. You know, I talked to somebody

449
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:46.320
Gabriel L.: So good forget to get that out, you know, because I felt a little bit of shame and guilt inside and sometimes I can say that anybody even Ashley, you know, like, oh,

450
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:47.760
Gabriel L.: I don't know.

451
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.570
Gabriel L.: Software like God, there's no

452
00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the same with the with the with the I can't remember whether they were Percocet, or hydro is that you picked up the other day.

453
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.690
Gabriel L.: Oh,

454
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the people in our

455
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah oxy yeah they might say, oh, what does this mean are you years. Is this going to be forever. You can use her so they can kind of blow it out of proportion.

456
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you use the term slip

457
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus or the word lapse instead of relapse and I know it may seem like a word game, but I like the distinction between a relapse would look like you would if you wouldn't be talking to me anymore. You'd say,

458
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Screw you, lady. I'm out.

459
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to talk like I tell her anything because you know you've already decided to stick with using. So a slip is when I asked you the other day, even though it was really hard to do.

460
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You told me the truth. And you told Ashley that gets you back on track. This is part of it for many people there are slips, but I kind of, not that I want people to have them, but they're so informative because we get to say

461
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you get to both be really impressed and proud of the progress you made, and every day.

462
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't really let 100% our guard down, we still need to be intentionally selecting and choosing health building skills and and staying emotionally regulated. So there is this sort of

463
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Relaxed vigilance for the rest of our life we all are. We're all just like, Huh, I need to be mindful of my health. It never goes away. We do. We all have to be mindful of it.

464
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But the frequency of those thoughts. I want to drink on a drink will go down that I can tell you, I mean, I'm not omnipotent, but they're going to decrease

465
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.590
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

466
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.660
Gabriel L.: So,

467
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, yeah, when

468
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When

469
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm Gabriel. I'm going to look at my my agenda and see one of the reasons why you and I connected back to back two weeks.

470
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, in a row was because of that. Are you still feeling like you want to keep meeting weekly to connect or do you want to move to bi weekly what would work for you.

471
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:10.560
Gabriel L.: I think we're scheduled for next week already early

472
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I have, I have a gal. I have a gal. It's a pretty I have booked already 7am I'm already booked for next week. I don't see your name here. Let me see.

473
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we real quick, we get we don't meet next week, unless there's something going on, you can reach out to me.

474
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know if it turns out that that you and Ashley want to do something and I'm free in an evening, since I'm on your timezone it's not as catastrophic it's you know what I mean when you guys say six o'clock. It's actually six o'clock, and it's not eight o'clock, my time.

475
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit more reasonable for me. So just stay in touch me with texting, see if it's a pencil. But otherwise, I really want something on the books for us so that I can protect our individual therapy and

476
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in the morning or she would the baby.

477
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.100
Gabriel L.: washes the baby right now. But you know, I usually just about

478
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.350
Gabriel L.: You prefer

479
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.700
Gabriel L.: An afternoon.

480
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a time would you say

481
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.170
Gabriel L.: Anytime like three to

482
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.640
Gabriel L.: Work.

483
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.110
Gabriel L.: Working from home. So not a big deal.

484
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be done by three or two. Okay, so why don't I pur pur pur pur pur pur pur pencil you in

485
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: For two ah I 2pm

486
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: On June 16 that gives you plenty of time to talk with her about it.

487
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:44.670
Gabriel L.: Okay.

488
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what about your work schedule. Is that going to completely freak you out though.

489
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.420
Gabriel L.: No, no worries.

490
00:47:52.500 --> 00:48:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got and I put Ashley and then for us if she can't attend you could either stick with that one. Or you and I could already plug in June, June 11 at 7am

491
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.250
Gabriel L.: OK.

492
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so for us, let's let's review our next individual therapy, sure thing will feel a lot like today, which is a Thursday, June 11 7am

493
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we're hoping to maybe even have even if she's there for half like Hey, hey, I'm so glad you're here. Just wanted to teach a couple of really cool convenience sort of communication skills. It's the I feel will do a couple of exchanges.

494
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really helpful in in sticky situations to be able to talk about our underlying feelings about why we have this perspective opinion and point of view, and it can really shorten

495
00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What normally an argument could last maybe three or four hours or 24 hours or three days can shorten to like 20 minutes or 10 minutes, it can go much, much, much faster faster. So it's efficient.

496
00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's what I wrote is like penciled you in this is what you want to talk to her about is June 16 at 2pm Mountain Standard

497
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And give it a thank you and it looks like our texting. I honestly, but if you don't hear from me. Just know that it could be. I'm not ignoring you. It could really be that that was lucky we got lucky on that text Exchange you don't try say so.

498
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I also can't call from it. So you wish.

499
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But

500
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.640
Gabriel L.: I mean, we should be able to get something going. I mean, I don't see why those days when work.

501
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll go, we'll go with that. And I'm going to message, your, your physician. I've been doing it regardless of whether people need medication or just say hey, Gabriel attended individual therapy and he's scheduled for his next appointment, so I will get to see you in group on Friday.

502
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.550
Gabriel L.: Very good. Yes, I will be there.

503
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. I'll see you then.

504
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:52.530
Gabriel L.: Bye.
