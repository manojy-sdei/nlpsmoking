41
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.700

Jesse Curtis Baca: They wouldn't help me figure out something

57
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.450
Jesse Curtis Baca: So,

58
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.130
Jesse Curtis Baca: I guess they

59
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.420
Jesse Curtis Baca: I guess I guess just kicked me out.

60
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.250

79
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.500

80
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.810
Jesse Curtis Baca: So take it.

81
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.800
Jesse Curtis Baca: To do a drug testing stuff somewhere you guys been referred me to a place and stuff like that. Yes.

82
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.300
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah. And then, and then after that I don't know you're here gonna let me know how it works later so

83
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:57.870
Joan Kandel: I will, I will fear not, it's gonna be okay. It's a good program and you, you do it from you know where you are from your home and it's just, it's just like this. It's, it's on the computer and there's therapy. There's peer support there's Dr. It's, it's gonna be, it's gonna be good.

84
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.420
Joan Kandel: Okay, yeah, we'll get you stable again. Um, so, how long were you on Suboxone total in total.

85
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.280
Jesse Curtis Baca: Six months approximately

86
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.760
Joan Kandel: Okay, yeah. And you were kind of just hitting your stride like you were just feeling stable and getting your life back together at that point.

87
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.710
Jesse Curtis Baca: Hmm. Yeah, it was, it was good.

88
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.020
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. So, um,

89
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.220
Joan Kandel: My it was at the first time you were on Suboxone

90
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.050
Joan Kandel: On a program

91
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.730
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, first one

92
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.240
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Okay, so, um, my, my sense about the subject of getting on the Suboxone is that

93
00:06:49.590 --> 00:07:03.060
Joan Kandel: I mean you know you've been you've been on opiates for like you say five years and and generally speaking people need to kind of stay on Suboxone stay sober and stay stable for

94
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:21.150
Joan Kandel: Usually at least a year before thinking about, like, Okay, let me try to get off of the Suboxone if they even want to get off the Suboxone some people stay on it long term and that's totally fine. So I don't want you to feel pressure to like

95
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.530
Joan Kandel: Get stable and then

96
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.920
Joan Kandel: Get off the program and you know and pretend like everything's just going to be fine and normal because

97
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:40.860
Joan Kandel: That's unfortunately not the way that addiction works. It takes it takes a lot of groundwork to kind of get to that place where you feel like okay I could maybe slowly taper off of this and be okay.

98
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.650
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah yeah

99
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.360
Joan Kandel: Does it. How does that strike.

100
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.510
Jesse Curtis Baca: Good again how that would be good.

101
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.680
Joan Kandel: Does that make sense.

102
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.710
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah. Makes sense. It makes you happy. Yeah.

103
00:07:53.250 --> 00:08:12.960
Joan Kandel: Yeah, good. I'm a so so it before I asked you some medical questions and answer to your question, because you kind of want to know about how the program works. So I'm so we'll do the intake today, like we're doing right now. I'll prescribe over the computer. The Suboxone to you.

104
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:24.090
Joan Kandel: And and you'll go to whatever pharmacy. You told us about you'll go there and pick it up later today. So you'll be feeling much better.

105
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.520
Joan Kandel: Today, today today.

106
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.660
Jesse Curtis Baca: Really is for seven steps for seven days or one day.

107
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.560
Jesse Curtis Baca: I called my

108
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.970
Good.

109
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.150
Jesse Curtis Baca: Model clinic day for like seven days until I got a drug test or something like that. I don't know.

110
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.610
Jesse Curtis Baca: Whatever you want to do. Thank you, bro.

111
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:52.170
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, of course. So the way we do it today is are you working. This is another question type

112
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.750
Joan Kandel: Jobs you're applying. Okay.

113
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.240
Joan Kandel: So I need to. I need to set you up in one of the groups because the groups are every week. And that's when we prescribe the medicines is once a week, usually

114
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:16.530
Joan Kandel: And it's it when people show up for their group and then I'm in the group. If there's a therapist in the group and then other other patients in the group. So usually we do our prescriptions once a week, when you come into group.

115
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.270
Jesse Curtis Baca: Okay.

116
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.050
Joan Kandel: I'm usually what we do is

117
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.610
Joan Kandel: When someone's first started. So my groups are on Tuesdays. So I'm thinking Tuesday at 430. Does that work for you in the afternoon.

118
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:39.210
Jesse Curtis Baca: Tuesday for 30 and that's a

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.130
Jesse Curtis Baca: Okay, thank you.

122
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.490
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you bet. So actually, I will be doing

123
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.840
Joan Kandel: A prescription just for today and tomorrow.

124
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.670
Jesse Curtis Baca: So it'll be a two day prescription

125
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.780
Joan Kandel: And then when you come tomorrow to group then I'll do another week to get you through

126
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:12.240
Joan Kandel: But you'll have to dose for today and tomorrow because that the group is in the afternoon. So you'll already have your dose for that you won't be hurting for group.

127
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.100
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, you know,

128
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.420

131
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:32.640
Joan Kandel: Yeah, this is coming. No. That makes a huge difference. Yeah. Yeah, so it won't be long, Jesse. You'll, you'll have that and you'll feel much better and then tomorrow.

132
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:46.140
Joan Kandel: So the group starts at 430 so whenever you have a group or an appointment. You always need to call into the virtual clinic about a half an hour beforehand, so call them at four.

133
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.560
Joan Kandel: And then called

134
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.560

Joan Kandel: Um, let me tell you first Jesse, the, the 582 number that you called is not going to be a number that you'll call in the future. That's just for today's visit

140
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:32.010
Joan Kandel: The four h o number is the number, you'll call every time. And they'll give you a new zoom room number for every week so that so that changes every week, but the one that you always call you could put it on you know in your phone as a saved number is that for you know one

557
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:19.110
Joan Kandel: Okay. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure was last time it was checked. You know what the numbers were

558
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.230
Jesse Curtis Baca: Oh, I don't know, but it's always been good.

559
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.520
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

560
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.660
Jesse Curtis Baca: Okay. Always been good, though.

561
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:36.900
Joan Kandel: Next time you go to the doctor will you ask them to take a full set of vital signs and have them write it down for you and then you can let us know what it is we can put it in your chart.

562
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.600
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, sounds good. I think I might have a blood pressure cuff somewhere over here.

563
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.160
Joan Kandel: Oh, that would be awesome.

564
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.100
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, I'll get that I'm not gonna bother her and elbow.

565
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.960
Jesse Curtis Baca: Well, okay, that's fine.

566
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:58.710
Joan Kandel: That's fine. So if you get that the, you know, like later today. You could call the virtual clinic and just let them know that that Dr. Candle wanted to know your vital signs and just the write it down.

567
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.690
Jesse Curtis Baca: That'd be super fast.

568
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.150
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, so kind of get back. I want to pick up this this box. I'm seeing as I can. Yeah.

569
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.980
Joan Kandel: Do that later. That's not a problem.

570
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.710
Jesse Curtis Baca: All right. Can I do that, like, like, what, how long does it take, you know, like, all that stuff on my chance

571
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.540
Joan Kandel: To get to get to the pharmacy.

572
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.850
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, like what yeah

573
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.690
Jesse Curtis Baca: For the so

574
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:30.780
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So right after we finish up putting the prescription. It depends on the pharmacy. They've been really overrun lately because of all of this virus stuff that's happening. The coronavirus so

575
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.140
Jesse Curtis Baca: The pharmacy is a little bit bogged down and slow.

576
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.640
Joan Kandel: But I would imagine that probably within a couple hours they should have it for you.

577
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.300
Jesse Curtis Baca: Oh, that's fine. Yeah, I love today. Yeah.

578
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.340
Joan Kandel: It will definitely be today, Jesse.

579
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.430
Joan Kandel: No, no worse. It'll do today.

580
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.130
Jesse Curtis Baca: So the dosage would be like, you know,

581
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.880
Joan Kandel: I want to talk to you about the dosage so

582
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.480
I'm

583
00:37:55.710 --> 00:38:02.490
Joan Kandel: A when you were when you were buying it illegally. How much did you take of it.

584
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.110
Jesse Curtis Baca: eight milligrams at once.

585
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.260
Joan Kandel: How many times a day, or just once a day.

586
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.350
Jesse Curtis Baca: Twice a day. Some people disagree a day but price is good for me.

587
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.080
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yeah. You know, I found that I've really found that most people do fine on twice a day.

588
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.180
Jesse Curtis Baca: It doesn't make a difference to me.

589
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.500
Jesse Curtis Baca: I pose the same issue.

590
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.930
Joan Kandel: Well, that's awesome. To know that's

591
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.820
Joan Kandel: That's perfect. That's great. And I think that's true for a lot of people is that you know that

592
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.000
Joan Kandel: That extra eight milligrams really doesn't make a difference. It's the

593
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:43.710
Joan Kandel: It's the first eight milligrams. Some people are fine on eight milligrams a day. Some people kind of need 12 or 16 but yeah that's so that's good. You know that about yourself.

594
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.510
Joan Kandel: So,

595
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.430
Jesse Curtis Baca: So, yeah.

596
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.900
Jesse Curtis Baca: It does. Okay.

597
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.620
Joan Kandel: So the ceiling effect. Yeah. You know, you know what you're talking about.

598
00:38:53.970 --> 00:39:00.570
Joan Kandel: So, uh, have you ever tried taking it just 16 milligrams in the morning, all at once.

599
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.650
Jesse Curtis Baca: I take eight milligrams in the morning and eight milligrams and I

600
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.230
Joan Kandel: Have you ever tried taking it all at once.

601
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.600
Jesse Curtis Baca: It doesn't really like the be honest with you, I hope I take it all at once.

602
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:24.810
Jesse Curtis Baca: I really can't tell the difference. Well, when I take it the other eight milligrams at night. I kind of feel like start again.

603
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.130
Joan Kandel: Like you, I mean,

604
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:31.710
Jesse Curtis Baca: Yeah, plasma levels pi go lower. And then when I took another eight milligrams and it goes back up a little bit.

605
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:37.440
Joan Kandel: Like, it's okay. So, um, so that's fine with me. If you want to take it twice a day like that.

606
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:47.190
Joan Kandel: It's a medicine that really is. It's made to last a full 24 hours so that people just take it once a day. So I'm going to just

607
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:56.340
Joan Kandel: Prescribe you 16 milligrams a day and let you decide which way works better. Either you could take it eight and then eight or you could take it all at once at 16

608
00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:09.660
Joan Kandel: If you, if you were to take it 16 milligrams every morning on a consistent basis you take it, you know, for like three or four days in a row, you could kind of see which one works better if it works the same.

609
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:16.500
Joan Kandel: Then just take it all in the morning because then you don't have to like keep remembering and have to think and have to, like, you know,

610
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:24.090
Joan Kandel: Feel like you have to take something twice a day. It's just so much easier to take something once a day. So, but, you be the judge of that. And you decide

611
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:32.310
Joan Kandel: If it works just as well to take it all in the morning, which a lot of people feel it does, then just take it all in the morning. If you feel it works better to split it up. Do it.

612
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.930
Joan Kandel: Okay, the judge you be the judge. However, it works better for you.

613
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:38.970
Jesse Curtis Baca: OK.

614
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.680
Joan Kandel: OK, so the last thing I need to do is just to kind of a quick physical exam, which is

615
00:40:47.790 --> 00:41:01.560
Joan Kandel: kind of difficult to do on the computer. But if you could look straight into the camera and bring the camera close to your eyes. I'd like to look into your eyes so look right at the camera that's perfect look right at the camera and look to your right.

616
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.210
Joan Kandel: Look to your right.

617
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.520
Joan Kandel: Here left. Yeah.

618
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.440
