00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.390
Joshua Lopez: All right.

6
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You got me down. Settle somewhere.

7
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.980
Joshua Lopez: I'm holding it. I'm sitting down trying to find a place that I can put it and still

8
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.630
Joshua Lopez: Sit down a quick quick little thing real quick, nice if I could flip this around.

9
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.170
Joshua Lopez: Little messy, but I got my couch.

10
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking to you got on love it.

11
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.910
Joshua Lopez: Yeah I ordered it from Amazon. Cuz I can't buy furniture in you.

12
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

13
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.870
Joshua Lopez: Either wait a little while but I'm still on. If you can see my dining room still empty in my dining room.

14
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.370
Joshua Lopez: Just Can't Wait to finally go shopping.

15
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.890
Joshua Lopez: I'm gonna try in the living room. Let me see if I

16
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.100
Joshua Lopez: Can

17
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Here's a suggestion. So oftentimes phones have cords out of the bottom. But if you have to two stacks of books or Tupperware that sit on the side that hold the phone up and then you got something holding up the back and the cord can be coming out.

18
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that, so it's fine. This is fine. It's just not great for if I want to do any MTR with you. I need to be I level with you.

19
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.460
Joshua Lopez: Okay, yeah, that

20
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ready. See if you have something to sit stack up like a crate like a stool or what else is big, a suitcase. What else is big.

21
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Big, big, big, big, big basket.

22
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time. I'm going to open up a note. Okay, no rush. Okay. Oh, I'm getting closer. I'm not hating that

23
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.610
Joshua Lopez: Yeah. Almost got it.

24
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.090
Joshua Lopez: Okay, so

25
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.110
Okay.

26
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That is much improved so remember this setting for future times to we want to grab that and start the day like that. Okay, let me get a note here. So any big changes.

27
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Any big changes in health of children, health, your health, family health any big changes going on.

28
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.560
Joshua Lopez: No health wise schedule with my kids has changed a little bit.

29
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:11.310
Joshua Lopez: Used to be where you know i worked and they stick with their mom as soon as I got off of work I picked him up for my days off. We're trying something new for the kids, mainly because

30
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.240
Joshua Lopez: They wouldn't have a chance to get settled, you know, they'd be with me two or three days, then it was back to their moms.

31
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:31.320
Joshua Lopez: Right. Same thing up there for two, three days back with me. So we're doing on my short week I have them the entire week you know and I work my god daughter, help me watch them on network. Okay.

32
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.210
Joshua Lopez: And I'm a long week there with her.

33
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:43.920
Joshua Lopez: Which of course I enjoyed last week was my short week I enjoyed having them or seven 3D, it was, it was nice coming home from work and then being here. I was different.

34
00:04:44.730 --> 00:05:00.420
Joshua Lopez: Because of course, I never had them when I was working, and then the data that I picked them up you know my last day of work. I'd go get them. It was nice to come home and and have them here. It was real nice. Of course, this week kinda hate in it because I don't have them.

35
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.440
Joshua Lopez: At all. It was really weird. I did ask her. However, if I could go pick them up today.

36
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.760
Joshua Lopez: She said, finding you know i'm going to hang out with them, at least until she gets out a word.

37
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.170
Joshua Lopez: Just because i i i don't know how she does it. She can go a week without seeing them. I can only go a couple of days and I start really missing them.

38
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:34.320
Joshua Lopez: They are, you know, I just missed the pitter patter of little feed or even the whining Miss of my son when he gets hurt or, you know, we just

39
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok alright so still very aware of that emotion of

40
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When I'm alone with myself. I'm not excited about it. I'm not, like, Yeah, I get to do all my personal things I want to do you still aren't in that yet.

41
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.010
Joshua Lopez: No, I just with them. No, I mean, I just

42
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.420
Joshua Lopez: For me, I don't ever see them as holding me back. You know, they just I do miss them a lot.

43
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:26.430
Joshua Lopez: Even before we switch the schedule just coming home to the empty house, you know, even though I didn't have energy to really play or or hang out with them. It was just, it was nice to come home and just have them here, you know,

44
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.340
Joshua Lopez: Most days I get home from work and I am too tired to do anything. So I didn't mind the old schedule.

45
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:49.710
Joshua Lopez: Not having them when I got out of work, just because I was up for maybe two hours each hour watch a little bit of TV and pass out, you know, but having a whole day without them. It's kind of weird definitely weird

46
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this is brand new. So it makes sense that there'd be an adjustment.

47
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you did was you tried to get them over. That was your solution right

48
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay actually going to go pick them up when we're done here.

49
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.020
Okay.

50
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now in this time. One of the things that we had talked about was creating

51
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of play that also is engaging in some Spanish and some cooking. It's like an all in one. I get to hang with my kids I get to be practicing Spanish doing things. I love having fun. It's not focused on material things like it was hitting a lot of the buttons.

52
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All at once. What did you end up doing was it nothing or some sort

53
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Of something

54
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:55.020
Joshua Lopez: Kind of like baby steps with the whole cooking thing. You know, I have a ton of groceries my excuse was I didn't really have a kitchen to cook home cooked meals are eating out a lot.

55
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:03.330
Joshua Lopez: To kind of baby steps when they were with me last week I cook dinner. A couple of times, which they enjoyed. I enjoyed

56
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:11.820
Joshua Lopez: You know, it just kind of, kind of like baby steps. It does feel feel a little weird just cooking for us three

57
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:23.460
Joshua Lopez: Something also brand new to me. So I'm just adjusting to getting back into a routine of there with me. We're eating home cooked meals were, you know, once I get

58
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:33.390
Joshua Lopez: A routine down of what I can cook, what I can do, you know, because a lot of the stuff I face to cook was for a family of four, you know, to adult my daughter, he, he said.

59
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:53.130
Joshua Lopez: Now I got to find meals that I'm not overcooking, I guess, you know, it's my daughter will eat pretty pretty decent all eat good my son. He's a small guy. He doesn't eat a whole lot don't just trying to find a balance with that I am kind of proud that I i finally am stepping up and

60
00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.750
Joshua Lopez: Finding the motivation to to to cook for them because they deserve that, you know, they don't need to be eating fast food all the time.

61
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.660
Joshua Lopez: So I did that as far as spending more time with them as well.

62
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:21.030
Joshua Lopez: When they were with me that week I had the couch came in two big old giant boxes I had boxes that I got from work when I move that we're still here. So as I was throwing them away my daughters. Like, what if we build a fort dad.

63
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:31.770
Joshua Lopez: I kind of ran with that as, like, you know what, we can not only build one, but we'll build one planet build the second one planet in a building like five four

64
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.620
Joshua Lopez: It was awesome.

65
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.990
Joshua Lopez: Then I went and got

66
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.360
Joshua Lopez: I know if we're trying to get away from just material things. But I went and got us like a board game. I mean,

67
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it

68
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.190
Joshua Lopez: I don't know if you remember the old at gaming Dungeons and Dragons.

69
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.210
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

70
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:57.270
Joshua Lopez: But that's that takes a long time. And it's probably too complicated for the kids. I got

71
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.940
Joshua Lopez: This thing. It's called five minute dungeons.

72
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it on the age range on the bottom. Does it meet your children's age range on the bottom is

73
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.480
Joshua Lopez: Eight plus

74
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.230
Joshua Lopez: My son will be

75
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.510
Joshua Lopez: Eight in July. So he's close enough to it.

76
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:09.990
Okay.

77
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.640
Joshua Lopez: So, and it's really fun, it's not complicated. It's something that we ended up playing

78
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:26.460
Joshua Lopez: For almost the whole night with my sense like Dad, I really want to play video games like no son. Let's have some time me you and your sister. We're, we're all together.

79
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:37.620
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I told him we play for like an hour. By the time we're done playing three and a half hours went by and, you know, it was, it was fun. It was, it was fun. It's something that they deserve.

80
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.720
Joshua Lopez: Just that last talk with you kind of made me

81
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.120
Joshua Lopez: made me realize that

82
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:54.570
Joshua Lopez: I can't think that I deserve something or she deserved something, it's what they deserve. They deserve quality time, not just

83
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:15.030
Joshua Lopez: You know, going through the motions getting by day by day, it's more of they deserve more they deserve home cooked foods quality time I'm something I'm definitely definitely excited about in definitely villain improvement that I've made for them.

84
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:31.020
Joshua Lopez: And I can. I hope to continue to improve off of that, you know, that's why I say baby steps, maybe a couple weeks we will have that Spanish night, you know, I'm just building up towards it, for sure. Okay.

85
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did that step, which was you got out of the sense of deserve and you moved into sort of this empathy space of this is what the kids deserve to and it might be hard to do.

86
00:11:44.040 --> 00:12:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're feeling like, Oh, I'll have to face that I am not having this adult meal. It means you're going to have to face the reality of my wife is not here, and you did it, it was uncomfortable and yet you're like it's in my face.

87
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To face little eaters to little picky tiny little eaters and me the big eater.

88
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Whereas the other one. Okay, I'm in it you faced it. So yeah, it's you have a lot to be proud of. And it's not just about I got up and I thought about the meal you can be proud of. I face the fact that another piece of evidence.

89
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not living with me.

90
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it. And did you end up getting high.

91
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

92
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That means you lived through it. You literally created brain tissue that didn't exist there before. Okay.

93
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I am proud I am very proud of you.

94
00:12:48.240 --> 00:13:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was probably hard at moments. Other times you may have noticed. Oh, now I'm having final. Now I want to cry. Oh, now I'm having fun. And now I want to cry. Right. It moves back and forth and back and forth, but ultimately

95
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: did it meet your belief system what you believe in, in a core place inside of you. I make healthy meals for myself and for my family.

96
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:23.610
Joshua Lopez: It did, it did and it felt better than just where do you guys want to go eat. You know, or what do you want me to go get about 1000 times better than that, you know,

97
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.540
Joshua Lopez: I've been promising them spaghetti and meatballs for like two weeks and I didn't do it.

98
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:48.450
Joshua Lopez: I just. It felt weird, you know. So doing those home cooked meals, it just like you said, if that were my core beliefs that this is who I was. And this is who I am. And this is where I need to be rather than chick fil a is a

99
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:48.720
Joshua Lopez: Quick

100
00:13:49.050 --> 00:14:06.690
Joshua Lopez: Easy simple fix, you know, which wasn't my core beliefs. You know, I believe that eating out every now and then. Is it should be like a reward every now and then not something that you live off of, you know, so if it did feel good.

101
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.780
Joshua Lopez: It did. And like you said it was facing kind of like another piece of reality.

102
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.080
Joshua Lopez: And I've done pretty good the past couple of days.

103
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.940
Joshua Lopez: Prior to that, I did feel

104
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.920
Joshua Lopez: Did feel pretty sad. I mean, I got to the point where I even called her just because it was so intense.

105
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.610
Joshua Lopez: No, I'm not proud that I called her a just

106
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.140
Joshua Lopez: I was really, really, at that time.

107
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember the thoughts Josh chemical you were thinking

108
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.710
Joshua Lopez: I'm

109
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.240
Joshua Lopez: Just

110
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.610
Joshua Lopez: Missing her like crazy like crazy, crazy

111
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.710
Joshua Lopez: Just

112
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.530
Joshua Lopez: Just missing her just

113
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: When you call her didn't meet the need

114
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.590
Joshua Lopez: Not really know

115
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.840
Joshua Lopez: It just like I was about

116
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.890
Joshua Lopez: Eight use the word I felt kind of desperate for

117
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.020
Joshua Lopez: Connecting

118
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.790
Yeah.

119
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:39.330
Joshua Lopez: You know, and with all this going on, it kind of brings up a not an obstacle, but I guess sort of like another obstacle, you know, there's social distancing. You can't hang out. And so I really just felt isolated, you know, not talking to my parents.

120
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:46.560
Joshua Lopez: You know, I just felt really alone and isolated that I

121
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.820
Joshua Lopez: Had a moment of weakness, and I called her just

122
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.030
Joshua Lopez: You know, okay.

123
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So although I won't label it the same way you do.

124
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, maybe we should talk about that a little bit. It isn't weakness. Every single one of us unless we're

125
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of antisocial personality disorder. We're going along for that connection, but that doesn't make you broken or week it's were made that way.

126
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you want that connection and you can feel it sharply you enjoy it. When you're your daughter's there your son's there. You feel close, no one's there.

127
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can hang with my new friend. I can't go to the gym. I'm not at work. I can't buddy around there. I'm not distracted by by this new job.

128
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a couple of things. Number one, changing this definition that you have of it.

129
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you change the definition

130
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think this desperate. I don't think you're going to reach what you're labeling desperation. I'm wondering if you change it, just to

131
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Be this situation is going to call for some other really proactive skills. I'm going to have to join some online memberships here. Just gonna and what are they going to be

132
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do. What have you been kind of thinking, maybe I'll check this out. But you're like, now then I'm gonna what are ones that you thought about doing and you hesitated too long and didn't get it done didn't sign up for it.

133
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.510
Joshua Lopez: Nothing really. I mean,

134
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.250
Joshua Lopez: I didn't really put a lot of thought into it. I just

135
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.440
Joshua Lopez: I don't know. I'm these feelings kind of came through and

136
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.160
Joshua Lopez: I was at work. So like

137
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.680
Joshua Lopez: Usually work and distract me and

138
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:52.200
Joshua Lopez: And and keep me occupied. It was just, it was weird. I was like,

139
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.350
Joshua Lopez: I'm gonna say like two, three days.

140
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:07.980
Joshua Lopez: After my daughter's birthday like leading up to my daughter's birthday and like two, three days after her birthday. I just was overwhelmed by this billing to talk to her.

141
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.560
Joshua Lopez: Specifically her, you know,

142
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.040
Joshua Lopez: I don't, I really don't know why.

143
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:22.830
Joshua Lopez: Just, I don't know if it was just, you know, the date that my daughter's birth or I don't know.

144
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.110
Joshua Lopez: I don't really know why I did it, or wife out that way.

145
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.090
Joshua Lopez: But

146
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.360
Joshua Lopez: It just, I don't know it, it felt

147
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:42.630
Joshua Lopez: felt really weird to call her and tower, you know, then I still being disorder I Mr. A lot

148
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.160
Joshua Lopez: And I've been thinking about her.

149
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.790
Joshua Lopez: Which I know is probably not the thing I should do.

150
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what your truth was so, so what

151
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What was her response. What did you get back

152
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.910
Joshua Lopez: Then really

153
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.830
Joshua Lopez: Really nothing that

154
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:28.560
Joshua Lopez: That's that. Then, you know, I kind of knew fallen world and going to make me feel better and it kind of confirmed it when I called her and I told her, these things because wasn't like I got I miss you too, or, you know, I didn't get nothing like that. It was just

155
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.870
Joshua Lopez: Kind of awkward.

156
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you stayed on the phone for five minutes or like 21 just down there.

157
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.510
Joshua Lopez: For about 10 minutes or so.

158
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.160
Joshua Lopez: I like 10 minutes

159
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.210
Joshua Lopez: Kind of told her you know

160
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.210
Joshua Lopez: Mr. A lot. A

161
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.660
Joshua Lopez: Mysterious her voice or laugh.

162
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.030
Joshua Lopez: Or smile.

163
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.000
Joshua Lopez: It was weird, too, because

164
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:13.830
Joshua Lopez: One of those nights I went to lay down and I literally I swear to you I could like smell her

165
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:35.340
Joshua Lopez: And there's nothing in my house that would have her sit on it. But it was so weird. As I was laying down. I like smelter said it like I can't explain it, because there was. There's literally nothing here of hers that wouldn't have that, you know, like, that's how intense

166
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:50.250
Joshua Lopez: My missing her was, I guess, like that's how intense it was that out of nowhere memory just popped up a sense and I could smell it clear as day like if it was right next to be

167
00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so those don't surprise me you lay down and it's very often that that smell was there when you lay down, who's in her pillow is in her clothing and was on her skin.

168
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And those two things. Remember Dr OBL talks about wire together right because they were fire together, laying down and having that sent went hand in hand in that room when you use to share together so

169
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You lay down and what got connected remembered was the smell that went with laying down in bed.

170
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't surprise me the same way you may get triggered to us because you've got a smell you like what just happened. You may not even a we aware of a cent, having been a trigger or something, some other Q

171
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not trying to change the focus back to recovery. But my point is the brain made connections at the time that you may not be conscious of it.

172
00:21:50.880 --> 00:22:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, you're not you, this makes a lot of sense what just happened. Okay. You have a lot of history of laying down and sent those to a lot of them put together.

173
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're sleeping. How many hours and that sense right there. So there's a lot of hours, put together of laying down in that sense was present reinforce reinforce reinforce reinforce so it doesn't surprise me.

174
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.940
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, nearly, nearly 12 years of it took

175
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A long time

176
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to this word connection.

177
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree.

178
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection is a human sort of instinct that we have. We want it.

179
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want it and you went to an old familiar one and didn't quite meet the need

180
00:22:51.600 --> 00:23:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And with this social isolating and makes it even more of a challenge. And so you can either throw your hands up and say, Well, too bad, so sad. I'm going to feel bad, or you can turn it crank it up.

181
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: work even harder at it, we started to play around with it a little bit last time, but I'm pressing in again and saying,

182
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not quite meeting the need, you can't reach out to your mom because she's just not a best friend.

183
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And your wife is not emotionally available to just not to have been for a long time, but she's not right now, but that doesn't mean that your need for connection can't find a place. So I want to talk about where you can go for it. Okay.

184
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We all have that

185
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I get mine. My friends do. There's you need to do yours. You're not broken because you want connection.

186
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about where else you can get it.

187
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Brainstorm

188
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you do

189
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.870
Joshua Lopez: One thing that helped me because like I said, the past couple of days. I had been doing better.

190
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.260
Joshua Lopez: Is the old friend of mine.

191
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:21.150
Joshua Lopez: Not somebody. I'm like attracted to or want to be, it was somebody that would just go with for a long time, she was kind of nerdy

192
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:28.710
Joshua Lopez: She brought up one of our conversations you know because because we've been texting each other, you know, she's like, I remember

193
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:37.110
Joshua Lopez: In middle school, some some girls were starting to pick on me and you told her you you told them to leave me alone. She's cool and she

194
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:49.650
Joshua Lopez: She's like, I remember remembering like wow I'm not cool. But that's cool. He did that, you know, and I've been I just been texting her she

195
00:24:50.610 --> 00:25:00.900
Joshua Lopez: She somebody that I knew her husband from work. That's how I kind of reconnected with her her ex husband, any way that like five kids together.

196
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:16.380
Joshua Lopez: And she said one day he came home, he told her he was having an affair. They were divorced, a month later, he has a kid with this new girl. So, you know, we've kind of kind of share stories and she's kinda

197
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.950
Joshua Lopez: Kind of giving me inspiration. You know that

198
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.830
Joshua Lopez: You can move forward. You can

199
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.330
Joshua Lopez: You know,

200
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:33.600
Joshua Lopez: And she somebody probably the only person that I outside of you that I can tell you know like out of Christ session, you know,

201
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:50.250
Joshua Lopez: And, you know, and. She'll. She'll honestly be like, you know, it's cool that you share that with me and I appreciate that, you know, and then Joe kind of give me her feedback and you know it's it's

202
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.590
Joshua Lopez: I don't wanna

203
00:25:54.510 --> 00:26:02.070
Joshua Lopez: I don't want to like depend on that, but she has she did help me this past week with what I was going through

204
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:11.130
Joshua Lopez: Because if I didn't have anybody, anybody. I don't really don't know how bad things would have gotten you know

205
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.490
Joshua Lopez: Abitur it kind of

206
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.610
Joshua Lopez: kind of kept me level helped me to continue my week to get up, go to work.

207
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.880
Joshua Lopez: That is one thing you you had told me last week, I think it was

208
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.050
Joshua Lopez: Kind of really resonated and stuck with me was

209
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:40.710
Joshua Lopez: You're doing all of this and you know you're not giving yourself enough credit, you're going through

210
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:55.830
Joshua Lopez: You know recovery, you're starting a new job you moved into a new place you're dealing with a divorce, you're dealing with separation from your kids and you're still going. It's something that kind of tell myself when I get down like

211
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.840
Joshua Lopez: Who the hell can do this much at once, you know,

212
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not sure I'm not bullshitting you just the see why FD thing alone just that one just that little piece right there good white people out

213
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't see it. You guys just it baffles me how you don't see your strength.

214
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know I sound like I'm blowing smoke up your ass but i'm not i'm in off.

215
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:40.830
Joshua Lopez: It definitely is served as inspiration. You know, there's morning i mean you know how depression works. There's times where you don't want to get up and you don't want to do anything.

216
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.380
Joshua Lopez: You know it's four o'clock in the morning and I'm feeling that way. And I kind of

217
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.020
Joshua Lopez: tell myself who

218
00:27:49.110 --> 00:28:01.290
Joshua Lopez: Who else could do. Who else could get up. Go work 12 and a half hours building this low still come home, you know, like I just a kind of a used it as inspiration for sure.

219
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:18.720
Joshua Lopez: And another thing is I keep telling myself things won't be like this forever. You know, eventually, there will be a change. I don't know what Ben or where or how but it'll be like a spark that'll it'll change, you know,

220
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.180
Joshua Lopez: I don't feel like this forever.

221
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

222
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.660
Joshua Lopez: I tell myself that and

223
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.420
Joshua Lopez: Often pray about that.

224
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Josh Let's do let's do some different kind of work today. Okay, let's take what you just said, Let's build on it. Let's get it even more solid do me a favor.

225
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: My lips are so chap would you go into your into your kitchen or somewhere and find to doesn't matter. I don't care what it is. It can be shampoo bottles for all I care. It can be

226
00:28:50.700 --> 00:29:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: These are drinking containers to go cups. They could be lotion. I don't care what it is, get two objects that are pretty tall, about the same height and put him right if you can

227
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want is right next to the phone. So I don't have three hands, but it would look like this, these two objects would be about shoulder height right to the side of the phone.

228
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.270
Joshua Lopez: Would they have to be visible on the screen.

229
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I won't see them. They're going to be right next to your phone, you'll see them right next to the phone. I will not see them at all.

230
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna go throw some water in my drinking container while you get yours. I will be moving quickly and

231
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

232
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to introduce is that

233
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The em Dr concept and I want to bring in think I've done that one time with you. Right.

234
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.710
Joshua Lopez: Okay, so I got him. They're kind of crooked.

235
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.190
Joshua Lopez: Everything rigged on a stool and then

236
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.050
Joshua Lopez: That are stacked up so about those are kind of leaning in.

237
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see. Let's see. Let's let me just check. So what I'm looking for is I'm looking for things that are about, let's say shoulder width apart in front of you. So if your arms were to go straight out those hands would touch them, and they'd be about shoulder width apart, that right

238
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Good and their level, they might be off by a little bit, but maybe you could be looking at just sort of the shoulder part of the bottle, instead of the top of it to sort of get the eyes moving horizontally at the same level.

239
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So those things that you're looking at one to look at your eyes do a check and see, we're just going to check

240
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You pull your screen up a little bit bigger. I want to be able to see your eyes. So I'm going to set the pace with my finger, and you're going to look at the top of the objects and I'm gonna look at your eyes just to see if they're moving

241
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, does that strain them. Are you a little close maybe sit back even an inch with your head just that was that was about a foot that me just about an inch. Let's just see.

242
00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not bad. I don't hate that. Okay. I like it. I like it. And did that one hurt, did that strain the I

243
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, check your volume. Let me hear you.

244
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you.

245
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.650
Good. Okay.

246
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, yeah, I heard the, um, okay. Nicely done. So that was our sound check and we got a good, a good piece for that for the movement. And I'd like to have an idea that once with you. I've done this. I've done at one time, have an eye or this is going to be the first time.

247
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.870
Joshua Lopez: This might be the first time.

248
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Out. Okay, so I could spend the whole half hour talking about what it is. Or I could just dive in. What would you like to do

249
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.240
Joshua Lopez: just dive in.

250
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'll give some instruction then today is

251
00:33:45.150 --> 00:34:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be a positive interweave which means I'm going to be asking you to be thinking about your resource team. I'll be asking you to think about the Rottweiler that sense of protectiveness of your brother, the nurturing aren't Auntie, Judy.

252
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And your kiddos right as nurturers and then Russell Brand and Yoda as the wise figures.

253
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I'll do some guidance around that and yes you can laugh. Of course, you can laugh.

254
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we do learn when we're happy we take things in when we're happy we we definitely can learn a lot better when we are not repulsed and disgusted by something so I definitely think giggling is is perfect for this.

255
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to explain a little bit what I'm going to be doing really and then what kind of your role is. So as always, your job.

256
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to catch and pay attention to the next thing that happens to if the next thing that happens is that you feel a tear. Why then, you'll say I'm I'm crying.

257
00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you might label the emotion you might tell me or if the next thing that happens because I'll be inviting it and they'll say what's coming up for you and you'll know what to do because I'm a guide and I tell you what to do. I'll be containing and guiding the whole time.

258
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But another piece of this is imagery and other pieces. This is cognitive so you might have a memory a thought you might have an emotion you might have a physical feeling okay any of those. I'm interested in

259
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm not interested in is you analyzing running it through a filter and deciding well I can't see this to go in, I gotta say this, this is what she wants to hear

260
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll get in your way. If you know anything about me. I want the raw truth, nothing but the truth, sir, right, because that's going to be the most genuine part of whatever's coming up. And that's the part that I want.

261
00:35:52.230 --> 00:36:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do any people pleasing, even if it's a cuss word and it's something that surprise you. I can't believe I just thought that where the heck did that come from. I want to know it.

262
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you know you know your role is just to sort of not in a long statement, it'll be something quickly. Maybe one sentence, boy. Now I'm thinking about

263
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: My cat. I can't believe I haven't thought about that in a long time, and you're done. That's all you're going to say it's a real short little statement.

264
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be doing em, Dr. And what that stands for his eye movement doesn't have to be I movement. If you were here, you'd have little buzzers in your hand.

265
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not, so I have to do it with I'm movement, but I'm looking for is a bilateral stimulation, which means left and right side of

266
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the hemispheres left and right side of the brain. And that can happen a lot of ways I could be if you were here, it could be tapping the outside of your knees.

267
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have the pulses, you'd have headphones on and you'd be hearing sounds and each year. So it doesn't have to be I movement.

268
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I hate the name of it because it sounds like it has to be a movement. It doesn't, but it will be today so I movement desensitization.

269
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where we won't be doing that today I'll be asking you to pull up a negative piece of memory.

270
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And a negative cognition and it's sort of like exposure therapy and you'll be sitting with it. Second after second after second while you're having this bilateral stimulation, which I believe is a distraction and allows you to reprocess that information. So, um,

271
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the basics. That's really fast.

272
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also do even more than that. I do what's called attachment focus, em, Dr. Which means you're not doing this alone. You're doing this with another human being that cares about you.

273
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so some other things can be going on, besides just this bilateral stuff and the reintegration of information that maybe didn't have a narrative before you're dealing with someone

274
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And that has an impact, too.

275
00:37:51.720 --> 00:38:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be paying close attention to, to that piece as well. There might be times when I say now, look at me. So that sort of thing might come up

276
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, this is what an iteration will look like. Here we go. And then we'll get into it, it'll probably the whole thing will basically look like this pattern.

277
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Josh would like you to think about these images, I'd like you to hold it in your working awareness. I want you to watch the pace of my finger and and once you look at these objects. And I want you to hold that in your awareness and just keep looking left and right.

278
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And about 30 seconds will, alas, and I'll say, inhale through your nose with me.

279
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale out. And let's let your mind go blank.

280
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll say what's coming up for you and you'll tell me, and then I'll say go with that. And then we'll do it all over again. I'm going to be here to guide you don't have to remember any of that. I'm right here. As you know, I got a big old mouth love to boss people around so

281
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I love being a guide. Okay, I'm right here. All you have to do is what

282
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.810
Joshua Lopez: Be honest. Yeah.

283
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention. Try not to censor it. Ooh, I just got angry. Oh, I just got sad little. I don't want to do this. I want to know my stomach just turned. I want to know those things. Okay.

284
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Or there's resistance or there's a whole new image that comes up. I want to know. And so let's together. Take a nice nice deep breath, inhale through the nose and nice really big belly breath.

285
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they are nice and slow.

286
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua, I want you to turn inwards. Close your eyes.

287
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now where once you were focused on what you saw through the video and what you heard with your ears. I want you to turn in to the sense of body sensation, just notice the temperature of the room.

288
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how it feels to be in your couch.

289
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To be supported by that couch where your back meets the couch, where it doesn't

290
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Aware of where your seat bones meet the cushion.

291
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your knees and calves.

292
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they make contact with fabric, the air and then your feet let those feet rest flat on the ground.

293
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And become aware of gravity. Isn't it amazing how they pull you to the center of the earth.

294
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That is quite consistent

295
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be aware of it.

296
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Allow that gravity where once, maybe you were fighting in holding the shoulders up, let it drop down

297
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: As it pulls those shoulders down to the center of the Earth gravity pulling you down consistently without interruption.

298
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd like to start to bring into your imagination.

299
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This resource team of yours, the Rottweiler

300
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to picture of being with that animal its protective nature sure and true.

301
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It knows what to do.

302
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It knows to protect

303
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And also your auntie Judy wanting for you, your potential

304
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Your full growth.

305
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to stay with them for now and just just move over to also the wise figure

306
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Russell Brand

307
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Having lived through his own recovery.

308
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: He has read so much and he sharing it with the world.

309
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And Yoda so wise so settled and confident in his wisdom.

310
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can picture the Rottweiler

311
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And Yoda interacting

312
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Communicating with you there.

313
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in Russell Brand

314
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Being aware of the nurturing figure of your auntie, Judy.

315
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Have them all together. You just pay attention to what comes up with everyone. They're

316
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tuning into that interaction.

317
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing their faces and maybe somebody morphs into somebody else or something happens where it just shifts and changes, that's okay to whatever happens.

318
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right on time.

319
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know when you're really collective in their mission that they are on your side. They are your team of resources when you really know it.

320
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, knowing that visualization is very clear for you. And then you'll open your eyes to let me you don't know all no

321
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, open your eyes and hold it. Hold that imagery, hold on to it. We're moving, nice and slow top of those images as those containers, hold it in your awareness.

322
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your resource team.

323
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: hold that in your awareness, the interaction. And I'd like you to add awareness of your body when you are thinking about this team.

324
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, letting it all go

325
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And let a quiet beat happen of nothingness in the mind.

326
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up.

327
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.680
Joshua Lopez: Visualize everybody. There's just so many random randomness to that group.

328
00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go with that. So come back in. Hold that there's so many go with that.

329
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Josh

330
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you only want to be with some of that.

331
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what to do. So what do you do with all of that.

332
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do first, and just make it happen in your imagination, what do you want to do with all of that protection nurturing system, all those characters.

333
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What feels intuitive and just make it happen.

334
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.560
Joshua Lopez: And my brother.

335
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Auntie and brother. Okay, so it is nurture and brothers protector.

336
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

337
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And where are you, what are you doing with them, auntie and your brother.

338
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: attention to your body. How does it feel to be enjoying her haven't seen in a while. How does it feel feel it.

339
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what's your brother's doing if it's pure and simple protection. There's no mixed feelings, then he's just in the role of protection if that's true. What's he doing what's he doing in your mind.

340
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.190
Joshua Lopez: Walked in a deeper

341
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.600
Joshua Lopez: Let me be

342
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: locked in and let me be with her.

343
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to where he goes when he does after the hug.

344
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

345
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there enough space for wisdom to be in there.

346
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.010
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

347
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:37.770
Joshua Lopez: For the moment, I would like to buy my brother or with them.

348
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's read in, inhale.

349
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, this time as slow as you can as little breath out as can die slowly blown

350
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mind go blank. Let your chin fall forward, open up the back your neck lean forward.

351
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be present with that.

352
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

353
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah thought passing by.

354
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body awareness. Can you describe what it's like to be you right now.

355
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:13.980
Joshua Lopez: Being tired.

356
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Tired. Yeah.

357
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, open your eyes.

358
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You cannot go without being tired and hold the imagery of aunty

359
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: As nurturer and sort of a combination sharing the wisdom and your brother also protective and wise you are tired.

Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

363
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Quick

Joshua Lopez: I know

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.330
Joshua Lopez: just lost it a little bit.

367
00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When she lives.

368
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.850
Joshua Lopez: At the end of being tired.

369
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.510
Joshua Lopez: Physically, Emotionally

370
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You lost it, meaning you you weren't focused on it or you were in it. You were, you were tired emotionally and physically just now.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.530
Joshua Lopez: Or was tired, physically and emotionally

Gwenevere Abriel: Open up and let's do it again. Go with that.

375
00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I was tired, physically and emotionally and then this distraction.

376
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Something happened. Don't know. Just go with that.

377
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: bring into your imagination, bringing into your working awareness, your resource team your auntie and your weather.

378
00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You are tired, physically and emotionally

379
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can bring the presence of your auntie and your brother.

380
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: into that space into that truth, bring them all together.

381
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happened.

Joshua Lopez: Why

Gwenevere Abriel: Do you say, I don't know why I'm so tired.

385
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.200
Joshua Lopez: I know the thought of why I am fire.

386

407
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's be in that quiet nothingness for even the moment if we can

408
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, we'll take some time and we'll talk a little bit about what this was like for you. This is your first time doing this. Maybe you could

409
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Just observe what it was like for you.

410
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.030
Joshua Lopez: Distracting for

411
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.790
Joshua Lopez: The awareness of, oh,

412
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:13.710
Joshua Lopez: Really

413
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

414
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so exhausted. You see it.

415
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get your heroism Joshua

416
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exhausting.

417
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

418
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

419
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a sense of wisdom inside to that there might be something to let go of. Not sure what it is, but I think you

420
00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be pulling some energy away and the things that you want to focus on the goals that you want.

421
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When you have decisions to make, you may want to pull these characters in be present with them while you're deciding just sort of be present.

422
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe going into a safe place in your mind and just being in that quiet of

423
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'll listen to what my auntie has to say and you listen to what my brother has to say or do we include them in this conversation.

424
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they're they're good at sort of saying, you know, dude. It's only so much you can do here. Right. You're exhausted. You gotta pay attention to that we go too hard, push too hard. What will happen if we keep ourselves exhausted what's at stake.

425
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

426
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of an interesting technique, isn't it.

427
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.180
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, definitely.

428
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:14.700

429
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:18.060
Joshua Lopez: That

430
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:26.820
Joshua Lopez: Brother, you know, my auntie duty not fictional because she was somebody she passed away.

431
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.030
Joshua Lopez: I can't really talk to her.

432
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:31.950
Joshua Lopez: In a little

433
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.720
Joshua Lopez: Brother, I have talked to, and he has, you know,

434
00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.770
Joshua Lopez: given me a bike similar to do that and

435
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.570
Joshua Lopez: At times I try and

436
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:49.230
Joshua Lopez: Buy

437
00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.600
Joshua Lopez: It you fail if they haven't let go.

438
00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.830
Joshua Lopez: And I haven't moved on. It is something that I do need to do

439
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:07.710
Joshua Lopez: This, I can't keep going, running on fumes and being exhausted.

440
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:11.760
Joshua Lopez: With a state is my dog moving forward.

441
00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.900
Joshua Lopez: And eventually finding happiness. Again, if I don't

442
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.220
Joshua Lopez: Definitely, definitely need to start trying to

443
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.490
Joshua Lopez: Use what he's told me

444
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.010
Joshua Lopez: Am I here.

445
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

446
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:32.760
So maybe

447
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's literally you call them and you talk with them. Or maybe it's journaling and writing down once and for all, if I

448
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: made a decision not waiting for my wife, my mother and other people to make decisions. If I put my foot forward.

449
00:58:49.320 --> 00:59:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And finally said, I'm done or what letting go with look like on your terms. I don't know what it is, but it may be through writing or let your dream life. Maybe it'll come up in there, or maybe from today, something will come up that really represents what you do that says

450
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If I did this one thing

451
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be symbolic of my letting go. Maybe you know what it is. Maybe there's a part of you that doesn't know i know i don't know but it'd be interesting to see what comes up with that being the invitation this week.

452
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your dreams tell you, maybe a conversation, literally, with your brother or maybe through journaling or some other just sort of in the back of your mind, what would be the thing that would represent letting go.

453
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of sit with that. And when we meet again or before you can certainly messaged me or something. But I'd be curious to know what that is.

454
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:52.650
Joshua Lopez: I would be very curious to know what

455
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

456
00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.440
Joshua Lopez: I've been trying to let go. I

457
00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess but but you haven't done it like this.

458
01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick up a piece of paper, dear, whatever, whatever. This thing is you need to let go of dear, blah, blah, blah. I'm letting you go, this is how I know I'm doing this, you write that letter and don't know ahead of time just you pick up the pen and you start writing. And then, there it is.

459
01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what comes up.

460
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you'll find out.

461
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's going to happen.

462
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll find out what that is. So that's the invitation is to do some journaling right in there. If it's a letter you never going to send but you got to find out what that is.

466
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought you might like that 12 o'clock.

467
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:14.760
Joshua Lopez: since we were little.

468
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:24.870
Joshua Lopez: I remember I messaged you about it but off the top of my head. I can't recall I'm group moving forward will be Tuesdays. Right. Well,

469
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.080
Joshua Lopez: Okay, so it's no longer Monday.

470
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're welcome.

471
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.020
Joshua Lopez: Okay, I just

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go to both if you have one of those insurance. It doesn't charge you a copay and it doesn't mean anything to you, you can go to all my groups if they're not in the same day as an individual or another group you're welcome anymore.

473
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:57.090
Joshua Lopez: Oh, OK. OK. I thought the whole group Monday was moving to Tuesday. I didn't realize that it's like a complete the new one, which is fine. I mean it. I just wanted to be clear that like moving over Today was my day.

474
01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.820
Joshua Lopez: Because sometimes I

475
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.370
I forget.

476
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So moving forward, I'll try to remind people, because it's a brand new group, group. I'll try to remind

477
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

478
01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.180
Joshua Lopez: Yeah 12 Correct, yeah.

479
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in your text to if you want to check it and then put it in.

480
01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to kind of get it in there. So next service for you is next Tuesday at 12 o'clock. Want to get in there. Maybe 1130 really have zoom has been

481
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Inundated, in fact, people couldn't even get in to the waiting room. It was somehow technically wasn't allowing people in. There's just a lot a lot of

482
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients people consumers of zoom and so it's it's challenging the the platform itself. So make sure you give your left self. A lot of time to get in.

483
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just think of it like traffic you know it you know I've got to drive all the way, you know, to, to an office. It's 45 minutes away. I've got to create time for that.

484
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:13.740
Joshua Lopez: I have noticed the wait time for virtual clinic is pretty long, um, you know, used to be able to check in, like 10 minutes and you were buying. Now, you give yourself 15 minutes in your bed in it kind of closes.

485
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another time to meet. And again, you're going to have to look at that work schedule of yours, and you're going to have to hold my hand on this one.

486
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't know it. And do you have your work schedule in front of you or do you want to text me when a good day would be, what do you want to do.

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:37.170
Joshua Lopez: Um, I can definitely take you. I know next week. I have, I would

489
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.420
Joshua Lopez: Of Tuesday.

490
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:52.620
Joshua Lopez: Individual Friday type thing. I would try and you know what I mean, just do to give myself time to

Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't know if you're working that day or not. I can't remember.

493
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:15.060

496
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so what's, what's the invitation for you to explore a little bit in the coming week

497
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:39.450
Joshua Lopez: To maybe do some journaling.

498
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.890
Joshua Lopez: And see what letting go really looks like.

499
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be a symbol of it right. What would represent it is either Literal or symbolic something. And that's perfect, see what comes up and just give yourself that space to see there might be some crime.
