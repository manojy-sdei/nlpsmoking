9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.180

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
Clara Esparza: And I was trying to cut like a piece of cheese and I went to my room and I forgot.

11
00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:06.660
Clara Esparza: A knife. So I was like, oh, I have like a little pocket knife that my father in law gave me so I took it out of my person decided to cut it in like apparently no one ever showed me how to use a knife, because I couldn't like towards my finger.

12
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.040
Clara Esparza: And literally like

13
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.480
Clara Esparza: Like the meat was hanging out in my finger and everything. It was disgusting.

14
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, gross.

15
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.560
Clara Esparza: So that was not a fun time at all.

16
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you go that night.

17
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:28.920
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I had to go because it was like bleeding everywhere like my my fingers. So my husband had to take me. Oh, that was fun.

18
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

19
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So have you been doing

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.430
Clara Esparza: I'm better better now. Yeah.

21
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.830
Clara Esparza: Cosby days have been a little better, just trying to keep busy not think

22
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about

23
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.240
Clara Esparza: Well, I don't

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, cuz I'm gonna want you to bring it up. Yeah.

25
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:14.910
Clara Esparza: Yeah I don't know know just anything like try not to think about pills are doing you know about things or whatever. I mean, I cut my finger was like kind of like in pain and how to thought about, like, you know, maybe like wanting to get a pill, but I didn't. I didn't do any so

26
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.410
Clara Esparza: That's

27
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.930
Clara Esparza: Why we say stop myself this time.

28
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This time

29
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.740
Clara Esparza: Yeah, this time.

30
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Clara.

31
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, boy.

32
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You heard about it.

33
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to give yourself credit to because, you know, you keep trying keep trying to keep trying. You're not giving up your key, you know,

34
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that piece, too.

35
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.370
Clara Esparza: Yeah, that's true. I know.

36
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.020
Clara Esparza: I just get down on myself or we know that

37
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, maybe. But doesn't get you anywhere.

38
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.730
Clara Esparza: Now it does

39
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.060
Clara Esparza: I'm starting I'm starting to learn a little bit. So I think hopefully I'll be able to stay on the right track.

40
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.480
Clara Esparza: Glory, and if not law how trying and

41
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right. And that's all we can do, you know, I'm pretty much anything. You know what I mean. We take five steps forward. Sometimes we have to take two and three steps back to, you know, gain them gain momentum for the next time.

42
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just don't give up.

43
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

44
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.600
I want

45
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what is

46
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Around you remember what happened.

47
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.750
Clara Esparza: Oh, I was like, Oh, I haven't talked to you. That's why I'm. No, I was just like,

48
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.010
Clara Esparza: I don't know. I had a lot of stuff going on. And then I had missed that one Friday group so

49
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:56.310
Clara Esparza: I was gonna pretend like I had enough like Suboxone to last through the weekend. So I called in and told them I wasn't going to get on that Friday Lou, isn't this last Friday the Friday before, right.

50
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.390
So I didn't get on group.

51
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.150
Clara Esparza: She had the virtual clinic asked me, What can you attend a meeting like, you know, sometime early next week at other groups, so he can send in your medication. And I was like,

52
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:18.480
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I think I can do Monday well come like it was, you know what, and to be honest the weekend wasn't even like I can't even pin it on something and tell us like

53
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.010
Clara Esparza: Something specific happened to set me off. I think it's like just a lot of everything and then me trying to like

54
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:43.140
Clara Esparza: Get. Um, what do you call it set on like the antidepressants and stuff and all that stuff. So I think it was just kind of like everything out one. So, then everything going on like in the world right now. And then I went home and I wasn't working. And then like I was just like,

55
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.260
Clara Esparza: I was okay, through the weekend and then come Monday I didn't end up getting on like the group that they wanted me to do the makeup group for I didn't get on

56
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.410
Clara Esparza: So I was still okay and I was like, no, you know, I'll be fine and kind of in my hand, which is like a bad idea.

57
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:12.420
Clara Esparza: I was like, I don't really feel like I need the Suboxone which is kind of just stupid. I don't even know why I thought like, I was like, oh, I don't need it. Like I could wait till Friday. Like, I literally thought I could wait till Friday. If I could do it.

58
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.130
Clara Esparza: So no, I couldn't wait till Friday and like

59
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.270
Clara Esparza: It was just everything at once. Me, My husband ended up getting in, like in a little argument. Nothing even like

60
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:33.540
Clara Esparza: Nothing major nothing even I don't even don't even remember what it was. It was like a tiny argument about something stupid and everyday thing like

61
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:47.460
Clara Esparza: In every day. Little bickering that we do. And like I just like, I don't know, I just wanted to buy pill so much goodbye pills like I didn't even it. That's kind of what scares me a little bit as I didn't even think twice about it.

62
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.760
Clara Esparza: Like the idea popped in my head and I went and I did that.

63
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the idea just didn't pop it into your head. So if you go back a little bit.

64
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you had the idea. First off, when you had the thought that you didn't need this boxing and that you could do it on your own. That was a piece of it. So what you want to kind of really identifies when it started it because it starts here.

65
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

66
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And so you want to. That's what you want to identify is when did those thoughts start changing in your head.

67
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.550
Yeah.

68
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:33.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because when you can when you can identify that, then when they start coming again you'll be more hyper vigilant and know that that's what's happening.

69
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does that make sense.

70
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.530
Clara Esparza: Yeah, it does.

71
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, you know, it starts way before you ever use

72
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just starts with a thought process. It starts with the emotions that we're going through, you know, maybe there were a couple nights that you didn't get good sleep or you weren't eating. You know, like you should have been

73
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to really pay attention to all of those aspects, because that's what's going to help you identify

74
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: where it started.

75
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.800
Yeah.

76
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's something to think about and work on

77
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.690
Clara Esparza: Okay, Ira

78
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. I mean, I can just buy what you just told me I can tell you I can trace it back, you know,

79
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why did, why did you miss group on Friday.

80
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:42.630
Clara Esparza: I'm that for it. Oh, that was what I was telling you guys this last Friday. Remember the okay so I missed it. That wasn't this Friday. That was the Friday before. Remember that Friday before that he had prescribed antidepressants.

81
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me.

82
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.580
Clara Esparza: So I didn't start those till Monday. So when I got to Friday. Again, I was like, on day five, and the pharmacist that told me like

83
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.550
Clara Esparza: She was like a major side effects that I hear a lot about on this medication. Does that give you like a really bad stomach ache for the first

84
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.360
Clara Esparza: Like week or two, but it'll go away. You just have to stick it through. Well, sure enough, I got like a horrible stomach ache, like, and I mean like

85
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.960
Clara Esparza: I was in the bathroom like Thursday night all freakin day

86
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:21.180
Clara Esparza: Like, and it had to have been not like I wasn't sick like it passed within a couple of days. I wasn't throwing up or anything. It was just, you know, using the bathroom like number two it would not stop and then like

87
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.290
Clara Esparza: I couldn't eat because they were just like, Pastor me right away and I was feeling like

88
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:34.830
Clara Esparza: nauseous. But I kept. I mean, I felt nauseous. But I kept telling myself about to throw up. So I would just like you know I just kept having to go to the bathroom. So on Friday. I was like,

89
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:41.880
Clara Esparza: I had slept with maybe an hour, like in the morning and I was, I can do, I literally was like I look like I'm on drugs because I had any

90
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:53.490
Clara Esparza: And I wasn't, I hadn't done anything at that point I was just like, oh my god, I cannot sleep at all. And during. That's why the next week. I did have, like,

91
00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:04.770
Clara Esparza: A few more Suboxone to last that week I had some Suboxone to last me through the weekend because during that time was my stomach ache. It wasn't even taking the Suboxone for like two or three days.

92
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:20.220
Clara Esparza: Because everything was just like, freaking grossi me out. I was like, so sick. My mom was even like are you praying issue to buy me a pregnancy test. I was like, I'm not praying that like I am not praying it like I I knew it was the medication because they've done that to me before.

93
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:28.290
Clara Esparza: Yeah, so like, but finally like, it's okay. Now it lasted like a good week. And finally, it just like started coming down but that's why I had missed group.

94
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.280
Clara Esparza: Who was just bad. It was about a couple weeks.

95
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you just trace back exactly how it and when it started.

96
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.480
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I guess so.

97
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.260
Clara Esparza: Yeah.

98
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You did.

99
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:56.490
Clara Esparza: Yeah, it just, it just sucks it put me. It puts me down to because, you know, I was like, and it's the thing that okay like a few years ago.

100
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:04.920
Clara Esparza: I got an anti depressants. That was, I mean it was a choice. Still, but that was only because I ended up in the hospital.

101
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.610
Clara Esparza: And stuff like that. And this time I actually didn't even need to get to that point, I was like, I need help, you know, and I asked you guys

102
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:21.390
Clara Esparza: And then it just goes like, and I know it's so stupid of thinking about, like, I, I did that, I asked you guys for help. And then afterwards, I seem like it just like

103
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.750
Clara Esparza: Be like, you know, I don't know how to explain it feels like it just like it blows up in my face and then I have a bad stomachache. So that happens.

104
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:45.630
Clara Esparza: So then I couldn't get my soapbox and because of my bad stomachache. And then I had to miss group and like, then I MISSED THE APPOINTMENT WITH YOU, AND IT JUST KK just follow you kept going. It was like something just kept going wrong. I was like, I should have just left myself.

105
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:53.520
Clara Esparza: That's how I was like I should have just stayed like off of medication because that's when it started like

106
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:54.930
Clara Esparza: Like

107
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Actually, actually.

108
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is when you really should have grabbed ahold of the people around you and said, You know, I'm not feeling well. I'm really in a, you know,

109
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Vulnerable state right now. Keep an eye on me. You know what I mean, reached out to people and and realize that when you do ADD medication on like that you have there are going to be some effects. So you knew it.

110
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here you knew that piece.

111
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I totally see how it can be how that could be the domino effect. I mean, it makes perfect sense when you play the tape backward and see step by step.

112
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

113
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you never it's never a wrong choice to reach out you know for how

114
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to not be attached to the outcome.

115
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

116
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.080
Clara Esparza: Yeah.

117
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.270
Clara Esparza: That's true.

118
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so now that you've got the some stuff underneath you. Is the antidepressant working

119
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.840
Clara Esparza: I mean,

120
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.960
Clara Esparza: I haven't really

121
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:13.920
Clara Esparza: I mean, I haven't really felt like a huge difference. But I mean, to be honest, like it's been

122
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:27.450
Clara Esparza: On maybe like on my going on my third week so maybe like I wouldn't feel it. Yeah, and I think that even if I even if it was kind of helping like I think I've been in like such a bad place lately. I wouldn't even notice. You know what I mean, because it's

123
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.530
Clara Esparza: So down either way lately just about life.

124
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:39.630
Clara Esparza: And before it wasn't just like stuff. It was a felt like nothing was happening, like I was doing. You know what I mean. I was just like before. I was actually just

125
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:46.140
Clara Esparza: Down for no reason. And I felt like I was doing good. Like even like work was doing going and then all of a sudden it was like

126
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:53.850
Clara Esparza: I couldn't get out of bed like I just, I didn't feel right, like in my head like I wanted to just like cry for every little thing even like my

127
00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:02.190
Clara Esparza: You know what my anxiety. I've always had, like, I've always had bad anxiety, especially like when I'm outpaces I have like a lot of like

128
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:20.430
Clara Esparza: Social anxiety, I guess, but my anxiety to comes a lot from like my depression because like I'll realize that when I start getting really depressed. Like I feel like everybody's judging me and like everyone's looking at me and everyone can tell that I'm like sad and I'm not feeling right

129
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.630
Clara Esparza: So that's like

130
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:30.990
Clara Esparza: That's where it came in, where like I wasn't even sleeping right because like I would just like lay there and just like overthink if I tell myself stuff in my head so

131
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:48.900
Clara Esparza: That's kind of like that's what was going on there. But I mean, like right now like it could be helping, but I don't even notice the difference because it's been such a bad couple weeks, but hopefully when I get like back on track and like feeling better, you know, everything like

132
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Global tell the difference.

133
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you

134
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What tell me some of the things that you tell that you tell yourself when you're in that negative headspace

135
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me where your where your thoughts go

136
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.690
Clara Esparza: Um,

137
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:16.740
Clara Esparza: I mean, kind of like when I said like, I feel a lot like I tell myself like I'm

138
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:30.570
Clara Esparza: I feel like everyone. And I guess it's because I don't like to show my depression. A lot. So I feel like everyone notices that like something's wrong with me. And then another thing is like I always tell myself a lot that like

139
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:41.520
Clara Esparza: When I tried to reach out to people or I tell my husband, or like my mom like, I'm feeling really depressed and stuff like there. They've always been super supportive like I've never gotten like a really bad like

140
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:48.000
Clara Esparza: You know reaction out of them. They've always told me, like, Oh, well, we're here to talk to you if you like. You need to be on medication like

141
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:57.870
Clara Esparza: That's not our choice like you. You do what you need to do like will go with you. But in my head I hear something different and I i hear like I'm booking

142
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:09.030
Clara Esparza: Do you know what I mean, like, I don't know why I like that. I feel like I'm bothering him like, why can't I just be like, normal which what's normal. I don't think anyone normal but like

143
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.600
Clara Esparza: That's what I

144
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:19.380
Clara Esparza: Call myself is, like, I feel like I'm not being normal. And like I don't want to bother people want like I'm I feel like I'm genuinely bothering them, but they just are being nice. And don't say it.

145
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:29.580
Clara Esparza: But then like when I'm okay. Like right now, like I know that's not the case. You know, like I know that's not it is, but when I'm in that state of mind. Like I feel like that's what it is like

146
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.590
Clara Esparza: I think that's the biggest thing is I tell myself a lot that I'm bothering people and

147
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:48.780
Clara Esparza: They shouldn't have to babysit me and then like the thing that you said is like reach out to people and tell them you like watching me like I'm not feeling good and stuff like that. Like I feel like they're going to get bothered like babysitting me or something.

148
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.450
Clara Esparza: Yeah.

149
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a false lot

150
00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Um, but it you know I I almost want to say it kind of ties into your self esteem.

151
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And not feeling, you know, worthy.

152
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, which

153
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is another falsity. You know what I mean. And when you value, who you are.

154
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you learn to value yourself.

155
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:26.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And these types of things are important that you're able to do it. You know what I mean, they are able to say, you know,

156
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Normal people

157
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what they do when they're not feeling okay and they're going through something they rely on on server people you know they're not server people with a lot. They rely on their, their support system to help them get through these things. You know what I mean.

158
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't always have to be 100% strong it's okay that you you know need somebody once in a while. There's nothing wrong with that. That's what makes us human.

159
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:08.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, doesn't make us less than just makes us human, you know, and you know, really, you've got to start combating those thoughts.

160
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And telling yourself. You know what I mean, almost, you're almost going to create a war inside your thought process dating. No, that's not true. I do deserve to to get help. I do deserve to have, you know, help through this. I don't have to be alone.

161
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll get through this. You know what I mean. And it's about combating that thought process so that you get out of that negative headspace

162
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you've got to, you've got to start feeding yourself. Good stuff, and began to start believing that you're worth that stuff you're worth somebody, you know, helping you through these things because Clara, you ARE

163
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, the thing you know

164
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're human.

165
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And we, by nature, we need other people

166
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just, you know, a fact of of human nature. You know what I mean.

167
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't mean that you're less than. But it's funny when you said normal people. And what is normal, like these days because really, honestly, what is normal.

168
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.370
Yeah.

169
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.870
You know,

170
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And realizing that to that you're just as normal as the next person.

171
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a thought, you know what I mean. And that is the reality. The true reality of life. Nowadays, you know, nobody is better than you. Nobody is above you. You know what I mean. You have just as much right to be supported, when you're having a tough time as what

172
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anybody does

173
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.980
You know,

174
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just that part. You know, you've got to change that thought process and believe that you are worth it. You do deserve these things.

175
00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And knowing when you start a new medication that you might have symptoms you might go through some kind of physical distress and preparing yourself for that as well, you know,

176
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.200
Clara Esparza: Especially since you

177
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:20.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've had you've experienced it in the past. So, you know, you probably are going to have some kind of side effects, you know, and I'm pretty sure that you're not being on Suboxone for a couple days contributed to the bathroom breaks, you know,

178
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.040
Clara Esparza: Definitely

179
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It definitely didn't help the situation, you know,

180
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At all, because not only was your body trying to adjust to the antidepressant, but you're also detoxing off of

181
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your subs.

182
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.030
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I realized

183
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

184
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really funny because you've just tracked back what the leading cause was of this relapse.

185
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You identified not sleeping.

186
00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You identified, you know, your be sick being in a vulnerable position, physically, which puts you in a vulnerable situation mentally and emotionally. Yeah.

187
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which allowed, which allowed for that negative thought process known as your addiction to to creep in and before you even know it. You know,

188
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.410
Yeah.

189
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:33.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's where the stop has to begin, not when when you know it happened before I even knew it before I even knew it, you know, I didn't even give it a second thought before I was buying pills. That's not where you got to, you know, pay attention to its way before

190
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We ever started

191
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so you don't get to that point.

192
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very make sense.

193
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.990
Clara Esparza: It does. Yeah.

194
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.900
Clara Esparza: Makes a lot of sense.

195
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're on your antidepressants. Now you're on your back on your subs.

196
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you're feeling better.

197
00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.390
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm feeling better and not 100% get there you

198
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.140
Clara Esparza: Know funky.

199
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.400
Clara Esparza: Percent but

200
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.440
Clara Esparza: Physically, yeah.

201
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.610
Clara Esparza: Yeah, physically, I feel good. Okay.

202
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.910
Good.

203
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the first step. Right. And the second step is, you know, giving yourself permission to

204
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feel a little weird right now why your body's adjusting to this medication and it gets built up in your system to do the job that it's supposed to do, you know,

205
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and then something else that I want to bring up is that secrets. Keep us sick.

206
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

207
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:44.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you tell yourself that you don't want to bother you know your family members, you know, with your stuff or that you feel like you're a burden on them.

208
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's actually like a, it's a thinking error because the true reality of it is is is

209
00:21:53.610 --> 00:22:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I bet you they would rather support you through that time when you're feeling that then have it get 10 times worse. You know what I mean, and other things happen because you you didn't feel, you know, like you wanted to bother them. You know what I mean.

210
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.330
Clara Esparza: Yeah, no, that's true. I agree.

211
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna work on asking for help.

212
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and being true to being true to who you are, you know, if you're not if you're not feeling okay there's nothing wrong with saying I'm not feeling okay

213
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just not

214
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

215
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.350
Yeah.

216
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you, does it make sense how your disease kind of creeped in when you started having those thoughts about being a burden on on your family and not wanting to let them know where you were at and what was really going on with you.

217
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your addiction then is able to creep in.

218
00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.380
Clara Esparza: And

219
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Add in. You know what I mean. And then the rest of the

220
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:02.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Guys know what to do.

221
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when we're weak and when we're vulnerable and when we're going through things, emotionally, physically or mentally. That's when you know our addiction really comes to life and is

222
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: can grab ahold easily if we don't have safeguards in place, you know,

223
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.490
Yeah.

224
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.950
Clara Esparza: When you yeah

225
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:23.580
Me.

226
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.590
Clara Esparza: Too. Oh, Max.

227
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that your snack.

228
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.950
Clara Esparza: Yeah I don't I don't I don't normally eat out like fast food and stuff.

229
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.230
Clara Esparza: I've never been like a person to, you know, and I'm bringing up. Me too. I just bought traffic.

230
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, OK. Cool. That's good.

231
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

232
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm gonna do this week.

233
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just keep working on getting better.

234
00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:04.740
Clara Esparza: Yeah, just do that and keep working. I mean, honestly. There's not really much to do, everything's kind of closed here.

235
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.560
Clara Esparza: Except stores but

236
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.770
Clara Esparza: Can't do the jam.

237
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.930
Clara Esparza: Nothing like that.

238
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I was thinking about going back to the JAMA are like, well, that's not gonna happen.

239
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.560
Clara Esparza: Anytime soon.

240
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you thought about online meeting.

241
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.180
Clara Esparza: No.

242
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.100
Clara Esparza: I have no

243
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.560
Clara Esparza: No.

244
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.230
Clara Esparza: I mean, I could try it.

245
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.950
Clara Esparza: Is it like

246
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.480
Clara Esparza: Is it like this video, or is it just like chalk.

247
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can actually get engaged in one or the other or even phone by phone. So, and

248
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you go to virtual na is virtual in a.org I think they actually give you different

249
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ways that you can engage in meetings. If you want to just listen for the first, you know, several times. See what it is about what's going on and get a feel of it, then you can just, you know, sign in and listen. You know what I mean.

250
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:13.560
Clara Esparza: Yeah.

251
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He would it's about. There's also the one that another one that some other ladies that I work with are going to which is called women for recovery.

252
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's online.

253
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To it and it's all women.

254
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, that might be another avenue, but you know, I'm going to encourage you to to really step outside the box a little bit and

255
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Check it out.

256
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially since so many things are limited. Right now, you know,

257
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.300
Right.

258
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it might help you get out of your head a little bit, you know, and give you another avenue of support that.

259
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you need when you're when you're feeling those thoughts of or those feelings of not wanting to burn your

260
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, your family, it'll give you another avenue, you know,

261
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.850
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I could try that I'm doing.

262
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:27.540
Clara Esparza: That other counseling to with. It's a counselor. My therapist. She's I actually haven't seen her like in a couple years, but I've been seniors since I was abolished 15

263
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:36.750
Clara Esparza: So I've known her like almost 10 years and I stopped seeing here like these past couple years, but I have called her. I think I mentioned it on group I

264
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:54.060
Clara Esparza: Only had. It was really only because of like what's going on and everything she had some openings, because a lot of people start going rather than that she's usually fully booked. So I'm going to try to see her like every other week, just to do that. So there's another thing.

265
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.170
Good.

266
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

267
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anyway, any place that you can go that you said you trust the person and you're able to speak openly and freely about these thoughts that go on. You know what I mean.

268
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that takes it out of the secret of mode and your addiction cannot latch on to it. Once you get it out again secrets. Keep us sick, especially if we have you know we fight the disease of addiction.

269
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Secrets are horrible for us to hold on to.

270
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

271
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.040
I know

272
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.320
Clara Esparza: Yeah, I know.

273
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.630
Clara Esparza: I know that, but I like to do that for some reason.

274
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

275
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'm hoping that getting you you getting back engaged with your therapist might help you work through that, you know, to where you you're

276
00:27:49.350 --> 00:28:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're able to kind of step out of that way of thinking a little bit because that's not gonna, it's not going to do you any good. You know, it's not. And in, in early recovery that one of the hardest things to do is to pick up the phone, right.

277
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to learn how to be able to do that.

278
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.190
You know,

279
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.050
Clara Esparza: I mean, I'll try to learn

280
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.330
Clara Esparza: No promises.

281
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:24.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, not actually for any promises just asked him for you to try. You know,

282
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.240
Clara Esparza: It will. I'll try.

283
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:34.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and you're gonna check out maybe a couple meetings online and see what's available.

284
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.780
Clara Esparza: I try

285
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. No, that's good.

286
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:53.370
Clara Esparza: I will leave. It's not that I don't want to, like, either. To be honest, like talking to you and talking to one person is okay with me, but even like the groups and stuff. It's a I'm barely getting like super comfortable there.

287
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.590
Clara Esparza: I don't know, it's just talking to, like so many

288
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.260
Clara Esparza: People I think just get a little like

289
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.450
Clara Esparza: More anxiety that

290
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I can tell you that most people that first go into meetings.

291
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hate it.

292
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because of that same thing hate it.

293
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it takes repetition to change it. You know what I mean, getting comfortable in your situation, it's gonna take some time. I mean, that's just the fact of it.

294
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.090
Clara Esparza: Yeah, you know,

295
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.290
Clara Esparza: I know like you've been our friday group I'm doing the getting comfortable with that.

296
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:34.650
Clara Esparza: Right, so I know I should give it a chance. But I'm stubborn.

297
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know, but just know that

298
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more that you do that now.

299
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The less uncomfortable. You're going to be when you really need it.

300
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know what I mean.

301
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.300
Clara Esparza: Yeah.

302
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.530
Makes sense.

303
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.270
It does.

304
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Alright, so I've given you some things to work on this week.

305
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:00.990
Clara Esparza: Okay.

306
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.810
Clara Esparza: OK, I will find them.

307
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you start seeing your windy windy don't see a therapist.

308
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.610
Clara Esparza: Well, I saw her.

309
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.680
Clara Esparza: Last week,

310
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.200
Clara Esparza: I saw her the Thursday before group and then so it's gonna be like every other week, so not this week next week.

311
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.370
Okay.

312
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and so we can

313
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can do check ins the alternate weeks that you're not seeing her

314
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:40.890
Clara Esparza: Okay.

315
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just, you know, check in, see where you're at, to see how things are going. See what's working, what's not working, you know, and just really kind of hone in on that piece, while you're working with your therapist.

316
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.120
Clara Esparza: And I said, Okay, yeah.

317
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:09.780
Clara Esparza: When I was there and I was filling out the paperwork. I did but that I was like seeing you guys again. But you guys could like, you know, talk to her, but I don't really know how that works. I don't know if I have to sign something with you guys.

318
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you have to send something with bright heart. So when you when you call back into the virtual clinic, let them know that you need a release of information.

319
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they'll get her to okay

320
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:22.110
Okay.

321
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And definitely, if we can kind of work together.

322
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you'll get the best outcome that there is, you know,

323
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

324
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:38.730
Clara Esparza: Alrighty.

368
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.820
Alex Gomez: I also wanted to talk about

369
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.500
Alex Gomez: The day I was arrested and what was going on with me today.

370
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.400
Uh huh.

371
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ahead.

372
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.990
Alex Gomez: Oh, I was having lots of visuals and

373
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.380
Alex Gomez: Um, the TV was like, it felt like it was talking straight to me.

374
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.790
Alex Gomez: That there's like famous actors on this show.

375
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:57.480
Alex Gomez: On the CW um it was super girl and like Superman or the flash and there's a lot of superheroes and in this in this episode that I was watching the day I was rested.

376
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:04.500
Alex Gomez: And so I just went for a bike ride to go clear my head because it was kind of it was scaring me.

377
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.340
Alex Gomez: So I went for a bike ride and then

378
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:22.890
Alex Gomez: To try to clear my head and everything from what was being said like directly to me from the TV. So I was trying to clear my head. I was doing tricks and stuff in the parking lot, you know, trying to clear my head and everything and then

379
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:35.130
Alex Gomez: For some reason, I don't know what got into me, but I threw my bike, I was carrying my bag on my back, and then I just threw it like on the barking everything and I walked in the hotel.

380
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:47.340
Alex Gomez: And I hopped on the computer and like I own the place, you know, and I was like okay well I'm still look on something online real quick and then all of a sudden the cops show up and I'm like,

381
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:58.650
Alex Gomez: Next thing I know, like they tell me to put my hands behind my back and I looked at him, I was like, What's going on, like, you're not supposed to be. I was like, Wait, what, and I didn't know what was going on. So then

382
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.910
Alex Gomez: They arrested me and then start pulling me towards the car.

383
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.080
Alex Gomez: And I must have blacked out because I don't remember anything after that.

384
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.000
Alex Gomez: I only remember

385
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.370
Alex Gomez: waking up in the morning.

386
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:23.820
Alex Gomez: And will then and then them letting me out of my cell and then me having to walk all the way home from jail so I don't even know what I was saying.

387
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.680
Alex Gomez: That I was having lots of visuals, while I was in the in myself.

388
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.170
Alex Gomez: There's like this, like this picture on my wall of like an outline

389
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.890
Alex Gomez: Of like it kind of looks like a Godzilla picture.

390
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that

391
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:47.580
Alex Gomez: It's like it. It's on this our side of the wall, but it ended up showing up in my cell in my holding cell.

392
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.180
Alex Gomez: And I'm wondering like how is that possible.

393
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.760
Alex Gomez: Like it might. It might just

394
00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.000
Alex Gomez: Seeing that are they just showing me that picture to make me feel more comfortable.

395
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With any mental health diagnosis.

396
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.330
Alex Gomez: Was that

397
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have any mental health diagnosis.

398
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:15.510
Alex Gomez: I have depression I suffer from anxiety and that's separate from curable bowel syndrome.

399
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um,

400
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you tell Dr. Davidson about your

401
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.820
Alex Gomez: Visual well my hat.

402
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.640
Alex Gomez: I haven't told her that I'm specifically

403
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.090
Alex Gomez: In group with other people, but

404
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

405
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.350
Alex Gomez: I feel more comfortable telling just one person instead of a bunch of people is

406
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.520
Understandable. Yeah.

407
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just the

408
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Only time that you've had the visuals, as it happened before.

409
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:55.680
Alex Gomez: It's happened before. And then sometimes like because I smoke a lot of we just like Comic Con my anxiety down everything and make me feel like let me help.

410
00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.140
Alex Gomez: But, um, sometimes it feels like my third eye opens and it sounds

411
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.260
Alex Gomez: Kind of sounds like a buzzing sound.

412
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.150
Alex Gomez: Like

413
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:11.130
Alex Gomez: Like a machine, kind of like, it's like kind of like a digital sound.

414
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:17.250
Alex Gomez: Mm hmm. And I can hear that. And then like I feel it all over my body.

415
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:24.180
Alex Gomez: And then I hear that sound and then it just like it wakes me up, like, to the point to where I'm scared.

416
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:31.770
Alex Gomez: And I don't know. I don't know how to take that feeling because I've never felt. I've never felt like that before.

417
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When did it start

418
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:40.380
Alex Gomez: Um, it started probably the day I got released from jail.

419
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:44.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how much marijuana do smoke.

420
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:51.090
Alex Gomez: I smoke as much as possible. I mean, I'll I can't afford it. So, I mean, I

421
00:39:52.890 --> 00:40:01.830
Alex Gomez: Have like some shake and stuff. It doesn't really give me a high, but I try to smoke as much as possible. Just like keep me calm and so I'd be able to have an appetite me

422
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because

423
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.140
Alex Gomez: I do, I do suffer from

424
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.830
Alex Gomez: Addiction to methamphetamines because I was using methamphetamine since I was 12 years old.

425
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

426
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.070
Alex Gomez: So I should have been dead by now.

427
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:28.680
Alex Gomez: And and I'm just scared that if I if I go back to that drug that I'll have, I'll start hallucinating again and start seeing these visuals and circling really afraid.

428
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you haven't used any any

429
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No man men were

430
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.900
Alex Gomez: Not since before I got arrested. That was the last time I use

431
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is last last time.

432
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.050
Alex Gomez: Yeah, it was about a month ago, about a month.

433
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.450
Alex Gomez: Month and a week ago.

434
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:50.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, you haven't used any math.

435
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At all.

436
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This week, no.

437
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.310
Yes.

438
00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I'm gonna give this information to Dr. Jamison so that she is aware of these things that are going on with you. You know, it's important that she does where. Okay, where do you get your we your marijuana from

439
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:23.040
Alex Gomez: Um, well i i tried ordering it online, but they cut me off because I ordered some online. But for some reason, I couldn't get my money out from my debit card.

440
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

441
00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:32.430
Alex Gomez: Cuz I'm collecting unemployment right now. So he ended up coming by and I didn't, I didn't have the money. So my mom said maybe next time. So they cut me off.

442
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:43.830
Alex Gomez: From the online website. So I can't work anymore. There was no online. So I pretty much have to ask people that I know like around town, there's any way in any way.

443
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:50.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, and keep in mind that not knowing where the sources, not knowing where it comes from.

444
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.000
Alex Gomez: But

445
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can we be vulnerable to have things in there that you aren't anticipating to have it you know in there.

446
00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So there's that piece.

447
00:41:59.490 --> 00:41:59.970
Right.

448
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you want to pay attention to that and be careful.

449
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you don't know you just, you don't know whose hands it passed through. I mean, it's like that too, with the dispensary but they definitely have more regulations than just, you know, the old fashioned way of of

450
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:26.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, getting marijuana and with the with the dispensaries and stuff. You just, you don't know. You know when you're getting it from friends. What's

451
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.810
You know,

452
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

453
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.250
Alex Gomez: The process that they go through and

454
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.850
Alex Gomez: So yeah, I'm very cautious about this.

455
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know marijuana it there's certain strains of marijuana that do have, you know, a hallucinogenic property to it. So there's that piece to have you thought about

456
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not smoking weed for a couple days to see if they go away.

457
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.010
Alex Gomez: I'm, um,

458
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.870
Alex Gomez: I mean,

459
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:06.090
Alex Gomez: The way that I'm smoking right now is like pretty much like just like smoking cigarette. It gives me a little bit.

460
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.190
Alex Gomez: But it doesn't give me where I where I need to be like, you know, like

461
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:27.540
Alex Gomez: I like to be stoned to the point where I could just lay and relax and not worry about this. We're just like it just gives me a little bit of buzz, but it just, it makes me want to search for more weeks it's not it's not very good.

462
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you thought about talking to Dr. Jamison about giving you something for anxiety that

463
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.930
Alex Gomez: They've given me hydroxide Zane and

464
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:50.310
Alex Gomez: You have a pittance, but my mom doesn't like me take down a bit because her patient used to take everything and it's shut down his kidneys. So

465
00:43:51.480 --> 00:44:05.100
Alex Gomez: Um, they they prescribed me three times a day. I think it's the 300 milligrams and it still wasn't even worth one, I would have to take like a fistful of the gap and just for me to relax.

466
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.590
Alex Gomez: And I dressed up. Yeah.

467
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:12.120
Alex Gomez: Yeah, the hydrazine, the fish a prescribed me

468
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.960
Alex Gomez: Three to four times a day, and it still doesn't help.

469
00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

470
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, yeah, let me give Dr. Jamison Miss information, you know, definitely. So that she knows. And so the last time that you had these visuals was a month ago.

471
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.830
Alex Gomez: Yes. And when I went to jail.

472
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it was right at the time, the day before you went to jail you did some math.

473
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:49.770
Alex Gomez: Yes, but I did sleep at night, but I was still kind of it was still in my system so still kind of doing it.

474
00:44:52.020 --> 00:45:00.360
Alex Gomez: But I was just like blown away at how that that picture is kind of like the outline of Godzilla.

475
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.830
Alex Gomez: And underneath this white wall is the green

476
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:15.900
Alex Gomez: A green coat of paint. And that same picture that was on my wall right here showed up in my cell. And it's not on my wall anymore.

477
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.080
Alex Gomez: So someone must have came in and rubbed on my wall.

478
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.420
Alex Gomez: And then rub them on myself.

479
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.380
Alex Gomez: And had that picture like put up there.

480
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:34.230
Alex Gomez: For some reason to like make me feel calm or something or make people comfortable because it's in my room so I do feel comfortable in my room.

481
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:42.900
Alex Gomez: But I was just like blown away about, like, I bet you anything. If I went back to that cell that picture what

482
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you think that you might have mentally put it there.

483
00:45:48.240 --> 00:46:01.320
Alex Gomez: I have no idea, but it was there all night. And then there was writing. I was, I was looking all over the cell is writing on the on the ground. There's a heart. And then there's like famous people's names on the walls.

484
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:09.000
Alex Gomez: From the episode, I was watching. I forget their names, but they were famous people's names and

485
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.140
Alex Gomez: I was just really delusional that way.

486
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's what it sounds like. And it could it be a direct result of the method you use

487
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:30.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. That's definitely a piece of Matthews is the paranoia, you know the the visual

488
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:32.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Message psychosis, for sure.

489
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so if it continues and you're not using math, then you know definitely then what I would think is being referred to a psychiatrist for for further mental health evaluation, you know,

490
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:58.650
Alex Gomez: Yeah, that's what my psychiatrist said I have seen one on Friday, and she said all doctors aren't psychiatrists and whatever. And she's like, she's nice like high stress.

491
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:13.920
Alex Gomez: So she's like, You need to go see psychiatrists on a regular basis for this problem because she pretty much been helped me, she said as she can help me and she had to leave early so that that made me feel like she can help me at all.

492
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she was a psychiatrist.

493
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:21.120
Alex Gomez: Yeah, I have her card was her name.

494
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.770
Alex Gomez: So we're here by the cleaner. The valley is playing next to the hospital.

495
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:38.340
Alex Gomez: Or her name is Carol J Hanson psycho psycho therapist.

496
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:40.470
Alex Gomez: Yeah.

497
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.750
Alex Gomez: Yeah, her number and everything's

498
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.220
Alex Gomez: Oh,

499
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, she's a Licensed Marriage and family therapist is where she is.

500
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, so she's not a psychiatrist. So she couldn't diagnose you

501
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:06.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because she's a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, you actually want a psychiatrist or even even

502
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dr. Jamison, can you know definitely

503
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Help you with the mental health aspect.

504
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:19.350
Alex Gomez: And I, and I quit taking my image depression medicine because it just, it just wasn't making me feel

505
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.690
Alex Gomez: Like when I was working at all.

506
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.110
Alex Gomez: Um, I quit taking him in a long time ago, like maybe like

507
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.980
Alex Gomez: Four months ago.

508
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.540
Alex Gomez: But I'm still really kind of depressed and I can't get out of this funk.

509
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:41.820
Alex Gomez: I just feel like I'm not, I don't feel like I'm a free so like, you know, I can move freely. I feel like I'm just like, stuck in one spot, all the time, and it makes me feel trapped

510
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So again, that's something that, you know, Dr. Jamison is, is your doctor. Your prescribing doctor so she would be the one that be able to, you know, help you. Is she the one that prescribed you that your antidepressants.

511
00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.690
Alex Gomez: Know clinical a was

512
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:19.860
Alex Gomez: Um, so I probably would have to talk to them because their clinic, ladies. And when I go in there and physically talk to them and they and they check me on everything. I'm Dr. Jamison just the one that surprised me. My opiate medication. The Suboxone there's causes absolved

513
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.860
Alex Gomez: From Suboxone so I only see here for for this problem.

514
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:34.260
Alex Gomez: But I wouldn't like to get awesome different antidepressants, because just, I just don't know how to deal with this.

515
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're going to talk to the people that gave it to you before and meet with them.

516
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm gonna have to make

517
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:53.340
Alex Gomez: Another appointment. Yeah, because just like I've been off my energy presence for so long. I just don't know. What do I mean I've taken pretty much every brand that they own that me

518
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:54.870
The

519
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:06.450
Alex Gomez: Name of one of them that they used to give me it seemed to help because then I was taking that and I was completely sober. I quit smoking weed.

520
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:20.580
Alex Gomez: I'm, um, and quit doing drugs and everything. And I was completely sober for like up to like five months was the longest time I was sober and that was the first time. My wife left me. My ex wife.

521
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When are you going to make an appointment with them.

522
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.180
Alex Gomez: Um today. Oh, I'll make another point today.

523
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and ask them if they have a

524
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Somebody that can

525
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluate you you for mental health, such as a psychiatrist or

526
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nurse a psych nurse practitioner somebody that

527
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: has the capability to

528
00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, diagnose your mental health and determine whether or not your visuals are a piece of your Matthews, or whether it's something else. And somebody at the same time, there'll be somebody that can monitor your depression medication and alter it or up it lower it whatever you know

529
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you want somebody that's gonna help you with depression somebody that can

530
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:35.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluate you and diagnose you as far as mental health goes for for your visuals, because when I first hear when I hear that because you haven't continually had any

531
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would associate that with your Matthews. Yeah, the visuals. You know what I mean. And, and maybe that's it. Maybe that's all it was.

532
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But again, I am a, you know, masters level substance abuse counselor and I don't have the qualifications to I, you know, to diagnose you as far as that kind of stuff goes

533
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But definitely, that's the kind of person that you want to see. All right. Yeah. And so you're going to call them, you're going to see if they have that

534
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Somebody that can diagnose you

535
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Assess you assess your mental health and and help you with your depression.

536
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we'll be able to determine, you know, you'll be able to determine off of that. But again, you have to have those certain time off of

537
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:43.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A math. You have any free and clear math. Right, right. You have to tell them about your marijuana usage and you know that you're on subs. I'm in anything else that you're on so that they can determine whether or not you're in

538
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whether or not they're able to assess you with those in your system that makes sense.

539
00:52:50.010 --> 00:53:00.870
Alex Gomez: Yeah, and I tried to talk to another place that over there by the clinic. I'm just to go talk to somebody about my problems and they ended up blocking me in there.

540
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.220
Alex Gomez: Or a 24 hour lockdown. And they labeled me once

541
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're ready to commit suicide.

542
00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:10.860
Alex Gomez: No, I just wanted to talk to somebody

543
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:18.600
Alex Gomez: And all night. All they did was just locked me in that place and sit me in front of the TV and asked me if I was hungry.

544
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:26.700
Alex Gomez: And I was like, No, I just want to talk to somebody and then my mom ended up leaving and just left me there all night and I was just like, freaking out.

545
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:33.390
Alex Gomez: I was like, You guys aren't even helped me. You guys are just sitting in front of the TV like guys aren't even talking like

546
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:45.900
Alex Gomez: There's other people in there that were saying, you know, for math using coming down off of drugs and everything. So they're they're withdrawing in there too. So I was just like, I just wanted someone to talk to you and me walking in every night.

547
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They want to do. You were detoxing

548
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:50.580
Alex Gomez: I'm

549
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.710
Alex Gomez: Not necessarily. I was more depressed and scared.

550

Alex Gomez: Okay, but

551
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.960
Alex Gomez: There was no one there to like talk to me about was

552
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.620

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can understand what how that would make you feel that way.

554

555
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:32.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just holding you for that for you know that 24 hours was in your best interest you know maybe that's why they did it. I don't know. I'm not them. I can't read their mind, but that would make sense to me, you know,
