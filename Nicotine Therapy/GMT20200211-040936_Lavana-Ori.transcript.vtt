293
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:24.990
LTE: That my car, you know that that aside, I wouldn't have enough to get a car and realistically get into a place

294
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.710
Lavana Oriley: Okay, and that would take care of the kids while you're at work.

295
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.290

302
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:54.600
LTE: No, not at all. Okay, so, and but that's why I've asked me for this three month is, I know that I'm not ready yet. I need

LTE: But I know, that's why I know I need at least three months, you know, to

309

LTE: Okay, yeah, and I

317
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.640

LTE: I

319
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:36.990
Lavana Oriley: Need a lawyer to go to court and say, first of all, pretty much your mother has taken your kids. She forced you into signing this agreement, she took your car.

320
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:44.250
Lavana Oriley: Cheese not allowing you to see your kids on a regular basis in a normal way.

321
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.420
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, unsupervised and

322
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:54.750
Lavana Oriley: I think you're, you're going to have to fight this in court because you did the paperwork.

327
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.050
Lavana Oriley: But I really honestly think you're going to need a lawyer and

328
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.640
LTE: The lawyer will be

329
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.390
Lavana Oriley: Able to speak for you. Let the judge know that you know your mother's taking your car taking your children, basically.

Yeah.

332
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.680
Lavana Oriley: You can always call the police and say my car got stolen.

Lavana Oriley: You know,

341
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:39.870
Lavana Oriley: It's not up to her. She is in charge of your life. She's not get to say that you have to have supervised visits or that

342
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.410
Lavana Oriley: Years from now you get to have your kids, she's

343
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.600
Lavana Oriley: Not the judge and jury of your life.

344
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.720
Lavana Oriley: And I know you don't want to piss her off.

349
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:09.780

Lavana Oriley: You cannot keep giving into your mom to not make her mad because you're either way you're not getting what you want and whether you make her mad or not. You're still not getting your way.

360
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.090
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, so

361
00:49:51.750 --> 00:50:00.540

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:05.970
LTE: And she's not

378
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:12.270

470
00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:40.620
LTE: When I moved out all she talked about is the money, you know, and so I have a feeling, she's gonna have a hard time giving that up, you know,

471
00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:42.750
LTE: The longer
