00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:29.580
Saraniah Aston: hated me for some reason. And he wasn't a doctor. And when I asked him if he was a doctor, like a nurse practitioner or whatever. He said, It's none of your business. And after that, I started asking questions and more questions and the whole clinic.

128
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.370
Saraniah Aston: They didn't like that. So they got rid of me in a nasty way.

174
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.680
Saraniah Aston: Anyone else and

175
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:54.060
Saraniah Aston: And my grandmother was a heroin addict, but I believe she's a drink. She just a drinker now. Okay.

176
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.300
Alright.

177
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.120
Chris Alliman MD: Any outstanding or current legal issues for you.

178
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.990
Saraniah Aston: Know,

179
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.320
Chris Alliman MD: No probation, parole or anything.

180
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.260
Saraniah Aston: No, I've never been to jail.

181
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.060
Chris Alliman MD: Good. I'm glad to hear that.

182
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.470
Chris Alliman MD: And then a little awkward question, but when we ask is any were you abused as a child.

183
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.550
No.

184
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.960
Good.

185
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:31.860
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to run. We are going to get you a prescription for Suboxone today. We'll get that taken care of, just to put your mind at ease. How much do you know about our program.

186
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.630
Saraniah Aston: Um, little bits is there's a weekly group meeting.

187
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.090
Saraniah Aston: And I'm assuming there's a therapist therapist or counselor. Yeah.

188
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.720
Saraniah Aston: Very good.

189
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.700
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so there's weekly

190
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.080
Chris Alliman MD: group meetings and then their weekly therapy individual therapy meetings also

191
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.300
Chris Alliman MD: And generally, for the first month we write two prescriptions, a week.

192
00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:07.920
Chris Alliman MD: And it bridges between those times. So you get one that goes from group to therapy and then when you attend therapy. There's another one that gets sent in to get you back to the group time. And so for the first month we just kind of bridge them together.

193
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:23.970
Chris Alliman MD: We found that that's the once people have bought into the value of the therapy, then we're able to space that out and just do one once a week prescriptions. But we found that if we do the weekly prescriptions at the beginning. People just kind of don't go to therapy so

194
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.380
Saraniah Aston: Oh, OK.

195
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.080
Chris Alliman MD: So we kind of hold that pretty tight for folks.

196
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:36.300
Chris Alliman MD: And we'll come together to the end at the end here and talk about what group and what things will work for you.

197
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.980
Saraniah Aston: Soon to that.

198
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.810
Chris Alliman MD: Now I get to that at the end. But I have a few other questions, not a few I got a lot of other questions.

199
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:55.050
Chris Alliman MD: First of all, here these are kind of yes or no questions going back to the time when you are actually using the the short acting opiates the hydrocodone owns the

200
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.210
Saraniah Aston: Heroin and stuff so

201
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:05.520
Chris Alliman MD: Think about it. And during those times. If you don't understand the questions and you need me to repeat them i or rephrase them. I certainly can. Okay.

202
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.320
Saraniah Aston: Okay. All right.

203
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.700
Chris Alliman MD: So are you taking the short acting opiates and larger amounts or over a longer period of time than initially intended

204
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.350
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

205
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.050
Chris Alliman MD: Was there a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control their use.

206
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.450
Saraniah Aston: No. Okay.

207
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:38.430
Chris Alliman MD: Did you have to spend a great deal of time in activities, trying to get the short acting opiates use them or recover from them.

208
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.520
Saraniah Aston: I'm sorry, I don't understand. Sure.

209
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.570
So,

210
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:56.280
Chris Alliman MD: The short acting opiates, you have to spend a lot of time finding them. If you're getting them off the street, if it was a prescription. That's not going to be hard.

211
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:10.800
Chris Alliman MD: And a lot of time using them, you know, getting through there through their effects or a lot of time recovering from using them that the time it takes to kind of get through using them.

212
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.950
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I'll try to answer that question.

213
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.370
Saraniah Aston: No. Okay.

214
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.620
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Did you have cravings, or a strong desire to use the opiates.

215
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.030
Yes.

216
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:37.620
Chris Alliman MD: Did using them cause failure to fulfill roles at work at school or at home.

217
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.700
No.

218
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:46.980
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue using them, even though they might have caused social or relationship problems.

219
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.690
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

220
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:56.970
Chris Alliman MD: Did you have to give up important social, occupational or recreational activities because of the short acting opiates.

221
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.170
No.

222
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.530
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use in situations that were hazardous like driving

223
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.960
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

224
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.400
Chris Alliman MD: And did you continue to use despite knowing that they could cause physical or psychological problems.

225
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.220
Saraniah Aston: I used

226
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.740
Saraniah Aston: I didn't know that they can have psychological problems that I use them.

227
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.330
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, physical problems was the other part.

228
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.410
Saraniah Aston: Um, I didn't know. So

229
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:35.550
Chris Alliman MD: That's fine.

230
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.800

Saraniah Aston: I don't, I don't have hepatitis. Okay, good.

233
00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:02.340
Chris Alliman MD: That's I think they probably talk to you about getting blood work done later on. And that's one of the things that we will that will be included in the blood work is just checking on that to make sure

234
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.160
Chris Alliman MD: It's so readily readily

235
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.540
Chris Alliman MD: treatable. Now we want to make sure we get people taken care of.

236
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.070
Saraniah Aston: Okay, good. Well, my doctor is on top of that.

237
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.090
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that as well. They should be. That's really good.

Saraniah Aston: No, but I'm not sexually active. Okay.

245
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.610
Chris Alliman MD: The reason I ask is just for your information Suboxone can cause birth defects. So you want to be aware of that.

246
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.050
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right, so we're going to run through

247

Chris Alliman MD: Some symptoms kind of starting at the top working our way through things either yes or no questions, and we're thinking about the last two weeks, basically. Alright.

248
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.170

318
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.060
Chris Alliman MD: All over just curious to know if you have any pain as you do that.

319
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.260
Okay.

320
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.760

Chris Alliman MD: Little cramping.

323
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.270

324
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.070

338
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:20.790

339
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:27.750

371
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:51.810

377
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:36.960
Chris Alliman MD: Sometimes there are activities that take writing. We also ask that you not wear a hat, just so we can see your face. Well, and then we also ask that you not smoke during the meeting because that can be a trigger for some people to start craving.

378
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.910
