42
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.970
William’s iPhone: So,

43
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.220
William’s iPhone: something's working there.

44
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.920
William’s iPhone: Good. Now I did screw up and did a little math, but that that was in the past.

45
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.170
Dr Katrina Groves: And when was that, do you remember

Dr Katrina Groves: Holiday. Yeah.

50
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.440

51
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.590
William’s iPhone: Lesson learned. Never again. Yeah.

52
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.240

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:27.960
Dr Katrina Groves: Narcotics and I know it started out or any actually any substance. Some people like they started when they were five years old, sneaking alcohol or cigarettes. What did you first take and when

William’s iPhone: So, yeah.

61
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.790

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.410
William’s iPhone: Me.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.300

67
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.320

William’s iPhone: Opposed just hanging around the crowd.

69
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.200

William’s iPhone: No, not at the young age, but in high school, they did.

73
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.480

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.600
William’s iPhone: I became a real bad drinker.

75
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.190

76
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.200
William’s iPhone: Well, I was going to counseling.

77
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.140
William’s iPhone: It was through the school, though.

78
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.580

79
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.470

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.290
William’s iPhone: I was an alcoholic ran in my family.

81
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.610
Yeah.

82
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Exactly and who, in your family has alcoholism.

83
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Your mother and father

84
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.810
Yes.

85
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.010
William’s iPhone: Yeah, growing up. They were both drinkers.

86
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. Do you think that they did you see them drunk. Did you see them abusive to each other or to you.

87
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.110
William’s iPhone: They were never really abusive. There was just always drums

88
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.060
William’s iPhone: Sometimes they were abusive each other. I did see it.

89
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.130
Dr Katrina Groves: And that can kind of stress out a kid.

90
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.300
Yeah.

91
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.300
William’s iPhone: I'm worried about my son now.

92
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Why is that

93
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.080
William’s iPhone: You came up to me and told me that he's a he's only 12 years old.

94
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.030
William’s iPhone: And he says he's bisexual.

95
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.600
William’s iPhone: And I don't see

96
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.130
William’s iPhone: That don't see it. You know where he got it from, or anything.

97
00:08:48.600 --> 00:09:01.320
Dr Katrina Groves: So a lot of kids that age, they really try to experiment with different things and maybe he's afraid of experimenting with drugs because have you talked to him about your own issues or

98
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:09.330
William’s iPhone: Oh yeah, if he knows he's, he does not like drugs. Good. No salads. He knows what it did to to the family.

99
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:17.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. So at 12 years old. It doesn't mean that it's for sure a lot of kids here stuff on the news and the

100
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Internet. It's all over there like, oh, you know, be gay be lesbian, gay, bisexual,

101
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Because, as a society, we're trying to bring people closer and try not to label people

102
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.170
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

103
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.990
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, possibly the best thing you could do is

104
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.940
Dr Katrina Groves: Try not to judge and try not to panic and

105
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.720
William’s iPhone: Although I didn't

106
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.600
William’s iPhone: I told it whatever's I was be

107
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.850
William’s iPhone: The best parent. I can I support him whatever I can call them support them.

108
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.110
Dr Katrina Groves: And also it's okay though to tell him your feelings like

109
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.020
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, you seem like a pretty handsome.

110
00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:03.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Boy, and it's kind of early for you to pick what you're going to be, you know, you know, know for sure if you're going to be a firefighter or or what you're, you know,

111
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.470
Dr Katrina Groves: After so it's kind of early to don't

112
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.560
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, it's important for kids to know that they're going to have lots of different feelings.

113
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.760
Dr Katrina Groves: But that not to settle on any one thing

114
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.490
Dr Katrina Groves: But just to talk about it.

115
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Is he going to counseling, because that's really hard when your parents are divorcing

116
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.040
William’s iPhone: Is

117
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Has he talked to his counselor about it.

118
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.150
William’s iPhone: I don't know if he has it.

119
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:40.860
Dr Katrina Groves: You might want to just bring X, ask him, because a lot of kids gone through divorce. They have an identity crisis and asked him to talk to his counselor.

120
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.590
William’s iPhone: Okay. All I ask is because

121
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, or just suggest that he do so.

122
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:56.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so going back to your substance abuse, then your alcoholism. When did you get heavy duty into the narcotics into the opioids.

123
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.150

Dr Katrina Groves: And what got you into the pills. Was it just that it made them that the alcohol work better.

128
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.200

129
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.910

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:19.830
Jacob Badura: My grandpa was drinking some BlackBerry brandy, and I asked him for a glass and he gave me a glass and I got really, really intoxicated from it and I didn't like it.

619
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:30.330
Jacob Badura: And I've never been a fan of alcohol or anything like that but smoking cigarettes. I started smoking when I was like 12 or 13 I believe

620
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:35.880
Jacob Badura: I started chewing first actually because of baseball. Then I started smoking after that.

621
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.760
Jacob Badura: And marijuana. I started using marijuana. When I was 13 I think

622
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:54.750
Jacob Badura: And I never used anything other than marijuana until I was probably 21 years old.

623
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:05.160
Jacob Badura: And probably around 21 or 22 is the first time I ever tried Xanax

624
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.230
Jacob Badura: And I was instantly addicted to it, the very first time I tried it. I was addicted.

625
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:27.600
Jacob Badura: And then I never tried anything else until I was probably about 24 and then I tried math.

626
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.530
Jacob Badura: And I use math for about a year.

627
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:43.710
Jacob Badura: And then after that, I started using exam. Well, I was pretty much Xanax, or what time because I had a prescription for it back then.

628
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.640
Jacob Badura: And then popular now is

629
00:43:50.040 --> 00:44:02.970
Jacob Badura: Think 27 or 28 was when I first started trying words first started taking opiate pills. I was taking vitamin and stuff like that to try to combat the withdrawals from the Xanax

630
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.380
Jacob Badura: I hate it.

631
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:14.700
Jacob Badura: Back then, they made me really really sick. Every time I took them but it helped me with the withdrawals from the Xanax and then eventually I stopped.

632
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.630
Jacob Badura: Getting sick from taking the opiates and I started liking the feeling of it.

633
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.220
Jacob Badura: And that's when I became addicted to opiates.

634
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.450
Dr Katrina Groves: And continue to use the Xanax as well.

635
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:46.650
Jacob Badura: I'm not as much as I did, then I I didn't ever want to really become addicted to any kind of benzo again. So I took him still but I took him sparingly, because I knew that if I took it every day that the withdrawal was

636
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.840
Jacob Badura: It was it. It's something I didn't really ever want to experience.

637
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:06.300
Dr Katrina Groves: And then so from 28 or. So you started using opioids, like every day off the street.

638
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.220
Jacob Badura: Yeah.

639
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you graduate into anything else after that. Did you go to heroin.

640
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.210
Jacob Badura: Um, I never tried heroin until

641
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.160
Jacob Badura: Or yeah, since late 2015 was the first time ever tried heroin.

642
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.460
Dr Katrina Groves: And then

643
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:33.780
Jacob Badura: I did.

644
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.810
Jacob Badura: Um,

645
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.460
Jacob Badura: That, at first I didn't really

646
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.660
Jacob Badura: Do too much of it because that's when I was still in the Suboxone

647
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.310
Jacob Badura: And so I would do it every once in a while and then

648
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.330
Jacob Badura: When I stopped using the Suboxone is when I got deep into it.

649
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:05.820
Dr Katrina Groves: And then how did you get yourself back out. I mean, what did you go to detox what what got you wanting to get clean again. Did something happen.

650
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:17.640
Jacob Badura: Um, I think it was after my sister died and after going down there to the funeral and stuff is when I really started

651
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:31.500
Jacob Badura: To evaluate where my life was heading and i just i knew i was either going to die or end up in prison. Within a few years, and I just didn't want my mom to have to go through that.

652
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.480
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

653
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.620
Dr Katrina Groves: And so, um, does this Suboxone work for you as far as. Do you have cravings still

654
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.910
Jacob Badura: I you know I I can't even remember the last time I even thought about using drugs.

655
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:04.800
Jacob Badura: Cool, I, I actually found a bolo Viking in one time at a job site.

656
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.310
Jacob Badura: And I threw it away that's ever thrown away any drugs ever in my life.

657
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:26.970
Jacob Badura: Even back in the day, even if it wasn't something I was using, I would still went and tried to sell it somewhere, trying to make money off that or something, but I haven't even seen or talked anybody that has that I know that use drugs in the last two years.

658
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:36.570
Jacob Badura: I just don't associate with anybody that does anything like that anymore. It's just, it's not even a part of my life, even in smallest sense

659
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.980
Dr Katrina Groves: It sounds like you totally turned your life around. I mean, completely

660
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:54.750
Jacob Badura: It is, it's a total of one ad from the way I used to be and not just the way I used to act, but my total mind state is completely changed you.

661
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Know you have a family, you have a little girl and how right

662
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.070
Jacob Badura: Yep, we have a baby boy on the way.

663
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm. When does he do

664
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.160
Jacob Badura: On August 10 is that new day.

665
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Very cool.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:19.200
Dr Katrina Groves: And is your mom still living with you guys, or how is where, who are you living with now.

Jacob Badura: Yeah, we're still we're still at my parents house right now.

668
00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:32.850
Jacob Badura: We're hoping they'll be getting out of here, but with everything that's going on right now. I don't see that happening, probably

669
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:44.730
Jacob Badura: Right within probably. I mean, whenever it all this is done and over with. We definitely have enough money to where we can move into anywhere we wanted to. We've been saving money for the last few years, so

670
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, I just great.

671
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:59.790
Jacob Badura: Yeah, not paying the bills or anything like that, really, except for, you know, the few things we bought like a car and the bed and stuff like that we've been able to save actually pretty good so

672
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Excellent. Yeah, and

673
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.730

Excellent.

678
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:29.640
Dr Katrina Groves: So the construction economy hasn't dropped down like some of the other jobs.

679
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:43.230
Jacob Badura: Well, no, not the I don't work for a person, per se. I pretty much. I'm an independent contractor, but the guy that I'm working or the person that I'm working for

680
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:56.160
Jacob Badura: They own a huge farm up in Brookings and they own the farmers market there. And so I built a house for his daughter. I built in addition onto her house and remodeled it and now

682
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.180

Jacob Badura: The next three or four years out.

684
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.930

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.400
Jacob Badura: Yeah, it's comforting knowing that

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.210
Jacob Badura: I'm secure for at least the next three or four years.

690
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. And that'll be great on your resume, no matter where you do after that.

691
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:46.920
Jacob Badura: Well, I'm hoping on getting my contractor's license sometime in that next few years to

692
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:59.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Excellent. So any legal trouble left over from the last of the past they were you ever in jail. Oh yeah, you said you weren't worried about prison and jail is that all pass now or

693
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:08.160
Jacob Badura: Yeah, no, I don't have any legal things pending. I didn't have any legal stuff PENDING WHEN I CAME BACK IN THE rehab.

694
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:16.530
Jacob Badura: Um, it was something I've wanted to do on my own. It wasn't something wasn't forced into it by trying that.

695
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:17.280
Okay.

701
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:52.440
For the

702
00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.210
Jacob Badura: Constipation thing I've been taken that for the last month.

703
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:06.300
Jacob Badura: And it seems to be helping a little bit to help me go to the bathroom but I'm still having like we're pains in the side of my stomach so

704
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:21.510
Jacob Badura: I was supposed to see him again, a few days ago, but with all the stuff that was going on. I was supposed to see him here on zoom. They sent me up for that, but they were so far behind in the appointment that I had to reschedule it because I had to get the word

705
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, but that set up to reschedule again.

706

Jacob Badura: Yeah.

707
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:33.570

708
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:44.400
Jacob Badura: Yeah, they Dustin gave me that at first when he gave me the XO friend to see if maybe that would help with the stomach pain, but it didn't do anything. So I stopped taking it.

709
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And then what about

733
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:37.440

735
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:46.440
Jacob Badura: And I used to drink a lot of soda back and I barely drink any water. And I think that might have been part of it too.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.150
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you drinking more water now.

737
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:56.910

745
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.030

747
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:45.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and that's something that you will definitely do. When you are ready, because I know when you make your mind up on something you do it so you let me know if you need help with that, but

748
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:47.940
Dr Katrina Groves: Whenever the time is right.

Dr Katrina Groves: And do you have any allergies to any medication or anything that you know of Jacob.

750
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:56.520

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.110
Jacob Badura: shall know the only thing I had

752
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:06.180
Jacob Badura: Yeah, the shellfish. I don't really know if that's a real allergy. I just, every time I've ever eat shellfish. I just get really sick.

753
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:07.260
Okay.

754
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.190
Dr Katrina Groves: So you don't get allergies, like pollen or anything like that.

Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so the next part. I just want to ask you some physical stuff like head to toe.

758
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:33.060
Dr Katrina Groves: So, have you had any Fevers or chills or night sweats these past week or two.

759
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:37.830
Dr Katrina Groves: Oops, last year.

760
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you back.

761
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.330
Jacob Badura: Yeah, I'm here.

762
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:47.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Have you had any Fevers or chills or night sweats at all in the last week or two.

763
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:49.860
Jacob Badura: Yeah.

764
00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:54.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Any trouble with coughing, wheezing shortness of breath in the last week or two.

765
00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:57.300
Jacob Badura: Yeah.

766
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Chest pain or pressure or heart palpitations last week or two.

767
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.100
No.

768
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.150
Dr Katrina Groves: You did talk about abdominal discomfort.

769
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.600
Dr Katrina Groves: So not the nausea is happening, but the vomiting is not under control now or

770
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:27.330
Jacob Badura: Yeah, I haven't been not I get nauseous. Still a lot, but I haven't thrown out the new thing that's been happening to me is that I almost

771
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:41.340
Jacob Badura: Passed out like sometimes. And it really shaky, and my heart just starts like beating at 1000 miles an hour, but then when I eat something, I get better. I almost thought I was like hypoglycemic or something.

772
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:42.900
Jacob Badura: And I went

773
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:51.030
Jacob Badura: I ended up having to go to the hospital. A few weeks ago was. I thought, I thought my appendix. But something was going on my appendix, that hurts so bad I ended up

774
00:57:51.690 --> 00:58:07.110
Jacob Badura: Going to Sutter post hospital and they gave me like a full body scan and they said everything was fine. But he said, maybe there was something with my gallbladder or something like that. But they didn't seem to care too much about. And they sent me home so

775
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:15.360
Jacob Badura: I haven't felt it since then, but it was it was enough to trip me out, then maybe go to the hospital.

776
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:22.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and you know there's something going on. Just because we can't see it on a CAT scan doesn't mean that it's not there.

777
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:30.090
Dr Katrina Groves: It kind of rolls up the worst things like if you had had an abscess, they would have seen that if there was something like a tumor, they would have seen that

778
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:44.580
Dr Katrina Groves: But your gut has always been sensitive. So I think that's good that you're continuing to pursue that workup. As far as your belly and when this is all past get to see a GI specialist and keep pushing it.

779
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:45.630
Yeah.

780
00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.710
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. So, have you had any seizures, though.

781
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:54.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, tremor dizziness vertigo.

782
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:57.060
Dr Katrina Groves: Know you said no more headaches.

783
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:59.880
Jacob Badura: Yeah, I haven't had a headache in a while.

784
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you feel like you have a mood problems and depression, anxiety, sleep.

785
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.400
Jacob Badura: Young I sleep really good now.

786
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Great because you're working a hard day.

787
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:16.290
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. Any suicidal thoughts. When's the last time you had

788
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:18.450
Dr Katrina Groves: Thoughts about suicide.

789
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:20.760
Jacob Badura: I've never had thought about suicide.

790
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:28.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so you feel like you're at like low no risk for that. Yeah. And what do you think your level of stress right now is

791
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.260
Jacob Badura: No.

792
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:32.580
Good.

793
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.010
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, and

794
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:41.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Have they sent you any drug the pee test in the into the

795
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.250
Dr Katrina Groves: House yet that's right heart sank. No.

796
00:59:45.780 --> 01:00:01.740
Jacob Badura: I was just able to sign up for yesterday. It's been taken forever to for me to do this and I just been so busy at work and everything and I signed all the paperwork and then I called in last week to do it. And they said, oh, it's been 30 days and you have to redo everything

797
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.100
Jacob Badura: So I got it all done on this.

798
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh yeah, I'm glad. And now it's done. But so what we'll do is

799
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:20.790
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you still see Tony like occasionally or talk to her, or what's your, what's your

800
01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:36.690
Jacob Badura: Mom Yeah I seen her. I went in, I think, last month. She helped me fill out all the paperwork to help me because I I hate doing all this crap on the computers and stuff like that. I'm just not a computer person so

801
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:43.740
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm doing just fine right now but I mean do you go in for counseling at all to talk to her. If you had a problem would you reach out to her.

802
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.090
Jacob Badura: Yes, I would.

803
01:00:45.510 --> 01:01:00.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so part of bright heart. I mean, you've had some good recovery time but I need to, we need to do the computer thing probably once a month at first and then maybe I'll drop you down to every two or three months, depending how you're doing your wife on

804
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.340
Dr Katrina Groves: A more frequent because of the pregnancy. I'm really trying to work with her on that.

805
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:07.410
Jacob Badura: Yeah.

806
01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:26.580

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:33.990
Okay.

809
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.640
Dr Katrina Groves: So I will go ahead and do a prescription today, or do you think you have enough until Monday.

810
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.330
Jacob Badura: Um, I probably have enough on Monday.

811
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:52.800
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, because I can put you on Monday. Schedule then shake a daughter.

812
01:01:55.830 --> 01:02:03.810
Dr Katrina Groves: And that way, it's, there's just the usual people you know like Sarah supposed to be there Tim, you know, 10 Stephanie.

813
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:08.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Christina be. Oh, you can't come in with your way.

814
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.310
Jacob Badura: Yeah, I

815
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.080
Jacob Badura: Christina told me to tell you that if

816
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.270
Jacob Badura: If there's a problem with that, that switch hers, because she don't mind being switched around or whatever.

817
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:26.730
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so maybe she can come on the ninth then on Thursday at 10 o'clock.

818
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.520
Dr Katrina Groves: She there. So we asked her.

819
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.800
Jacob Badura: She Yeah, she said, that would be fine. I already. I asked her before we started.

820
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.590
Jacob Badura: Or she told me where we started actually

821
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.220
Dr Katrina Groves: So if you want to write it down. Let's do Christina.

822
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.720

Dr Katrina Groves: And I'll do your prescription on that day.

825
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.480
Jacob Badura: Okay.

826
01:02:55.290 --> 01:03:05.640
Dr Katrina Groves: And so try to check in at 530 because I don't know how long it took you today. But when there's four or five people it takes a long time for them to check you in and you have to ask, they ask you questions.

827
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:14.760
Dr Katrina Groves: takes about five minutes. But if everybody's coming in at once, you might want to get in a little early so I don't know what time you get home from work, but

828
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:18.780
Jacob Badura: I usually get home around 515 or so.

829
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.420

Dr Katrina Groves: Alright and bright heart will reach out to you to get a urine test 2% to your house and also getting blood work done at the clinic so that God will have that too.

838
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:53.820

841
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Yep. All right there. I'll see you on Monday night, then you have a good weekend.

Dr Katrina Groves: You too. All right, good.

843
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.460
Jacob Badura: Night.

844
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:54.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so the only thing I have to add to our usual template is that the patient was restless. He has psycho motor agitation. That's pretty chronic

845
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:20.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Everything else, I believe I addressed. So his diagnosis will be opioid dependence severe in remission and also tobacco dependence moderate. Hang on. What's the

846
01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:33.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Tobacco has its own thing. Oh, cigarettes used to do too. But now it's nicotine dependence moderate cigarettes.

847
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.760
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, hang on, we'll get to the next one.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:07.890
Dr Katrina Groves: That's true.

902
01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.520
Khadra Porter: We'd lose a lot of people. I feel like, you know, yeah.

903
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.120
Dr Katrina Groves: We're covering

904
01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:13.800
Khadra Porter: Right.

905
01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:28.530
Dr Katrina Groves: But what I heard one of our counselors say she was really good. She said, You know, you guys as people in recovery that are added had been attics you guys actually have a heads up on this from other people that have never been through chaos in our lives. They've never

906
01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.750
Khadra Porter: Had. Yeah, that's true. He

907
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:33.720
Dr Katrina Groves: And you are have been through this before you

908
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Know, to have your whole life turned upside down and right

909
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:38.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Yes, others and you are

910
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.320
My neighbors. Right.

911
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:46.950
Khadra Porter: Yeah, that's true. I guys, you know, I didn't think of it like that. But yeah, it is. It's true.

912
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:51.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so, so I want us to kind of start at the beginning and

913
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Glad you're in your car so you can dredge all this up.

914
01:10:55.710 --> 01:11:07.080
Dr Katrina Groves: The first age that you remember using and what were you using and just take me through your childhood and and forward as far as your drug use, what was first one happened, kind of thing.

915
01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:15.690
Khadra Porter: Um, when I was in high school. It was really bad at my house was like my parents were the worst at that time.

916
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:17.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Fighting you mean or what was

917
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.950
Khadra Porter: Bad because they were drinking my

918
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:36.270
Khadra Porter: Before my dad died, you know, my mom never even Drake. She never cussed. I mean, we went to church every Sunday. She was just like the perfect mom and perfect way, you know, and then my dad died and she married telling you right away and

919
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:45.810
Khadra Porter: So our lives really were tossed upside down and really in. So then you know they got married. So they got a house and then

920
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.750
Khadra Porter: They started to tell he's always been an alcoholic or whatever and then

921
01:11:52.830 --> 01:12:04.110
Khadra Porter: For some reason, my mom just started drinking and he even threatened deliver because he was like, if I dream. I will not stop, you know, because he was sober at the time.

922
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:13.620
Khadra Porter: Because he had just gotten out of prison in so my mom wouldn't stop. And so then they both just started drinking all the time.

923
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:24.090
Khadra Porter: It was terrible, terrible. And then, so I had a really bad eating disorder in high school. And then I started smoking weed.

924
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:33.900
Khadra Porter: But then like weed would give me like a weird reaction sometimes like I would feel like I couldn't breathe in my heart, anxiety, probably really

925
01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:35.220
Khadra Porter: You know, yeah.

926
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.230
Khadra Porter: Yeah, and so I stopped smoking weed and then

927
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:49.260
Khadra Porter: I went on homeschool for a little bit and then I went back to the high school and I think I tried coke.

928
01:12:50.730 --> 01:13:10.470
Khadra Porter: A couple times, but I didn't like it because I just got a really bad headache, it wasn't. And the thing is is that when I would go out and be like drinking and stuff. I would be thinking like my brother, my brother and sister, you know, can entice and they were still home.

929
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.670
Khadra Porter: You know,

930
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:20.850
Khadra Porter: And so I would just be worried about them. And so I just felt guilty and I didn't want to drink or use because I was scared for them, you know,

931
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.180
Dr Katrina Groves: You're like, Oh, Mom, taking

932
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.600
Yeah.

933
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:41.850
Khadra Porter: Yeah. Yeah, when I got my first job at like everyone was so excited, getting jobs like I'm going to save up for a car. I'm going to do this, this, and I was like, with my first check. I'm going to take him out to lunch like that was my thing yet and

934
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:53.070
Khadra Porter: So then I didn't, didn't use drugs for. I mean, my whole life really. And then when I got, I see is when it really

935
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.920
Dr Katrina Groves: And when did you get the interstitial cystitis what

936
01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.650
Khadra Porter: I was nine weeks pregnant with Channing, and he was born in 2015 so

937
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:10.710
Khadra Porter: 2004 maybe the end of 2000 earth yeah 2014 I see and

938
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:22.200
Khadra Porter: I couldn't get anything really because I was pregnant and everyone was scared to, you know, deal with me because obviously I was pregnant and

939
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:39.720
Khadra Porter: I've never been able to take pills like they would make me so sick. Like even a half of bike it in or something. But I was so desperate like I would have done, try anything. And then my cousin and her boyfriend.

940
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:48.480
Khadra Porter: By well they used to buy a lot of pills. And so I just asked her for a couple of Norco

941
01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:53.820
Khadra Porter: And then I realized that it gave me a little bit of relief and

942
01:14:54.930 --> 01:15:16.740
Khadra Porter: A little bit of relief was worth all the risk in the money in it so fucked up because I was pregnant with chanting, but I mean I was suicidal, you know, I wanted to die. Right. So, I mean, so then often on I was able to get like little bits from her. And then finally,

943
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:32.190
Khadra Porter: Like in the middle of my pregnancy and my OB. Let me take Tramadol he prescribed me Tramadol yeah that helps some but my hormones were so bad because I was pregnant, and I think my bladder just couldn't

944
01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:40.860
Khadra Porter: I don't know. It was like nothing. I tried really helped you know up and then after I had Chani

945
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:52.980
Khadra Porter: They gave me Narcos because my OB promised me that if I made it through my pregnancy without a boarding or suicide.

946
01:15:53.850 --> 01:16:08.640
Khadra Porter: He would give me something stronger so I held on to that hope, you know, and then he did and chanting was in Oakland because they had to fly him out when he was born because he stopped breathing and

947
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:16.950
Khadra Porter: He was like throwing up like Brain Stuff. And they thought he swallowed like amniotic fluid or something.

948
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:19.890
Dr Katrina Groves: Because we were using

949
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.470
Khadra Porter: Not caught. I know, I know. It could have been

950
01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.770
Khadra Porter: In I feel so bad for that, but I just didn't know what to do, you know,

951
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.370
Right.

952
01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.760
Khadra Porter: So that, and then

953
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:52.410
Khadra Porter: When I got back from Oakland. I, you know, because we were there for almost three weeks in me and Josh were down there. We didn't have like any money. We didn't have a car, we were in sandals and tank tops, like it was cold down there, you know, and

954
01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:55.260
Khadra Porter: We got a place

955
01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:10.500
Khadra Porter: Like the Ronald McDonald houses and stuff. I don't know if it was exactly that. But it was one of those things that was close to the hospital. And so we would just walk over you know, walk, walk back and forth all the time of

956
01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:11.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Your baby.

957
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:21.360
Khadra Porter: Yeah. And then, so I was taking my darcos the whole time I was there, you know, my, my own prescription. And then when I got back

958
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:26.190
Khadra Porter: I was going to you IHS and so they started

959
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:39.090
Khadra Porter: Letting me try a bunch of stuff because I would every appointment I would have a list of meds that I researched and but I was in support groups and I just wanted something so bad you know

960
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:55.500
Khadra Porter: So he started letting you try stuff and then he ended up putting your Percocet. Then I was taking more than I was prescribed and sometimes I would flare and be up all night, you know, and then I just got addicted to him. I mean, I was on for a long time, you know,

961
01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:59.370
Dr Katrina Groves: And so working, you got tolerant to them.

962
01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.290
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, once and then you need. Yeah.

963
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:03.030
Khadra Porter: I know, yeah.

964
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:03.960
Khadra Porter: Very slow

965
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.100
Khadra Porter: And I wasn't devastated when he took me off. But I mean,

966
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.480
Khadra Porter: Why, why

967
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:21.450
Khadra Porter: Yeah. Oh, he just said that I was on it for you know too long in that basically I wasn't getting any better. So, you know, which was hard to hear you know yeah

968
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:31.020
Dr Katrina Groves: And then did you go down to San Francisco. I think he sent you somewhere to get installation or something.

969
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.740
Khadra Porter: Yeah. Oh, I went a couple times just San Francisco and got them done. Yeah.

970
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.860
Khadra Porter: I think I got like three, but it was supposed to be like a six week thing.

971
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:54.120
Khadra Porter: Like I would have to go every week and I just after three of them. I just couldn't do it, you know.

972
01:18:54.570 --> 01:19:03.660
Khadra Porter: Right. And you know, I know you're supposed to wait till after you know the whole six weeks to see about but those three honestly

973
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.160
Khadra Porter: I think I felt worse, you know,

974
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:15.870
Khadra Porter: I just could keep going you know by car broke down Ivy League and the kids. It was the middle of winter.

975
01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:18.000
Khadra Porter: It was just a lot. Yeah.

976
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:30.420
Dr Katrina Groves: So you kind of put it on hold and when when when did you decide or how did you decide to get on the Suboxone program did you start getting meds off the street after he cut you off or

977
01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:34.470
Khadra Porter: Yeah, I was still trying to buy them, you know, and

978
01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.860
Khadra Porter: It just got harder to get up because you know no one's getting them so

979
01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:43.200
Khadra Porter: No one said, we go, you know, and I didn't

980
01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:50.100
Khadra Porter: Know anyone besides my cousin to go other places. I just didn't know anyone that would even have them, you know,

981
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.500
Khadra Porter: It's so

982
01:19:54.510 --> 01:20:07.950
Khadra Porter: Josh had been in this box. And because I even know what's the box and was until he went in the program, you know, right. And for some reason, like I always knew I would end up there, but I just knew it you know it.

983
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:14.340
Khadra Porter: He you know he didn't really take the programs areas and he wasn't ready to get clean and

984
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:22.470
Khadra Porter: You know he's really not addicted to I mean he he's addicted to everything but you know mess with it was really his

985
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:39.990
Khadra Porter: You know, wellness love really. I mean, so it was just hard for him, you know, to, I don't know, do the program. But for some reason, I knew that I would be in the program at some point, and he did to actually I remember him like talking to you about me and like

986
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:46.290
Khadra Porter: You know, could you help her if she came here and you know, could you help her icy and, you know, I remember that.

987
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.490
Khadra Porter: And so

988
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.290
Khadra Porter: When he taught me.

989
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:50.880
Khadra Porter: What

990
01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Did he ever give you your his Suboxone to try so

991
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:04.440
Khadra Porter: No, I was scared because I was still like using hills. And so, yeah, I just said no. And then so when Dr butts took me off.

992
01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:18.270
Khadra Porter: I was like, this is too hard, like I just want to get better and have my own prescription, whatever. It's going to be or, you know, I really just needed support honestly was the main thing you know

993
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.690
Khadra Porter: I couldn't wait to go to my first group like

994
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:30.150
Khadra Porter: I mean, you know, like I remember like after me, or like people that came in with, you know, around the same time as me.

995
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:41.340
Khadra Porter: They would be like complaining about group for, like, whatever. And I'm like, I'm not the one to share, you know, I agree with you because I love fruit like it.

996
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.450
You know,

997
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:44.610

Khadra Porter: I'd have to go. You did. You know, I could go to my sisters because she'd be off work by then and then they could just play with my nephews, you know, and I could get in the car, whatever.

1034
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:43.350
Khadra Porter: And then, you know, in the evening, they're more calm, kind of, and you know I could put a movie on and stuff.

1035
01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:44.160
Khadra Porter: I mean, I might

1036
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.130
Khadra Porter: I would have to stay in the bedroom, not the car, probably, but

1037
01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.540

01:23:59.130 --> 01:23:59.700
Dr Katrina Groves: That way. Yeah.

1047
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.670
Khadra Porter: Yeah, I was having a

1048
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:30.360
Khadra Porter: I was kind of having trouble signing in with the first ID for a minute. Yeah. And then I was

1049
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:38.340
Khadra Porter: You know, on hold for the guy and then I got the new ID for you. And so it was just

1050
01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.990
Khadra Porter: Now, I know it takes a minute.

1051
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:50.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, you're learning, we're all learning God kind of crazy. Okay, so do you feel like the sub solve is controlling your cravings for using drugs.

1052
01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, like percent 50% 90%

1053
01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.810
Khadra Porter: Probably like 90% yeah

1054
01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:00.150
Dr Katrina Groves: And how is it with the pain.

1055
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:02.310
Khadra Porter: Um,

1056
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:13.260
Khadra Porter: It's hard in you know I agreed with Dr. Pearson to go down quite a bit. I get 120 now instead of like 180 or something.

1057
01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:39.390
Khadra Porter: Let him at all. Yeah. And so, you know, it was quite a drop, but you know, I'm doing it and I'm deal. You know, I mean, I think that my I know for sure my tolerance for my symptoms has gone. I mean, I just have to, you know, deal with it. So I know that that you know mentally. I can handle it better.

1058
01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:50.130
Dr Katrina Groves: And it may be being in recovery for so long. And I mean, the problem with the narcotics, as you know, even even Tramadol it's going to get to where it doesn't work. And you're going to be you.

1059
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:50.490
Khadra Porter: Know,

1060
01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:52.110
Khadra Porter: And that scares me so

1061
01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Bad so

1062
01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:05.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Of course, after all this virus stuff is going off, you know, go ahead and get continue to work on your ice find somebody that's a specialist and interstitial and keep on

1063
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:07.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Helping them. Don't ever quit, you know,

1064
01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:08.460
Dr Katrina Groves: I know

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.690
Khadra Porter: I feel like

1066
01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:16.890
Khadra Porter: I feel like sometimes that I, you know, have quit trying to get better. I just manage it.

1067
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.670
Dr Katrina Groves: You know,

1068
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:24.480
Khadra Porter: Right, you know, someday. My kids are going to be gone and all have to live for myself, can I

1069
01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.200
You know,

1070
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.010
Khadra Porter: So I have to figure out a way

1071
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:29.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Have you had

1072
01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:36.090
Dr Katrina Groves: A client recently thoughts. I know that you did in the past, but how how much, what is your suicide.

1073
01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.920
Khadra Porter: Feeling well I've been having quite issues lately.

1074
01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:49.980
Khadra Porter: Recently, like, I don't know why, but I just like get so like I just feel angry and upset, all the time.

1075
01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.580
Khadra Porter: And like I've never been an angry person. I don't

1076
01:26:53.970 --> 01:27:02.520
Khadra Porter: I eat it like sometimes I'll go days or a day with out feeling any joy and all those

1077
01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:03.570
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

1078
01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:04.980
Khadra Porter: And I hate it.

1079
01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:09.480
Dr Katrina Groves: That's depression, really. And are you on any medication for depression right now.

1080
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.190
Khadra Porter: Cymbalta

1081
01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Is that 30 milligrams still

1082
01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:13.920
Khadra Porter: Yeah.

1083
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:28.560
Dr Katrina Groves: And you can bump that up. And if you can go to 60 you can go to 90 I have people on 120 so that would be your one, I would say ask a primary care doctor to pump that up because it was good for pain and depression.

1084
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:36.960
Khadra Porter: Yeah, cuz I don't want to keep going on like that, you know, I don't want to stay stuck like that, you know, because it

1085
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:51.570
Khadra Porter: It does. And it's scary. Like, I don't want to feel joy, happiness, I don't want to I, even I just like I feel like I'm just like need, like, you know, to be in or just like no available.

1086
01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.610
Khadra Porter: Emotionally at all.

1087
01:27:53.670 --> 01:27:54.090
Khadra Porter: You know,

1088
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:59.970
Dr Katrina Groves: As you're dealing with so much in here and in your, your pain and your stress. There's nothing left.

1089
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:11.670
Dr Katrina Groves: So when's the last time you felt suicidal like really like I have a plan. I'm going to do this or that or have you ever had a plan.

1090
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.370
Khadra Porter: Don't really a player. No, but

1091
01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:17.340
Khadra Porter: I just have felt like

1092
01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:23.520
Khadra Porter: I just wish I wasn't existing you know to be like it's just you are

1093
01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:24.300
Right.

1094
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:33.060
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah okay and that's depression talking. And so I think that I know you've got good days and bad days. And I know you

1095
01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.810
Dr Katrina Groves: You wouldn't want to leave that legacy for your kids.

1096
01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:46.770
Dr Katrina Groves: I would. So what other support do you have right now besides Tony and I mean, now you've got this group. Do you have any

1097
01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Any friends that you're hooked up with

1098
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:55.680
Khadra Porter: No, not really. But me and my sister and my mom have gotten really close over the last year so

1099
01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:58.350
Khadra Porter: I go there. Almost every day.

1100
01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:03.990
Dr Katrina Groves: You're too old to be exposed to, you know, we're trying to shelter in place.

1101
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:04.830
Khadra Porter: I know, yeah.

1102
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:15.870
Khadra Porter: We've been to you pretty like heavy precautions, like I had to go to Walmart yesterday to get groceries for the month, you know, okay.

1103
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:29.010
Khadra Porter: I didn't let him go with me because you know he's 61 diabetic, he's overweight. He's going to wheel his wheelchair all through the store on the route is it'd be touching it with his hands to

1104
01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:40.770
Khadra Porter: It and bring it into the house, you know, and he was kind of pissed, but I was like, Richard. I'm sorry but I so I had a mask and gloves when I went to the store and then

1105
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:53.970
Khadra Porter: Before I went inside. I took them off outside and throw away the wind washed my hands and stuff. So we we've been to keep pretty heavy precautions and I didn't take my kids with the, you know, and stuff so good.

1106
01:29:54.360 --> 01:30:03.360
Khadra Porter: Yeah, I, I do worry about my sister a lot though because she's still at the clinic in Brookings in you know it's scary. So

1107
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:05.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Everybody just keeps doing what you're doing you

1108
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:07.410
Dr Katrina Groves: Will be fine. It'll. It'll get

1109
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.580

1126
01:30:56.610 --> 01:31:06.450
Khadra Porter: I would make sure that I didn't get pregnant if even if I was because it's just not fair to me or the baby or my other kids. It's just too hard. You know, so

1127
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:07.140
Khadra Porter: I could

1128
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.070
Khadra Porter: Go through that again.

1129
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.230
Dr Katrina Groves: So you may want to think about birth control, just because you never know.

1130
