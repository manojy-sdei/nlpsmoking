00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.080
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

2
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.550
Randy McWilliams: There we go. That was on my end.

3
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.760
Randy McWilliams: Hey there. How are you, yeah.

4
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.770
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

5
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.150
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, the I know I'm just done just now leaving work.

6
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.840
Randy McWilliams: Just crazy times right now we're we're taking our whole operation 100 people in one shelter.

7
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.740
Randy McWilliams: And putting them in hotels in the Bay Area. So I've been over at this hotel.

8
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:24.000
Randy McWilliams: All day getting busloads people in their belongings and putting them into hotel rooms and feeding them and and we're not even we're not even nearly halfway done with everybody and it's crazy because of this coven thing so

9
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.180
Shawn Phalen: So it has not been indicated that you guys need to do that.

10
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.060
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it's, it's definitely I think it's suggested by

11
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.770
Randy McWilliams: I think it's part of new song governor nuisance plan, but it's definitely part of our counties.

12
00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:04.050
Randy McWilliams: Initiative for distancing and separation and quarantine shelter in place, all of that stuff. So I guess they need the the main shelter par for people who are

13
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.230
Randy McWilliams: tested positive for coven

14
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:23.520
Randy McWilliams: That's going to be sort of a triage center. It's really scary. It's, it's really crazy and I don't know if we will see an explosion and cases or not. I don't know what to expect.

15
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.740
Randy McWilliams: But it's

16
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
Shawn Phalen: I heard Sacramento has more cases than San Francisco.

17
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.530
Randy McWilliams: Mm hmm.

18
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:49.050
Randy McWilliams: I have no idea how that's worked, except to say that some places have probably been slower than others to ramp up some sort of a protocol and a plan and stuff like that. That's my only gas, but

19
00:03:50.850 --> 00:04:00.090
Randy McWilliams: We unbelievably in my shelter haven't had any positive cases which is thank God, but it's amazing.

20
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.510
Shawn Phalen: So then what does that do for you for work. Are you hard they work hard, they

21
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:21.540
Randy McWilliams: Yeah. Well, it's an interesting situation and, you know, it's all part of the reason I'm here with you doing this therapy is you know how it's affecting me. It's very stressful.

22
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.150
Randy McWilliams: In terms of work. Thankfully, we will

23
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:39.810
Randy McWilliams: You know, be able to keep our hours and continue to work. Work considered essential employees by the state. So running this program.

24
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.250
Randy McWilliams: So thankfully will be able to to continue to work, but at the same time.

25
00:04:48.270 --> 00:05:00.390
Randy McWilliams: It's hugely stressful, you know, working with this population. And then, you know, as you know, I live in a sober living environment where there's 15 people right now so

26
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:13.170
Randy McWilliams: I go from this environment to that environment, it's, it's been a huge stress, but I'm maintaining you know I'm just going going with the flow so far.

27
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.900
Shawn Phalen: Are they making people in the sober living get tested.

28
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.180
Randy McWilliams: Not get tested.

29
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:32.190
Randy McWilliams: There's been sort of a shelter in place guideline. Most, most of the people there are not working, anyway.

30
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.950
Randy McWilliams: Though they're not leaving

31
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.970
Randy McWilliams: A handful of us are working and the people that do work are working in

32
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:56.820
Randy McWilliams: Businesses that are still operating a couple of the guys or get like a mini mart for a gas station. They're still open, and then I of course work for this homeless program which is open, so

33
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.540
Randy McWilliams: We're just, you know, the main thing for me.

34
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.050
Randy McWilliams: Is just constant cleaning. I have. I've managed to get my my hands on disinfectant.

35
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:24.030
Randy McWilliams: And I've been making cleaner with bleach and water, and I've been spraying down door knobs and touch points every chance I get, you know, I'm wearing a mask.

36
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.050
Randy McWilliams: every chance I get I'm washing my hands and sanitizing that's really the best I can do.

37
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.050
Shawn Phalen: And I think that's all you can do.

38
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.380
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it is, it is for anybody.

39
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.110
You know, and it's

40
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.660
It is stressful, you know, with the population that you

41
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.950
Randy McWilliams: That you work with. Yeah, and even your living situation to, you know,

42
00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.020
Shawn Phalen: If people are following protocol and doing you know the cleaning and the hand Washington the masks and all that.

43
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.270
Shawn Phalen: You know, according to the CDC, that should be

44
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.390
Randy McWilliams: Sufficient right

45
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:19.260
Randy McWilliams: But just you just, you know, you hope everybody's doing it. You know, you know. I just know in my house.

46
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.830
Randy McWilliams: We're pretty religious here. We're about doing that stuff. But at my house.

47
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.330
Randy McWilliams: Not everybody's constantly cleaning like I do.

48
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.610
Randy McWilliams: So I it does, it has to be done by everybody. I guess to suppresses virus overall

49
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.410
Randy McWilliams: But I'm an interesting side note about it all is my girlfriend and I have

50
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.250
Randy McWilliams: Been talking about trying to move into a

51
00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:13.020
Randy McWilliams: Apartment together. So we've been looking around the past couple of weeks trying to find a decent deal which would be nice. So it would be very nice. I would love to be able to do that sooner than later. Yeah. Um, but, and you know, I think it would be a huge step.

52
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.680
Randy McWilliams: In the right direction for us.

53
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.940
Randy McWilliams: And just especially with everything going on, it would be perfect timing to get out of this environment, but

54
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.890
Randy McWilliams: Don't want to rush any push anything too much. So just taking our time looking, you know, it's got to be the right fit.

55
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.570
Shawn Phalen: Right, so

56
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:49.230
Randy McWilliams: Have you found anything. Are there things available that yeah there's actually surprisingly a lot of places still available and they're looking to rent. They're looking for people to move in right away. I imagine there's probably

57
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.360
Randy McWilliams: A lot of people

58
00:08:52.860 --> 00:09:10.260
Randy McWilliams: That are just kind of sitting tight through this thing right now. So there's probably a lot of open inventory. I'm guessing I don't really know, but there are a lot of things out there. It's just so expensive in this area. It's out ragingly expensive so

59
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:19.440
Randy McWilliams: Take some time to find something that's the right price, first and foremost, you know,

60
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.610
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and I would take your time on that. I would

61
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.100
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, you know, I would

62
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.800
Randy McWilliams: Find what's going to work for both of you. Right.

63
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.410
Shawn Phalen: You know, put some numbers to it, do a budget.

64
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.610
Randy McWilliams: Right, make sure that this is something that's not going to

65
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.430
Shawn Phalen: stress you out trying to

66
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.250
Randy McWilliams: Make the rent and

67
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.090
Shawn Phalen: Try and have money set aside for emergencies, that kind of thing. You know what

68
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.050
Exactly.

69
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.180
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, price range and, you know,

70
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.810
Shawn Phalen: You know, make it like this fun adventure. Yeah.

71
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.030
Randy McWilliams: Yeah yeah

72
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:20.970
Randy McWilliams: Exactly, that's trying to I'm trying to look at it that way. And I think she has to, you know, it, it's, it is, you know, it's our next next adventure together and

73
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.300
Randy McWilliams: You know, but definitely as

74
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:31.950
Randy McWilliams: You know, concerned about the money and the budgeting and having enough, like you said, for emergencies and

75
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:48.120
Randy McWilliams: Not getting ourselves into a situation where we're so strapped that we can't even afford a new tires or something when it comes up so badly. Right. Absolutely. You got to save for that rainy day.

76
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:59.430
Randy McWilliams: Well, that's exciting. Yeah, yeah. That is good. Yeah, you were you the one that brought it up or did she bring it in.

77
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.610
Randy McWilliams: Well, we've talked about it in the past before just didn't passing and

78
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.880
Randy McWilliams: You know, never really serious and I've never really wanted to the bush.

79
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.350
Randy McWilliams: But I brought it up recently again.

80
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:32.550
Randy McWilliams: And then with this shelter in place thing she lives with roommates as well. And it's been very stressful to be, you know, stuck in a house with people 24 seven and

81
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:45.570
Randy McWilliams: She's not working right now, which is one thing. She's got a lot saved but her jobs. Well, she is, I take that back. She is still working three days a week for conservator. But, um,

82
00:11:47.370 --> 00:12:02.910
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, so I kind of brought it up again and then she addressed it a few weeks ago that she'd like to look start looking, you know, and so I of course immediately thought let's find something today and

83
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.320
Randy McWilliams: It's gonna take some time.

84
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.020
Randy McWilliams: Right, it's good, you know,

85
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.660
Shawn Phalen: What What areas are you guys looking in.

86
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:40.470
Randy McWilliams: The area we're in now you know this Walnut Creek conquered area outside San Francisco where, you know, an average one bedroom is 1900 dollars plus right though you do find some that are decent you know that are you know 16 1700 dollars, they're rare.

87
00:12:42.150 --> 00:13:00.330
Randy McWilliams: But you do see some now and again that's kind of what we're looking at. As long as it's in a decent area isn't a good complex yeah you know it all you oftentimes pay for what you get. So we have to be really careful about that to

88
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.130
Randy McWilliams: Me know

89
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.130
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know, they don't have rank control there, you know,

90
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:24.840
Randy McWilliams: Oh my god, they need it. It's only a matter of time before the issue has to come up because with all this stuff going on and right. My God above like you would think I know la still have la house right control and yeah

91
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.780
Shawn Phalen: Nice areas that are around control but

92
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.640
Randy McWilliams: Absolutely, you know, words are gonna be hurting like

93
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.830
Shawn Phalen: People can't afford to pay their rent.

94
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.960
Shawn Phalen: Right. So it's like, I don't know, it's just it's annoying.

95
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.220
Randy McWilliams: And they want a lot of these places want three times.

96
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:56.550
Randy McWilliams: The income. I mean that's almost impossible. That's, that's crazy. You know, I mean, so it's all about finding the right landlord to know

97
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.090
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

98
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.510
Shawn Phalen: That's exciting. Okay, so what's going on with school then

99
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.960
Randy McWilliams: School still going schools. It's crazy, they've shut it down for the rest of the academic year. It's

100
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.880
Randy McWilliams: Probably going to be shut down through

101
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.340
Randy McWilliams: Fall. I'm guessing.

102
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:25.710
Randy McWilliams: But they've moved everything online. So most of my all of my classes are doing this zoom platform and it's working out. Okay, it's

103
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:46.980
Randy McWilliams: It's been a huge change to get used to it because I used to really love in my classmates talk about it to really loved going to campus being in class interacting collaborating. So it's really hard to get used to this socialites solace isolationism and

104
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.300
Randy McWilliams: You know, and the zoom classes and stuff.

105
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.910
Randy McWilliams: But they seem to be working. So far, just with everything.

106
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:03.120
Randy McWilliams: Everything that's been going on. It's been such a huge stress for everybody.

107
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:17.610
Randy McWilliams: You know, and it has been for me, too. It's been hard for me to wrap my head. You know hundred percent around some of the school work. You know, like I have in the past, but I'm maintaining the grades and

108
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:26.430
Randy McWilliams: You know that's that's all I can kind of expect myself right we're all just trying to get through this thing.

109
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.960
Shawn Phalen: Yeah and you know that's really what you know what I've been telling my clients. It's like this is out of our control.

110
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.900
Randy McWilliams: Control over this. We do not know when the end date is going to, you know, we're at the end of April.

111
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:50.430
Randy McWilliams: Right, it might go into may be probably well maybe longer

112
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.290
Randy McWilliams: I know

113
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.580
Shawn Phalen: It's sort of, you know, it's not. It's like preparing yourself for this.

114
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.770
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, and to be

115
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.320
It's almost like a way of like resetting yourself and

116
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.560
Randy McWilliams: You know, um,

117
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.790
Shawn Phalen: It's a lesson in patience.

118
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.340
Internally and

119
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.580
Introspection being

120
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:32.940
Randy McWilliams: Like there's so many different lessons with what's happening here. So yeah, world is almost being reset. Yeah, it's about

121
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.610
Shawn Phalen: You know, finding things to come to do to keep you, but doing it in a different way. Right.

122
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.600
Shawn Phalen: Reading a book playing a board game.

123
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.840
Shawn Phalen: Can you guys go for walks out there.

124
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.220
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, yeah, we're able to still go for walks. Exactly. Yeah.

125
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.230
Shawn Phalen: Going for a walk.

126
00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:05.340
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, like it's stuff that we did before the internet and cell phones. Exactly. It is. It's like the good old days, forced on us.

127
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.720
Shawn Phalen: Not staying up until two or three in the morning on your tablet or your phone.

128
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.580
Randy McWilliams: I know

129
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.300
Randy McWilliams: That we have not done for

130
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.940
Randy McWilliams: Decades and oh yeah probably longer I know no so

131
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:33.330
Shawn Phalen: as frustrating as it is. And as scary as it is, you know, you just have to take the precautions that you're already

132
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.620
Randy McWilliams: Taking and

133
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.270
Randy McWilliams: You know,

134
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.690
Shawn Phalen: What I'm telling clients to stay off social media stay off.

135
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.610
Randy McWilliams: As much as you can. I mean, be informed.

136
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.640
And listen to

137
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.750
This stuff that their

138
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.030
People

139
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.580
Randy McWilliams: And it's, it's

140
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.650
Randy McWilliams: A it's increasing people's anxiety. Yeah.

141
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.170
Shawn Phalen: They're in the business of instilling fear. There's sensational ization

142
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:15.630
Shawn Phalen: Right. Yeah, so stay off of it as much as you possibly can.

143
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:21.540
Shawn Phalen: Right. Um, keep washing their hands washing wearing gloves do

144
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.290
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

145
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.540
Shawn Phalen: What about meetings are you doing those online.

146
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:33.630
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, you know, I haven't been to as many just because I've been trying to keep up with some of my schoolwork, and between the work schedule but

147
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:48.540
Randy McWilliams: They do do them online. Dave put a lot of the local meetings on zoom as well. So it's just kind of trying to get used to a new work schedule that's been kind of sporadic and then

148
00:18:50.040 --> 00:19:02.280
Randy McWilliams: Getting getting a grip on my schoolwork, and then, yeah, I will be attending once I get hopefully get a better word team down amidst all this chaos is crazy, because I'm working

149
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.390
Shawn Phalen: My job, my clinic.

150
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.570
Shawn Phalen: skeleton crew so we're

151
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.260
Shawn Phalen: Wrapping everything I'm doing is phone

152
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.550
Randy McWilliams: Ready.

153
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.660
Shawn Phalen: All my individual sessions and group sessions.

154
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.500
Right.

155
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.400
Randy McWilliams: That's crazy. Hey, is it like

156
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.060
You know, like today, I forgot a client, like I just completely like

157
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:41.370
Randy McWilliams: That, you know, so using examples of like I'm experiencing the same thing. And it's exactly it's going to just take

158
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.790
Shawn Phalen: Just some more getting used to. And we're P occupied because we're worried and we're

159
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.520
Randy McWilliams: Focused because it is

160
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.320
Randy McWilliams: And

161
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:59.910
Shawn Phalen: So just keep grounding yourself as much as you possibly can. Getting I'm taking walks every day. Sometimes

162
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:10.740
Randy McWilliams: Right, I can. Yeah, getting out in nature, doing not kind of stuff and absolutely. You know, you just have to

163
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:23.550
Randy McWilliams: Have to adapt and get through it. Absolutely. And I love taking the walks. I've lived my girlfriend. We've taken some walks, of course, six feet apart but

164
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:41.100
Randy McWilliams: But word walking at least we're walking because it's really, really a test to get through all this. But, um, yeah, you do. You gotta just adapt, but it is tough. You're right. You forget things

165
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:52.380
Randy McWilliams: I'm off my game, so to speak, totally was with a lot of different things. And it's like, I'm just trying to find myself just trying to keep up.

166
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:59.130
Randy McWilliams: With with obligations right now is what I'm doing. And so it's weird.

167
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:07.110
Shawn Phalen: When you have all your clients when all the people are in the hotels and do you are you touching base with them. Is that how this

168
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:16.860
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, and that's how we'll keep our job. It's the weirdest thing. So we're putting all these folks in hotel rooms and then we will have

169
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.600
Randy McWilliams: One of the rooms as a cause I

170
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:39.840
Randy McWilliams: Temporary office that we're working out of. So then we will there'll be different shifts all day and night, working out of this room, and we'll go check on the clients and feed take them dinners and lunches and whatnot.

171
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:50.550
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it's gonna be a real test on the clients. Yeah. You'd be busy. Oh yeah, it's gonna be very busy.

172
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.770
Randy McWilliams: So,

173
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.720
Randy McWilliams: You've got a job. Definitely. There's a lot of

174
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:08.340
Randy McWilliams: People that file for unemployment. That's insane. And you know, when they told me a few weeks ago, this might happen. The first thing I thought of as

175
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:15.510
Randy McWilliams: We're all going to get laid off that they're going to put the clients in hotel rooms and they'll be in hotel rooms and will be laid off and

176
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:27.090
Randy McWilliams: And so I thought, the first thing I thought is, I'll run down to the local grocery store, they're hiring on the spot because of this madness going on at the stores and

177
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:37.110
Randy McWilliams: So I was kind of preparing myself for having the gap even more during this thing, but thankfully

178
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.780
Shawn Phalen: Thankfully here. Clean your super you know because

179
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:50.370
Randy McWilliams: This could have just been awful. If you are still using right you know. It's crazy.

180
00:22:51.870 --> 00:23:12.300
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it would have been a nightmare it. I don't know. I can't even imagine it because it was last year around this time when I was really in will it was exactly last year at this time that I was in my last few weeks of a horrible relapse before I got helped out of it and

181
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.550
Randy McWilliams: And I was, um, it could have been really ugly because I ended up getting kicked out of a room. I was running

182
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:29.130
Randy McWilliams: And I would have been in real trouble. When I think about it now. And it's interesting you say that because

183
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:44.220
Randy McWilliams: Not just that specific relapse and thank God I am sober. Now, I've been having a lot of like really intrusive memories come in about things that I've done.

184
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.280
Randy McWilliams: You know, just about really shitty things that I used to do when I was using and drinking and all that.

185
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.160
Randy McWilliams: I just don't know why it's been strange

186
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.090
Randy McWilliams: Why, they've been kind of popping in

187
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:15.330
Randy McWilliams: Now, but every once in a while. Just think of something, how I was at a certain time in my life when I was using it a mess.

188
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:22.140
Randy McWilliams: But I just try to use those reflections as as thank God I'm not

189
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.510
Randy McWilliams: Right, I'm not. Now I'm not that person now right

190
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.160
Shawn Phalen: Exactly. And also, it wouldn't hurt to

191
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:53.100
Randy McWilliams: Talk about some of those intrusive thoughts, either with me or your sponsor because yeah being base. Yeah. And yeah, you want to make sure that you're not carrying around shame and guilt, definitely, which is obviously

192
00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.840
Randy McWilliams: You know that's what happens right first that you get from your

193
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:14.550
Randy McWilliams: You know, even in sobriety. So just make sure that you are on top of some of that if you feel like it's necessary to talk about it. Yeah, it's a good idea to to do that. Yeah.

194
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.580
Because the shame and the guilt.

195
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.400
Randy McWilliams: They do something to. Yeah, they do. You know, it's

196
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:35.760
Randy McWilliams: You don't want that inside you. You want to get that out right you know whether it's journaling, however you want to do it. Just, just make sure that your

197
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.830
Randy McWilliams: Don't let a creep up on you right that's the fully aware to absolutely

198
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.510
Shawn Phalen: And those thoughts are actually really come in.

199
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:58.410
Randy McWilliams: I'm sure you know it's common and sobriety well with you know and and you have you've got a little bit of time and

200
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:07.620
Randy McWilliams: You might still have you might continue to have some of those, like, oh my god. Exactly, remembering this right now.

201
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.240
Randy McWilliams: And also school can bring some of that stuff up to

202
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.310
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

203
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.100
Shawn Phalen: What papers that you have to write or assignments that you're doing or group projects or

204
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.590
Randy McWilliams: Definitely, that kind of stuff. So yeah, you're on top of it.

205
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:35.100
Randy McWilliams: I think that's good advice. Not to carry it with me. No, don't carry with you. Right. Okay, so let's

206
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.650

Rhonda: I also, I went in to get an MRI for my neck and they're gonna have to put me in a different I guess the machine here is real small so

236
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:11.820
Rhonda: They wheeled my head in there and there's no like room at all. I mean I got extremely cross cluster, probably, and I couldn't do it. So they're going to send me up to a different hospital work. So larger machine.

237
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:25.350
Rhonda: Because they'd have to literally squeeze me in there. It was pretty, I just, I, I didn't realize I was that claustrophobic till I get in there and I couldn't move right yes I gotta get out of here, please help me out.

238
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:36.300
Rhonda: I gotta get that done. And once I get that done on then. No, no more about what's up with my neck. So, okay.

239
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.230
Shawn Phalen: How are you doing with everything else that's going on.

240
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:48.270
Rhonda: I'm pretty good. I've been trying to stay inside not go out too much social distancing quite a bit and

241
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.050
Rhonda: Staying away from sick people, and

242
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:08.430
Rhonda: But I was not doing doing pretty good. I mean, we had a family meeting my, my brother in law's of psychologists and so he had he does zoom. Now, I guess he so my whole family went on, zoom, where they all live in different areas.

243
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:19.200
Rhonda: We got we're going to start doing that, once a week. We all got together and talked to see how everyone's doing. And that was kind of cool. It's really cool. Yeah.

244
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.310
Shawn Phalen: I know people are doing that more and more with this.

245
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.920
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know, like

246
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.570
A great weekend.

247
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:36.420
Rhonda: Yeah, it is. It really is. And then we get to see my family. So yeah, that's really good. Okay.

248
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.450
Shawn Phalen: So who are the groups, everything

249
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:57.180
Rhonda: Oh yeah, I love my group I Dr pastors group is pretty good. I like it. Okay. I really like it. So medications are they doing okay yeah it's, I'm not a sick anymore. I just, he gave me a different kind like a lower dose and a different

250
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:05.430
Rhonda: Sub solve or something like that. And I only take like a third or half of one twice a day.

251
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:14.430
Rhonda: And it seems better. I still need the nausea medicine, though, because it does make me a little bit nauseous, but it does help. It does. It helps

252
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:38.760
Rhonda: Yeah, you seem like you're good. Yeah. Yes, I am seem like Oh good. Yeah, you've got energy and make your, your some things shifted feels like something's moved in a positive direction. Yeah, it has. And my son is doing well. I have a son has schizophrenia and he's taking his medication.

253
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:46.440
Rhonda: He's getting his shot every month. And it makes it a little easier to deal with him and

254
00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:59.130
Rhonda: And, you know, so that part's good I'm his pay or pay and so he when he's honest medicine, he's just not as as

255
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:16.230
Rhonda: Out there like delusional or anything like that. And he's more centered. He's grocery shopping more he lives on his own. And so that part whenever he's doing better. You know, it makes life a little easier for me to. Well, I can tell. So

256
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.270
Shawn Phalen: How did you get him to go back on medication because he he wasn't taking it right

257
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:27.270
Rhonda: No, he wasn't he resisted for a long time. I basically just kind of said that, you know,

258
00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:38.340
Rhonda: Because he would, he would disturb everybody around so much that nobody wants to be around him and I basically said, you're not going to be spending the night here and I don't want you coming over to my house.

259
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:47.850
Rhonda: SCREAMING AND YELLING like you are, you know, you can't do that unless you're medicated I said it's not, you can't ever see me. It's just, you can't come over here, raise hell.

260
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:56.550
Rhonda: It just because you don't want to take your shot. So you and if you want to get your money you're better off to get your, your shot and then

261
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:10.590
Rhonda: I said, when you get your shot think your life just seems to turn around for the better. And so he's, he also gets rewarded for mental health. They give them a shopping cart or something like that, when he gets it done so.

262
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:17.970
Rhonda: He's been everyone's telling him how well he's doing so nice. Yeah, yeah, it's a lot better.

263
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.830
Shawn Phalen: So he lives alone. So he's able to live alone.

264
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:36.360
Rhonda: Yeah, he has it chess, and he lives alone and he's got a really good worker. She's a friend of mine, and he's really happy with her and doing that stuff. So yeah, he's, he's a

265
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:44.610
Rhonda: much better, much, much, it's like night and day when they get on. It's just a monthly shot is all it is in Vegas is Dana.

266
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:57.510
Rhonda: Was he resistant because of the side effects or just because he just didn't want to have the shots. Um, he said it made him tired a lot, but I think that I taught reminded him that

267
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:08.100
Rhonda: The side effects go away after a while, that the that the benefit outweighs everything else. I said, because

268
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:26.880
Rhonda: He didn't said he didn't like the side effects is just, but you know what I mean he I guess he's getting a lot of positive input from a lot of people. Nice. So, yeah. Oh, cool. He wouldn't be able to keep up with the pill every day. Yeah, so they just give them a shot. Yeah, it's a month.

269
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.230
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's, it's so much easier if they can do that.

270
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:37.710
Rhonda: A lot of times they will go into denial, you know, they don't want it and they don't want they

271
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:49.020
Rhonda: You know, they just don't want to do it a lot of times they'll feel better. And then they think they don't need it. And then they stop and it goes right back down. He did compensates, you know, gets locked up.

272
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.280
Rhonda: Right, so

273
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.510
Rhonda: And he's better

274
00:36:52.620 --> 00:37:01.680
Rhonda: You know people that have mental illness. Don't want to have mental you know they don't know, they certainly don't you just really don't think

275
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:12.120
Rhonda: He's real happy because he's been getting work to he's been getting some work and he's thinking about going to work for this particular

276
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:19.950
Rhonda: Thing called GH outreach for disabled people and then he's been doing yard work and different things to make cash.

277
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:38.400
Rhonda: And he's gonna get a bike and he wants to ride a bike around town instead of walk. I'm nervous about that because he's not really good on a bike and I worry about a safety, but if it's a three wheeler like he's talking about getting and he has a helmet, then it's okay.

278
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:57.330
Rhonda: So does he take public transportation. He has before. Yes. He'll take it is that are all drive him or his worker will drive them okay so yeah okay it's he can take a bus to you can. Mm hmm.

279
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.030
Shawn Phalen: And then. Okay, so you're his pay. That's, that's good.

280
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:18.930
Rhonda: Yeah, and my other boy. He's in San Quentin right now and he gets out, man. He's wanting to come up here, but I'm really apprehensive about him coming up here because he has a tendency to get into trouble quite a bit and I just don't want any of that around right now.

281
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:19.740
Shawn Phalen: What

282
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:29.040
Rhonda: I honestly I love him. He said he's locked up for something to do with drugs. I don't know. He got burglarized or did something, I don't know, and

283
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:41.520
Rhonda: I feel bad because he he really wants to be around family, but at the same time, I just said, if you can find a place, a clean and sober home somewhere where you can come up here and

284
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:51.960
Rhonda: Do the things that you're supposed to do to stay. Keep your life straight, that's fine. But I said I can't have you living with me, and I certainly can't have

285
00:38:52.620 --> 00:39:00.960
Rhonda: Don't want any trouble right you know up here so i'm not i mean i miss them terribly but I'm not sure if I want them close actually

286
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:15.330
Rhonda: Because of all the trouble that they've caused in the past the drama and all the I still want that. I don't want to be part of that stuff anymore. I love them but I mean he needs to make a life for himself and be happy, you know, and so

287
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:17.970
Shawn Phalen: Has he been in and out of prison.

288
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:33.150
Rhonda: Yes, he well actually not prison just jail but prison was the first time and with prison. And then my other son. Yes, my other son went to prison and he's getting out off a parole in about a month so

289
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:45.330
Rhonda: He got messed up and drugs, they both got my methamphetamine, and it caused a lot of problems for their life. So right and

290
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.870
Rhonda: I just don't want any part of that. Yeah.

291
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.890
Shawn Phalen: Any mental health issues with the one that's in San Quentin right now.

292
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.870
Rhonda: Yes, actually my other two sons, they supposedly

293
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:07.500
Rhonda: The, the one in San Quentin has skits oh effect disorder. And then the other one has an undifferentiated schizophrenia.

294
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:19.680
Rhonda: But it and I'm really confused as to why they have it. And you know why so many of my kids out of it. And the only thing I can think of is that because my other my brother has it is that they

295
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:30.930
Rhonda: Did drop the methamphetamines I still don't know to this day. If it's the drugs that brought it out or it's really hard to say, but well and sometimes math can

296
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.290
Shawn Phalen: Create drug induced psychosis and

297
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:41.310
Rhonda: Yes. And so that that could pop that could be what it might be that as well and sometimes

298
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:47.250
Shawn Phalen: Even after they've stopped using and even after they're on medication. They don't come back to baseline.

299
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:54.510
Rhonda: No, no. Yeah, he never did. Yeah. Never did yeah and

300
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:59.040
Shawn Phalen: There's also spice. You know, people smoke spice, which is a

301
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.710
They call it a synthetic marijuana

302
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.920
Shawn Phalen: It's really like an incense. It's a highly toxic that

303
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:16.440
Rhonda: Oh, I've never heard of that. Yeah. Other younger people doing that now or

304
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:31.740
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and I'm not sure how popular it is now. I mean, it was pretty big you know couple years back I don't hear a tongue. I don't hear a lot about it, but I have worked with people that did smoke it. And now our skits. A friend Nick.

305
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:47.880
Rhonda: Oh, wow. See, I think it can bring it out at the gym genetic predisposition is already there. I believe that especially drugs like math and stuff like that can bring it out. Yeah, it can bring it out. Absolutely.

306
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:54.900
Shawn Phalen: So you know if. Do you feel like you've got good boundaries with your son that's coming home or getting now.

307
00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:04.650
Rhonda: I do they don't live close to me and I'm nervous about thought of them living close to me but i i did Alan on for years. Alan on Save my but

308
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:10.860
Rhonda: I mean as far as how to set good boundaries because, you know, actually, as a parent, that's the toughest thing.

309
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:21.690
Rhonda: To do with a drug addict, because you actually can hurt them more than you help them when you enable them. So I like them to have consequences of their own.

310
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:32.040
Rhonda: Actions instead of to bail them out, you know, all the time. So I learned about a lot of stuff like that. And I do, but then it's always the mother thing you know well

311
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:42.510
Rhonda: It's those boundaries. I have to keep them clear but love them from a distance, if you know what I mean, I'm not responsible for them anymore so

312
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.160
Shawn Phalen: So it makes your life easier to not have him.

313
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:48.990
Shawn Phalen: near you.

314
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:58.530
Rhonda: Yeah, I mean, I want to see them, but I don't want them. I don't want trouble. I still want any trouble. Right. You know, so

315
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:04.680
Rhonda: I mean, I told I told him if he's going to come up here. Then he needs to get into a recovering home.

316
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:12.030
Rhonda: Or go to a town close by that, you know, he. There's a lot of places you could move but not not with me but

317
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.320
Isn't it

318
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:23.100
Shawn Phalen: Isn't it a requirement that they won't guess it's not a requirement, but many of them go to sober living after they've been really

319
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.650
Rhonda: Yeah, yeah, he could probably do that.

320
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:43.500
Rhonda: Sometimes that's a requirement of their probation, sir. Yeah, it, it will probably also depend on the terms of his release, and once he's released. What's going to be expected of him because he will have to check in with his P. Oh.

321
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.140
Rhonda: Yeah, well, I get tested.

322
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:57.810
Rhonda: So that part. You know that one son, the middle son is in complete denial about it. He doesn't think he has it, and he refuses medicine for it.

323
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:13.290
Rhonda: When he went to prison. He took it. But now he does. He just doesn't think he has it he refuses to as long as he's refusing and in denial that really makes me nervous on having them, you know, around because of that. Yeah, yeah.

324
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.480
Shawn Phalen: And that you know that can be your rule. It's like you have to be on medication for me.

325
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:25.500
Rhonda: Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like there's just no other way, like, yeah, those are my boundaries like

326
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:36.150
Shawn Phalen: And, you know, of course, you can't make somebody take medication, but at least he knows, like, hey, this is what you're requiring just because of all the stuff that's happened in the past.

327
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.430
Rhonda: Yes, my, my

328
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:49.020
Shawn Phalen: My boundary is that if you want to be with me or be near me. You have to be on medication if you're going to be in my life where I see you on a consistent basis. I can't do that unless you're on meds.

329
00:44:49.710 --> 00:45:01.890
Rhonda: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. So yeah, they do know that and I but Travis won't accept those terms, so he can stay down there as far as I'm concerned, and

330
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:02.640
Rhonda: I don't

331
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.250
Shawn Phalen: Is he the one that's in San Quentin right now.

332
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:16.650
Rhonda: No, that's he he's out he's down there and but he gets off parole in about it next month, I think, and He's down. He's living down in Sacramento area.

333
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.960
Shawn Phalen: Helens even I'm hero.

334
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.400
Rhonda: Three years. Yeah, three years.

335
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.290
Rhonda: Any work.

336
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:42.240
Rhonda: Um, I said. They said he gets off next month. I'm surprised, but I mean, because the fact that he's not taking the medicine or doing things he needs to do. I, I guess he still gets off. He's must be doing something right. So,

337
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:50.910
Rhonda: But the other one is is getting out in May and he's the one his social worker called me up and she wanted to know if

338
00:45:51.690 --> 00:46:07.380
Rhonda: You know, it's possible for him to get transferred up here. And I said, well, I can't be responsible for him and I said if he can get into a sober living environment or somewhere up here that's between you guys in him, but I said I can't

339
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:22.500
Rhonda: Have him at my place to live, or anything like I don't want that stuff around me, and I told her that. So she wanted the addresses of different places, but I didn't really have it at the time. So I haven't given it to her yet.

340
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:34.470
Rhonda: But he's the one he just missed his family. He's taking a shot. Now, every month there, he does. And she said, he's more stable. Now, the nice ever been for a long time.

341
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.390
Rhonda: But I still

342
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:51.960
Rhonda: You know, I've seen him do that before he's been conserved, actually. So yeah, he has been conserved. So he he definitely would need to stay medicated and to stay out of trouble. So no doubt about it.

343
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.600
Shawn Phalen: Is everything court order to take medication.

344
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:09.990
Rhonda: No, only one he was concerned, right. So, I mean, when he was conserved a, you know, it's even that it's hard for them to make them, you know, take it.

345
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:19.380
Rhonda: You know what I mean. So if unless they're in a facility like unless they're in like stabilized. Mm hmm.

346
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:32.340
Rhonda: Yeah, it is very difficult because there's more for them down there, actually, that really is a lot more for them down there as far as like even if the mental hospital down there. They had a program for live in

347
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:45.600
Rhonda: People, where they had in their 90 days and then they place them out, out in the home transitional living for group homes or whatever they have more available down there. They up. Then they have here.

348
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:53.670
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, their services are our broader down there, too. I mean, they're better off. I mean, they will have better services, just because

349
00:47:53.670 --> 00:48:02.190
Rhonda: Yeah saleable so it's kind of interesting that she made that suggestion wanting him to be. Yeah.

350
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.970
Shawn Phalen: You're in a small you're you're right at the border, you

351
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:16.200
Rhonda: Yes, I am. Yeah. Right up here and it's a small town like there's a mental health facility here, but there's no mental hospital here close by any anywhere close by.

352
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.440
Rhonda: I mean, if they were to get locked up for 5150 would probably be in another town.

353
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.550
Rhonda: Like you Rica, or somewhere like that so

354
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:35.160
Rhonda: Anyway yeah they're better off down there. And I'd like to visit with all I'd like to have all my children come up visit me

355
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:42.360
Rhonda: I went there last year to see them, but I'd like to, to visit them all of us together but like even

356
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:55.050
Rhonda: The one up here that stable and my daughter. She doesn't want him around when they're like that she's had to go through a lot of stuff with their brothers and we don't want them. We love them but we don't want the

357
00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:07.920
Rhonda: Involvement or there's always been too much you can, you know, from afar. Yes. Love them from a distance. So yeah, okay.

358
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.620
Shawn Phalen: Um, are we, how often are you wanting to meet remind me.

359
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:22.920
Rhonda: I think it's once or twice a month or something like that. That's fine with me. Okay, I wouldn't mind that a little bit, you know,

360
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:31.890
Rhonda: I was going to mental health here, but they're not even doing that right now here because every place.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.870
