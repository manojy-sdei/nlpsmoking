Miranda Archuleta: So I got out at 630 GMO fuzzy. But when I came over here.

5
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.730

6
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.100
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, they're 12 hour shifts,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.870
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that's a lot. Gosh.

8
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.920
Miranda Archuleta: It's not too bad, though, it goes by fast tonight. And that's it. So we go three days on a four days off, and then another every other week we work Wednesday, so

9
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.710
Dominique Pozo: Great.

10
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.970
Dominique Pozo: So, so what would you like to focus on today. What, what's up for you. Is there anything that's really

11
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.350
Dominique Pozo: Particularly up for you.

12
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.500
Miranda Archuleta: Not really anything in particular, I guess I'm doing okay.

13
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:06.330
Miranda Archuleta: Now that I went back to work. It's not so stressful because I don't want to be around the kid like that, but just it easier when you can get like a little break from the kids here and there, you know, so

14
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.860
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely.

15
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.110
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

16
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.660
Dominique Pozo: Well, um, well, let's see. I'm going to look up your chart. Maybe we can work on your treatment plan and talk about your goals.

17
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830
Dominique Pozo: Let's see, I'm gonna look it up right now.

18
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.840
Dominique Pozo: Sorry, it's taking a second to open up

19
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.130
The files.

20
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.090
Miranda Archuleta: Waking up for this.

21
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.950
Miranda Archuleta: Coming through

22
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100
Dominique Pozo: I wonder is, do you think moving forward. This might be too early for

23
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.170
Dominique Pozo: An individual session. No.

24
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.970
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, Nigerian coffee. I gave myself enough time.

25
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.400
Miranda Archuleta: To drink some coffee and kind of just wake up a little bit. I'll go back to sleep for like another few hours after so we're good.

26
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:43.560
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Well, I just want to tell you that I appreciate that you showed up, you know, it's just like this chronic issue with patients that they don't come and it's so frustrating for me. So I just want to acknowledge that you made it even though you worked all night. Thank you so much.

27
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.120
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, no, I used to just what would I FIRST STARTED AT GOOD WHEN I TRIED you guys a couple years ago, two years ago.

28
00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:06.330
Miranda Archuleta: I wasn't going to the group was catching myself not going. And I don't know if it was just, I don't know what it was. I just wasn't going in an okay job, but now I'm I think since I started again. I don't think I miss school

29
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.550
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah.

30
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.220
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, I started with you so

31
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.920
Miranda Archuleta: And there are. That sounds so

32
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:27.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I appreciate it. Okay. So yes, it's time. Definitely time to update your treatment plan all of the goals that you had were expired in October of last year. So let's let's

33
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.310
Miranda Archuleta: See, yeah.

34
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.380
Dominique Pozo: Not so.

35
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.090
Dominique Pozo: Oh, even before some of these say September. Okay.

36
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.250
Dominique Pozo: Great, so

37
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.800
Dominique Pozo: Tell me how one of the

38
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.520
Dominique Pozo: The short term goals says to identify how spirituality or religion affects your recovery process. Have you done that.

39
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.910
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Do you have any thoughts on that about

40
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.800
Dominique Pozo: How do you have a spiritual practice that is

41
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.340
Dominique Pozo: That is connected to your recovery.

42
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.190
Miranda Archuleta: Really

43
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay, it's fine. If you don't, is that even something that's important to you. I don't want to have it on here. If it's not something you really want to focus on

44
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.000
Miranda Archuleta: It's not really, no. Not that I even

45
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.980
Miranda Archuleta: I never really thought of it. And I guess being that I

46
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.370
Miranda Archuleta: Never really focused on it. I don't think it's a big thing.

47
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.370
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm gonna take it out, then this is

48
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.270
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering if someone whoever did this just did some generic goals for you because if that's not even on your radar. Let's just get it out of here. So,

49
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.630
Yes.

50
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.940
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

51
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.620
Dominique Pozo: So how about

52
00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:00.330
Dominique Pozo: Tell me, tell me something that you would like to work on say that maybe by the end of August. We can check in around it and see.

53
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.310
Dominique Pozo: How you're doing something that

54
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.990
Dominique Pozo: Realistically, you could potentially meet by, by the end of August.

55
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.410
Miranda Archuleta: I'm trying to work on my high blood pressure. I take two medicines.

56
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:33.090
Miranda Archuleta: At least try to regulate it, because even with the medicines, it's still high, sometimes, like a lot of time. So we'll work on that maybe getting it lower not having to take two medicines when we have not sure I'll see them, but it just seems like sometimes it's still high.

57
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.020
Miranda Archuleta: Okay, we can focus on learning how to like

58
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.630
Miranda Archuleta: I guess even like relax or meditate or something to help it go lower even with the two pills.

59
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.680
Okay.

60
00:06:50.040 --> 00:07:04.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. That's great that you're naming how you want to get there, too. So that's helpful because then we can. I can check in and say, you know, okay. How's it going, have you been meditating more. Do you notice that that is you know impacting your blood pressure.

61
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.910
Dominique Pozo: Okay. How about another one.

62
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.230
Miranda Archuleta: Maybe going on walks more sneaky.

63
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.040
Okay.

64
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:45.660
Miranda Archuleta: We're not even just more just like one on one with my daughter, because she's kind of real needy. So I'm trying to get that one on one with her, just so that we

65
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:57.750
Miranda Archuleta: Should go to sound like she doesn't have to interrupt all the time. If my other constraints talk or she always feels like gas to be her me going to try and get some maybe one on one time with her.

66
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:08.310
Miranda Archuleta: And get her knowing like I'm still here whether he's talking, he or she is always has to be right there and she says in the room mean

67
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.310
Miranda Archuleta: It gets all frustrated

68
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:22.830
Dominique Pozo: So this is great. This is do you have you have you ever hold on I'm gonna save this so that while we talk. It doesn't disappear.

69
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:26.970
Okay.

70
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.520
Dominique Pozo: Have you ever

71
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.910
Dominique Pozo: Heard about attachment theory.

72
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:44.760
Dominique Pozo: Okay, once we finished the goals. Today I'm going to pull up a little print out on attachment theory and it's all about how

73
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:57.510
Dominique Pozo: when we're children are caretakers, the kind of attachment that we form with them impacts our behavior as adults. And there's different kinds of secure attachment. There's disorganized attachment, there's

74
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:09.300
Dominique Pozo: Avoidance styles. There's all these different ways and it would be interesting to think about because the, the insecure attachment that I'm hearing from your daughter.

75
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.840
Dominique Pozo: Is meeting all the time. I'm wondering how

76
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:25.830
Dominique Pozo: You know what, actually, I'm not wondering, you're saying you're you're speaking to me that you want to work on maybe creating more of a secure attachment with her through walking with her so that she doesn't you know need that reassurance so much

77
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.580
Miranda Archuleta: So much is ridiculous. Sometimes it's like

78
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.700
Miranda Archuleta: Me like I get frustrated and I don't mean to

79
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:46.140
Miranda Archuleta: You like you're not buddy me. It's just, you know, you're just you don't let Jake of, you know, talker do anything because here you have to be right there. Like, you can't let no one else have attention or something.

80
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.480
Miranda Archuleta: She's super. She's crazy. She's super smart, but again, she's just

81
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.050
Miranda Archuleta: She's, she's one of a kind, that's for sure.

82
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:06.900
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is great. I think intuitively you know you need more time with her so that she can relax and know like okay her needs are getting met because it's actually has some strong needs for attention.

83
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay.

84
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.780
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great.

85
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.600
Dominique Pozo: So,

86
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.670
Dominique Pozo: Let's see.

87
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.210
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

88
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.370
Dominique Pozo: How about, well, let me get the. So one of the next one.

89
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:36.240
Dominique Pozo: Says get support and get off Suboxone is that, do you remember same month

90
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:51.090
Miranda Archuleta: I think I might have said it. But now that I kind of think about it. It seems like there's really not like a rush, rush for yes because being a I just

91
00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.600
Miranda Archuleta: I feel like a kind of just need it. I don't make media right now for some reason. I mean, it's been years I've been on it anyways but

92
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.040
Miranda Archuleta: I wrote though ever been like maybe cutting down but not really. I guess getting

93
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:21.270
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. So here, here's how you're rewarded it tell me if the sun's accurate and continue receiving the support of bright heart health.

94
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.620
Dominique Pozo: As she works towards tapering down slowly.

95
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.730
Yes.

96
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.080
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

97
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.540
Dominique Pozo: This feels more like a long term goal, actually. So I'm going to put this one in the long term goals.

98
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:00.690
Okay.

99
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.280
Dominique Pozo: You said

100
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.970
Dominique Pozo: Here it says in quotes.

101
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.650
Dominique Pozo: I liked.

102
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.900
Dominique Pozo: So I know that

103
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.800
Miranda Archuleta: It's a broker right here.

104
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.110
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I said, does that mean that the group is beneficial for you or what does that mean

105
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.900
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, pretty much. It does help me. I actually enjoy going

106
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.320
Miranda Archuleta: I just, I feel like I'm

107
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:55.800
Miranda Archuleta: You know, I'm just with everybody else at the same situation or been there, done that. I just feel like there's really no filter on what I can say, or, you know, like everybody pretty much is now. So yeah, enjoy.

108
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:03.900
Dominique Pozo: Okay so uh for your short term goal to check in a couple months just continue attending your weekly relapse prevention group.

109
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:15.120
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, definitely. Because like I said before, I, I wasn't going and just, I just wouldn't go. So I just want to make sure I stay on that jacket. Keep going. Even though I'm working

110
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.940
Miranda Archuleta: See, we're going

111
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:37.710
Dominique Pozo: OK. And then let's see in September of last year, it says you're interested in counseling and it says client all attend individual therapy weekly. Do you, do you want to be coming weekly or do you want to come once or twice a month every other week. What, what is your

112
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.240
Miranda Archuleta: Which is fine.

113
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.770
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm going to say attend

114
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.700
Dominique Pozo: In the tool there be this.

115
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.250
Dominique Pozo: This

116
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.470
Dominique Pozo: twice a month.

117
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:56.730
Yeah.

118
00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.410
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

119
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.420
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's see.

120
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.170
Dominique Pozo: How about two more goals.

121
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.540
Miranda Archuleta: See

122
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.970
Miranda Archuleta: It's too.

123
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.960
Miranda Archuleta: I guess kind of seem to get my car back to get a car back

124
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.340
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

125
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.220
Miranda Archuleta: This little wrinkles changing

126
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.770
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great.

127
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.070
Miranda Archuleta: Is getting better routine during the day, like

128
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.860
Miranda Archuleta: During the day, but just I guess when I'm when I'm often we're just have a better routine.

129
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.940
Miranda Archuleta: Scheduling good on the schedule or something.

130
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.610
Miranda Archuleta: I've been wanting to do

131
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.400
Dominique Pozo: What would that look like

132
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:32.220
Miranda Archuleta: Um, it's, it was game better than a and I got my job. So no have to work on it again to figure out

133
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.490
Miranda Archuleta: Nicely when you know

134
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.590
Miranda Archuleta: Will be a

135
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.400
Miranda Archuleta: Teenagers, especially since the kids are still home.

136
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.710
Miranda Archuleta: Can you get tired.

137
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:09.810
Dominique Pozo: Can you name what that would look like. Ideally, like what would a I wrote to create a schedule that involves more balance between rest and activity look this. Does that sound accurate.

138
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.070
Dominique Pozo: The person you've dialed is not able to receive calls at this time.

139
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.700
Dominique Pozo: MIRANDA are two Leta just

140
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:30.660
Dominique Pozo: got bumped out of the zoom room. I tried calling and was unable to reach her. Can somebody else try to reach her, please.

141
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.530
Dominique Pozo: I'm still in the zoom room waiting for her to return.

142
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.090
Dominique Pozo: My pleasure, dear.

143
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.380

145
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.400
Dominique Pozo: I see you trying so hard to support him.

146
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.730
Dominique Pozo: And it hurts me as well to see the hits you're taking

147
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.490
Dominique Pozo: I just

148
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.850
Miranda Archuleta: Disconnected this evening back with us. I had my husband. Check it and it was disconnected.

Dominique Pozo: Your chart again I am

154
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:06.000
Dominique Pozo: I contacted the virtual clinic so they they might call you looking for you because that's like, I don't know what happened. I tried calling her

155
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.860
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

156
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.000
That's okay.

157
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.500
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so we got cut off. When I was asking you.

158
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:28.470
Dominique Pozo: To to kind of name for me. So the justice that I got about you're creating a different a better schedule for yourself is one that is more balanced between rest and activity. Is that accurate.

159
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.010
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

160
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.360
Dominique Pozo: Can you hear me.

161
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:46.800
Yeah.

162
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.360
Miranda Archuleta: Maybe

163
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.530
Dominique Pozo: So I'll just say it again.

164
00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:04.050
Dominique Pozo: That's okay. I was writing down in your chart that you wanted to create a schedule that that supports more balance between your rest and activity is that

165
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.420
Miranda Archuleta: Accurate. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

166
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.270
Dominique Pozo: And then what would it look like. So can you be a little more specific. Like, what would that schedule look like

167
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.850
Miranda Archuleta: It's just more like

168
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:29.820
Miranda Archuleta: Maybe just like more of what like what to do on unscheduled like what to do daily like sweating like activity or something with the kids.

169
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:39.030
Miranda Archuleta: Are different stuff like different is this different stuff daily just they're not born all the time it gets a word.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.020
Okay.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:48.600
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

172
00:24:52.260 --> 00:25:02.940
Dominique Pozo: Any, any more long term goals that you can think of. I mean, the one that I have is just that you keep getting support from us and work on tapering down slowly. Are there any other

173
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.200
Miranda Archuleta: Just yes

174
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.090
Miranda Archuleta: Steve financially stay warriors. It's just so hard to get off track to

175
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.010
Dominique Pozo: Stay financially stable.

176
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.820

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.580
Dominique Pozo: That's good. Well, here's a few questions that

179
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.040
Dominique Pozo: Are unanswered in your treatment plan.

180
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.390
Dominique Pozo: Are you aware of any emotional triggers that are

181
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.580
Dominique Pozo: That that are

182
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.130
Dominique Pozo: Pretty you

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.210
Miranda Archuleta: Know, really, like I said, I'm like, past the triggers already kind of like to see where

184
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.620
Miranda Archuleta: I can see deals and you know they can be around. And I just, they just don't

185
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.170
Miranda Archuleta: It's not even on mine to you and I thought tonight. Think of to me.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:07.890
Dominique Pozo: All right.

206
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.810
Dominique Pozo: And if you got in any sort of trouble with in any way, who would you call

207
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.670
Miranda Archuleta: Me, brother.

208
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:22.080
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

209
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:34.740
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And then last one. Um, how about some self soothing or self care behavior that you that you know either works for you or that you're doing currently that to

210
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.690
Dominique Pozo: Take care of yourself.

211
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.360
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

212
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.170
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm just going to put maybe wants to work on this.

213
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.220
Yeah.

214
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:54.720
Okay.

215
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.560
Dominique Pozo: All right.

216
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.350
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I

217
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.360
Dominique Pozo: Am actually pulling up

218
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.640
Dominique Pozo: The attachment theory.

219
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.140
Dominique Pozo: stuff to talk about this with you. It might shine some light on what's going on with your daughter, maybe

220
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.520
Miranda Archuleta: Oh,

221
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.850
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, she's just hard. She's crazy.

222
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.570
Dominique Pozo: So actually, before we get into it. Is this

223
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.190
Dominique Pozo: Is this

224
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.640
Dominique Pozo: Even interesting to you because I don't want to share it. If it's not

225
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:21.930
Miranda Archuleta: Ya know, it is cuz she's just she's yeah she's, she's going to pretty much like trying anything I guess at this point because

226
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:39.390
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, she ever since she was little like we just we had her like I stopped working and everything so sick and she grew out of room, our problem. And I just stayed home with her. Still, and I know I just felt like if I left her anybody. Like, I guess.

227
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.710
Like

228
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.340
Miranda Archuleta: They wouldn't beat her because I felt like she was just so hard, like I just felt like she couldn't go like I couldn't leave a little bit scared to like we were

229
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:58.140
Miranda Archuleta: Just, you know, I get to the point where I'm like, good evening. I'll literally shake because she gets me like that and

230
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.370
Dominique Pozo: It is I.

231
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:09.240
Miranda Archuleta: Think, maybe it's a little bit attachment with me to with her, but I'm not too sure like no that's growing older. I was like, I thought she she kind of sell

232
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.250
Sell this

233
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:26.160
Miranda Archuleta: Ever to be wrong. Everything is just like sometimes I get frustrated. I'm shaking. A lot of times, I think that's all my blood pressure goes up is pushes my button. So this she just

234
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:27.960
Miranda Archuleta: Just, uh,

235
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.490
Miranda Archuleta: Huh.

236
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.100
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Well, let's see. Let's see if this shines a new light for you.

237
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:36.630
Dominique Pozo: So,

238
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.870
Dominique Pozo: So do you want to read it or do you want me to read it.

239
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.030
Miranda Archuleta: Read it.

240
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.010
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

241
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.180
Miranda Archuleta: Okay.

242
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:50.940
Dominique Pozo: So this is, um, so there's so this man john Bowlby, he was a therapist long ago.

243
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.850
Dominique Pozo: In the early 1900s, he came up with this attachment theory.

244
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:10.530
Dominique Pozo: That speaks to you know what goes on for children. So it's based on the idea that an infant needs a secure relationship with their primary caregiver. Usually that's mom. But if they don't have a month, whoever sing character.

245
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:29.220
Dominique Pozo: In order to fulfill their social and emotional development. So they did him and this woman, Mary Ainsworth did all these studies between infants and their caregivers and they came up with this, these, these this theory about it so

246
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:40.020
Dominique Pozo: The theory states that as adults. It allows us to feel secure which enables us to go out and explore the world without stress and anxiety.

247
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:45.690
Dominique Pozo: But instead with trust that we will be taking care of by life so

248
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:53.340
Dominique Pozo: I mean your daughter so young to she's still probably moving through some of the natural stages which right here.

249
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:05.220
Dominique Pozo: So Stage one of attachment when it's secure, is that there's cooperation intimacy respect love and trust.

250
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:13.680
Dominique Pozo: And then when they're when there's resistant attachment their attention seeking they crave affection and are very clean.

251
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.850
Dominique Pozo: Is that

252
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.430
Dominique Pozo: Is that kind of what she's

253
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.060
Doing. Yeah.

254
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:19.860
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah.

255
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.800
Dominique Pozo: So,

256
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.800
Dominique Pozo: Well, so this is great because it sounds like she's still in stage one and then

257
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:43.290
Dominique Pozo: The independence. That's probably when she'll start to hit like I'm adolescence and this is just something to be aware of. If you know if you can work on it. Now you can avoid her becoming rebellious reckless manipulative

258
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.240
Dominique Pozo: passive aggressive

259
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:59.760
Dominique Pozo: All these things that you know the most ideal of the securely attached adolescent is that they have self control, they're confident they're assertive, they're responsible and they start to gain their, their autonomy. Their sense of self.

260
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.430
Dominique Pozo: So I think what you're doing is great, is to start, you know, addressing this. Now, tell me again how old she is. Sorry, I

261
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.270
Dominique Pozo: Just 660 she's still so young. Yeah.

262
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.590
Miranda Archuleta: She's a little manipulative to you and I'm

263
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.090
Miranda Archuleta: Even that values. No, no, she's, she's kind of already there.

264
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.890
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay, well,

265
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.790
Miranda Archuleta: Okay, so

266
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:30.030
Dominique Pozo: So here's, you know, you can just read. Can you read that without your glasses. What

267
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.500
Yeah.

268
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:44.340
Dominique Pozo: So the, the thing that's like lights up a bit of a concern for me is that some of this behavior. It's what can lead to, you know, addictions, like, you know, being

269
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.220
Dominique Pozo: The, you know, over indulgent and the codependent behavior, all that

270
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:51.750
Miranda Archuleta: You know,

271
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:57.570
Dominique Pozo: When ideally we want someone to grow into being creative resilient persistent motivated

272
00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.100
Dominique Pozo: caring, compassionate empathetic all the things

273
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:17.220
Miranda Archuleta: She's awesome. Is there, like, she just she's very successful. She's good problems all like all right there. She's creative design persistent motivate. I mean, all that she's there like she has all that she

274
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.180
Dominique Pozo: was great.

275
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.010
Dominique Pozo: That's good. So it sounds like

276
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.860
Miranda Archuleta: attention seeking kind of thing.

277
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.150
Miranda Archuleta: That she's really falling there any other ones.

278
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.380
Okay.

279
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.690
Dominique Pozo: She's super smart. Yeah.

280
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:48.450
Miranda Archuleta: Sometimes she does it just because she knows she can. And I think that's a lot of times why she does it. I noticed like she's just doing it because she knows she can get away with it or she knows she's added some marks doing a lot of times that's I think it is.

281
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.830
Dominique Pozo: Well, what do you think, Oh, I'm going to close my door. Excuse me. I'm just starting to rain.

282
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.600
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, what do you think

283
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:20.160
Dominique Pozo: What do you think you could be doing differently. Aside from, you know, the spending more time is crucial. I think that's critical. More quality time with her. Is there anything else that you could be doing is there may be a way that you're communicating with her.

284
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.070
Miranda Archuleta: Maybe like

285
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:35.790
Miranda Archuleta: Maybe just because we're seeing with like his mom and dad knows I feel like maybe she she feels like maybe she's a little left out because there's a cousin now and

286
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:47.220
Miranda Archuleta: She sometimes feels like I guess you can't tell us what's going on because matter, we will, you know, kind of like, because we're here to kind of not have to but

287
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:54.840
Miranda Archuleta: Sometimes you feel like, oh, where's somebody else's house. You know, you gotta respect that and kind of like, you can have a scene, but I guess.

288
00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:58.890
Miranda Archuleta: He feels like

289
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.900
Miranda Archuleta: She gets questions just start yelling and not sure less

290
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:20.070
Miranda Archuleta: Suffering like it's over, it's over now because I just want to kind of avoid the argument is a problem because they argue over like the stupid stuff all these two boys, they just acquired so maybe I don't hear her out all the way, but

291
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.860
Dominique Pozo: Oh. Well, that makes sense. I

292
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:32.430
Dominique Pozo: Mean, maybe she is, you know, all of her attention seeking is letting you know she needs to be heard, like there's something that she's getting cut off was being heard.

293
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.460
Miranda Archuleta: That may be what it is.

294
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:47.490
Dominique Pozo: That's so great. Well, I think you're you're totally problem solving on your own. Like, okay, I'm going to take more time, just with her and that will give her the space to be heard.

295
00:37:48.030 --> 00:38:02.250
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah, because I feel like sometimes doesn't get to see what she needs to say because I'd rather just avoid, you know, the big argument between cousin or sounds like it's over. Just stop. I don't want to hear and only one here, so maybe I just either here.

296
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.930
Dominique Pozo: I think so.

297
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.720
Dominique Pozo: Sounds really simple actually. Yeah.

298
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.870
Dominique Pozo: She's totally in a she's a really intelligent little one who's got all these ideas and

299
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:21.030
Dominique Pozo: Things to say it, I can imagine she really needs to be heard, to be validated and

300
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:21.930
Dominique Pozo: This is

301
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:33.990
Dominique Pozo: A part of that attachment is that when the caregiver meets the child and says, I see you great and mirrors back then they internalize that and then their confidence builds from there.

302
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.630
Miranda Archuleta: Yes, it is. Yeah.

303
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.430
Miranda Archuleta: Oh,

304
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.420
Great.

305
00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:51.030
Dominique Pozo: Great. Well, I think that was good. We, we definitely kind of updated your treatment plan. Is there anything else you'd like to do today. I think

306
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.530
Dominique Pozo: Anything else that's up for you.

307
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.030
Miranda Archuleta: See

308
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.390
Miranda Archuleta: Think I think we did that someone started working on that. Maybe some

309
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.350
Miranda Archuleta: Letters talking by just getting by yourself. Yeah.

310
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.040
Miranda Archuleta: Does it for now.

311
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:37.560
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's look at our calendars and what we can set up for our next session time

312
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:55.830
Dominique Pozo: So if this is a good time for you. I can do the same time on the third which is two weeks from today Wednesday, the third at noon.

313
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.140
Miranda Archuleta: That's fine. Okay.

314
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.830
Dominique Pozo: All right, let's plan on that then

315
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.110
Dominique Pozo: All right. Okay.

316
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.240
Dominique Pozo: All right, Miranda

317
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.980
Dominique Pozo: Have a great day and I hope you get some

318
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.180
Dominique Pozo: Good rest and

319
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.200
Miranda Archuleta: Thank you.

320
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.650
Dominique Pozo: And I hope that you have some really quality time with your daughter.

321
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.350
Miranda Archuleta: Yeah I know she's good. Hey,
