00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:10.860
Samantha Scott: I'm so sorry. I was trying to sign in. And then I will. I tried to facebook sign and that didn't work so i reset my password. And then I got then I was in right but then I was different. I didn't know where to a meeting. And finally, I figured it out.

3
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

4
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're here and actually I owe you an apology. You are my last client of the day.

5
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.910
And

6
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This may end up happening to us too.

7
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes feelings. Don't just turn off right when the hour hits the top of the hour.

8
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.880
Samantha Scott: Right. Oh yeah, totally.

9
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what ends up happening is it just sort of keep snowballing forward. I don't want to borrow from Peter to pay Paul kind of thing.

10
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.680
Right.

11
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.580
Samantha Scott: I just didn't want you to think that I was not here, you know, that's why I texted you.

12
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me tell you what's actually happening on my show you this cool thing. Let me see screenshot, you'll be able to see what I see. So let me see if it'll work.

13
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.150
Samantha Scott: It should have my name on it. And that was something that she said I needed to fix. So hopefully, it does have that now.

14
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.500
Samantha Scott: This will end up working on me just

15
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna work.

16
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can you see your own video or no.

17
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.420
Samantha Scott: Yes, I know I can see a screen.

18
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Too bad. Okay, I'm gonna do it another way.

19
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.200
Samantha Scott: Okay.

20
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got this cool thing called us you know that screen we take a snapshot of something

21
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that's going to show you show you what I see, so that you can feel confident of what I see. I got a funny little picture here for me.

22
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.900
Samantha Scott: Oh, I mean, I could see my video on the bottom of the screen. Is that what you mean.

23
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hang on just two seconds we'll get there for me. I know there's a delay. It's weird, cuz it looks like I'm doing nothing. And I think it's just it's a word.

24
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.020
Samantha Scott: Notice a couple times. Like if I talk too fast or something. I feel like I'm going beyond the zoom you know

25
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, here we go about ready to do a screen share. And there it is.

26
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want you to see what I see.

27
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So look at

28
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Look over on the right you see your name over here under

29
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.040
Samantha Scott: Man. Awesome.

30
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But just so you know, I saw you earlier.

31
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.550
Samantha Scott: And I'm pretty cool.

32
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Unfortunately, I can't chat with you. I used to

33
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.820
Samantha Scott: Know, but that's good to know. Because then I know that I'm not just sitting there and you don't know that I'm there. You know what I mean.

34
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally. So I'm going to change. Eventually off your out the new Upgrade. No one seems to know why chat disappeared. Oh no, here I got it. Now I it's here on this one. I'll just say hi to you and Hi. So you just got a chat.

35
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.850
Tonight.

36
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

37
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm really glad you're here.

38
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.950
Samantha Scott: I'm glad to

39
00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and my understanding from Dr. Gabriel is that this, this is something you've kind of been kind of back burner in it for a while and you're ready to get to it.

40
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:16.380
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, I am. I mean, always my excuse was either. I wasn't making a wall like my last job I we had to pay for insurance per month. So it was like $700 a month.

41
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.750
Samantha Scott: So by the time we paid for that, like on we're journalists, you know, so it's like

42
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.300
Samantha Scott: Not a lot of money. And by the time we paid our insurance. We didn't really have time or money to go pay copays, you know,

43
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.070
Samantha Scott: So, so this is Enya. And it's just I don't know like in the past year.

44
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.580
Samantha Scott: I've realized a lot of things will last a year ago I cut off contact with my mom because I finally realized that like

45
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:59.460
Samantha Scott: All this time. My dad was super abusive and he's really like, you know, he just fits in the black hat. So I put it on him. But, um,

46
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.160
Samantha Scott: I realized, she's like super manipulative and then I started like doing all these like reading all this stuff about like narcissism and stuff. And like

47
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:19.800
Samantha Scott: I realized like, that's totally what she is. And so I said if you can't treat me with respect and if you can see me as something else beyond like an extension of you.

48
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.230
Samantha Scott: And this way I reflect you then.

49
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:38.910
Samantha Scott: Then call me, but she hasn't, you know, and I blocked her on social media because she was just sending ugly messages and messaging, my friends, I even had to post something like you know if my mom messages you about me. Please do not tell her anything, you know,

50
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you just gave me a little snapshot. So today, Samantha. This is going to be a little bit different today. We won't be able to get into all of that, but something

51
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.490
Else.

52
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't do you can't do your part wrong. It's all me.

53
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.950
Awesome.

54
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show you what we have to do.

55
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you have an idea of how much work we have ahead of us. Okay.

56
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, my job to as as nicely as I can keep us in here. We're going to need to cover lots of see all these drop downs. So many things we're going to need to

57
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.780
Samantha Scott: I got it. I can stay on task with you totally

58
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: psyched. So now here's I have a little thing that I do, which is

59
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The very first thing I do is I want to introduce myself.

60
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you have some clue of who you're working with.

61
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

62
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I am Gwen Gwen of your hey you my counselor that blonde lady I i'm not hung up on titles labels. You can call me whatever you want the one that you know whatever

63
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, not Dr. Phil, I'm

64
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist. I've been licensed here in Florida for over 20 years, love, love, love my job. I was definitely meant to do it.

65
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but I've been very drawn of this will be brief because this is going to be an assessment from you but I'm getting a snapshot

66
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: On the reason that I'm working with substance use. It started with working with populations and finding out very quickly right next door was addictive behavior, whether it was a process, a person alcohol, sex, drugs, alcohol, whatever.

67
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just seemed like it was everywhere.

68
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to understand it more. And I've never left whether I was an EA T or I was working in felony drug court or residential or I've dabbled in lots of different locations, but always sort of saying nice and close to the substance use. It's so pervasive.

69
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Oh, I continue to be intrigued by it love working with the population, but really what ends up happening is, even though we're labeling and I'm working at substance use, what's happening is I'm actually treating trauma.

70
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

71
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.590
Samantha Scott: Generally, I have a lot of trauma.

72
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Comfy zone. So, you're in good company all my clients, same thing, right.

73
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we're presenting here with this symptom withdrawal and de de de but what I'm treating is the developmental complex trauma. Some of it is shock trauma. So, so that's what I'm actually treating

74
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.170
Samantha Scott: Oh yeah, definitely.

75
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple more things I use my phone. I use my phone for scheduling. Something else I use it for which is I let my clients know and I'm letting you know if you are feeling isolated or that you're about to go into a sort of a suffer moment. I don't want you to feel like you're alone.

76
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can send me a message like

77
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This day just sucks.

78
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you can send me one of those. But what will come back.

79
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't be like this, how you and I are talking and it's warm and fuzzy

80
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Hopefully it's warm and fuzzy what ends up coming back. I've learned over the years, is it can feel a little cold to my client, and I'm warning you now.

81
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.700
Samantha Scott: It's actually advice. Right.

82
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.470
Samantha Scott: There. Okay.

83
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I will not be giving advice.

84
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.050
Samantha Scott: Okay.

85
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotcha. I won't be validating, I won't be any of those things. What I'll end up saying is, this is for scheduling. So I'll say something like, ooh. Ooh, that sounds difficult. When can you meet in zoom

86
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in here now. Yeah. And so, um,

87
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.380
Samantha Scott: I like to say that make sense. I mean work life balance. You got to

88
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it doesn't work.

89
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right translation through a text, it will fail. It has failed for years and now I know

90
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.260
Samantha Scott: Right, all the inflection everything. Yeah, totally.

91
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to dive and what we're going to start with is you're going to notice a pattern and some of my questioning, you're going to hear

92
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what was the age of first useful. What was the progression will will, when was your last use when I'm not going to be hearing today. And this might be the part that you want to share. It'll be

93
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Our next session is why right

94
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.600
Why

95
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.850
Samantha Scott: I got you were building a timeline kind of sort of

96
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to hear me interrupt a little bit here and there, and I won't mean to be offensive. I won't get through it. It's a two hours that we have to jam in

97
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.390
Samantha Scott: To for you guys.

98
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. I'm gonna I'm gonna learn about the progression of your opiate use. So I'd like to know the age that you first experimented with any short acting opiate of any kind.

99
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:35.820
Samantha Scott: I was actually talked to Dr. Dre Brill I'm the first stage was 17 I was prescribed it by a doctor after I had a

100
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:51.690
Samantha Scott: Leap of laser excision procedure on my cervix wouldn't stop bleeding, blah, blah, went back, they put silver stuff on it to stop it silver nitrate or something and then gave me a prescription for pain medicine.

101
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.130
Samantha Scott: I never taken it.

102
00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So how long have you been a long so 17 habit. How long were you on that prescribed medication. And what was it,

103
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:21.540
Samantha Scott: It was, I think, just bike it in probably like five milligram bike it in and it was a couple of refills back in those days, you know, you got like one and then you'd call back and they give you one more refill usually so it wasn't definitely a habit. But that was the first time.

104
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have the age I have sort of onset experience of it or a couple refills. And then, so this is I'm giving you an example and then hey, I didn't use for three years or

105
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you know what I ended up doing. I ended up going and stealing from my friends cabinets and you know when it got to the point that I was inhaling it and I was using 60 milligrams a day. So I want to hear the progression from 17 to today, not in every detail I

106
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Think right

107
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.090
Samantha Scott: Now snapshot gotcha, gotcha.

108
00:11:51.510 --> 00:12:16.170
Samantha Scott: Okay, so, um, I'd say from 17 to a even 20 even whenever I first moved here even to like 23 or 24 when I first moved here to New Mexico. It was more of a flirtation I maybe take some, but it was never an everyday habit.

109
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:35.700
Samantha Scott: And then I moved here. I met this person who I felt like it was my best friend and she had a disease called a reflex sympathetic dystrophy at the time. And she had a ton of prescribed oxy code on

110
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello, hello to you at this time to you.

111
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.640
Samantha Scott: 2425 ish

112
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so friend had available medication age 25. Tell me about what you how much you were doing at that time.

113
00:12:49.500 --> 00:13:01.920
Samantha Scott: I could take a 120 milligram and super high rush like that was probably that was the good time couldn't have the legs.

114
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, your age 25 and you're doing, how much a day.

115
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.400
Samantha Scott: When he know I mean I can take a 20 milligram oxy codeine and get high from it.

116
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you, adjusting it taking it orally, where you crushing it. How'd you adjusted

117
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:27.330
Samantha Scott: I was at that time I had taken it orally and then I crushed it in my mouth coding and that was the first time I experienced that you for you.

118
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.740
Samantha Scott: Know,

119
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.200
Samantha Scott: crushing up with 20

120
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what was the progression from there.

121
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:45.480
Samantha Scott: From there, she needed money, um, to do stuff she had this prescription. So I would give her money. I felt like it was a good deals, she was giving me drugs and

122
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:58.800
Samantha Scott: I've sorted by more and more from her at that time I was in college, and my pretty much, I had a job, but like my student loan money was what I was using, for the most part, it would be dispersed and I would give her a bunch of money.

123
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:18.030
Samantha Scott: Um, I'd say a progress pretty rapidly because I mean within like within a month. I was doing double, triple the you know that amount, and it seemed to progress really fast, the tolerance seemed to build up super fast.

124
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're 42 now.

125
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there you are there. And what was the progression from there. Just kind of checking in on at its worst, or maybe you tried fentanyl maybe went to heroin just sort of let me in on that a little

126
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:43.380
Samantha Scott: At the worst, the worst thing that I was doing is my husband was getting a pain prescription for a legitimate condition which he doesn't get any more.

127
00:14:44.580 --> 00:15:03.150

255
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:48.600

256
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Any used every weekend after that. What was the progression.

257
00:26:52.140 --> 00:27:11.340
Samantha Scott: I would say that's fairly accurate. And when I turned 17 I moved out of the house and moved in with my boyfriend who was a pot dealer. So after that, I would say it was like daily you know twice daily at least probably

258
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Two joints or two balls, a day.

259
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.760

260
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it, okay.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: When was your last use. Was it this morning and how much

264

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.820
Samantha Scott: Not that I know a

268
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Client denies lifetime use any experimental use of crystal of math accidental or intentional.

269
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did I can use that method.

270
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Man crystal meth.

271
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, age of what about this one. What about age, your first use of a hallucinogen like mushroom.

272
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:35.250
Samantha Scott: Oh, I'm probably maybe a little bit later than the pot. So maybe 17 I'm

273
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I tend to like them.

274
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:47.400
Samantha Scott: A lot. I mean, when I was in high school to my early 20s, I probably did mushrooms.

275
00:28:48.480 --> 00:29:05.850
Samantha Scott: Are nice man I probably did mushrooms like 50 times I did acid, maybe comparable 50 times have never done like pod or any of the other hallucinogens

276
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

277
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.220
Samantha Scott: Or x to see

278
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That one too. And I appreciate when people. Remind me to add that tonight.

279
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.550
Samantha Scott: Supposedly, it's back. I don't know. I mean, that's what I hear. I haven't done anything but I hear people talking about it.

280
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We got dude, what was the last time you did.

281
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Any hallucinogen last time.

282
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:43.770
Samantha Scott: I would say it's been a bow. It was definitely before I moved to Albuquerque, and it was even a little bit before that, I would say it's been about 14 years at least.

283
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.980
Samantha Scott: Maybe 15

284
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:54.540
Samantha Scott: I had a bad trip. And after a couple bad trips I stopped.

285
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: At first use of

286
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A benzodiazepine that says Xanax

287
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.590
Samantha Scott: Of the

288
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:17.040
Samantha Scott: Gosh, I'm trying to remember it would have been later. I don't think I tried that may be until my early 20s.

289
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:35.940
Samantha Scott: And I was prescribed it a prescribed Valium for like 10 years by my doctor for just basically oh post traumatic stress disorder will keep you at this low level and then they realized how harmful. They were with the dementia and then I go

290
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here we have 10 years. I want to know is that at one milligram a day at night or what

291
00:30:43.980 --> 00:31:05.640
Samantha Scott: A 10. No, it was when I was prescribed it was five milligrams a day. But I would sometimes go over that, you know, I would take like instead of taking my take like one and a half of those. And the next day you know i'd take an extra the other half from something else and

292
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:33.240
Samantha Scott: The worst one was, I was prescribed Xanax after my best friend committed suicide here on and I was only on it for maybe six months, but she told me to wean myself down. I didn't. And I thought I could just stop cold turkey and it was the worst, worst thing my back was just spasming and

293
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:39.960
Samantha Scott: That was Xanax and I think that was a small dose. I'm trying to remember. I think it was like point five.

294
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me when your last use of a benzodiazepine of its many names. When was your last

295
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:55.980
Samantha Scott: It's been since the last prescribed it to me. Um, so at least five or six years.

296
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.670
Okay.

297
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha. And have you ever had a seizure associated with coming off of the bentos

298
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.730
Samantha Scott: I'm pretty sure that that Xanax black thing. Yeah, that was

299
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: To see your history.

300
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Secondary to benzo papering or stopping

301
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.150
Samantha Scott: Definitely more painful than any other withdrawal with phones.

302
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

303
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about treatment history. Let's see, we have various levels of care. Let me start with just. Yes. No. Have you ever had treatment for substance use, aside from what you're getting right now. Yes. No.

304
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, here we go. Then let's dive into that age of first use of substance use treatment. How old are you,

305
00:32:41.820 --> 00:33:07.440
Samantha Scott: Okay, this would have been around. Okay, so this was after Lisa and I'm sorry it's really already at the year. Just give me a second, it would have been she died in 2006 um so it would have been 2007 to 2008

306
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:23.310
Samantha Scott: I did the Methadone program and actually it might have been more like 2009 closer to one and a half to two years I did the Methadone program. I think the highest dose that I got to was

307
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:32.490
Samantha Scott: 80 or something and then I did the entire taper thing and came off and then was briefly clean

308
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: For how many months.

309
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.040
Samantha Scott: Um, maybe seven

310
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

311
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.070
Samantha Scott: And it started slow and

312
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.880
Samantha Scott: Then, hold on.

313
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're so this isn't it. This is an MIT program that's what this will be

314
00:33:52.500 --> 00:34:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah ever been in. I'm going to start with higher levels of care. So I want to know if you've ever been hospitalized or spent 30 days in a residential program. No.

315
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're denying so please transcribe client tonight's lifetime of hospitalization, as well as residential level of care. Have you ever been in an intensive outpatient program where you spend three to four hours a day, three times a week.

316
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.670
Samantha Scott: No.

317
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Client and as intensive outpatient care. What about

318
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking to a therapist, maybe once a week.

319
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: For a few months or years where you talked about the underlying history. What about that.

320
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:41.610
Samantha Scott: Yeah, yeah. There were a couple of times. Once I had the insurance and I was able to see a therapist who did em, Dr. Yeah.

321
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It turns out it's a good thing. We'll, we'll talk more. What year was that he gave me the year

322
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.290
Samantha Scott: Ah, gosh, that would have been

323
00:34:50.430 --> 00:35:10.560
Samantha Scott: Um, let's say, to trying to think, okay, says after I met 30 bubble for this would have probably been about 2005 2007 maybe

324
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days a week just approximate

325
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.920
Samantha Scott: Oh, just one appointment, a week.

326
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Once a week. Got it. And we also at that time also receiving psychiatric medication management at that time.

327
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.410
Samantha Scott: I did see a psychiatrist.

328
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:38.040
Samantha Scott: For a while I had to self pay and he ended up not seeing him abruptly. He was prescribing me quantify.

329
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:38.820
Oh,

330
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many months or years were you prescribed and took Klonopin

331
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:56.040
Samantha Scott: That was. I mean, it wasn't very long. I saw him once, twice, and then he wanted to. He said I had to pay him again. And I couldn't afford it. So it was like six months maybe

332
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Six months.

333
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, this provider of the outpatient care 2005 2007 was this treating substance use, or when I pick this conversation up again. Should I kind of move it down into depression, anxiety, PTSD and it was really more about the mental health. Peace.

334
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:28.080
Samantha Scott: Yeah, before the MA TT therapy. I had never been honest with any healthcare provider about my addiction.

335
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so this outpatient care 2005 to 2007

336
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.770
Samantha Scott: The first time I saw it outside, outside help.

337
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.380
Samantha Scott: Okay, for a day addiction, so

338
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get this straight. Basically that care and now these are these are you're addressing sort of the behavioral health part

339
00:36:50.010 --> 00:37:00.780
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I mean I feel like a lot of the I definitely just feel like everything from like I had don't have the coping skills. And that's one of the reasons why I

340
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:10.740
Samantha Scott: You know, and I feel like my trauma, especially the stuff some stuff I probably can't even remember is very informative of like how I

341
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:18.450
Samantha Scott: How I continue to navigate life and it's really not a effective or good

342
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. We're going to go now into psychiatric history. Again, we're just looking for. See if you can just let let the structure of these

343
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Pre populated questions, see if they can help help guide us. I've been going off the cuff doing my own thing that for a second. I like to know people substance use history, probably more than anyone does. I really like to know.

344
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is for me.

345
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So it needs an accreditation requirement, but it's also very much for me. So

346
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, we're going to keep these answers. Nice and tight. Here we go.

347
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been diagnosed with

348
00:37:51.960 --> 00:38:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: A psychiatric illness such as depression, anxiety, bipolar movement disorder learning disorder impulse disorder obsessive compulsive disorder psychiatric anything diagnosed

350
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.460

351
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.470

352
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Before 18. Yeah, no, you can't do that. Yeah.

353
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:36.570
Samantha Scott: Well I, I honestly have. I mean, it seems like the treatment protocol, like the DB T stuff is seems really cool.

354
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:44.550
Samantha Scott: I don't know. It just seems like most of the people I know who have been diagnosed borderline or teenage girls so it's

355
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get it, I, that's why I asked one to know what it was. I know Scott you. Alright, so we've got

356
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Complex PTSD.

357
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.330

362
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:17.640
Samantha Scott: No, I mean, I don't think so. Those have been the main ones. I mean, somebody might have said, Oh, you're depressed or. But in general, those are the diagnoses.

363
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank you for that. And have you ever been hospitalized because you wanted to end your life and being hospitalized. You may be kept your client denies lifetime hospitalization for suicidal behavior.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:57.090
Samantha Scott: My mom took me once when I was a cutter. When I was younger, and my mom took me to a residential facility. When I was like, I don't know, like 16 probably and then she but she got me right out. Like I was there for like two hours. Hmm.

366
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. Okay.

367
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.210
Samantha Scott: But that's the only mental health hospital thing I've done

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.740
Samantha Scott: Not that I know of.

372
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fair. What about psychiatric or psychotic, did anyone in the family stories. Anyone have any psychotic episodes in their family history father side and other side

374
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for them. Let's see what we, what do we got. What about okay so yeah you started to talk about something really important and I got it. This is where I slow way down and I like to hear some some specific so

375
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Age you first had and I distinguish self injurious behavior from suicidal. Okay.

376
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I shouldn't. Maybe they're the same for you.

377
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's pull them apart just for now.

378
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.690
Samantha Scott: Yeah. No, they weren't the same for me.

379
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: For sure. So age of rolling going to talk about suicidal ideation right now and I'm going to distinguish that also from intent. I don't want to be alive.

380
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to distinguish it also from a plan and from action. So I'm starting with the age that you started thinking, I don't want to be alive. How old were you

381
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.010
Samantha Scott: I don't know. I don't know that I've ever thought that

382
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.880
Awesome.

383
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:58.650
Samantha Scott: I mean I've definitely wanted like whatever the pain or whatever the trouble or whatever it is to end and I've sometimes, um, you know, maybe act it out.

384
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.760
Samantha Scott: Just because I was so miserable. But I don't think I've ever genuinely wanted to kill myself.

385
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Client denies lifetimes to like suicidal ideation plan intent action. Let's go over to homicidal. Have you ever thought about killing someone else put together a plan and

386
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Seriously, yeah.

387
00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Ask worse. No.

388
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.670
Samantha Scott: No, no. I mean, do you mean, have I seriously considered killing someone no

389
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I know you have the same guy over in New Mexico that I have on my freeway. I want to call them to not that one.

390
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.900
Samantha Scott: But no, no, not an actual so homicide plans.

391
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And tonight's tonight's lifetime homicidal ideation intent of plan and action. So now let's move over to self injury.

392
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This. How old were you when you started to

393
00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To cut our burn or hurt yourself over you.

394
00:42:50.610 --> 00:43:02.970
Samantha Scott: I mean, it was a very brief time that I did that, probably from the age of like 14 to 16 or 17 and

395
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:15.120
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, part of me wonders. I mean, yeah, there's definitely like the release, but like part of me wonders if I was like acting out to, like, I don't know.

396
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do all that with you at another time.

Samantha Scott: And so, for the most part they were probably exploitive, and one sided. I definitely did a lot of to put it as simply as I can. I definitely did a lot of like going out and quote unquote acting like a man and like you know trying to have control.

696
01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:24.210
Samantha Scott: But not really having control.

697
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Got you.

698
01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Married, for how long.

699
01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.030
Samantha Scott: We have been married now. Geez, gosh, it's like eight years.

700
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are living with and I want to know pets included

701
01:09:44.040 --> 01:10:03.450
Samantha Scott: Yes, I live with my husband, Rudy, and I live with my let's see 1234 dogs. Now we have Frank, we have Hannah. We have Izzy, and we have bandit.

702
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.630
Samantha Scott: Okay, three small dogs one big

703
01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Other anyone else living in the home.

704
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:10.620
No.

705
01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: No any

706
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Lifetime how many arrests.

707
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.910
Samantha Scott: Of me yeah zero

708
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients nice lifetime history of arrest. So it's safe to assume you have no open pretrial release cases probation or parole client denied any open cases, please transcribe hobbies, what are the things you like to do fishing, hunting painting.

709
01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:39.240
Samantha Scott: Puzzle I'm really into stories. I like

710
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:47.610
Samantha Scott: Writing I like reading. I like watching movies. Those are probably my big ones spending time with the dogs to be

711
01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Got it. Okay, I'm

712
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how about

713
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

714
01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say three things I want you to remember them all ask them a little bit later.

715
01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a rock.

716
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Pen. These are glasses.

717
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you and I

718
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going to do now the formal part is over. Yay.

719
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, but this this part still really important and it has to do with writing goals.

720
01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.050
Samantha Scott: Okay.

721
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to come up with two, we can write as many or as little along the way but two of them.

722
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can think of today. So I'm going to help a little bit just

723
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a prize. One of them having to do with

724
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Substance use history. This is your goal, right, not mine, not. You're not. Nobody's but yours right you it's going to guide our work together.

725
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to know, sort of in your own words. I want to what

726
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.450
Samantha Scott: In terms of substance, please.

727
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am.

728
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:32.430
Samantha Scott: I'm in terms of substance abuse, I want to successfully. Use this medication for the time needed to get the proper skills and work together with you guys and ultimately be free of any substance, but I'm not rushing into that I want to take as much time as it needs to get this right.

729
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's move to the second piece which might pull these apart a little bit. I want to successfully use medication for the time needed to get the proper skills. So let's take those proper skills that you think about, let's move over to this other side, which has to do

730
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For Pedro health, psychological, emotional, let's go into that for a moment.

731
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like you just say in your own terms. And again, I'm putting these in quotes. So we want to really be sort of tight.

732
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.540
With it.

733
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's all it is. Maybe you've already said it. So see if you can identify what you want either more of or less of when it comes to the behavioral health part, what's your goal.

734
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:26.040
Samantha Scott: I want more healthy coping skills and ability to interact with an imperfect world without going insane.

735
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:29.160
Samantha Scott: And I want to

736
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.330
Samantha Scott: I want to also like define

737
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:47.940
Samantha Scott: This sounds. I'm trying to think of a non complicated way to say it like I want to be able to differentiate the problems that I experienced growing up.

738
01:13:48.420 --> 01:14:02.970
Samantha Scott: In one way I feel like I'm reliving the same interaction again and again and again and again that I had with my mother and then now I have it with whoever I'm around my husband, in this instance, and I would like to

739
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:11.670
Samantha Scott: I would like to create that and make it what I actually want versus just the program pattern that is in

740
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in basic terms, it's I want to resolve childhood wounding and I would like to have a positive, constructive healthy relationship with my mother.

741
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:35.070
Samantha Scott: I would like to, I would like to do that. I don't know if it's going to be possible with her, but I would like to at least have a healthy perspective from my end.

742
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's just stick. We'll get into the other stuff later. How about we just stick with I want to heal from childhood, warning, warning.

743
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, nice. Gotcha.

744
01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.370
That's a big

745
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing around there and I'll carry on for the whole time.

746
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're done. Did it

747
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're done. Did it

748
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm now.

749
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna have to go pretty quickly, but just want to ask you what those three objects were

750
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:14.250
Samantha Scott: Oh, a pant. Oh, wait. Was it rock pan glasses.

751
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, nice.

752
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She, she identified was able to recall those three

753
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:19.650
Three objects.

754
01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, some of them will just give you a quick snapshot. And in fact, we're going to do, I'll do that in a second. Let's pick another time to meet actually first. Okay.

755
01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.940
Samantha Scott: I mean my schedule is pre open right now so

756
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I do all my work in the first half of the day. I know most people are like, I want to see you at night. But no, I

757
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.230
Samantha Scott: Know, I hear you. That's that makes sense.

758
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So right now, and it doesn't mean this is the time slot will carve out one that ends up that you and I can really commit to an irregular basis.

759
01:15:51.540 --> 01:16:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the short term, we might be floating around a little bit. I want to pick a time that's not subject to

760
01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: My bi weekly people trying to flip flopping I use old school agenda stuff so I'm

761
01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:17.100
Samantha Scott: That's good. I mean, I would. It uses different parts of your brain. I know, writing with a pen uses different parts of your brain than typing. So

762
01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just, if I

763
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Get yeah

764
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on just a second. So I want you to just sort of give me a minute to think. Yeah.

765
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.240
Samantha Scott: Take your time.

766
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that's it. I think I've got one time, I think I can commit to

767
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What about next week. So next week. So we might have a

768
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Temporary time for

769
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Them. Okay, how about the book book book book book book about how about

770
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On Tuesday, that's your new group is Tuesday, so I can't do that. Never mind shift gears.

771
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What about one time only.

772
01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: One time only next Wednesday. Okay, April 22 at 9am

773
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:31.560
Samantha Scott: Let's do it.

774
01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful. And then so your upcoming services are you have a group on April 21 it's my brand spanking new group with you in it. Right, and that's a new one. For me, it's going to be noon for you. The next day, we'll get to meet at 9am Mountain Standard Time. Of course.

775
01:17:55.470 --> 01:18:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try to create a time for you, more consistently at

776
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: 10am on Wednesdays.

777
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:06.540
Samantha Scott: That sounds good.

778
01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm gonna try for that. Okay.

779
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.520
Samantha Scott: If it doesn't work out, like I said my schedule super flexible right now so

780
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've got you.

781
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got those two written in once they're in writing, which they are. I got a nobody is going to go in there. So we are set. So real quick, just a little intro in some of the kind of work that you and I might do together.

782
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.600
So,

783
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I of course bread and butter interlaced with everything, of course, is the CBD that cognitive behavioral therapy and DDT love it. I love it. I'm a

784
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Big fan of. So that's interleaved but that's sort of like like duh, for me, like,

785
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The work that it sounds like since you've had a positive experience with a therapist for some

786
01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: For years, you were able to connect it sounds like on some more, you know, intimate interpersonal level. My guess is that you would probably be a good candidate for somatic transformation inner child work having to do more with sort of

787
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:22.110
Samantha Scott: Transformations really interesting to me that's I mean I've, I've done a little bit of reading in the in the DB T areas and I mean

788
01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:28.440
Samantha Scott: Or maybe I'm thinking of something else. Maybe it was like, I think I'm thinking of somatic experiencing.

789
01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: War with Peter will be. Yeah.

790
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.720
Samantha Scott: You are okay yeah so that's definitely something I

791
01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.930
Samantha Scott: Get into me anyway so

792
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to know. Just real quick and then I gotta go.

793
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you have a positive experience meaning not that along the way. It wasn't in pleasant, but that the final outcome of the FDR was a positive one.

794
01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:58.560
Samantha Scott: Yeah, and I mean in terms of the research I've looked at in recent research, it seems really like

795
01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:00.450
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

796
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a positive outcome from it.

797
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:04.290
Samantha Scott: Yes, I'd say so.

798
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times did you go

799
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:11.550
Samantha Scott: Um, I mean, probably not more than 12

800
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:12.960
Okay.

801
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:18.300
Samantha Scott: Unfortunately, I mean, I would have kept going.

802
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I do it here in in the tele health. It's, I, I can't do with a little buzzers. And I don't do the little sounds, but I do the eye movement part I do we might look up attachment focused Cmdr. I do an extra little piece to it, you could look that up.

803
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's interesting. It will become relevant I think especially around the fact that somebody along the way identified you as having this borderline piece.

804
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's going to be a relevant part our relationship, how you perceive judgment and abandoned and all those parts will probably come into play. So I'm just

805
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:58.530
Samantha Scott: Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.

806
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Although whatever preconceived notions. Most people have about me. They probably think I drive a convertible. They probably think that I was a cheerleader. When I was in high school, you can let that although

807
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not what I look like.

808
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.790
Samantha Scott: To me seems funny.

809
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

810
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It says a lot of humor.

811
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot, a lot, a lot of play. But it is pretty serious business. And I mean, I ain't clued a lot of humor into it so the more that you kind of have that ability all I'll leave that in wherever we can.

812
01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:35.310
Samantha Scott: Definitely into absurd. LAUGHTER And like crying through tears and stuff.

813
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, good, good.

814
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The other thing would be want to know what electronic device you're going to be using so that I know my limitations around me and Dr. Kind of are you using a phone.

815
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.940
Samantha Scott: We don't use your phone, but I also have a laptop and then I can use if that helps.

816
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Out about. Yeah, it probably will, at about the maybe fourth or fifth session.

817
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm probably going to say, could we shift gears we shift gears to get zoom on their let's let's kind of see and and kind of start to integrate, possibly in Cmdr. Possibly. I don't know yet.

818
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll be able to tell probably after those sessions.

819
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool.

820
01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:36.150
Samantha Scott: I'm excited about this whole process. I'm really excited about working with you. I feel lucky because I know that there. I mean, I know that there's like a level of professionalism that you could serve anyone, but it is nice to feel a personal connection and I do feel that with you.

821
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

822
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.370
Samantha Scott: That's a human. I'm talking to you.

823
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes.

824
01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you reject that. So you'll definitely

825
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Have on that. So a couple of quick things. I won't. You won't learn much about me on a personal level, it's all about you. So my mind boundaries is a really important feature of the work we're going to do together doesn't mean we can't laugh our asses off though.

826
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:57.600
Right.

827
01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But there will I don't want there to be any moment where you actually think you have to take care of me. I don't want that in here. So you're in a really you're going to meet that you're going to bump into it, probably you if you end up

828
01:23:10.770 --> 01:23:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Having big feelings like oh I'm angry that you can bring that in here. I'm not gonna, I'm not going to make it about me. I'm not going to been doing this a long time so you can bring bring it. Okay.

829
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.670
Samantha Scott: I'll be honest, I promise.

830
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Um, one thing I do, where I'm an independent contractor, which means that if you so the night before. I'm pretty good. I'll try and send a little reminder. I'll say, hey,

831
01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:39.330
Samantha Scott: Here you did yesterday.

832
01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. Yeah, sometimes it'll feel redundant, but I like to send the consistency to all of my clients, even if we touch base in group you're going to be like, oh, Hawaii, she's sending I just told her I'd be there.

833
01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:55.410
Samantha Scott: But I'm going, Oh no, I appreciate that. I definitely can use the reminder always

834
01:23:55.650 --> 01:24:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you something sort of in the life and limb category of urgent comes about the night before just text me say I really can't keep the appointment. I'm here in the hospital.

835
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:08.490
Samantha Scott: Some people right

836
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: He's still met with me while they're in the hospital.

837
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and but my point is I do earn my living here meeting with you. So if I know far enough in advance, the people that I have an on call list.

838
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.290
Samantha Scott: Schedule with them.

839
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:22.680
Samantha Scott: Right.

840
01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I could love to know.

841
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um, and it is a treatment program. So it's a little it's a slightly different feel than just

842
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The psychological part because it's a substance abuse treatment program, you're probably going to feel a little bit like what's up with all these rules. This is annoying.

843
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but they're there, they're there because they work they hold all sort of accountable in a way that just correct mental health, depression, anxiety that

844
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:56.100
Samantha Scott: That's not I know and I mean this is the first time, like I said,

845
01:24:56.610 --> 01:25:10.170
Samantha Scott: Besides the Methadone thing. This is the first time I'm like actually coming at this from a honest, I've always tried to cover up with every time I've seen the doctor within the past 10 years it's been. Oh, I have to make sure and cover up this. You know what I mean.

846
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:12.090
Samantha Scott: So I

847
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:17.850
Samantha Scott: I am definitely respectful and I will make sure to respect all the roles and

848
01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, well, I just want you to know that they're, they're not to be mean.

849
01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:23.490
Samantha Scott: They're not right.

850
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's in service to you. Sometimes they'll feel more welcome than others.

851
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can come in here and you can say this one I really don't like or this one piss me off, you're welcome to say those things and we can process it one more thing and then I keep thinking that this will definitely be the last one.

852
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go again. Dr. Aubrey hell is my mother.

853
01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

854
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:44.070
Samantha Scott: She told me that

855
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's good. But you're not going to really, most of the time, if ever, most people have been in here for years and they don't know because they forgot. I told them, or they weren't my

856
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Writing to begin with because I don't call her that I cry Dr Arielle and I will do that ever horn.

857
01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:00.720
Samantha Scott: You're not

858
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A parent, you won't see a deliberate dialogue from parent to child, but what you will see is a really comfortable relationship, you're going to see a comfort level in here that is

859
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: very playful, sometimes it doesn't drift off into anything uncomfortable. If it does, I want you to know you can bring it in here. Probably going to be able to bring it to her, she's not the therapist, but I am

860
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay so that all of it as sin tonic. That's a great word out there, it means whatever comes up for you. You can bring it in here and we can process and talk about it.

861
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, yes, but since you have a dynamic with your mother just pay close attention to things that come up when you're in group. If you see something that kind of activates for you.

862
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of make a little note of it in your recovery journal and maybe you can bring it in and say, Boy, I had this real thing and it was right.

863
01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You did this thing to her right, something happens, it's a feature.

864
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That this program offers because we don't normally get to see that happen in real time.

865
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:02.220
That

866
01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't happen.

867
01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:04.860
Samantha Scott: So let's use it.

868
01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:06.750
Samantha Scott: Yeah. Might as well.

869
01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

870
01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:07.620
Samantha Scott: I don't

871
01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I look forward to seeing you at now is your medication bridge.

872
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:12.270
To today.

873
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:23.910
Samantha Scott: Yes, the wall. She prescribed another week's worth, so I think I'm okay. Until the till the next time. Well, our group session. Right.

874
01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Okay. So I'm going to tell her any way that you're here somehow she worked that part out. But this is what I do. If I think I will.

875
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: 99% of the time. Remember to ask you. This is your medication bridge to today. Some days it will be some days that won't. It sounds like you don't have a medication issue, but I do like to send a message of compliance, sort of, hey, she showed up. So

876
01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sending that now. So she knows that you

877
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Have your bio psychosocial

878
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Attended

879
01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Did her bps and she reports. She does not need medication, she has enough to get to our groups. All right.

880
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.390
Samantha Scott: I believe, so our groups next week. Right.

881
01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you really want to be sure, because this is your moment. This is when you're facilitating

882
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.620
Samantha Scott: Me check. I've got the hold on. I've got them right here.

883
01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:18.720

886
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not thinking. Um, yeah. My work is done. I feel good on the end of my day. I'm going to go have some dinner.

887
01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:44.700
Right on.

888
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I wrote is Samantha Scott attended her bps. She of course she has enough to get her to her next service of group on for 21

889
01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if

Gwenevere Abriel: Anything comes up. Don't forget this.

891
01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:58.320
Samantha Scott: Uh huh.

892
01:28:58.590 --> 01:29:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You can literally walk in, sort of, metaphorically into virtual clinic. You can roll in there. If you have any questions, you can just go in there and ask them, or you can call bright heart health. Okay.

893
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:13.260
Samantha Scott: Okay. Sounds good. I'm really excited to work with you.
