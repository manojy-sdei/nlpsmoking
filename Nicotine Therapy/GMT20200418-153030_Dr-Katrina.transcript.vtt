122
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.910

127
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

128
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.790

Dr Katrina Groves: Right, that's ginger co as a PA

130
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:23.730
Dr Katrina Groves: And so, medications, I'm looking at right now. Besides, let's see. You like the sub sub better than the Suboxone. Is that right,

131
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:32.670
Galaxy A20: Yeah, I was using this zone, but lately I've had a really, really, really bad tooth infection.

132
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.310
Galaxy A20: It's been makes it really worse. Wow, so

133
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:47.430
Galaxy A20: Last week, Tony. She sent him the script for this about some says, as long as it's working better now.

134
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.040
Galaxy A20: I just can't take the Tsar until I get those teeth removed.

135
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.820
Dr Katrina Groves: And when. When is that going to be with all that's going on.

136
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.910
Galaxy A20: Your guess is as good as mine.

137
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.040
Galaxy A20: But this Suboxone side, you know, this is

138
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.100
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't remember why you switched in the first place.

139
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.580
Galaxy A20: I just liked it better. Okay. Yeah.

140
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:22.290
Dr Katrina Groves: Just remember, it has a standard under your tongue along a little bit longer. So when do you need your new prescription. And did she call you in a month or just a

141
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.230
Galaxy A20: Week. I'll be in a week. Yeah, until I got this figured out

142
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.970
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so when is it do you have your prescriptions with you at all. You know the date that it's dude.

143
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.580

Galaxy A20: I have right next right now.

145
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.080
Dr Katrina Groves: But so two days ago would have been Thursday. So you're good until I'll just give you a prescription on

146
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.970
Dr Katrina Groves: Thursday, then

147
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.710
Dr Katrina Groves: For the Suboxone and you're doing three a day, I assume.

271
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.330
Galaxy A20: Luckily, I was up in the mountains working, you know,

272
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.270
Galaxy A20: Michaels farm. So that was

273
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:25.500
Galaxy A20: distractions. Yeah, it was a blessing to be away from everybody and not able to come to town and whatnot so

274
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.460
Wow.

275
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Now that takes a lot of

276
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:41.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Internal fortitude to not use especially when you kind of have permission and your brain, like the box. I know I can go get

277
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:43.740
Galaxy A20: It.

278
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.690
Dr Katrina Groves: So you must want this pretty bad.

279
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.630
Galaxy A20: But, but two and a half hours on the phone yesterday and the

280
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.400
Galaxy A20: Day before that.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.590
Dr Katrina Groves: And better. I'm getting

283
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.630
Galaxy A20: Up early on Saturday. I'm ready.

284
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Appointments I could have put you at 11

285
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.760
Galaxy A20: It's like she's only has a 931

286
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:16.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. So, okay, going down, you're more any tremors seizures vertigo or headaches.

287
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.680
Galaxy A20: I get vertigo every once in a while, but

288
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:20.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Not

289
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.820
Dr Katrina Groves: That much here but inner ear problem.

290
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:32.400
Galaxy A20: I don't know. I need to look at that, after I talked to my doctor, they just kind of shrug it off as well as what else is happening.

291
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.120
Galaxy A20: Right. So yeah, I'm talking

292
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Like, is it the rooms thing. Is that what you feel. Okay.

293
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:48.900
Dr Katrina Groves: So what I describe it to people as there's probably a little rocks in your ears and you know how your middle ear is your balance, Oregon.

294
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:58.860
Dr Katrina Groves: So what you can do look this up online if you have access to the computer. It's called Benign Positional Vertigo or BP PV

295
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:14.280
Dr Katrina Groves: And there's a way exercise you can actually do you like you throw your head forward you throw your head back, you turn it sideways. There's that can move those little calcium deposits out of your ears and it makes the

296
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Decision and

297
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.890
Dr Katrina Groves: It is, I mean, really, you got to flop yourself on the bed there.

298
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.360
Dr Katrina Groves: But there's a certain ways to do it. And if you will stick with it.

299
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.800
Dr Katrina Groves: It will move like a teeter totter. Right now you're like this when they get out of balance, it will kind of move them back.

300
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:46.230
Dr Katrina Groves: But it's worse before it gets better because you have to like do the exercises and they make you dizzy. But they, it does work if that's what's going on. But yeah, you should have someone look inside your ear. I can't really see here right now inside

301
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:46.740
The

302
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.650
Galaxy A20: Library, because we're I'll get a

303
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.330
Galaxy A20: An old memory like I'll think of something to have thought of years.

304
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.340
Galaxy A20: It's like, why am I think of that. Next thing that I was like, oh, oh.

305
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.320
Galaxy A20: I just gave up. You know, like a very good or something, just like

306
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:13.020
Galaxy A20: It's like a solid like 3045 seconds, you know, I'm just like, I shouldn't even be driving right now kind of thing, you know.

307
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.030
Galaxy A20: And it's, it's been happening.

308
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.000
Galaxy A20: For the last probably six or seven years.

309
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.320
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

310
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:34.680
Galaxy A20: It's not all the time, though, it's like it's really random times, but it's only when I'm thinking about something that I haven't thought about yours. Sure. Yeah, it's really we're chatting doctors about age dismiss it like they always do.

311
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:47.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, you know, that doesn't sound like that what I was talking about them. It sounds more like it's it's hooked up with that memory of either was at your brain injury or limited to that.

312
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.000
Galaxy A20: No, this is before I even got ran over the way before like

313
00:22:52.080 --> 00:23:00.810
Galaxy A20: Probably happened, I was 22 for the first time, like I was leaving my friend's house and walk to another friends and I was like, Oh, well that's like I got severe lightheadedness,

314
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.350
Galaxy A20: But the only comes with

315
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.740
Galaxy A20: Something that I hadn't even thought about it forever.

316
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.820
Galaxy A20: Or just just the next thing I'm just like, Oh, I can

317
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.640
Galaxy A20: Sit down before I fall over or

318
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:21.840
Galaxy A20: And I want to say used to happen at least once a day for about like two years.

319
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.260
Galaxy A20: And went from like maybe once a month, and now it's slowly coming back.

320
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.470
Galaxy A20: As if it isn't the most because nobody has no idea what I'm talking about when I say it. Yeah.

321
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.720
Dr Katrina Groves: That's how it is like there's times where I've been driving

322
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.380
Galaxy A20: And it's just go, I'm probably gonna crash to kill somebody.

323
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, it would be good to pull over, you know,

324
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.950
Galaxy A20: Only last about 1015 seconds.

325
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:55.980
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, and get it sounds like it's hooked up to a brain a neurological you know

326
00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:06.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Thing in your head. So maybe if you stop when you stop thinking about stuff from the past and you're busy and you're not bored. You know, it's less likely to happen, but you are

327
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.620
Galaxy A20: Like like thinking about the past.

328
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.890
Galaxy A20: Year looking looking at my phone or something, some spoke with my hand.

329
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.260
Galaxy A20: Was up to me.

330
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.670
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. What do you ever lose consciousness and pass out.

331
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.800
Galaxy A20: No, no, never been that

332
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.530

Yeah.

334
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.550
That's interesting.

335
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:42.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Yep, because it's a hard thing to figure out. You'd have to see a neural neuro psych specialist to get that fixed up

336
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.860
Galaxy A20: Yeah, that's a whole nother can of worms. I don't want to open up

337
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.180
Dr Katrina Groves: It is so speaking of mood issues. Do you have trouble still with depression, anxiety,

338
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.850
Dr Katrina Groves: What about sleep problems or how's your sleep.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.490
Galaxy A20: 65

344
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:16.620
And any

345
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:21.570
Dr Katrina Groves: Suicidal thoughts at times. Do you ever get so hopeless or despair.

346
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright so let me see what else I got here.

347
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.830
Dr Katrina Groves: Um, do you feel like, what, what are your coping skills right now that you're using.

348

Galaxy A20: So,

349
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.320

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.160
Mm hmm.

352
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.810
Galaxy A20: I would still be doing that right now if I had that I have added for

353
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.130
Galaxy A20: Me.

354
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.990
Dr Katrina Groves: What do you mean by micro dosing

355
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.080

Galaxy A20: The mushrooms.

363
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Are just plain just mushrooms.

364
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.810
Galaxy A20: Not in my life.

365
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.110

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.590

Dr Katrina Groves: The mountain right

374
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.620
And it was

375
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.240
Galaxy A20: That

376
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.430
Galaxy A20: I can't do too much.

383
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.880

387
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:52.290
Dr Katrina Groves: So you probably feel kind of stuck with your mom like you could otherwise just leave and go somewhere else. Right.

Dr Katrina Groves: I didn't ask about

393
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.880

Dr Katrina Groves: Number one, of course, is the opioid dependence severe intermission.

463
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Year and a half. That's great.

464
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Yes.

465
00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:18.720
Dr Katrina Groves: nicotine dependence, which is also severe on cigarettes or tobacco use. However, I guess that's nicotine is the appropriate billing term for that I'm currently have a dental infection and all my antibiotics, but he's his primary care doctor is dealing with that.

466
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.040
Dr Katrina Groves: No other psychiatric diagnoses. Oh, chronic pain from his

467
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Motor via

468
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.540
Dr Katrina Groves: His trauma. He wasn't sure on the date that

469
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.080
I think you said for five years.

470
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.980
Dr Katrina Groves: So he's got a

471
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.550
Dr Katrina Groves: Brain injury.

472
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh gosh, I'm blanking on the name

473
00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.930
Dr Katrina Groves: He does have left leg.

474
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:09.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Pain like an ankle pain from severe fractures and he

475
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:17.610
Dr Katrina Groves: Has hardware in place that's under his assessment to, I guess, and he'll be following plan would be to follow up with his

476
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.220
Dr Katrina Groves: primary care doctor

477
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.880
Dr Katrina Groves: So he can get a referral to Orthopedics and the meantime, he's using ice and

478
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.480
Dr Katrina Groves: Wrapping and elevating his leg as needed.

479
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Alcohol uses not a problem right now. So I'm not really going to mention that

480
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Sounds like he's using only occasionally, although it's concerning because of his

481
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.350
Dr Katrina Groves: I guess I will mention it. It's concerning because of his family history.

482
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.350
Dr Katrina Groves: But at this point. He's not drinking enough to

483
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Be a problem.

484
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.250
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh boy, I did advise him to not drink it on

485
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:16.920
Dr Katrina Groves: His pharmacy Walmart on Thursday I will see him on that Dan mentioned

486
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.640
Dr Katrina Groves: I had a question. So I'm kind of new to this to

487
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.390
Dr Katrina Groves: Aging. I hope I'm pronouncing it right

488
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:45.900
Dr Katrina Groves: If I want them to follow up. Do you put that somewhere. I know you put that in the dictation. But then, do you reach out to the team and tell them when his follow up appointment is or is that for me to do because I've gotten different answers from different people.

489
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.810
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'm probably just going to go into slack right now and type the follow up.

490
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.660
Dr Katrina Groves: Or scheduling, I think.

491
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.000
Dr Katrina Groves: But I didn't know if you happen to know. So maybe you can send me a little email.

492
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.040
Dr Katrina Groves: And then I KNOW THIS WENT LONGER THAN USUAL, but I have time, so

493
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Any questions on his HMP, let me know.

494
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:24.060
Dr Katrina Groves: Otherwise, I'll see him on Thursday at 10 o'clock in the morning P SP Pacific Standard Time.

495
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.230
Dr Katrina Groves: And where are you located, you're probably

496
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:29.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Far away.

497
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:42.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Thursday would be what 23rd. Okay, thanks. A gene. I'm going to log off for now, just because I don't know if that other patient is going to come in or not.

498
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:44.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Bye bye. Have a good day.
