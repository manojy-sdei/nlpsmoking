Dawn Abriel: Nice to meet you. You've had a long day. Haven't you

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh my goodness. It's been a rough

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.570
Dawn Abriel: A lot of questions. DUKE. And I've got to ask you a bunch more. So

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.010
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Charger on my phone here.

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.070
Dawn Abriel: So that would be a good idea.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.210
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I've been. I was on the phone with her for almost god like hadn't been two hours now. My phone is dying. I've got to get it plugged in here.

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.560
Yeah.

14
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Come up here and paint with me. Okay.

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.800
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Come on me.

16
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So,

17
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.240
Dawn Abriel: I was looking at your

18
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.430
Dawn Abriel: Prescription Monitoring Program that shows the medicines, people have been on

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.540
Absolutely.

20
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.210
Dawn Abriel: It says here that you are currently taking 24 milligrams of up Murphy.

21
00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:05.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I'm at three Suboxone strips. A day right now, but I don't have any more medic I run out on Monday. And when I went in to see my provider today I was discharged because of having to reschedule appointments

22
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When I'm on the phone.

23
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She's impossible just impossible.

24
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The spider.

25
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.880
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh my god.

26
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.890
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not anymore.

27
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sorry fighter now.

28
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

29
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.470
Dawn Abriel: So, um,

30
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They didn't fill my prescription today when I which they just said I was non compliant with my going in and I just got evicted from my house. I had to move yesterday, so I couldn't go to my appointment yesterday.

31
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:58.230
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I rescheduled for today, not knowing that when I went in there. I was just going to be discharged and I asked her, am I going to get some kind of a temporary prescription so that I'm not in withdrawal and she said no.

32
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So they didn't even send you with anything. And I've been out since Monday.

33
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So,

34
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.390
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Please have to finish this. Okay.

35
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I killed this fighter.

36
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:33.630
Dawn Abriel: So I will try to do this as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, usually I look at all the information that people give the care coordinator, and then I don't have to ask those questions. So I might have to ask repeat questions.

37
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.210
Dawn Abriel: But just bear. Bear with the process.

38
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.610
Dawn Abriel: Alright, so your last dose was last Monday.

39
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.230
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It was this past Monday.

40
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.140
Dawn Abriel: Just the day before yesterday right and

41
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.690
Dawn Abriel: You, you take all three strips all at once in the morning.

42
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm not all at once. I take

43
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:15.090
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I try to, I try to make. I like split them apart. So I'll take two in the morning and then I'll wait almost a full day until I start feeling a little weird. And then I'll take the last one in the afternoon. Sometime I close to the evening time

44
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:32.580
Dawn Abriel: Okay. ARIEL I gotta tell you, that is not the way this medicine was designed it is not the way you can't get an appropriate blood level, you can't get it just, it was designed to last 24 to 36 hours so

45
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, I was just scared because I've only been on the treatment for a short time. So I was just scared to take the, I mean, I should be doing that. It's just doing the three in the morning.

46
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:53.730
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, because you it's really confusing to your body. And if you're doing it that way. My guess is that you don't need the full 24 my gift.

47
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.990
Dawn Abriel: That you

48
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:08.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Probably need a 24 but I've just been trying to like when I first went in there. I told me that I was going to try to cut myself down and like, hey, I could start there and then maybe over a couple weeks. I can go down to like one and two. She said, Don't do that. That's

49
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.820
Dawn Abriel: Your. No, no.

50
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.450
Dawn Abriel: No, no bad

51
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: About and then that leads to relapse. Don't do that. That's right.

52
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

53
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.110
Dawn Abriel: That's right. So in this program, what we will do is get you stable get you

54
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:32.040
Dawn Abriel: Know functioning the program and then probably like the end of April, May be first of May will start very, very slowly tapering you down.

55
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.070
Dawn Abriel: Very slowly small amounts

56
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.960
Dawn Abriel: Because you're at a lot of medicine. That's a lot of drug to be taking

57
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.910
Dawn Abriel: I've taken to consideration that one milligram of buprenorphine.

58
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.960
Dawn Abriel: Equals 20 milligrams of morphine.

59
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.100
Dawn Abriel: Oh wow, you're taking a huge amount

60
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.190
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and you have to because

61
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:04.350
Dawn Abriel: The other short acting opioids that you took you developed a tolerance, right, you needed more and more and more.

62
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.040
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Right.

63
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.710
Dawn Abriel: To get the same effect or to prevent withdrawal.

64
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.120
Right, so

65
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.820
Dawn Abriel: Were you ever an IV drug user

66
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.890
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, never.

67
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.260
Dawn Abriel: And how old were you when you first started using opioids.

68
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I would say

69
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.740
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

70
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.980
Dawn Abriel: And it started with prescription

71
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.060
Yes.

72
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.300
Dawn Abriel: And

73
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.410
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever had an overdose or medical problems or legal issues because of the opioid use

74
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.980
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No legal issues or anything like that, but I have had

75
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I've had an I've had an overdose or pretty close to one. I didn't have to go the hospital or anything, but I was really sick.

76
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.160
Dawn Abriel: And it was accidental.

77
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Accidentally accidentally acid.

78
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.890
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you first started using any illicit drug even marijuana

79
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.130
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I would say 21 2020 years old 20 years old.

80
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.150
Okay.

81
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.600
Dawn Abriel: And has your drug use resulted in problems with relationship or holding down a job.

82
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Know,

83
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Which name right.

84
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Look for him for

85
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.040
Dawn Abriel: Now, and what number program is this for you.

86
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:04.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: This is the very well courageous transformations. The place that's trance referred me to you guys. They are actually

87
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.770
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They're actually the very first ones you guys would be my second

88
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Program as far as referring me to you guys.

89
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Remember your neighbor friend. Okay.

90
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:32.910
Dawn Abriel: So, boy, we were told a completely different story. We were told that they had maxed out their number of clientele that they can order buprenorphine for and that's why they

91
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.480
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Were answering

92
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:45.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, they told me that I was not compliant with coming to my appointments, because I live so far away. I did have to reschedule a few appointments, but that's

93
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:58.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's what they told me I was not compliant and that they needed to refer me out to another clinic and there was a the lady named Ashley. She was a support worker in the room. She was also sitting in the room with us. She's the one that called you guys

94
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.990
Dawn Abriel: Well, I'm glad she called

95
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.580
Dawn Abriel: Me. So do you have sleeping anxiety issues also

96
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:14.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I would say, maybe a little bit of anxiety. I've never been diagnosed with that, but I don't have sleep issues really

97
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.780
Dawn Abriel: That's good.

98
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.560
Dawn Abriel: And have you ever been hospitalized for a psychiatric problem for mental health problems.

99
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.940
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, ma'am.

100
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.660
Dawn Abriel: And what would you say your stress level is right now.

101
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Probably through the roof.

102
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.680
Dawn Abriel: And

103
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.250
Dawn Abriel: So its economic

104
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.850
Dawn Abriel: Housing

105
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.710
Dawn Abriel: What else

106
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.290
Dawn Abriel: No, social, what would the stresses of

107
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:04.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, like, Gosh, we've done, like you said, the move the victor recent eviction just a couple days ago.

108
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:16.140
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Trying to figure out where we're. I mean, trying to look for a house trying to figure out where we're going to move. And now today upon finding out that I was discharged is trying to find a new doctor so I am not in suffer.

109
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And also counseling and boost. So I guess.

110
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.630
Galaxy J3 Orbit: All the things

111
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.220
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and how about you self esteem. How would you rate yet.

112
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.800
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I would say about a seven. If it's from one to 10 I would say about a

113
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.030
Dawn Abriel: Good. Alright, so let's do the medical issues.

114
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:42.480
Dawn Abriel: And I have to ask you a really long list of questions. So, stop me if any of them apply to you.

115
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, okay.

116
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.170
Dawn Abriel: First of all, do you know what your blood type is

117
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I do not, it's not a rare one. I don't know.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, most recently, I have had

127
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.010
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Attempts

128
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.350
Dawn Abriel: And does that include

129
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.360
Dawn Abriel: A plan.

130
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.410

Dawn Abriel: So I was telling you that while you're on Suboxone it's easier to quit smoking and and we will support you. We really, you know, it's such a dangerous chemical. It's much more dangerous than the opioids are if it weren't for overdoses.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.550
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Right, okay.

218

314
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.820

329
00:24:47.550 --> 00:25:01.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: About three months ago I did have blood in my pee. And I think that when I went to see the I went to an urgent care clinic. She said, I had the coagulated blood in my, in my urine, but she thought it was perhaps from the drinking

330
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:18.330
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Maybe something else. She gave me some stuff like a hole in my esophagus. She said it was a possibility from the drinking. So that could have been possibly what it was, as well. But I quit drinking. I don't know if it's gotten better. I don't feel like that now.

331
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.010

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.820
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, that's right. Okay.

336
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:03.240
Dawn Abriel: No helplessness, you're not seeing or hearing things that other people aren't and you'd have no easy bruising.

337
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:04.740
Dawn Abriel: Right.

338
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.990
Dawn Abriel: And you're not taking any medicines over the counter, except the Suboxone

339
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:16.710
Dawn Abriel: Correct. And I can't remember from your, your you taking the generic buprenorphine.

340
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.930
Dawn Abriel: I think that's what I said.

341
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: On your

342
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.910

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sorry.

345
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.720
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it takes about 40 minutes to get through the whole

346
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.270
Dawn Abriel: Thing we're almost done. No.

347
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.750
Dawn Abriel: This is meant for people who has

348
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.460
Dawn Abriel: Dementia, so

349
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:09.090
Dawn Abriel: I just run through it really quick you bathe yourself and go from one place to another and you feed yourself and

Galaxy J3 Orbit: We have

358
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:49.140
Dawn Abriel: A muscle that goes from the jaw line down to your sternum right in front of that muscle, you have to press, but not too hard. If you press too hard. You actually block off the vessel. So it's right in front of that muscle.

359
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh, I feel

360
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.320
