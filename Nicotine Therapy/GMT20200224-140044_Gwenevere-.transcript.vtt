2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.929
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good. Let's just do a sound check. I'm turning my volume up. Can you hear me. Yeah.

3
00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Super. And I can hear you and see you got your coffee. That's your little mug you don't have a big one today.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.200
Christina Haro: No, not the big one.

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, let me get in a little note here. Here, my first client this morning, so I don't have my my record open yet doesn't take long.

6
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So anything significant changes that maybe Need Updating

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.370
Christina Haro: No, no other than when Dr. Allen months and in my prescription. It was wrong.

8
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you let him a virtual clinic or bright heart health. Now,

9
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.840
Christina Haro: Yeah, I did. So hopefully they'll get back to me today said so hopefully

10
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll take a look and see if for any reason. If I see a little note somewhere for you. Okay.

11
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.010
Okay.

12
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Just in case we want to do some bilateral stimulation. Do you happen to have to two containers are

13
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.440
Christina Haro: I've got to hear

14
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.530
Christina Haro: Fantastic. I was ready this morning because I thought maybe we're going to do a

15
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Smart thinking okay I'm get this open first

16
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Such a younger daughter with yeah

17
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.610
Christina Haro: Yeah, she came in early this way.

18
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.360
See

19
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.510
Yeah.

20
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You already swung by virtual clinic I didn't check

21
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.080
Christina Haro: I'm guess I did. I did my survey or you this way.

22
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Or out you're on point, girl.

23
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, we're going to check on medication for someone just look around this show. I don't see everything but sometimes I can see something February 21 13 films.

24
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: 19 milligrams for seven days. Does that sound like what you're trying it looks like two and three, eight film. Does that look like what 19 milligram. Does that sound familiar because you were

25
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sounds like going to 19

26
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.150
Christina Haro: usually get 90 I usually get, um, oh gosh, I'm trying to think here.

27
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You got seven days, seven days eight days.

28
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Four days prior to that. So it looks like seven days is a pretty typical timeframe.

29
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you should have enough quantity and looks like for 30 tablets.

30
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you using any of that.

31
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.790
Christina Haro: No, he sent it in for the first time.

32
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.210
Christina Haro: Oh, I'm gonna use it because, as it is. I've always had a real low blood pressure.

33
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.480
Christina Haro: You have my stuff. I probably won't wake up and work.

34
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, yeah that's that's the warning is that of course it's a blood pressure medicine so

35
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so you're coordinating with them. Yes. Okay. All right. All right. All right, now

36
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.770
Let's go and

37
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.250
See where we left off.

38
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I give you any things to kind of focus on. So we reviewed it may be the box breathing, talk to you, grounding in the five senses.

39
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, now that one a lot of people forget that one.

40
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know part of what you want to do is sort of catch that initial response.

41
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When you start to get angry, um, since the last time we met you have any new observations around that.

42
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:42.720
Christina Haro: Um, well, I've thought about it and I thought about, you know, what object that like to focus on, but I really didn't get into it much. I'm kind of busy. And that's a good day. I haven't really had much time.

43
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so. So not much time. And I think you heard, although I didn't say, Did you practice grounding. The five senses. But let me try a different question.

44
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.820
Christina Haro: Sorry.

45
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so quite a right when you assess yourself. I'm on that sort of hair trigger anger. Right. Yes. How was this week for you.

46
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.020
Christina Haro: This week was really, really mellow. So I need to

47
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.880
Christina Haro: You know, I did practice my breathing, though a little bit, other than the focusing on an object. I didn't

48
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So focusing on an object that's just the

49
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.370
Christina Haro: Ground south. Yeah.

50
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's a visual right you do as many as you can see as many things as you can hear, you want to hit all the senses.

51
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything you can take something and smell and everything. Like if you put your hands on to something. So grounding. The five senses. We don't just want the visual

52
00:05:44.160 --> 00:06:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but the bottom line is, so you didn't notice any significant anger expression. And was there any test. So in other words, if you didn't have a significant event like son staying out late, maybe you weren't tested either

53
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.770
Christina Haro: Know it's pretty mellow last couple of days.

54
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So you haven't had a chance to actually apply them to catch

55
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok ok so those will be useful. There'll be really informing on whether they're starting to be a space between the stimulus which is

56
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Something might happen here or you're impatient or whatever the trigger is and your ability to perceive I have choice. Most people, there's no gap. It's anger and they feel like there's no choice. We want to get. So there is some time and space between stimulus. And your response.

57
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, I'll get there. Okay, so let me just take a little look at some content, um, let me see how far we got in in the anchor room.

58
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked him to hear me. I'm going outside ask mom. Good.

59
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You are able to go out with your friends.

60
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.700
Yeah okay so that one pretty much got it completed.

61
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So another reminder to use a resource is that anchor room.

62
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when you are in distress. Let's say you have a really big decision to make. You can actually bring yourself back into that space visually sort of in your imagination and you can picture the couch and everybody being able to talk and you know if

63
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If the sense the quality of your dad being there is, is what's needed done. That's what you do you picture everything that you need in that room. And don't forget

64
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You actually do have access to magic. You can pull out a magic one. Okay, what do I need

65
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I need courage. I need self acceptance. I need so puff

66
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then see what you bring in, because that's, that's really the recipe in here. Anyways, what do you bring into that room. That's something I really want to know. So I can reinforce it and incorporate into the work we're doing

67
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I brought in my cat. Oh, I brought in. I forgot my best friend from thudded I brought that quality. And that makes sense. And then you start to think, okay,

68
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I at what emotion. Am I feeling I'm angry. Well, okay, usually there's an emotion underneath that, let's see what that anger is doing to protect you. So what's the underbelly feeling. Oh, okay. It's probably fear typically underneath everything even sad is going to be fear.

69
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You can pretty much pick away at nm experience and pick, pick, pick, pick away at it dissect it and probably

70
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to end up being afraid of either a perception. Someone perceiving you one way or the loss of something separation from something a judgment of the self can't tolerate it shames activated or shame is like

71
00:08:48.540 --> 00:09:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid I can't stand my vulnerability. So typically we can wind it down and find that fear. So if you go looking and feel comfortable enough and. NET and groom look for what you might be afraid of losing or afraid might happen.

72
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And then sort of pay attention to your body. See what's getting tight maybe shoulders chest got hands, feet, something jaw and then go, Okay, what do I really need not. How do I escaped this discomfort. But what do I really need

73
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to remember I'm okay. I remember I have enough of the resources to solve this problem.

74
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you stay in fear your brain won't work. Right. You won't come up with an elegant solution. So the key is to go there and figure out what the underlying need, is it you're trying to satisfy something and self medicate some something that's going on. It's probably fear but

75
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so those are the basics. I know I reviewed it very quickly. But that's what that is. That is really available to a lot of people once they fall in love with that realm, they go there, a lot they visit. Then they bring all their quality.

76
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Figures in there with them protective nurturing wise they bring them in the room with them and then they've got the container when they want to use it and then outside the room is adjusting metaphor, you can put them all together, if you want to. Okay.

77
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so why don't we do a little bit of work.

78
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do some of the bilateral stimulation. Let me just review a little bit of some of the things that you said to me, and maybe you'll say, Oh yeah, that's still that's still an issue for me or boy. Yeah, he and maybe you'll notice something in the body today that might signal some distress.

79
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so one of the things that you had noted earlier, was I get upset about Kareena

80
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: She does not do drugs. I tried to do things different from how my mom was I never

81
00:10:49.980 --> 00:11:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: singled out or favored one child over another. She has it in her mind that I was a horrible mom, she would say used to beat me. You are about mom.

82
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: She moved out at age 19 she doesn't like authority and does not like a advice given

83
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I had her arrested twice for hitting and you notice as you were talking about it last time, and you may want to check in with your body. Now,

84
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole body started to shake, and this was that 100 last time. Okay, the heart was pounding the face was red hot. And the thought was, there's nothing I can do. That's the negative cognition and

85
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to be back then. Years ago, right. I'm a bad mom that's moved and changed now it's more closer to there's nothing I can do.

86
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I should be able to help her make her understand what she is going through is not, it's not other people. Right.

87
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And the positive thought that you wanted was I wish I could pick up the phone and call and say I love you.

88
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't seen the new baby or the 10 year old now, since then, and you move to this positive cognition and I am a good person.

89
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Or at least it's one that you had wanted. Now you have since talked with her you're wondering, I remember if if this is just another phase of trying to manipulate in some way, but you're grateful for the contact it. Tell me more about how that's doing right now.

90
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:36.420
Christina Haro: Um, she's actually she hasn't called me, but I guess she called my other daughter, my daughter and she said this, she couldn't remember my number. If I didn't have my number. She wanted to talk to me.

91
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:43.800
Christina Haro: I guess my daughter gave it to her mother daughter gave it to her. I haven't heard from her. I did see pictures of the new baby, though.

92
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.350
Christina Haro: I haven't talked to her.

93
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does it make you feel to think

94
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That you haven't met this this granddaughter, sort of, what kind of emotional experiences that bring up for you.

95
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:05.400
Christina Haro: I get sad because this baby looks just like my daughter. I mean, like the exact copy of her

96
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:14.040
Christina Haro: Was born. Yeah. So yeah, it's sad. It's sad. I'm I get really sad.

97
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But that but aside from right now. It hasn't been coming up a great deal.

98
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.430
Christina Haro: No. No. No, it hasn't. You know,

99
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And how has that that belief about yourself. What's the current sort of belief about who you are and the meaning of you as a mom these days.

100
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.010
Christina Haro: I'm

101
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:48.660
Christina Haro: Feeling a little better by myself I you know I do believe that I can work on myself and make myself feel better. I do believe that

102
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.950
Christina Haro: Yeah, it wasn't the perfect mom. But you know, I know. I wasn't horrible mommy there.

103
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.500
Christina Haro: But I believe that I can you know I can get through that.

104
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me a little bit about how you assess the not perfect. Sometimes, what's happening is if we don't sit with that.

105
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That remember we've talked a lot about shame and it does take trust. Hopefully you've been able to see that people can talk about things and I'm not going to not going to add to it.

106
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's good for some people to have a witness. Other people just to hold it in their mind. You did that before you just held it in your mind and you weren't ready to talk about it and that's fine.

107
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And so maybe if that's all you can get to today, we could hold that in your head, sort of in your imagination. Your awareness.

108
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But see how much you're comfortable talking about. I wasn't perfect. So what constitutes I wasn't perfect

109
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.660
Christina Haro: To me.

110
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:06.810
Christina Haro: I wasn't perfect because I know I made a lot of mistakes, you know, to me, I know the men I chose cause you know a lot of the

111
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:17.130
Christina Haro: Bad stuff happened you know in my life and they know I make mistakes. I know that the tunes that I went through because me being a probably

112
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:25.080
Christina Haro: Some kinds of bad mom, even though they didn't see that because my kids can tell you they never saw me do anything.

113
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:44.100
Christina Haro: Um, but I'm actually i know i you know I'm not a perfect mom because I did like how to tell you I never, I never disciplined them. I can discipline as much as I should have. So I feel like let everything go through and I never gave them the guidance that they should have. Okay.

114
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's probably the biggest one maybe exposing them to maybe negative male figures.

115
00:15:51.240 --> 00:16:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, which may have contributed to addiction. So they had a mother who is inactive addiction and then there's the parenting piece I could have done more discipline and more guidance does that kind of capture the big categories.

116
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:11.850
Christina Haro: Yeah. And then we didn't want to go through that. This is important because I didn't want to become my mom, you know that.

117
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So just

118
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it just because we don't want to do something doesn't mean you automatically know how to do the healthy version, you didn't have it sounds like any modeling of it.

119
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anyone ever discipline you did your dad ever remove privileges or make you write sentences or timeout or take can't, you can't go out this weekend or grounded any of that.

120
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:47.550
Christina Haro: Oh, yeah, yeah. My dad was a good father, but he never was abusive, you know, to that point. Yeah, he did.

121
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.300
Christina Haro: He did us and discipline does. Yeah.

122
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So besides grounding what a discipline look like

123
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:13.440
Christina Haro: A discipline was go to your woman take them now or you're not playing anymore. Get inside or go go pieces because we were basically brought up on a farm. So it makes me go, or any of us, you know, like go feed animals do that.

124
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.480
Christina Haro: Stuff like that.

125
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you remember if it helped shape.

126
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The behavior. He was trying to

127
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Get rid of. So if you were hitting someone yelling at someone breaking a rule. Did that discipline help change your behavior. The way he wanted it to.

128
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.640
Christina Haro: Yeah, it did. It did. Yeah, okay.

129
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm curious.

130
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you had a choice, although you may not have known it that you could have disciplined your children using your dad's modeling.

131
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know any idea how you didn't you decided not to go that direction, you know,

132
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.140
Christina Haro: I have no idea.

133
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.100
Christina Haro: All I ever

134
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:15.780
Christina Haro: Thought you know was, you know, I guess I looked at it like our moms really supposed to be like that, you know, it's just the way it's supposed to be, you know, I it to me was confusing. I was confused.

135
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you mean something like I was confused. Our moms supposed to be like dad's behavior or definitely not moms and so you were confused. How do I, how do I be a mom.

136
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

137
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness. Yeah, that would be confusing.

138
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so isn't that you took on the

139
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I can't tell. I haven't heard any stories around it. Oh, they're they're poor thing you are there to comfort when something bad happened or were you just sort of lecturing yelling when it went bad which kind of did you do

140
00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:04.890
Christina Haro: Yeah, I didn't watch the bathing thing I like, oh, you know, it's okay. You know, you, you know, it's okay. I just let everything go

141
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.580
Christina Haro: There was times though my kids told me that

142
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.860
Christina Haro: That I was a little scary. And I guess I lose my temper once in a while.

143
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.270
Christina Haro: But

144
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.940
Christina Haro: Other than that, I don't know. I wasn't like what Kareena says

145
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no chance that some of that happened while maybe you were intoxicated.

146
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.610
Christina Haro: Know,

147
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.640
Christina Haro: Because all my drinking was when I was out

148
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:45.960
Christina Haro: As if I if I came home drunk. My kids are usually asleep with the sitter. So they never stopped me don't

149
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.100
Christina Haro: Ever. And I didn't do no drinking at home.

150
00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we, you know, when you're not actively drinking. The next day, it doesn't mean that there isn't, irritability, when we don't you know what I'm trying to say if you actually had developed alcohol tolerance and dependence. At one point in your life.

151
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really hard to be patient.

152
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.810
Christina Haro: Yeah, you're right, it could have, you know, it could have been. It could have been, you know, yeah.

153
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't remember that's that's what we're talking about right now there's no there's no memory. Okay.

154
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.440
Okay.

155
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And and so talking about it now. Right.

156
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Get some sort of pay attention to your body and tell me what what you're noticing.

157
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.460
Christina Haro: It kind of makes my

158
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:52.590
Christina Haro: I kind of put a little bit of fluttering in the chest, you know, my heart beating. I think about

159
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.850
Christina Haro: The past and how I wish I could go back and change it.

160
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.050
Christina Haro: It's like a, like an anxious feeling

161
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.880
Christina Haro: Like, I don't want to think about it, you know, that kind of anxiety to where I don't want to think about it. I kind of want to just

162
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.720
Christina Haro: Yeah, I do think about it, I wish to go back and change stuff, which I know I can't

163
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are you thinking about yourself right now.

164
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:23.850
Christina Haro: I'm

165
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:34.080
Christina Haro: I'm thinking now that I'm getting older, I know I'm a better person. I'm a better. I'm a better mom but then I think I'm a bit too little too late.

166
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm, I'm a better mom.

167
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And that part is the positive but at the. Tell me about what when you have that thought it might be too late that one.

168
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the negative thought you have about yourself there. The I got that. Good one. Here the positive one. What's that negative one, it might be too late. What do you believe about yourself there.

169
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.520
Christina Haro: Um, I just believe that I'm

170
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.970
Christina Haro: That the mom, I wish I could have been

171
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:29.940
Christina Haro: is never going to happen. That's a skill. I just feel like, okay, make it so wrong. You know what can they do now is I mean I can't go back to teach anything. I just feel like I'm like, that's it. It's over. I mean, I am what I am.

172
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's play a little bit with this and then maybe we'll go into some work around that, um,

173
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They will forever be your children. They are they happen to be chronologically older. Sometimes children that begin for example to start to use

174
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Marijuana oftentimes that's a drug that has been normalized in their environment and they start to use it. Kids can oftentimes emotionally be stuck at that age of 13 when they started smoking.

175
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally, they're still that age, you're still solving problems of a 15 year old.

176
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had mentioned that Kareena could rename Katrina Karina Karina does not use any mood altering substances, you mentioned, that's still the case.

177
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.240
Yeah, okay.

178
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't necessarily mean that that's the only thing that can stunt that sort of emotional development. There can be other things. There can be

179
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of neglect, there can be an abuse situation there can be a lack of attunement that's actually a bigger one than most people realize when our caregiver make a parent, if that's what it was at the time.

180
00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If children, for example, are not seen like as in I have my own talents. Hey, look at me, look what I've done. I'm interested in this, can you listen. Let me show you. You know attuned

181
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Apparent that's really emotionally available kids can feel unseen and there can be real challenges. This is getting really psychological for a second when it goes into object relations.

182
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some real sort of unhealthy things that can happen.

183
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So although you say there's no way to be that mom that right you don't get a second chance.

184
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I believe that people change. That's why I'm in this field, right. That's why you're in a recovery program that recovery of the authentic self as possible, that being the best version of yourself is possible. I believe in that.

185
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And

186
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you just take one piece with Kareena

187
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When she. What shall we call because I want to use your wording.

188
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: When she is full of it and as manipulating you she's a phony she's pretending to be something and you register it as a con or manipulation. What are we going to call that behavior that she does.

189
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.860
Christina Haro: I call it the little spoiled brat.

190
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.330
Christina Haro: Because

191
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:49.230
Christina Haro: Yoshi. Okay. She has a really good relationship with her father. Okay, she's always been a daddy's

192
00:25:50.430 --> 00:26:02.670
Christina Haro: But Dad was not a good dad. Dad was just when I left him and Kareena was four. And my son was three. Now listen to this one should

193
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the developmental part she was for right

194
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

195
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And when you say bad. What was he just like an make a quick note of that. What she experienced what what do you mean by bound

196
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:27.180
Christina Haro: To remember she told me he used to take her to another girl's house and tell her. Oh, today you call her mommy. That's your mommy today.

197
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:34.770
Christina Haro: So yeah, that's how bad he was and he was a very bad. He was a drug addict. So really bad for that.

198
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.180
Christina Haro: And

199
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:46.770
Christina Haro: I didn't know this was going on until later on when Kareena was like five or six, he started telling me stories. After I left him. So then I realized what was going on.

200
00:26:47.430 --> 00:27:01.620
Christina Haro: This was all going on behind. Well, I'll just tell you for a reason, right. But see, as I got older and she started developing a relationship with him and started, is it. And now, and she uses us against each other stuff.

201
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:16.860
Christina Haro: Like to talk him stories that aren't even true and then she'll come and tell me stuff about him that aren't even to us. He still he calls me and tell me in your 40,000 Kareena is a spoiled brat. He says, I don't know about her. He said, Can't handle her

202
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what if we, the part that you all agree on is inappropriate demands on Kareena as a very young little person. Okay, and

203
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: All of this involved in being a drug dealer. I don't know what all went on in front of her eyes.

204
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

205
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.980
Christina Haro: Yeah, and neither do I. Because there could have been a lot of things. So

206
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if we, what if we say this because remember this is your treatment here but but let's look at it like this.

207
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A little girl at four gets to we start to actually remember right around four and certainly at five, but for we can start to

208
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Start to remember some stuff. But if there's a huge flood right of the adrenaline up the cortisol, it's going to mess with the memory if what she remembers was being abused by Imani

209
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it wasn't you, but it may have happened.

210
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or neglect or or confusion or whatever she had to do. She couldn't blame this mommy. Maybe he had said she's perfect she's wonderful maybe you're the object of who she has enough trust and love that she can blame you.

211
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But for whatever is so complicated, and she's not in here to talk to. But the point is your daughter has something

212
00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Not taking care of something that she's like I'm hurt, whether it was you that the point is that she's hurt. There was something that happened along the way this need to blame you. There's no one else to blame for, you know, however, this composition family dynamics works out.

213
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

214
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say it's too late.

215
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's not

216
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You, I think, have a willingness. I'm not sure. I'll check in on that and you have a daughter. That's wounded, whether it's your fault. Right. Who knows, I mean,

217
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Grief as a parent, there's just do the best we can but whether she's blaming you. It sounds like she is okay, but when you say it's too late. I just wonder if you have an interest.

218
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To help, meaning you can listen without saying no, I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't. That's really different.

219
00:29:52.230 --> 00:30:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, you might be kind of like a therapist, in a sense, not telling not giving advice, but really listening and attuning to what she's talking about. It might be hard because our, you know, our pride gets at stake, like, this isn't me. I didn't do that.

220
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I'm trying to say. Yeah.

221
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We can we can still be this healing space of unconditional acceptance. Some crummy things probably happened. I mean, if you're with a drug dealer.

222
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you may have had a pretty significant amount of denial, going on to, to try and survive. I mean, you have to stick your head in the sand to not see things sometimes right to be with someone like that.

223
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not conscious of it. That's what denial is it's conscious

224
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.360
Christina Haro: And then another thing is that he always beat me. And she always saw it.

225
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.400
Christina Haro: And that she remembered and she's told her father.

226
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:57.960
Christina Haro: And he actually admitted. A LOT OF THINGS FOR HER you admitted, a lot of things to her. He doesn't deny it.

227
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So Christina the psychology of children is. I mean, it's going to be 24 years later 23 years later before her brain develops into a full adult, she was for

228
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, sometimes people

229
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When we witness something our own lives are in jeopardy, we can feel as if our own safety is in jeopardy. We're watching something happen and we interjected so. However, it has see there's Why don't know which it was what it was. It would take quite a lengthy

230
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Assessment to ascertain that. But the point is, she's hurting

231
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you saying it's too late. But it's, it may not be because that little girl inside of her can still benefit from some healing. Yes. I wish she would get some professional help. But

232
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to

233
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's oftentimes a really big important step is just being able to listen and not refute it not argue with it just contain it, that's a lot of what therapists do is they just listen. They don't advise it just sort of go, Whoo. That's hard. You know,

234
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think your pride could handle that.

235
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

236
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:29.310
Christina Haro: Well, you know, if I think get her to talk to me without screaming in my face. I could do it.

237
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you.

238
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:45.120
Christina Haro: But never the tape to like if I could sit out I tied sitting down with her and then she starts to scream because she loses his temper right away and that she felt like

239
00:32:45.600 --> 00:33:00.360
Christina Haro: She wants you to answer back and when you try to answer. She doesn't like your answer. So then she gets mad monster screening. And then if I stayed quiet and not answer to search for me, Martha, she tells me you're not even listening I

240
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever said this.

241
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, sweetheart, that all just sounds so hard.

242
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not advice. It's not denial. That's meeting them with empathy. Oh, baby girl that's just, that's just sounds so hard to live with you see that

243
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's this that's this cradling all and and yes a mom does that number and go back to this. I feel confused. Yes, we do.

244
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And dads to and grandmas and we just go, oh, because again, back to object relations what the outside world. Does the little one absorbs into the self. So when the outside world says, oh, it's going to be okay, honey.

245
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We start to absorb that eventually and we can say to ourselves,

246
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be okay, honey, I can absorb it. That's just the way psychology from little folks when they're tiny tots. That's just how it works.

247
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When our caregiver is not there or violent and when the world is hostile and scary that gets absorbed. She is probably completely psychically very chaotic and disorganized inside. And I'm sorry that happened to her.

248
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you want to see the space where you can do something that is a and it's a big gift. I'm not gonna lie, it's a lot to give to someone, because we have to sit with

249
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The false accusation. But if it means that your daughter for a second gets to feel grounded gets to feel loved actually takes it in

250
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty cool.

251
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I saw you making some notes. Do you have any questions about that kind of phrasing.

252
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.190
Christina Haro: No, no, there's just some, you know,

253
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.750
Christina Haro: If you knew Kareena if she chooses

254
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I yeah I don't. So what you're saying is, it would be right away.

255
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:23.340
Christina Haro: Yeah, she's very manipulative yeah she you know she has a step mom now that is actually teacher okay because my son was over there and you know he really likes her too. So

256
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:34.470
Christina Haro: I'm step mom and and and Tina's father are not married, but the garden kids for Christmas. Right. And this has been around them for like 16 years. Okay.

257
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:43.860
Christina Haro: So I actually talked to her. She calls me once in a while to give me an update on things right. So tell me you know what the baby was born, she was at the hospital with her and she called me and everything.

258
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:53.640
Christina Haro: But she called me. She told me we got engaged. And I said, Oh, congratulations, you know, great, you know, well, um,

259
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:07.680
Christina Haro: She told me that that Kareena told her father. Why, why would even marry a woman like that that you know you should just leave her and me and me and you will get a place to live.

260
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:19.800
Christina Haro: She likes to he wants everything for her. And I think she's jealous because she feels like she's going to loose with that this is trying to manipulate them now and make them fight so they will get married.

261
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all what I call content Christina its meaning if you meet someone there and you want to go into battle and you want to spar with someone about that, about whether she's doing what she's doing this right or wrong, you're going to end up being an argument with her. Yeah.

262
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.320
Christina Haro: So I just like yes she caught but Kareena told me the same thing on the phone.

263
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.820
Christina Haro: I you know I just listened to her. What can I say, you know,

264
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.810
Christina Haro: I know this to manipulate me and she tries. I just

265
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.680
Christina Haro: That just listen. I just want. There's nothing I can do.

266
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

267
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a couple of things you can do. And that's what we're talking about, because you're saying I can't do anything you can

268
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You can contain it emotionally and you're being quiet. I think because I'm on the phone with you. I don't know what I can just listen. I don't know what that actually is in real time. But yes, listening but also saying I imagine that would be really hard.

269
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine that would be really difficult.

270
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:29.160
And if there's ever anything you want from me, let me know.

271
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're putting the ball in her court. The other piece has to do with your boundary settings. Here's what I don't know when she yells, do you stay in the room, or do you walk out and sit there and try and get her to calm down. What do you do

272
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.320
Christina Haro: I've done both I've done both

273
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Ways away. What does she do

274
00:37:53.160 --> 00:38:00.990
Christina Haro: She came after me. If you out there, me and that's if you got it by the hair and hit me because I wouldn't sit there and argue with her. Yeah.

275
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's, she's. It sounds like she's really interjected what she witnessed as a little girl. She's taken that and she's recapitulated in her life. She's just reenacting it. I'm really sorry. Poof.

276
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.330
Christina Haro: She definitely need some professional

277
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:25.920
Christina Haro: So they would tell my mom I told my mom when she asked me about her, including are really close my mom with three, you know, we're really close, and she asked me.

278
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:42.720
Christina Haro: How come I never spanked Corinne. I said, Mom, I've never spanked her, you know, she says what she you need to spank her. She says, because you know she's really a manipulative little girl, you know, and this is talking about communion when she was six or seven eight.

279
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:44.730
Christina Haro: And I'm

280
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:56.610
Christina Haro: As Kareena got older. My mom told me what you're gonna have a problem with her. She says to tell me all the time and I look back at it and I see you know the way she was. And I'm like,

281
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:09.030
Christina Haro: I always thought maybe something happened, maybe something happened when I was in the rounds. I was busy working. Once you spend time with that that was busy taking her other places, which I didn't know if he was taking

282
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:15.300
Christina Haro: Credit telling me, and I always thought about that, you know, something happened there.

283
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be

284
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But the bottom line is you can register something's maladaptive and unhealthy because she's damaging relationships. She's getting in her own way how. However, the origin of it. We may never know.

285
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but the part where you listen and contain that could be a place where you can feel I am doing something instead of, I can't do anything if you aren't listening. That's not a small thing actually

286
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:54.450
Christina Haro: Okay.

287
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually an important one.

288
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And saying, I want to hear everything. But when you yell. I have to get off the phone and I have to leave the room and no

289
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to distance myself that's reasonable. But I want to hear your stories and your hurt. I want to hear about it and show you why care, but the yelling

290
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And and the name calling is really all that's all like here, and then I can't hear the content anymore only hear how you're saying it said, I can't hear what you're saying. So I love you and I want to hear what you're you're going through

291
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Later, you guys are just getting back talking to each other again. But my point is there's ways for you to protect your emotional and physical boundaries which you deserve to protect at all times.

292
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And at the same time. Because isn't that also what was needed, because we do both.

293
00:40:49.860 --> 00:41:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We say they're there. Everything's gonna be okay. Wow, that's so hard. That's all I don't don't don't snack me. There's no snacking with your hands down. Okay. And then you see it's both. It's not one or the other. It's both.

294
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We watch we're modeling also boundaries that didn't get interjected either. So there's a lot you can be doing because in a lot of ways. She may still be or she still sounds like a four year olds me. I'm sorry, but she sounds like she's problem solving problems just like a four year old.

295
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:30.780
Christina Haro: You know, exactly. That's how I see her. I see her as the eye when you talk to. It's like you're talking to a little girl.

296
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and even you spoil like a little spoiled brat. So see how your language, even captures that's that's kind of where she psychologically still stuck. So if you think of it like that.

297
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be kind of talking to her little girl inside, in a way, you see what I'm trying to say.

298
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.440
Christina Haro: Mm hmm. Okay.

299
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

300
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how you doing right now.

301
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:13.230
Christina Haro: Good, good. It feels good to talk about things that don't have anybody to talk to you about stuff like that, you know, and it feels good, you know, to, to listen to somebody them to listen to somebody tell me

302
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:20.640
Christina Haro: What they would do and that's good because you know that's what I need. I don't need to hear somebody else.

303
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well. Alright, um, we can continue to do that, then you you opened up sort of an invitation that sort of taps into, you know, the marriage and family therapy training.

304
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: In my my formal training and and definitely you kind of a little bit of it. Also, with your son. Instead of showing anger, you

305
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Express it through. I feel scared, something bad will happen to you.

306
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And he has to say all mom, don't, don't worry. You say, Can you please be home by midnight.

307
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I can get some sleep.

308
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.140
Christina Haro: Yeah, you know, really good because the last time I told him exactly like that.

309
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You used and I feel statement.

310
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:27.060
Christina Haro: Yes, I told him I told him I feel scared. I tell them when you leave and I talked, and then I feel scared. I said, when you don't call me. And then he said, I'm saying, Mom. I meant to call you on my phone was dead. He says, I'm sorry. I won't do that anymore.

311
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Antagonistic can't stick

312
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.820
Christina Haro: Yeah.

313
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.080
Right.

314
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm always amazed when people actually use that I feel and an emotion word they'll come back, just as you did and know it'll have a positive outcome.

315
00:43:52.830 --> 00:44:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's quick, it's like that argument may have escalated for half hour or however long and it was over quickly because you used, you got to the core emotion. Remember we human beings.

316
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Our emotions are what motivated us

317
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You are motivated to speak your truth to your son because fear registered, whether it was over the top or not, I'll to little whatever every family is different.

318
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are motivated by it. It has real value. We got to pay attention to that stuff sadness recently sadness with with Kareena. It's motivating something to

319
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's the stuff we're doing this morning. If that sadness wasn't there. Maybe you would never take another look.

320
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't minimize the beautiful value of what emotions can be okay they remind us what's important to you, your relationships to your children, your grandchildren is important to you.

321
00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So sadness may come and you say what a, what's the lesson here what's what's coming up. I've been. I've been denying the fact that I care more about Kareena than I've been letting on

322
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that's it right paying attention to it, respectfully, and then going into it would go into the room and say, oh, I'm feeling sad.

323
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I had my daughter there and I was disciplining her and I wish I knew. I wish I had someone that knew what to do as a parent as a mom, I wish I had someone there. I wish, maybe a therapist or a mentor or somebody that could have said, this is what you do.

324
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now at this age. You're because they're adults, you don't have pull phone stay home right sentences.

325
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have those pieces. But what you can do is still the boundary setting part

326
00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you still have some resources, maybe, maybe it'll be money. Maybe it will be staying at your place or it'll be something like that.

327
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I can continue to talk, but keep me abreast of the stories specific ones and then we, you and I can come up with ideas of

328
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Different ways that some people are doing it that have been successful, so that you don't have to get to the point of feeling confused frustrated angry okay because

329
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like you said you were confused at the time. And there you know you're always going to be their parent that doesn't change out of the age. So, and you and with Kareena especially she's probably still like four

330
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.050
Oh, yeah.

331
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I'm excited. I feel like we've got a little, a little

332
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Something here when it. Whoops, I think I just lost my mouse. I use a little throw

333
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Their great

334
00:46:54.870 --> 00:47:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Carpal tunnel. They're so amazing. I'm so glad to hear that. Okay, we didn't get to do any MTR but that isn't really direction today took

335
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how often, let me just check in on on sort of the stinking thinking how much that's come into play over the last week. How many negative thoughts or

336
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Cravings have come in.

337
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:31.110
Christina Haro: I haven't really had it in the last week, to tell you the truth. You know, I've been busy looking for a job and stuff so I've been really occupied to where I bought and then, you know, having to be able to talk to Christina and then I talked to my granddaughter on the phone.

338
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:37.050
Christina Haro: Right in the good feelings and I was like, you know, sounds great.

339
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:43.200
Christina Haro: This last week was fake, to tell you the truth, I thought, okay, you know. Yeah.

340
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.070
So,

341
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Christina, pay attention to that. I felt great. I had connection to my daughter, my granddaughter.

342
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Job. Notice that, and then when those cravings come in the negative thinking. Notice the context of your environment. I'm lonely. I have negative thinking

343
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What have I done. I've got that I maybe I was a bad mom thing I could have done this BETTER. DIFFERENT THAN cravings creep up the the context of our emotional life, our thoughts, our environment. They hugely impact.

344
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:23.730
Christina Haro: Idea.

345
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Will see an intensity of thoughts of using it's just because we're we're social beings we care about these connections.

346
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not to be minimized are important or or when your son had got kept going out right. Oh, I don't want to be scared. Are you scared. Are you scared. Are you scared. What am I going to do I feel helpless. I could use

347
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So meeting those situations because they're going to happen again.

348
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.660
Exactly.

349
00:48:52.920 --> 00:49:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning them in a different way, in a healthy way. Realizing quickly. Oh, I need to do some box breathing. I don't want to do what I used to do all get what I always thought, Okay, I got it. I gotta, I gotta do it differently.

350
00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because those old ways of thinking will pop in your head doesn't mean they're only things. But we've got to get in the way of them really quick, just noticed that as your circumstances became pleasant, there were fewer cravings. That's really a big takeaway today.

351
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um,

352
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the job. I could have sworn there you're going to hear from someone on Sunday.

353
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:36.600
Christina Haro: Well, I did. I went for the interview and I really, really liked him. I like the lady. The only thing is that he did not explain to me.

354
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:48.600
Christina Haro: Where he lives is here close in town. But mom doesn't live in tell mom lives like over the mountain kind of ways. So I didn't take it. It's too far to be clean.

355
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay too far. Okay. But you were hired and so you that confidence should be there. I'm hoping

356
00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.070

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You can move to

369
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And this can change back, by the way.

370
00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really at this point it's an it's a it's a bit in whether your circumstances starches sort of start to unravel. If it starts to get more chaotic.

371
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: More intense maybe conflictual relationships might be happening or somebody you know get sick or something. We can change the appointment scheduled, but at this point I think I could see you every other week which you'd like to do that.
