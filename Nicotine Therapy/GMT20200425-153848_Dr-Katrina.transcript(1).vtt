00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.360
Galaxy S10e: Yeah, he's in his own way.

404
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:49.800

Galaxy S10e: Yeah yeah

408
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.020
Dr Katrina Groves: I was watching like a hawk, because sometimes kids can get kind of go crash that time of their life. As you know, so

409
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.450
Galaxy S10e: We, we keep it. He's got his own little ways of telling you something's wrong.

410
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Good.

411
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.950
Galaxy S10e: We've kind of got our kids figured out, and that way.

412
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.660
Galaxy S10e: You know, in the

413
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:16.770
Galaxy S10e: End, we know

414
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.580
Yeah.

415
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:32.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, well, I will let you go unless there's other questions, they're going to write hearts going to want you to do a drug screen. They're going to mail it to your house. I don't know if they explain that to you.

416
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:42.270
Dr Katrina Groves: They're going to mail it and when you soon as you get this little package at your house, you're gonna have to call them in the virtual clinic, which is where you are today. It's like the front desk.

417
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:52.710
Dr Katrina Groves: And then they'll get somebody on and you'll go pee and you'll look at the results together. It's not a big deal. But it's kind of nice gets mailed to your house and that will happen maybe once a month.

418
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:59.970
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm going to try and see you just once a month here for a little bit and then go longer if we can

419
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:09.090
Dr Katrina Groves: I just want to get you used to the group process and then the scripts. I want to hook them up with our visit. So every visit, you get a script and you don't have to worry about it.

420
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:18.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, if you're, if you have some problem. If you have to miss just always communicate, kind of like with Tony call him up, call it bright heart and say, hey, I can't make it.

421
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.970
Dr Katrina Groves: You can do the day before the week before or, you know,

422
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:35.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Where we. They might just bridge you. I don't know if they'll give you, they won't give you like a whole script for a month. They'll say, Okay, you get three or four days, just like Mike was calling and then you got to

423
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Make up a group. So it's really a hassle. So even if you're sick, you know, try to come in.

424
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.610
Okay.

425
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.590
Galaxy S10e: Okay.

426
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:50.400
Dr Katrina Groves: They might want you to have bloodwork done again, which you can do at the clinic, since you got a primary care doc there.

427
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:58.680
Dr Katrina Groves: But other than that, I'm just so happy to have you here. And how's the insurance. Are you still in partnership. Are you having

428
00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:58.950
To

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.920
Galaxy S10e: I don't know for how much longer, but

430
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:07.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Now that worries me. If you do get insurance most insurances will cover this

431
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:20.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Without a problem. And just like you might have a smaller copay and then Tony still has groups. So if you need to jump on with her. She's doing virtual groups like this. Most mornings.

432
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:21.870
Galaxy S10e: And

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.300

LG K8+(2018): No, I was um it was in between. I think my junior, and my senior year of high school and

456
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.540
LG K8+(2018): I just kind of started hanging out with different people and

457
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.870
LG K8+(2018): And and started using they were using in front of me at first and and I smoke weed, you know,

458
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:19.290
LG K8+(2018): But I mean, other than that I didn't really do hard drugs and then I they started doing them in front of me and then you know you

459
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.130
LG K8+(2018): Hang out in the barbershop. You're going to get your haircut. So

460
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:34.320
LG K8+(2018): I, I started started doing them, you know, kind of lost all my friends and stuff and had all new ones and

461
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.930
LG K8+(2018): It was in but two years, three years later.

462
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.990
LG K8+(2018): I went to my first rehab.

463
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:46.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Money.

464
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.180
LG K8+(2018): Yeah 20 or 21, something like that.

465
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.070
LG K8+(2018): And

466
00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:00.600
LG K8+(2018): Then I stayed clean for maybe off meth for maybe eight years.

467
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:20.820
LG K8+(2018): And and butt off mess. But then I was working at the lumber mills and her and the doctor started describing me a bunch of painkillers. So I was taking those regularly and

468
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.680
LG K8+(2018): Then I

469
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:34.860
LG K8+(2018): My friend gave me a methadone and that's when I started using methadone and I probably use that every day since I was 21

470
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.670
LG K8+(2018): Probably for 10 years

471
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:50.970
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, in, in that that got overwhelming I spending all my money on pills and, you know,

472
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:52.740
LG K8+(2018): I couldn't

473
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.910
LG K8+(2018): I couldn't function without them in work without them.

474
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:05.940
LG K8+(2018): And that got to be too much, then my doctor cut me off and

475
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:19.590
LG K8+(2018): I was tired of, you know, trying to find pills and not having anything and I was missing so much work and all that. So that's when I went to my second rehab and

476
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:34.290
LG K8+(2018): And stayed clean off pills for about maybe a year and then I was right back to taking pills again and

477
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:46.560
LG K8+(2018): Then I then I heard about this box and program surgeons boxing program and I haven't done it yet. Opiates painkillers, nothing like that and

478
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.060
LG K8+(2018): Six years, five years.

479
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.900
LG K8+(2018): Really yeah yeah

480
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.670
Dr Katrina Groves: Cuz yeah I remember that.

482
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.100
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, correct. Yeah.

483
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.850
Dr Katrina Groves: And then, now that you've been back

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.190
Dr Katrina Groves: I was gonna ask. I noticed I don't see that.

487
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.090

494
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.290
LG K8+(2018): It was just time. And then I started eating healthier.

520
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.050
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't think so. It's not supposed to do that. It's like crazy that you were in withdrawals.

521
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.820

525
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.360
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, it's still kind of a trial run, isn't it.

526
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:36.630
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, um, people are using it pretty successfully all over. But we, it was a trial run for us because nobody pays for it on Medicare. Medicare partnership.

527
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.230
Dr Katrina Groves: So, um, let me shift gears for a minute. And do you have any other medication you take like

LG K8+(2018): I try not even take ibuprofen.

531
00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:01.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Good, yeah. Imagine you have some pain stuff, are you still doing construction or what's your job.

532
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:09.240
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, yeah. Still doing construction got two houses going at one time. So I've been super busy.

533
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:21.840
Dr Katrina Groves: But no injuries that landed you in the hospital anything. Nope. Have you had a knee surgeries like your whole life surgeries appendix gallbladder.

534
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.720
LG K8+(2018): I had shoulder surgery from when I got hurt in the mill.

535
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, okay.

536
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.480
LG K8+(2018): It was my coffee or whatever.

537
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Is that better.

538
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:42.750
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, it's a lot better. I needed it in my other shoulder, but I just never followed through that.

539
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:51.540
Dr Katrina Groves: And then it looks like, oh yeah, I see that in 2011. It was about repair. I'm looking at your other computer. If so, that's why.

540
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.380
Oh,

541
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.600

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.010
Yeah.

543
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:04.770
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, that that was kind of coincided with the accident.

Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, yeah. I've always remembered that about you that no matter what's going on. You just take your family and you just go like once a year. It's pretty cool.

581
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah what routine not routine.

582
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.180

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.650

588
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:18.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so I don't want to take you through a quick head to toe thing. This is just symptoms that you might have had in the last week or two, and most of them are going to be no

589
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.330
Dr Katrina Groves: So like any Fevers or chills or night sweats and the last couple weeks.

590
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Know any fatigue, where you're like, so tired. You can't get out of bed in the morning.

591
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.880
Dr Katrina Groves: No weight gain or weight loss. Now that you're off the method probably isn't a problem.

592
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:42.030
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, well, I have a problem, gaining weight sometimes because

593
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.730
LG K8+(2018): I'm just always so busy.

594
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:56.430
LG K8+(2018): And I'm always on the go. So like if if I'm constantly going. I have a fast metabolism. You know, I don't have time to just sit there and snack all days. Oh.

595
00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.800
LG K8+(2018): But other than that, yeah, it's pretty steady

596
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:07.440
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and any trouble with cough or wheezing shortness of breath.

597
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:08.880
LG K8+(2018): No.

598
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.740

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.220
Dr Katrina Groves: And swelling in your legs.

601
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:33.360
Dr Katrina Groves: No any abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, blood in your stool. Nope. You said you didn't really have constipation anymore because you're eating fiber.

602
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.910
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, yeah. And no, yeah, it's been a lot better know that I'm eating healthier.

603
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Than neurological any tremors are seizures or vertigo or headaches.

604
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:53.910
LG K8+(2018): And I've been getting headaches but I think it's just stress related because I've been getting knots in my back and

605
00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.240
LG K8+(2018): Like headaches behind my eye.

606
00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Where are the headaches located

607
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.400
LG K8+(2018): Like right behind my eyeballs.

608
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:12.300
LG K8+(2018): Okay, but I can, I can feel the knots in my back and I can feel it are in my shoulders and then I can feel it up my shoulders into my neck and then we had my

609
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.900
Dr Katrina Groves: And is that when you take your ibuprofen. If you have to

610
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:17.040
Yeah.

611
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Just over the counter or prescription

612
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.230
LG K8+(2018): Over the counter.

613
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:32.220
Dr Katrina Groves: So don't forget stretches. I see that stuff does work and get some bio freeze or whatever you can rub into the neck.

614
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Tylenol works too. And it's not so harsh on your liver.

615
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.360
Dr Katrina Groves: You never got hep C, right.

616
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.910

619
00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:02.190
Dr Katrina Groves: But you can't sleep because you're getting you get up and down. Right.

620
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:08.310
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, I get up at 530 sometimes I don't go to bed, till 11 at night.

621
00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:09.750
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow.

622
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:14.070
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, because my kids are late for now.

Dr Katrina Groves: So you feel like you're rested when you get up. Are you feel like, Oh my God, I just got to sleep.

624
00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:39.030
LG K8+(2018): No, um, because even if I could sleep in. I can't like my body just wants to wake up, you know, and it's not like I feel groggy or tired or anything like that, you know, I get when I sleep. I get good sleep.

625
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:46.560
Dr Katrina Groves: That's what I want it now. So if you ever had suicidal thoughts before recently.

626
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.870
Dr Katrina Groves: No matter how bad it gets you haven't taken that route.

627
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:57.360
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, yeah. And it really hasn't gotten that bad, so

628
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:59.400
LG K8+(2018): You know nothing.

629
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:13.020
Dr Katrina Groves: And your level of stress right now on a zero to 10 scale as far as your life, your work, your anything. Is that like 10 out of 10 is the highest and zero is no stress. Where do you think you're at with that.

630
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.810
LG K8+(2018): Um, I would say.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Because of the coverage and your or because of work or what

634
00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:30.900
LG K8+(2018): Um, yeah, probably mostly work.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.370
LG K8+(2018): I got two houses going so it's like

636
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:39.330
LG K8+(2018): I'm just constantly trying to keep up. It's crazy.

637
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.600
Dr Katrina Groves: And yet on the other party, your brain. It would be

638
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Gee, I'm lucky I have a job right.

639
00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:54.630
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, no, I have to stop and remind myself. There's so many people out of work right now. And yeah, I, I'm very thankful

644
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.810
Dr Katrina Groves: You have to like twist your arm to get you in. Right.

Dr Katrina Groves: We knew it would work. So when's your next script you

648
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.280
LG K8+(2018): Is Wednesday, I think.

649
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:33.660
Dr Katrina Groves: So you must have got it on last just this last Wednesday.

650
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.100

653
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:56.730
Dr Katrina Groves: Monday night at 545 which means you really got to check in at 530 if you're going to even get on and then Thursday mornings at 10 which I don't think is going to work for you. If you're that busy.

654
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:02.280
Dr Katrina Groves: So which one of those sounds like Monday nights better

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.100
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, yeah. That way better.

656
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:17.370

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.730
LG K8+(2018): Um, I've never had a problem with them.

660

Dr Katrina Groves: That night. Okay, put it in your calendar. I want to, I want to see it in your calendar or do you put it on your phone.

665
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:56.430
LG K8+(2018): I put it on my phone, but I'm gonna write it down. Um,

666
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.400
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright.

667
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:01.290
LG K8+(2018): So,

668
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:04.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Forth and try to check in at

669
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:14.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Group until 645 and if you need to do it in your truck that's fine, but just be somewhere private

670
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:25.650
Dr Katrina Groves: You probably are going to need headphones, we don't have it today because it's just you and me. But, you know, any kind of little headphone devices that you plug in and be helpful.

671
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.120
LG K8+(2018): And you said 515 checking

672
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:39.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, probably better do that and it might mean you'd be sitting for a while just waiting for everybody else. But at least you'll get in and you can work in your on your brain, other things.

673
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.510
Dr Katrina Groves: And so then what then we'll do your script.

674
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:51.750
Dr Katrina Groves: After that, we'll do it every month or every two weeks, or however compliance, you're going to be, they might start out with every

675
00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:03.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Couple weeks. Well, just depends. So how do you feel in your recovery as far as stability on that same scale zero is no. Well, how can I do this.

676
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:10.740
Dr Katrina Groves: 10 would be the most stable, you are like absolutely no way you're going to relapse zero was like I could relapse today.

677
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.760
LG K8+(2018): I'm probably eight or nine i mean

678
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:16.140
Console.

679
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.520
LG K8+(2018): Yeah, there's always a slight chance. But I mean,

680
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:31.350
LG K8+(2018): I don't know. I have a good routine. I have a good balance in my life and I don't see any thing coming in between that

681
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:33.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Nice.

682
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:34.260
Yeah.

683
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:41.190
Dr Katrina Groves: And so right here, it will reach out to you to to get a drug screen. They're going to send one to your house. I don't know if that happened already

684
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.870
LG K8+(2018): Know, she talked about it though. Yeah.

685
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:53.010
Dr Katrina Groves: As soon as you get it, you call the virtual clinic and the virtual clinic that number is just like the front desk at the clinic, you know, if

686
00:56:53.610 --> 00:57:09.030
Dr Katrina Groves: If there's 20 people in line. You just gotta wait your turn and but they will help you go through. Don't open it up until the you get somebody online and then they'll walk you through your pee test and they don't have to be in the bathroom with you. So don't panic.

687
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.530
LG K8+(2018): It doesn't bother me. I do it for probation, so

688
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.480
Dr Katrina Groves: There you go, and also at the hospital, they're going to have you do some blood work.

689
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:25.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Just to make sure your liver is okay and your kidneys, especially with all that smoking.

690
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.940
Dr Katrina Groves: But I'm so are chewing. I'm so glad that you quit. That's awesome.

691
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.960
Yeah.

692
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. So any other questions on bright heart or how this works.

693
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.300
LG K8+(2018): Um, so is it group every week or what is it

694
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:53.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Not there is group, but not for you guys. I mean, I'm just my main goal here was to grandfather, all you guys in so that you have somebody to give you scripts, because

695
00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:08.760
Dr Katrina Groves: There's nobody at don't learn. They haven't been able to find a doctor, take my place. So this is just easier but i don't i'm not accepting any new people. I think I have one new person right now and I'm kind of sorry I did because she's kind of all over the map.

696
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:16.320
Dr Katrina Groves: And I have to see her every single week. But you guys are so awesome. Most of you are in recovery long term, you know, this system you worked with Tony

697
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:22.710
Dr Katrina Groves: So no, I think for you groups going to be once a month, and maybe even less as a stretches out

698
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:33.870
Dr Katrina Groves: I just want you to get used to it and I like people that are in recovery and good clean time to be there to talk to other people and it'll all be the people that you know when you used to know from group, right, or did

699
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.010
Dr Katrina Groves: When you did come

700
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:35.940
LG K8+(2018): Yeah.

701
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:42.780
Dr Katrina Groves: Is there anyone that I usually feel like I absolutely do not want to be in group with these people because they're such assholes or

702
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:45.720
LG K8+(2018): No, there's nobody that

703
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:46.890
Okay.

704
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:58.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, that's good. So yeah, I'll see you on me. I'll give you enough prescription to last until May 5 so that way if something weird happens on the fourth you'll have an extra day but

705
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:06.480
Dr Katrina Groves: If you miss group. It's a nightmare. It's just crazy. So, so try to come on the fourth and no matter what.

706
00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.040
LG K8+(2018): Okay.

707
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:16.890
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'll also do a script today, like I said for that you can pick up next week on the 29th.

708
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:25.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Is that the day you just you're telling me the day your script was do and you think it was Wednesday. So I'll just say release. When do

709
00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:30.450
Dr Katrina Groves: And then I'll give you enough until the fourth

710
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:43.410
Dr Katrina Groves: And any problems still I'm in touch with Tony she's she can text me. We can help you deal with stuff, but I'm trying to wean people in away from Tony and onto bright her but she's still a great resource.

711
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.590
LG K8+(2018): Yeah. So what is Tony going to do

712
00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.300
Dr Katrina Groves: She's still doing they're doing groups like this at the clinic. Yeah.

713
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.100
LG K8+(2018): Actually

714
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.940
Dr Katrina Groves: Any other things so quickly, so

715
00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:08.280
Dr Katrina Groves: Does it. This will be easing up in a few weeks, I think. But I mean, eventually we're gonna have to let the virus back in at some point, it's just going to be controlled and slow and manageable then

716
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.330
So, yeah.

717
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.900
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, thanks for taking the time. It's good to see you again. You look array.

718
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:25.140
LG K8+(2018): Thank you, you too, and I use this. That's your number right and your number never change on the zoom

719
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.230
Dr Katrina Groves: It changes all the time.

720
01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.400
LG K8+(2018): Oh,

721
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:42.960
Dr Katrina Groves: I only use that number. I only use that number for intake. So you can't just go directly to zoom you have to go to the virtual clinic. That's like the front desk, it's like you go to the virtual clinic and they'll give you the number. It'll be a toll.

722
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:51.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Free number for Monday and every group sex. That's a common question. Okay.

723
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:56.370
LG K8+(2018): Does that not making sense. No. Does it make sense. Yeah, yeah.

724
01:00:58.650 --> 01:00:59.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

725
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.290
Dr Katrina Groves: I'll just call that virtual clinic number and they will

726
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Put you in with me.

727
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.050

731
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.730
LG K8+(2018): Thank you later. Bye.

732
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:21.930
Bye.

733
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I'm waiting for my third one right now, so hang on.

734
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:47.700
Dr Katrina Groves: He had to dependence. That's intermission. That was, like, major serious severe to tobacco to dependence, but it's in remission. So that's a good diagnosis.

735
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:51.630
Dr Katrina Groves: No other diagnoses on him.

736
01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Let me go back a bit to

737
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Joey outgrows

738
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:11.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Addition to my usual HTTP on his scan. There's a old tattoo no signs of track marks.

739
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:24.780
Dr Katrina Groves: And that he has nicotine dependence that's in remission. That was severe, but it's in remission.

740
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:40.710
Dr Katrina Groves: His diagnosis, of course, has the opioid dependence severe in remission and he has no other depression, anxiety or other problems. So I think I'm good with him.

741
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:46.770
Dr Katrina Groves: He does not need a prescription until May 11 so that's

742
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Group.

743
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.000
Dr Katrina Groves: So I think I'm done with showing

744
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.900
Dr Katrina Groves: On Josh various

745
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.770
Dr Katrina Groves: He is such as F 11.21 opioid dependence severe in remission. He's also

746
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:25.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Tobacco or nicotine dependence and chewing tobacco, but again in remission or so that's, that's good. In early remission, I would say.

747
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.200
Dr Katrina Groves: low risk no suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

748
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.520
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm going to refill one week's worth of prescription to get him to the fifth of May.

749
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:50.550
Dr Katrina Groves: His prescription is due on the 29th and will release that until the fifth. But then he supposed to do group on May 4

750
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:53.250
Dr Katrina Groves: He was a bit distracted.

751
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.970
Dr Katrina Groves: In the car I noticed he had his pencil out he was working on as construction thoughts but

752
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Otherwise, it was good.

753
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:09.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Any other option notice on him. Now I think everything else was good. My usual

754
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.240

769
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:04.350
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you on a phone or tablet.

770
01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.940
LG K8s: I'm on my phone.

771
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.130
On your phone.

772
01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:13.050
LG K8s: Up there I am.

773
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.960
LG K8s: Yeah. Can you see me now.

774
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:21.030
Dr Katrina Groves: You're out in the woods somewhere where yet.

775
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:24.810
LG K8s: I'm behind my store. So I'm actually working.

776
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:26.340
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, you're working

777
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.260
LG K8s: Now we're just putting oil crab gear.

778
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Yep. How's the crab season going

779
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:36.960
LG K8s: Uh, not too good for us, it was, it was slow

780
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:38.610
LG K8s: And

781
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:41.580
LG K8s: Yeah, it wasn't great.

782
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Sorry to hear that.

783
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.130
Yeah.

784
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:49.920
Dr Katrina Groves: So you have about a half hour for me just to do this out of the way.

785
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.870
Dr Katrina Groves: Yep. Alright.

786
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.450
Dr Katrina Groves: So this is sort of like pretending that we never met before and I don't know your history so

787
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:04.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you have on your phones are so that it's more private or are you good how you are

788
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.760
LG K8s: I'm pretty good. There's mom away from everyone.

789
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:24.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so start from the beginning. Like, I don't know, age five. Did you use a marijuana cigarette. I mean, start as soon as you remember when your substance use, was it out because they're part of a when you got into stuff and go from there.

790
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:31.470
LG K8s: Was probably around eight, when I first tried to cigarette and then

791
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.950
LG K8s: Around same time with weed.

792
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.820
LG K8s: Smoking was young.

793
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:46.140
LG K8s: I don't. It's hard to explain. I guess it's been a long time.

794
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.640
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're kind of going in and out there what, when did you start taking on narcotics or the pills.

795
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.080
LG K8s: By

796
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.970
LG K8s: 13

797
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:10.290
LG K8s: When I started taking that just because they're around all the time, and it was mainly my bike. Again, it's almost

798
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.830
LG K8s: And then I did that for years.

799
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:17.610
LG K8s: For a long time, like, I can't remember.

800
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.890
LG K8s: Exactly when I was 14 all the way up to

801
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.790
LG K8s: 3329

802
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:34.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, you get them off the street and for your dad are getting prescriptions for yourself.

803
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.370
LG K8s: Still them from my parents and

804
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.100
LG K8s: However, I could get them.

805
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.980
LG K8s: But that's when I was in my attic. Now it's totally different. I don't do that stuff anymore.

806
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:54.120
LG K8s: I know, life has changed quite a bit. So yeah, I'd get him on the street. So, and however I

807
01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Started it ever lead to IV drugs like heroin or anything else.

808
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:05.460
LG K8s: A lead to mass, never, never, never liked noodles.

809
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:14.700
LG K8s: Kind of lead do that because I got into Narcos and then that led to math or

810
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:26.340
LG K8s: Biking in that first and then that led to a Narcos I do methadone and that was my drug of choice not to go and they're really expensive.

811
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:34.920
LG K8s: So I couldn't afford them one day and I found out that math was like a lot cheaper.

812
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.040
LG K8s: And it lasts a lot longer.

813
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.040
LG K8s: So it kind of got me into that. And I did that for probably

814
01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.730
LG K8s: Eight to 10 years, eight years.

815
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.310
LG K8s: Wow, but I probably not even that probably more like sticks, but

816
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.110
LG K8s: The thing about that was I did not like it, but I kept doing it.

817
01:14:59.730 --> 01:15:01.140
LG K8s: It was just, I had an

818
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.670
LG K8s: addictive personality, I guess, I guess, get addicted to tough real easy.

819
01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.710
LG K8s: That letting go. I

820
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:19.800
LG K8s: Just kind of destroyed my life. I kind of

821
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.880
LG K8s: lost a lot of my burns and started to lose my family, my God.

822
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:28.440
LG K8s: You're

823
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.000
LG K8s: Good. No.

824
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:42.390
Dr Katrina Groves: So you joined the Suboxone program. I'm trying to remember. I think it was November 2014 if I have it right

825
01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:47.820
LG K8s: Quite a while ago. I think I've been there for five years now. Yeah.

826
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:51.360
Dr Katrina Groves: It's been over five, five and a half. Yeah.

827
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you have any trouble during that time with overdose.

828
01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:01.980
Dr Katrina Groves: End up in the hospital, the problems with God.

829
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.340
LG K8s: Never, never went to the hospital for now.

830
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:12.570
LG K8s: I felt like times were have a real good way to iron out of my mind, but

831
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:15.960
LG K8s: I thought showed us what a doctor. But again,

832
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.170
Dr Katrina Groves: And any other substances like volume's bentos alcohol.

Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And did you ever have any

838
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.630
Dr Katrina Groves: legal trouble from that probation or anything at all.

839
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.010
LG K8s: No.

840
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.220
LG K8s: To myself.

841
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

842
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.970
Dr Katrina Groves: So right now, how's the Suboxone working for you.

843
01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:04.230
LG K8s: works good for me now. Yeah.

844
01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:10.710
Dr Katrina Groves: And I you're taking too long to have the eight milligram strips. Now, is that right

845
01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:11.850
Yeah.

846
01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:15.030
Dr Katrina Groves: That's good. I'm glad you got down a little bit.

847
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.230
Yeah.

848
01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:18.990
Dr Katrina Groves: And

849
01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:28.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Quitting a wanting to get clean because your dad was not gonna let you go into the business within

850
01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.350
LG K8s: That was a part of it. But that's not quite the whole thing I really wanted to

851
01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:42.570
LG K8s: In the first place, with the math. I really wanted to get away from the math because I was just like, historian me basically

852
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:49.350
LG K8s: Yeah. And I was actually at the point or I didn't care if I lived or died. Wow. And

853
01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:53.400
Dr Katrina Groves: We have idle during that time to give a try to take your online.

854
01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.200
LG K8s: Oh, I never

855
01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:03.390
LG K8s: Was trying to figure out the day when I got arrested. I was trying to figure out a way to quit. But I knew I couldn't quit by myself.

856
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.240
LG K8s: Caught me pretty good.

857
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.350
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, maybe the jail system. I've been arrested.

858
01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.040
LG K8s: Yeah, yeah, I was actually a

859
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:22.830
LG K8s: Satan my car. Listen. Music crying because it's bad relationship thing and just I hated myself. I hated without

860
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:34.050
LG K8s: It no more, but I wasn't thinking about killing myself trying to figure out a way to quit and then just happen got arrested and that was it.

861
01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:42.510
LG K8s: And apart big part of it too is like like you to my dad wasn't he's gonna sell the boat and get rid of everything.

862
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.610
LG K8s: And

863
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:47.820
LG K8s: That was another

864
01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:50.910
LG K8s: Reason good reason to quit.

865
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.700
LG K8s: And now he proudly and actually thinking about buying a bigger boat.

866
01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:58.650
LG K8s: So,

867
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:00.870
LG K8s: Beggar nicer boat.

868
01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:02.940
Dr Katrina Groves: Excellent.

869
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:12.750
Dr Katrina Groves: So do you have any mold problems now like the prep now that you're clean and sober for over five years. Do you still have issues with anxiety, depression or

870
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.090
Dr Katrina Groves: Sleep changes.

871
01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:20.010
LG K8s: Not lately. No, I've been actually doing.

872
01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:21.540
Good.

873
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.440
LG K8s: I do get anxiety, but it's not like it's like anxiety from going on here.

874
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:33.990
LG K8s: Like that. Dr. Anxiety, like I get nervous when it comes to meetings are going

875
01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:35.850
LG K8s: To the doctor.

876
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:45.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Sure. I mean, this is nice that you're surrounded by your own house. You don't have to be in the doctor's office. So I'm hoping that you'll be less anxious for you.

877
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.420
LG K8s: I'm actually more comfortable her than

878
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.360
LG K8s: Sitting in the doctor's office.

879
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.800
LG K8s: Yeah, don't around its kind of don't really want to be there anyways.

880
01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:06.450
Dr Katrina Groves: Right actually Tony have groups like this to now. I don't know if you knew that, but she doesn't every morning or a couple mornings a week. And if you ever needed to get on with her. That would be cool.

881
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:08.130
LG K8s: Yeah.

882
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:17.820
Dr Katrina Groves: So speaking of that on your soapbox and when do you need to refill it looks like it's coming up here pretty quick. You have your box you

883
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:19.860
LG K8s: Know, I don't

884
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.630
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you know when it's do, isn't it usually like the first of the month or

885
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.370
LG K8s: Maybe it's coming really soon. Yeah.

886
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.380
LG K8s: Okay, carrying a few days.

887
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so I'm going to start prescribing from bright heart here.

888
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.360
Dr Katrina Groves: What pharmacy. Are you using

889
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:37.920
LG K8s: A Walgreens.

890
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Walgreens, and

891
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.300
Dr Katrina Groves: It's gonna be hard. I know once you start fishing.

892
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.810
Dr Katrina Groves: It might be difficult for you to make a group

893
01:20:56.130 --> 01:21:01.380
LG K8s: Well, right now, so it's all this stuff's going on. I'm kind of having more time on my hands.

894
01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:02.550
OK.

895
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.900
Dr Katrina Groves: So the options. This next week. Well,

896
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:11.850
Dr Katrina Groves: My Monday and Thursday are like really booked but

897
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:22.980
Dr Katrina Groves: So I could go ahead and just do your prescription and put you a month out for a visit. But I don't want to make it too.

898
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:33.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Which is better for you. Monday nights like at 5:45pm or Thursday mornings at 10am as a rule, or do you just need to play it week by week

899
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.240
LG K8s: I never know what I'm going to be doing.

900
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.790
LG K8s: Or week by week but

901
01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.050
LG K8s: I don't know what

902
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:54.240
LG K8s: My schedule is kind of hard. Go do it like I wasn't supposed to work today, but I'm here at storage so

903
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:59.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, so why don't we make it um

904
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:07.380
Dr Katrina Groves: How about Thursday, the seventh of May at 10 o'clock. I mean, I don't know. It's like you said, if that's

905
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:19.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Just make sure you know that I have two groups or Monday nights at 545 and Tuesday Thursdays at 10 and I was like one of them sometime this month.

906
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.840
LG K8s: Okay, Thursday night.

907
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:27.990
Dr Katrina Groves: No Thursday morning at 10 or Monday nights at 545

908
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:32.580
LG K8s: Thursday at 10

909
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.620
LG K8s: In the morning

910
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, like right about now.

911
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.530
LG K8s: I'm good. And then was other one

912
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:43.650
Dr Katrina Groves: Monday nights at 5:45pm

913
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:55.470
Dr Katrina Groves: And I'll put you down for Thursday, the seventh of may just tentatively right now.

914
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:58.440
LG K8s: Thursday.

915
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:07.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, tentatively if that works. You could also come Monday, the fourth if that works better in the evening.

916
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:18.120
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't really care. I just want to get you. It won't be this week, but it'll be the next week after

917
01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.430
LG K8s: Okay, well,

918
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:25.140
LG K8s: I'll try to get at least one of those this month. Yeah.

919
01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.930
LG K8s: Thursday 10 in the morning Monday at 545

920
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:42.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. And the trick with right heart is there's so many people doing video. Now it takes a long time. There's maybe 150 people all over the world that check in at one time.

921
01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:55.410
Dr Katrina Groves: So it's good if you try to get on a half hour early and then just keep doing what you're doing, do some work, whatever. Just you'll be sitting in the waiting room, basically. And then I'll let people in

922
01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:06.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Also there's a different group number every time. So you go to the virtual clinic. It's called. It's like the front desk. The phone number you call today.

923
01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.910
LG K8s: Yeah, I'm talk to one lady.

924
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:12.210
Dr Katrina Groves: It'll be a lady every time. Yeah.

925
01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:18.270
Dr Katrina Groves: And then, and then they'll put you in whatever group room. I am so it's never the same number twice.

926
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:29.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so I'll just go ahead and give you a prescription at Walgreens or a month and then hopefully you'll get in sometime

927
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.440
Dr Katrina Groves: This next week.

928
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.140
LG K8s: Okay.

929
01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:40.800
Dr Katrina Groves: You like it if you really let us know if you're not able to make the visit to that helps

930
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:46.530
LG K8s: Okay, like guys to call and cancel it. If I'm too busy.

931
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.650
LG K8s: Yeah, and do I call the First Lady.

932
01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:58.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Just I think always call that virtual clinic. I don't know. I don't really know the whole process, but always calling that like you said that first lady.

933
01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.050
LG K8s: Okay, I don't know her name so

934
01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:08.790
Dr Katrina Groves: So let me just ask you a few other questions. And do you have any allergies at all that, you know, I have to medication.

935
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.820
LG K8s: Not to medication now.

936
01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:12.420
Oh, yeah.

937
01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:14.790
LG K8s: bee stings. Yeah.

938
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you have an epi pen or anything on hand.

939
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:20.040
LG K8s: I never got epi pen yet.

940
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:21.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you want one.

941

LG K8s: You know i'm not i'm not sure about you.

945
01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.670
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, I'm doing Suboxone so I'm not your primary care doctor, though.

946
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.720
LG K8s: Okay.

947
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:55.440
Dr Katrina Groves: Cuz I don't even. I'm only a contractor for the clinic I don't work for them anymore. So you need to get yourself. It's hard right now. But if you have any medical problems, you're still

948
01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:58.830
Dr Katrina Groves: The clinic is still your medical home.

LG K8s: Every once in a great while I'm I twitch my eyelid.

1030
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh yeah, that happens sometimes it's just like

1031
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:27.390
spasms.

1032
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:42.840
Dr Katrina Groves: But it happens to everybody, so mentally. It sounds like you don't have any mood swings know depression or anxiety. No suicidal thoughts, no sleep problems, except once in a while.

1033
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:45.390
LG K8s: I noticed

1034
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:51.540
LG K8s: If I do not, if I don't take Suboxone I don't

1035
01:31:53.010 --> 01:31:56.310
LG K8s: I do have sleep problems like when I'm detox. I'm not that

1036
01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.210
LG K8s: Kind of talks. Awesome. If you don't take him.

1037
01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, that's true.

1038
01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:09.720
LG K8s: If I forget it or not. I do.

1039
01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.900
LG K8s: But when i'm suppose what I'm supposed to do.

1040
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:28.860
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and you know there is that long acting one sub blockade, it's a shot and people at the clinic have been trying it so

1041
01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:41.070
Dr Katrina Groves: It lasts for 3045 days and it won't. It's not like every day. You got to take your scripts or you're going to go like that, it's stable. So think about

1042
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:42.480
LG K8s: If that's an option for

1043
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.150
LG K8s: You yeah I'm getting thumbs meals. That's right on.

1044
01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:49.800
LG K8s: Yeah.

1045
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:56.760
Dr Katrina Groves: So we're pretty much about done. The only things I wanted to remind you is

1046
01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:03.930
Dr Katrina Groves: That the bright heart is going to call you just to do some psychological testing.

1047
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:08.730
Dr Katrina Groves: So just be prepared. There's a lot of questions. Thank you.

1048
01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.940
Dr Katrina Groves: So just do that as quick as you can.

1049
01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:14.100
LG K8s: Like

1050
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:20.040
LG K8s: Is either call me like just randomly, or do I have to make a meeting for

1051
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:27.300
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't know. I think it's probably an appointment, you'll probably get with your therapist, they have to do something called the bio psychosocial profile.

1052
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:39.120
Dr Katrina Groves: And, you know, let them know you're a fisherman and you have the regular hours, but they'll at the beginning with Brighton heart. There's a lot of paperwork to go through. So try to be patient with that.

1053
01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:44.100
Dr Katrina Groves: They will send you a peek up in the mail and

1054
01:33:45.150 --> 01:33:50.760
Dr Katrina Groves: They're going to want you to call when you receive your peak cup and they'll explain how to go through that.

1055
01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:04.290
Dr Katrina Groves: They'll do before every visit, they'll do a little check in with you that takes a few minutes, so just make sure that you come to every group like 30 minutes early. If you can, that's

1056
01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:04.920
LG K8s: Important you

1057
01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:06.270
LG K8s: Know,

1058
01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:11.010
Dr Katrina Groves: And if you miss a group, like I said, if you call ahead. That's great.

1059
01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:19.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Try not to miss them because I want to try to get your prescription hooked up with your visit day, but I know your job is kind of crazy.

1060
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:20.460
LG K8s: Okay.

1061
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:21.750
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'll just

1062
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.030
LG K8s: This one on one groups are actually multiple people with us.

1063
01:34:27.630 --> 01:34:36.480
Dr Katrina Groves: there'll be people that you know from group like Casey, AND I DON'T KNOW. Josh Tiffany people that you know from the clinic.

1064
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:40.500
LG K8s: Yeah, so I'll see all their faces in the bottom of the screen.

1065
01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:42.510
LG K8s: Yeah, okay.

1066
01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:58.620
Dr Katrina Groves: So I would have you come this next week, but I'm too crazy books. So I'll see you on the what we decided, either the fourth at night or the seventh in the morning, and I'll give you a choice of which one to go to

1067
01:34:59.340 --> 01:34:59.520
Dr Katrina Groves: But

1068
01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.630
Dr Katrina Groves: I will prescribe the month at Walgreens for you.

1069
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:08.910
Dr Katrina Groves: And the EPI pen as well.

1070
01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:17.490
Dr Katrina Groves: And then you get in with your doctor dodi for the chart stuff they're doing virtual clinics. But I don't know how much you can do in the

1071
01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:18.780

All right.

1075
01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Any other questions for me, Rudy before I let you go.

1076
01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Alrighty.

Dr Katrina Groves: We're gonna have to kind of pretend that I haven't seen you before. And I don't know your stuff and and start at the beginning. Like brings bad memories. I know, but starting

1118
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:43.470
Dr Katrina Groves: however old you were, whether it was marijuana when you were six or alcohol when you were five or just start from the beginning about your substance abuse and just tell me how it what happened in

1119
01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:46.710
Dr Katrina Groves: Your history.

1120
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:47.700
Okay.

1121
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.480
Jennifer Snider: Um, well.

1122
01:38:52.650 --> 01:39:04.320
Jennifer Snider: I was around six, six or seven when I first smoked weed my uncle. I was living up my Grandpa's house and my uncle was

1123
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.140
Jennifer Snider: Around 14 or 15 and we went out back and

1124
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:13.650
Jennifer Snider: We got stoned. Well, he got me stoned.

1125
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:15.150
Jennifer Snider: And

1126
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.480
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, so that was my first time with marijuana

1127
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:26.910
Jennifer Snider: And then I smoked. My first cigarette. When I was nine and

1128
01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:34.380
Jennifer Snider: And then didn't start actually smoking cigarettes until I was 14 then I started smoking as like an actual habit.

1129
01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:37.560
Jennifer Snider: But, and then

1130
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:48.030
Jennifer Snider: When I first drink, and then I sort of went a little crazy and was wanting to drink all the time, any chance I could get and then

1131
01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:59.610
Jennifer Snider: First time I did math. I was. It was after my mom died. So I was 15 or 16

1132
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.350
Jennifer Snider: Was the first time I smoked mess.

1133
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:06.540
Jennifer Snider: And then

1134
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.580
Jennifer Snider: 18 is when I started doing math all the time.

1135
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.390
Jennifer Snider: And then

1136
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:20.100
Jennifer Snider: 19 is when I started doing heroin all the time.

1137
01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:23.520
Jennifer Snider: And then, yeah.

1138
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:28.320
Jennifer Snider: 20 I tried to get sober because I thought I was pregnant.

1139
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:36.660
Jennifer Snider: But then I completed the program. It was the is when I met Tony and

1140
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:41.190
Jennifer Snider: I did that for Trillium okay

1141
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.600
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, the JRC

1142
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.180
Jennifer Snider: So I did that successfully and then I went to a sober living house and

1143
01:40:49.470 --> 01:41:00.300
Jennifer Snider: But then my boyfriend from Oregon, who had gotten into heroin with moved down to try get sober to yeah I didn't work out. We ended up using and then Oregon so

1144
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:02.100
Jennifer Snider: And then

1145
01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:16.080
Jennifer Snider: After he went to prison. I came back home and got sober for over a year I was sober, but I was drinking all the time. So then I ended up going back to math and then heroin and

1146
01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.660
Jennifer Snider: Then this is my

1147
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:22.290
Jennifer Snider: Last time trying to get sober AND I'VE BEEN SOBER SINCE

1148

1156
01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.990
Jennifer Snider: Because no no I have, I could probably

1157
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.960

1158
01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:55.500

Jennifer Snider: Okay.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:03.750
Dr Katrina Groves: And let's see here. Have you been in hospital for any other reason like I don't know surgeries appendix gallbladder.

1263
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:15.090
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, I've had my appendix taken out when I was younger and right before I came into the program. I had to have emergency surgery because I had an ectopic pregnancy.

1264
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:22.200
Jennifer Snider: Oh, that's right. Oh, yeah. And then I've been in the hospital probably like three times.

1265
01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:39.450
Jennifer Snider: Well, more than that with abscesses, for some reason, and which is weird because. Okay, so my first year in the program on my birthday. I was in the hospital was an abscess. The next year, my two year it was the 26th of May, a couple days before my birthday. I was in there with another one.

1266
01:49:39.810 --> 01:49:40.920
Dr Katrina Groves: What the heck are you talking

1267
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.600

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.140

01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:54.150
Jennifer Snider: Not Murcia, no.

1272
01:49:54.570 --> 01:50:05.370
Jennifer Snider: Okay, yeah, but um I first started getting those when I got three. The first time I got an abscess. I got three on my arm Malaysia and then my

1273
01:50:06.630 --> 01:50:12.180
Jennifer Snider: On the other side of my league when I was living in Salem. I thought it was for my drug use.

1274
01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:14.040
Jennifer Snider: But, but

1275
01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:18.900
Jennifer Snider: My grandma says that she's to get him on her side, so

1276
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:24.930
Jennifer Snider: I think in the doctor said some people just more prone to get them so

1277
01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:28.800
Dr Katrina Groves: You haven't had one this year on your birthday, happy.

1278
01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:29.910
Jennifer Snider: Not this year. Nope.

1279
01:50:30.810 --> 01:50:33.150
Jennifer Snider: But I still got a month ago. Yeah, yeah.

1280
01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.090
Dr Katrina Groves: Like a lot of vitamins and Akhenaten, whatever.

1281
01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:44.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Okay, so, um, let's see, what are you using for birth control.

1282
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:47.850
Jennifer Snider: I am on the implant in my arm.

1283
01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.530
Dr Katrina Groves: And how long has it been there.

1284
01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:51.930
Jennifer Snider: I'm

1285
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:57.120
Jennifer Snider: Probably since November, December.

1286
01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.290
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, here we go. So, December 2019

1287
01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:01.920
Jennifer Snider: Yes.

1288
01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:03.570
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're good for three years.

1289
01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, good. And are you are you having a boyfriend. Now tell me your, your

1290
01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.610
Dr Katrina Groves: Is that the same guy from the hotel or

1291
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:16.560
Jennifer Snider: Yeah. Same guy, but I'm actually sort of thinking we're not right for each other.

1292
01:51:16.890 --> 01:51:17.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh really,

1293
01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:19.470
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, um,

1294
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:21.420
Jennifer Snider: Yeah.

1295
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:25.290
Jennifer Snider: Like in my life. I want to

1296
01:51:27.210 --> 01:51:39.180
Jennifer Snider: I want to achieve things. And I want to have a family and just thinking long term. I don't think I would be comfortable having kids with him because he blows all of his money on the casino.

1297
01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:47.040
Jennifer Snider: And then goes and borrows money from all these people, then he has to pay those people back. So then he has no money, but then he's wasted all you know and

1298
01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow, sounds like he has a gambling addiction.

1299
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:51.180
Jennifer Snider: Does really bad.

1300
01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.850
Jennifer Snider: He says that he says it was worse than his mess habit.

1301
01:51:58.050 --> 01:52:02.880
Dr Katrina Groves: And you know is right switching addictions his brain is looking for that happy hi somewhere.

1302
01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.590
Jennifer Snider: Yep, got it.

1303
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:07.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Find it channel, it does something like golf or

1304
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:20.700
Jennifer Snider: I know he he has cool hobbies, like, you like to read would and he he will shave it down and lacquer it and he has me skin boards, all the time, which is really cool. But yeah.

1305
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:22.860
So, I mean, there's

1306
01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:27.990
Jennifer Snider: There's lots of good things about them, but I just

1307
01:52:29.250 --> 01:52:32.700
Jennifer Snider: Where I think we're just two different he gets like angry really easy and

1308
01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:36.720
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, I feel like always apologizing for something which is not okay so

1309
01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:41.130
Dr Katrina Groves: No. So there could be some domestic violence in his future

1310
01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:45.720
Jennifer Snider: That's what john said because I brought it up in group, the other day, and

1311
01:52:46.380 --> 01:53:00.450
Jennifer Snider: In like which and I didn't want to say this because it sounds so domestic violence and but I don't think he would, because he grew up with it and he always says how he so against it. But then again, who knows anything could happen, you know. Yeah.

1312
01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:15.450
Dr Katrina Groves: People that grew up with domestic violence in their tissues, it's in. It's in there, you know, and they can't help it, even though they say, I'll never do it on never do it. It sometimes a switch just lips, and it turns that on and they have no control. So

1313
01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:23.220
Dr Katrina Groves: I think that sounds. Why is knowing your history to maybe back off and look for someone else.

1314
01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:24.750
Jennifer Snider: Yeah yeah

1315
01:53:26.250 --> 01:53:32.190
Dr Katrina Groves: So any kids that you have at all. I mean pregnant miscarriages abortions.

1316
01:53:32.730 --> 01:53:37.440
Jennifer Snider: Ahead. I'm pretty sure I had a miscarriage. When I was 20 and went into the program.

1317
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:47.370
Jennifer Snider: Because I had missed my period. And that's why I went. That's why I came back to California to get the rehab and my, my first week in the program.

1318
01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:58.620
Jennifer Snider: I woke up at like 4AM with really bad pains in my stomach. And so it was like four four o'clock, and we had to get up at six anyways. And so I went into the shower and

1319
01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:00.690
Jennifer Snider: Hold on.

Okay.

1430
02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:42.300

Jennifer Snider: No. Oh, they told me to that I have to do the beacon. I have to call beacon and get the number for you.

1470
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:16.710
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, okay.

1471
02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:17.940
Jennifer Snider: What's that mean

1472
02:04:19.170 --> 02:04:26.730
Dr Katrina Groves: So they might want to do. I don't understand what that means. They might is that are they trying to do a bio psychosocial profile on you.

1473
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.170
Jennifer Snider: Know they want to

1474
02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:36.810
Jennifer Snider: For they need to do a mental health assessment and then they have to give me like a registration number that they said, I give you

1475
02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:41.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, well, you won't give me you'll give it to one of the girls at the front.

1476
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.650
Jennifer Snider: Okay, yeah.

1477
02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:49.920
Dr Katrina Groves: If you have any questions on that just call them back because people at the virtual clinic are really helpful. So

1478
02:04:50.520 --> 02:05:02.940
Dr Katrina Groves: That the main bright heart number just say hey, but that would be great if you got all this paperwork, they have a ton of stuff. They have to put in the computer and they follow it. So if you can just get on that not procrastinate.

1479
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:04.800
Jennifer Snider: Yeah, I know.

1480
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:07.290

Dr Katrina Groves: sooner you do that, then the better I can take care of what I need to take care of and get that all out of the way.

1483
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:27.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, but every time that you do a group, they're going to ask you, like, seven questions and it's every single group and it only takes about five minutes, but just be aware that, you know, you're gonna have some kind of little check in every time.

1484
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:27.900
Jennifer Snider: Okay.

1514
02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.100
Julie Vanderpool: Yes, they came with the phone. So it's rather handy.

1515
02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:56.790
Great.

1516
02:07:58.170 --> 02:08:04.590
Dr Katrina Groves: So yeah, this was just like an intake for bright heart. I'm so excited. You're going to be with us, and I'm not gonna you

1517
02:08:05.190 --> 02:08:05.490
Julie Vanderpool: Know,

1518
02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:07.050
Julie Vanderpool: No you're not.

1519
02:08:07.290 --> 02:08:17.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. So this is kind of like an intake, which I know you've had a lot of people work already with Breitbart, but this is just to go over a few things that I need medically

1520
02:08:18.450 --> 02:08:24.090
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And the first thing is might take about a half hour. I'm running a little bit over

1521
02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.500
Julie Vanderpool: That's okay.

1522
02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:33.420
Dr Katrina Groves: So remind me from the very beginning, if you can remember how old you were when you started having

1523
02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:45.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Any drug issues at all. So I just want to substance abuse history for you, like, whether it's drugs, alcohol, I mean what started marijuana and alcohol, what

1524
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:51.180
Julie Vanderpool: It started with alcohol and that was probably

1525
02:08:52.410 --> 02:08:53.670
Julie Vanderpool: 1415

1526
02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:54.720
Julie Vanderpool: Oh, yeah.

1527
02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:57.840
Dr Katrina Groves: And progress how from them.

1528
02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:04.350
Julie Vanderpool: So progressed into a pretty serious drinking problem.

1529
02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:09.210
Julie Vanderpool: Continuously the drugs didn't start until

1530
02:09:10.890 --> 02:09:20.370
Julie Vanderpool: I want to say I was, well, no, I'm sorry I experimented with different things, but the daily drug problem happened around 25

1531
02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:22.140
Julie Vanderpool: So,

1532
02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:25.470
Dr Katrina Groves: And what did you get hooked on the most. What was your drug of choice.

1533
02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.940
Methamphetamine

1534
02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:31.770
Dr Katrina Groves: And so when did the opioids view experiment with those in the beginning to

1535
02:09:32.610 --> 02:09:38.280
Julie Vanderpool: Yes, those are kind of consistently throughout just whenever I could get my hands on them sort of thing.

1536
02:09:39.690 --> 02:09:40.020
Julie Vanderpool: So like

1537
02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.250
Dr Katrina Groves: I get your coat

1538
02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:45.960
Julie Vanderpool: What North narco Vicodin and Percocet, where my Bates.

1539
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.830
Okay.

1540
02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:52.410
Dr Katrina Groves: And then the math, though, that somehow got to be even more.

1541
02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:54.120
Julie Vanderpool: He asked

1542
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:57.060
Dr Katrina Groves: What do you think the difference was like the

1543
02:09:57.510 --> 02:10:00.990
Dr Katrina Groves: Narcotics and the math. Why do you. Why do you think you did that change.

1544
02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:10.200
Julie Vanderpool: Well, initially the meth kept me from blacking out on alcohol.

1545
02:10:11.490 --> 02:10:14.130
Julie Vanderpool: That was my main attraction to it.

1546
02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.620
Dr Katrina Groves: And downer. And then that was your up

1547
02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:23.400
Julie Vanderpool: Mm hmm. And then that just became a daily thing that it seemed like I couldn't

1548
02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.160
Julie Vanderpool: Go through a day without

1549
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:30.360
Julie Vanderpool: So then the opiates kind of fit in, like,

1550
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:42.720
Julie Vanderpool: Kind of chasing a high I guess if I got to high on the on the math and the opiates were wearing me down a level. It was just

1551
02:10:44.250 --> 02:10:46.020
Julie Vanderpool: Like chasing my own tail.

1552
02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:48.570
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah.

1553
02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:54.000
Dr Katrina Groves: So, did you ever have an overdose where you almost died or had to be resuscitated

1554
02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:57.180
Julie Vanderpool: No, no, I didn't have that

1555
02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.770
Julie Vanderpool: Time. Fortunately,

1556
02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.660
Dr Katrina Groves: And hospital that led you into the hospital for your substance you

1557
02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:05.340
Know,

1558
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:09.240
Julie Vanderpool: No.

1559
02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:15.960
Dr Katrina Groves: And other. I know you had a little bit of trouble with Benz's as well.

1560
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:22.500
Dr Katrina Groves: And our valiant Klonopin Xanax, when did those start entering the picture.

1561
02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:25.200
Julie Vanderpool: I'm actually

1562
02:11:27.690 --> 02:11:31.020
Julie Vanderpool: I didn't have too much of a problem with those

1563
02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:39.480
Julie Vanderpool: But well, and when I those entered the picture later. Like, I guess in my 30s.

1564
02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:44.250
Dr Katrina Groves: And you're using them for anxiety, panic.

1565
02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:45.960
Julie Vanderpool: Huh, yeah.

1566
02:11:47.190 --> 02:11:50.700
Dr Katrina Groves: And are you still taking bentos

1567
02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:55.140
Julie Vanderpool: The half a milligram clonazepam. Mm hmm.

1568
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:56.730
Dr Katrina Groves: And how often once a day.

1569
02:11:57.150 --> 02:11:58.440
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah, okay.

1570
02:11:59.370 --> 02:12:00.240
Dr Katrina Groves: And then I know

1571
02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:05.310
Dr Katrina Groves: That your mom was able to get off them completely. I'm hoping. She's still on them.

1572
02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.510
Julie Vanderpool: She is still

1573
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.410
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah.

1574
02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.610
Dr Katrina Groves: And you know what I think you're going to join her. I just have this feeling

1575
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:12.510
Julie Vanderpool: Yes.

1576
02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:13.200
Dr Katrina Groves: One of these

1577
02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:14.910
Julie Vanderpool: Days, the plan.

1578
02:12:17.070 --> 02:12:18.720
Julie Vanderpool: She wanted me to tell you. Hello.

1579
02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:20.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Hello. Hi.

1580
02:12:21.210 --> 02:12:21.690
Julie Vanderpool: I will

1581
02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.190
Dr Katrina Groves: So the Lexapro, you're still taking 20 milligrams a day. Is that right,

1582
02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.960
Julie Vanderpool: Yes. Okay.

1583
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:34.770
Dr Katrina Groves: And any other medications, besides the sub sub solve and the quantum and Lexapro, you know,

1584
02:12:34.890 --> 02:12:36.390
Julie Vanderpool: Just those three. Okay.

1585
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.910
Dr Katrina Groves: You don't have asthma. You don't have any other medical problems, high blood pressure,

1586
02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.220
Dr Katrina Groves: I know he's nothing like that.

1587
02:12:44.730 --> 02:12:45.150
Okay, now

1588
02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Excellent. And so why does have solvent. Again, instead of the Suboxone did it just tastes better.

1589
02:12:52.530 --> 02:12:55.890
Julie Vanderpool: And initially, I chose that because it was a menthol option.

1590
02:12:56.910 --> 02:13:01.380
Julie Vanderpool: And I'm glad that I did because it's a lower dose and

1591
02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:06.060
Julie Vanderpool: So that just worked out without realizing it.

1592
02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:12.720
Dr Katrina Groves: So I am looking left here because I have your other computer from the clinic, my left.

1593
02:13:13.410 --> 02:13:14.220
Julie Vanderpool: Eye failure.

1594
02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:21.660
Dr Katrina Groves: So I don't see what's going on. So when is the last prescription. I feel like you just got one for the zoom saw recently.

1595
02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:23.460
Julie Vanderpool: I did just last week.

1596
02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.220
Dr Katrina Groves: And what they wasn't that you got it, you know.

1597
02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:29.520
Julie Vanderpool: Wednesday or Thursday.

1598
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.450
Okay.

1599
02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:37.770
Dr Katrina Groves: What I want to try to do is get you a group so that your scripts match up with the telemedicine groups.

1600
02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:51.000
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And do you feel like Monday nights at 545 are going to be better for you or Thursday mornings at 10 I just don't know what your job flexibility is right now.

1601
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:54.090
Julie Vanderpool: Oh, well, I'm laid off so I'm

1602
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:56.190
Julie Vanderpool: Flexible there.

1603
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:58.410
Julie Vanderpool: coven

1604
02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:00.780
Julie Vanderpool: So,

1605
02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.680
Julie Vanderpool: I kind of like the Thursday option.

1606
02:14:05.610 --> 02:14:07.110
Dr Katrina Groves: But later.

1607
02:14:07.650 --> 02:14:14.190
Julie Vanderpool: Okay, good, because if I do go back to work. I don't have to take the Monday option, but I have a feeling, it'll be a while so

1608
02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:22.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, I hope not. I think that's the first thing they need to do is open up the National Park. I mean, people can just kind of distance still

1609
02:14:23.850 --> 02:14:24.360
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah.

1610
02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:25.950
Julie Vanderpool: Do you think

1611
02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Anyway, not my, on my job.

1612
02:14:31.410 --> 02:14:41.760
Dr Katrina Groves: If we put you if we assume you got your prescription on like the 23rd last week that would just be on two days ago. Oh, the 16th wouldn't have been that you got your script.

1613
02:14:42.330 --> 02:14:45.960
Julie Vanderpool: No, it was just a couple of days ago and I got it.

1614
02:14:46.110 --> 02:14:54.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Look, we say it was like 23rd. Then we'll go 1234 so you could come in on the 21st of May.

1615
02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, is that work for you at 10 o'clock.

1616
02:14:58.500 --> 02:14:58.950
Julie Vanderpool: Sure.

1617
02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:09.600

Julie Vanderpool: How many years. Yeah. Or, oh

1694
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:26.100

02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.720
Julie Vanderpool: Okay, um,

1696
02:19:28.050 --> 02:19:32.040

02:19:33.510 --> 02:19:36.750

Dr Katrina Groves: Anyway,

1700
02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:50.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. Where's your motivation to quit. Is it like zero. There's no anniversary quit or is it like

1701
02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:53.310
Julie Vanderpool: How knows someday I will so

1702
02:19:53.760 --> 02:20:02.760
Julie Vanderpool: The vapor thing is set up so you, you start with a certain like I started out with 12 milligrams of nicotine and I've worked my way down to six milligrams of

1703
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:03.390
Dr Katrina Groves: Nicotine

1704
02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:14.850
Julie Vanderpool: And then I'll switch to three, when I can get that low and then it'll go to zero. And then you can stop. So I am motivated to quit and trying to use it as a tool to do so.

1705
02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:17.340

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:37.860
Julie Vanderpool: You know,

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Weight loss or weight gain. That's bothersome.

1729
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:43.620
Julie Vanderpool: No. Okay.

1730
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:47.610
Dr Katrina Groves: Any chest pain or pressure or heart palpitations that you've noticed

1731
02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:48.660
Julie Vanderpool: You know,

1732
02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:53.490

1733
02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:54.600

1734
02:21:55.500 --> 02:22:03.150

1735
02:22:03.810 --> 02:22:06.150
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah, that's kind of been

1736
02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:13.380
Julie Vanderpool: Coming up again. I'm might want to in the beginning I was taking a laxative with it and

1737
02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:17.190
Julie Vanderpool: I stopped. But I've kind of been feeling that

1738
02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:19.860
Julie Vanderpool: I might need to

1739
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:21.780
Julie Vanderpool: Use one again.

1740
02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.520
Dr Katrina Groves: So it's better to do a store.

1741
02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:31.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Often or not a laxative. So you want something more like kohli's or Doc, you say not Duke, relax. But, Doc, you say,

1742
02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:32.130
Julie Vanderpool: Okay.

02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:35.280
Dr Katrina Groves: I can send a prescription if you want. I

1744
02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:40.440
Julie Vanderpool: Think I might have some left from. Okay. So, and that's okay.

1745
02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:48.360
Dr Katrina Groves: And you're on such a small doses. I'm sorry. I have a feeling, it must be the fiber in your diet, you need to maybe be drinking more water when you bake.

1746
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:52.500
Dr Katrina Groves: It pulls out all the moisture makes real drive so

1747
02:22:53.220 --> 02:23:02.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, eating more vegetables, fruits fiber apples broccoli. I mean, anything that's good for your son to write to get on

1748
02:23:02.310 --> 02:23:04.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, high fiber diet.

1755
02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:41.370
Julie Vanderpool: So strange period of time, but I'm getting through it so

1756
02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:54.120
Dr Katrina Groves: You know I've heard a lot of other people worrying about coven and all this. And it's like, you know, you guys actually have a heads up on this. You guys have actually people in recovery. They have been through hell they have been through.

1757
02:23:54.450 --> 02:24:03.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Right when they can't be in control of anything. And so for you guys. It's kind of like, Okay, I've done this before.

1758
02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:07.200
Julie Vanderpool: Right. Yeah, that's true, that's a good way to look at it.

1759
02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:08.220
Dr Katrina Groves: I couldn't

1760
02:24:08.490 --> 02:24:15.480
Dr Katrina Groves: Be positive. So you did have a post traumatic stress on your chart that PTSD. What, what was that about,

1761
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:18.780

1768
02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:43.860
Julie Vanderpool: I think we've worked through that.

1769
02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.780
Julie Vanderpool: Right, yeah.

1770
02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:52.320
Dr Katrina Groves: Panic attacks, though, you still have those or does the client up and keep them kind of down

1771
02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:53.910
Julie Vanderpool: Like keep some down

1772
02:24:56.580 --> 02:25:04.710
Dr Katrina Groves: And have you thought about what it looks like if when you decide to taper the bends have, have you thought about what that would look like.

1773
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:06.480
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah.

1774
02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:10.530
Julie Vanderpool: That's something I really want to do

1775
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:19.500
Julie Vanderpool: I've just been scared to start. I saw my cell up my mom went through. I don't think it'll be that bad for me.

1776
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:22.590
Julie Vanderpool: No, I haven't been on him as long or and I'm not on as

1777
02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:24.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Much behind those. Yeah.

1778
02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.470
So,

1779
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:30.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Look up something called the passion manual. I think a

1780
02:25:31.770 --> 02:25:38.400
Dr Katrina Groves: Page to and I believe if she's an older doctor, I think she's even gone now. But she did an amazing

1781
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:50.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Book about bentos it's all, it's about as much Avengers affect you and how you can get off of them in a very, very slow fashion. And I just love her.

1782
02:25:51.060 --> 02:26:00.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Whole thing about it is great. So I don't know if you can get online and actually I think you can you can look up Ashton manual and about themselves. And that might give you

1783
02:26:00.930 --> 02:26:01.170
Julie Vanderpool: A

1784
02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:11.790
Dr Katrina Groves: But you're absolutely right. Do not start quitting everything together and make you're working on your vapor pen right now. Don't start with the band goes, you got to do one addiction at a time. Okay.

1785
02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:16.800
Dr Katrina Groves: But yeah, that was that will happen for you.

1786
02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:21.870
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Um, I think I got everything I needed.

1787
02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:23.280
Julie Vanderpool: Okay.

1788
02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:25.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Medical History social history.

1789
02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.610
Dr Katrina Groves: Any other kids that you know about like that. You've had or miscarriages or abortions, or just that one.

1790
02:26:36.570 --> 02:26:39.360
Julie Vanderpool: I've had two abortions. Okay.

1791
02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:43.560
Dr Katrina Groves: And so three pregnancies one

1792
02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:49.560
Dr Katrina Groves: And tell me about your brother, how he's doing and just in general.

1793
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:54.330
Julie Vanderpool: He's in reading, he's back at rest pad.

1794
02:26:55.830 --> 02:27:02.010
Julie Vanderpool: So where that he needs to be there and they're working on conservatorship

1795
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:06.810
Julie Vanderpool: Which is not what he wants, of course, but

1796
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:12.000
Julie Vanderpool: It's what he needs and he lost his apartment and

1797
02:27:13.530 --> 02:27:16.470
Julie Vanderpool: He, you know, hit his bottom and

1798
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:24.810
Julie Vanderpool: He's trying to get you know myself for someone to say sure we'll take them in at our house.

1799
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:34.020
Julie Vanderpool: And we're standing strong together on that. So he's probably upset with everyone in the family, except for Preston Preston write some letters and

1800
02:27:34.530 --> 02:27:39.420
Julie Vanderpool: He writes back. So we're going to keep that up and just hope for the best price.

1801
02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:44.520
Dr Katrina Groves: At that's really wise you guys very, very important. I mean, Logan is a very smart.

1802
02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:49.380
Dr Katrina Groves: And and that's part of the reason it took so long to get nutrients.

1803
02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:53.550
Dr Katrina Groves: And and i think he needs to be where he's at.

1804
02:27:54.210 --> 02:27:54.720
Julie Vanderpool: Me too.

1805
02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:03.000
Dr Katrina Groves: And I'm so happy that it seems like you got in recovery exactly at the right time, because when he was going down, you will you were coming up and

1806
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:10.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Right went from there to there and it was just so good that he didn't have to see his home uncle's meltdown and

1807
02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:11.640
Julie Vanderpool: And he right

1808
02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:13.890
Julie Vanderpool: Because not having me and yeah

1809
02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.740
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'm really happy with you guys. You must have some angels looking out for you in your life.

1810
02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:21.990
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah, I think so.

1811
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:25.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you go to church. Still, or do you do any kind of

1812
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:29.850
Julie Vanderpool: Well churches cancelled for the coven thing.

1813
02:28:30.810 --> 02:28:32.400
Dr Katrina Groves: Still, people can do better. This

1814
02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:43.470
Julie Vanderpool: Yes. And actually we have we've watched it on YouTube. Last week, so we'll probably do that tomorrow and yeah I'm still I still have a church family, a good one.

1815
02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:48.240
Dr Katrina Groves: And don't even have that women's a it was a women's group that you were doing for a while.

1816
02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:50.310
Julie Vanderpool: I was. Yeah.

1817
02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:57.630
Julie Vanderpool: I need to look into what they're doing with zoom. I haven't found that out yet. There's I'm sure there's something

1818
02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:06.360
Dr Katrina Groves: Alrighty. I'm sure there is something so I think we're good. And what did I tell you were coming

1819
02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:09.090
Julie Vanderpool: On May 21

1820
02:29:09.450 --> 02:29:11.310
Julie Vanderpool: At 930 yeah well

1821
02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:13.320
Dr Katrina Groves: 930 second. Good job.

1822
02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:15.210
Dr Katrina Groves: And you just

1823
02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:24.300
Dr Katrina Groves: The regular zoom room or our virtual clinic. It's like the waiting area at the front desk and they'll ask you some questions and let you in. So

1824
02:29:24.330 --> 02:29:36.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, there's still some paperwork stuff they got to do when they intake you, it seems like a lot, but try and be patient with it. There's like a bio psycho social profile that they have to do with a therapist and

1825
02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:45.090
Dr Katrina Groves: I would call them and be kind of proactive and say, hey, is there anything I need because they're kind of running around until they hire more people

1826
02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:52.200
Julie Vanderpool: Okay, yeah. They told me I need to call beacon, and I need to do some lab work and they'll

1827
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:54.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Send a drug test to your house and don't open hell.

1828
02:29:54.690 --> 02:29:58.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, little package and then you call them and they'll help you walk through that.

1829
02:29:59.130 --> 02:29:59.610
Okay.

1830
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:04.710
Julie Vanderpool: Then I do that on zoom also right so they can see me. Yeah.

1831
02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.890
Dr Katrina Groves: They don't have you go pee with them that you just go

1832
02:30:08.010 --> 02:30:13.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Right out a kind of look at it together. And I'm sure you're not worried because it's not going to be positive.

1833
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:14.550
Julie Vanderpool: No, it's not.

1834
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:29.250
Dr Katrina Groves: If there is ever a. Some of them have false positive tests you know about that. So if there's ever one that they're like oh this doesn't look quite right. You say, You know what, I'm going to go to the clinic, you just go into open door and you know text Tony and she'll give you a

1835
02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:35.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Trap a test there and they can send off and prove that it was a false positive. So,

1836
02:30:35.430 --> 02:30:36.690
Julie Vanderpool: Oh, good. Okay.

1837
02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:38.340
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't ever want that to freak you out.

1838
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:39.390
No.

1839
02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:41.220
Julie Vanderpool: Me either.

1840
02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:45.150
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, well, good to see you. Did you have any questions for me.

1841
02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:51.030
Julie Vanderpool: I don't think so. Oh, so the groups. How many people

1842
02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:53.010
Julie Vanderpool: Yeah, I'm you.

1843
02:30:53.310 --> 02:31:01.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Will be anybody. But I'm getting everybody that my goal is to get all you guys up with me. And so, and you don't know how all these people right because you've never

1844
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:02.880
Julie Vanderpool: Been the group so

1845
02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:07.890
Dr Katrina Groves: Right now, there's only 123 people on the 21st

1846
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:29.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, but that may change sometimes like Monday this Monday, like I have OH MY GOD 123 or 56789 and that's the most I ever. I don't like 10 there's another therapist that helps. She basically takes people through like a

1847
02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:40.530
Dr Katrina Groves: A handout or working through whatever. She'll. She'll do a little check in, but 10 is just almost too many. I had a few no shows that are trying to make up their groups, but

1848
02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:42.120
Julie Vanderpool: Oh, okay.

1849
02:31:42.690 --> 02:31:53.280
Dr Katrina Groves: So yeah, you don't have to talk a lot. Just listen. And if you have any feedback for people. You're one of my people that's got a long term sobriety. And so even though you don't know people

1850
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:55.230
Julie Vanderpool: Okay.

1851
02:31:55.470 --> 02:32:02.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you concerned about is there anyone that in the group that you can't be with or don't absolutely don't want to, you don't

1852
02:32:02.490 --> 02:32:08.040
Julie Vanderpool: I didn't. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I have a problem with that.

1853
02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:10.530
Julie Vanderpool: If one comes up.

1854
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:12.630
Julie Vanderpool: I don't think so.

1855
02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:19.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, I think we're ready. I'm on track with my next person at noon.

1856
02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:25.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Seven people today. It's like, Wow, my

1857
02:32:25.170 --> 02:32:27.420
Dr Katrina Groves: God, you guys are all getting

1858
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:29.910
Dr Katrina Groves: So yeah, love to your mom.

1859
02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:32.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Thank you, happy she's doing well.

1860
02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.710
Julie Vanderpool: She is she's doing really well.

1861
02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:36.480
Julie Vanderpool: So a

1862
02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:39.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Couple weeks and yeah

1863
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.100
Julie Vanderpool: Thank you, you too.

1864
02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:43.200
Julie Vanderpool: Bye.

1865
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:55.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, the next one is supposed to be.

1866
02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:21.240
Dr Katrina Groves: I've done Joey Alcatraz was first Joshua area was second Tony Hatfield missed. But he's trying to come back on Rudy stole was at 1030 Jennifer Snyder was at 11 I just did. Julie vanderpool. Yay. So my next one is 12 o'clock. James would

1867
02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:23.280
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

1868
02:33:30.570 --> 02:33:35.970
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm ready for my opening meet you here before I type this

1869
02:33:38.310 --> 02:33:40.770
Dr Katrina Groves: And then I'm trying to get Tony Hatfield at 1230

1870
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:58.800
Dr Katrina Groves: So kind of confusing, but the next patient is going to be Tony Anthony Hatfield, we call it Tony is Date of Birth is six 183 let me know if you really need all that for me to dictate or if it's in your list. I just don't know.

1871
02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:14.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Where you get your information, tell me how fields tough PS Scott add. He's homeless. He's drinks alcohol. He has used methamphetamines many times

1872
02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:18.000
Dr Katrina Groves: He's a tough one.

1873
02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:25.830
Dr Katrina Groves: And then after that I think James words and then I'll stay on because I'm going to have to go through each person.

1874
02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:29.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Should do that now with the last person. I did.

1875
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:38.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Because I finished class areas I finished really afterwards.

1876
02:34:39.090 --> 02:34:42.840
Dr Katrina Groves: So for Rudy, or can I guess I have a minute here. We can do Rudy, stop.

1877
02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:55.080
Dr Katrina Groves: He was a young man, that was a fisherman and he is a clever and a fisherman by trade, so problem with him as he's going to need flexible groups.

1878
02:34:55.770 --> 02:35:07.890
Dr Katrina Groves: I know that's hard for bright heart to do but really important because he is stable clean over five and a half years and really feels like a different person. So

1879
02:35:08.610 --> 02:35:19.410
Dr Katrina Groves: I forgot to ask him if you could use his iPhone or iPad on the boat and maybe difficult to get any kind of reception out there and of course if he's busy point and crackpots Ain't no way

1880
02:35:21.390 --> 02:35:31.620
Dr Katrina Groves: But we can try to be flexible. I think is next group, he was going to do either Monday or Thursday, not this week, but either the

1881
02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:35.640
Dr Katrina Groves: four or seven

1882
02:35:37.290 --> 02:35:38.880
Dr Katrina Groves: S question mark.

1883
02:35:40.770 --> 02:35:45.810
Dr Katrina Groves: So he'll do either the fourth or the seventh group depending on his

1884
02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:53.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Schedule. We might have to kind of make it like that. I might have to make him go to every two to three months, which is fine.

1885
02:35:55.140 --> 02:36:00.450
Dr Katrina Groves: So for Rudy his diagnosis again was an opioid dependence in severe in our mission.

1886
02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:08.850
Quit smoking.

1887
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:20.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, he's, he was a smoker and change the beta. Now he's a nonsmoker and he does not need a prescription right now because he just got

1888
02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:42.420
Dr Katrina Groves: But he does take some action eight milligrams per day and I will try to get him an epi pen prescribed

1889
02:36:48.690 --> 02:36:56.610
Dr Katrina Groves: For his basting anaphylaxis. So add that to his diagnosis boosting anaphylaxis. Otherwise, he's good.

1890
02:36:59.190 --> 02:37:00.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Walgreens.

1891
02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:14.250
Dr Katrina Groves: And so I did those three. The next one I'm still waiting for my patients. So let's do Jennifer Snyder and she's been clean over three years, which was February 2017

1892
02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:26.400
Dr Katrina Groves: She had issues for alcohol for a while but is no longer drinking. So she's alcohol dependence is in remission and it was only moderate

1893
02:37:29.250 --> 02:37:37.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Or usual diagnosis of opioid dependence period in remission. I said she for birth control. She's using norplant

1894
02:37:38.430 --> 02:37:45.870
Dr Katrina Groves: Which is put in December 17 2019 so it's not do out for three years and she'll meet with her PCP for that.

1895
02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:52.950
Dr Katrina Groves: She may be inches long. Should I be bipolar to

1896
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:57.840
Dr Katrina Groves: She also has asthma.

1897
02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Jennifer Snyder, sorry.

1898
02:38:05.250 --> 02:38:17.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, she has asthma and mild and intermittent and she just has an inhaler she uses and she'll contact her PCP for that. She also takes the Lexapro 20 milligrams a day. And again, this is probably for

1899
02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:25.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Bipolar to which has her other diagnosis just has some varicose veins and swelling. That's another diagnosis.

1900
02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:38.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Should be getting stockings and putting your feet up or she's not working. And she did have some constipation, but it's improved with fiber and she does not need a

1901
02:38:41.130 --> 02:38:42.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Script. Oh, she has a

1902
02:38:46.050 --> 02:38:50.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Domestic Violence relationship potential

1903
02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:56.700

02:49:50.430 --> 02:49:50.940
Yeah.

2033
02:49:52.770 --> 02:50:02.100

2043
02:50:52.650 --> 02:51:07.770

Dr Katrina Groves: Let me look I have your other computer open here so I can maybe tell you

02:52:54.720 --> 02:53:00.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, it's me, it's made your appointment with destiny. I don't know if you want to write it down on a piece of paper.

James wood: And

2069
02:53:10.590 --> 02:53:12.720
Dr Katrina Groves: At what time

2070
02:53:14.850 --> 02:53:15.750
Dr Katrina Groves: 1040

2071
02:53:17.370 --> 02:53:17.670
James wood: Okay.

2072
02:53:17.700 --> 02:53:24.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Money, but they may be doing zoom. So you may want to try and check in half hour early again.

2073
02:53:26.490 --> 02:53:27.420
James wood: Yeah, that'd be

2074
02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:30.690
James wood: Pretty cool.

2075
02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:36.900
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're getting practice. You just need to find a better spot with better internet and better phone

2076
02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:37.290
Yeah.

2077
02:53:39.210 --> 02:53:39.360
Oh,

2078
02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:42.990
James wood: My goodness. Oh, so

2079
02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:44.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Right after you get paid.

2080
02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:48.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so you don't take Depakote anymore.

2081
02:53:50.130 --> 02:53:50.790
James wood: Okay.

2082
02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:53.850
Dr Katrina Groves: There's a medication.

2083
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:55.020
James wood: Don't know.

2084
02:53:55.470 --> 02:53:58.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh Capra lever.

2085
02:53:59.610 --> 02:54:02.670
Dr Katrina Groves: Lever terrorists attacked or something. Okay.

2086
02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:03.420
James wood: Yeah.

2087
02:54:03.690 --> 02:54:06.090
Dr Katrina Groves: And is that 1000 milligrams twice a day.

2088
02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:07.620
James wood: Yeah.

2089
02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:13.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. And do you still take Klonopin or is that been gone a long time.

2090
02:54:17.250 --> 02:54:17.610
James wood: Went on

2091
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:19.530
James wood: I came clean

2092
02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:25.290
James wood: He doesn't want

2093
02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:34.470
James wood: That again maybe

2094
02:54:36.810 --> 02:54:47.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Exactly. So I think what you said was, I'm translating I can make sure the alcohol and Ben's. Those are a bad combination you stop breathing. You can die. So, yeah.

2095
02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:48.180
Yeah.

2096
02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:52.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so you're taking the seizure medication.

2097
02:54:55.980 --> 02:55:00.150
Dr Katrina Groves: And the Suboxone you're doing eight milligrams three a day, I assume.

2098
02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:02.100
James wood: Yeah.

2099
02:55:02.850 --> 02:55:13.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Is it. How's it for your cravings. Like when's the last time you took opioids. I mean, I know you've got alcohol issues. But what about the narcotics. When's the last time you slipped up for those

2100
02:55:15.150 --> 02:55:15.420
James wood: Took

2101
02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:19.350
James wood: Me actually for the whole time and

2102
02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:28.320
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, I was gonna say that it was like you started in 2014 could that be right.

2103
02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:33.630
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. Wow. And then, oh my gosh.

2104
02:55:35.250 --> 02:55:36.030
Dr Katrina Groves: That was great.

2105
02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:45.690
Dr Katrina Groves: You were thinking about the shot to this sunblock hate injections. Have you ever thought about those

2106
02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:47.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Rather

2107
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:50.220
James wood: Wanted to do that, actually.

2108
02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:54.840
Dr Katrina Groves: might try. There's something called vivid

2109
02:55:58.350 --> 02:56:06.450
Dr Katrina Groves: There's a medicine called the trial is a shot for alcohol, but it also helps you from stopping

2110
02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:19.560
Dr Katrina Groves: It takes cravings for narcotics. So people with alcohol and narcotic issues they go off the Suboxone and you take pivotal shots. Instead, and it can be very effective.

2111
02:56:20.850 --> 02:56:31.140
Dr Katrina Groves: So that's something I'm going to want to, I think, put it on your notes to ask Dustin, or maybe I can figure out a way to get it for you if you're interested.

2112
02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:36.450
Dr Katrina Groves: I mean, we can try camp route. First, I'll put you back on Cam Pro.

2113
02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:38.130
Dr Katrina Groves: For the album.

2114
02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:47.880
Dr Katrina Groves: But I think vitro shot works really good for people that are have a lot of alcohol problems as well. So maybe we can

2115
02:56:48.030 --> 02:56:49.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Go great thoughts.

2116
02:56:52.170 --> 02:56:56.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medication.

2117
02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:05.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Lexapro. What happened with hives.

2118
02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:06.120
Yeah.

2119
02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:09.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow, okay. No Lexapro for you.

2120
02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:16.350
Dr Katrina Groves: All right. And I want to do a little family history.

2121
02:57:16.470 --> 02:57:17.340
Dr Katrina Groves: I know this is

2122
02:57:17.610 --> 02:57:20.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Hard. But is your mom still living.

2123
02:57:21.450 --> 02:57:22.020

Okay.

2136
02:57:58.710 --> 02:58:00.720
Dr Katrina Groves: And what about your father. Is he still living.

2140
02:58:24.510 --> 02:58:28.170
James wood: It almost like four or five years from now.

2141
02:58:30.990 --> 02:58:36.450
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, because I know you had a lot of trauma and your childhood. He was, he would be you kids right

2142
02:58:37.770 --> 02:58:38.100
James wood: Yeah.

2143
02:58:39.450 --> 02:58:47.070
Dr Katrina Groves: So one of your diagnoses is post traumatic stress. It's like what Vietnam vets get I think we've talked about that before. Right.

2144
02:58:48.390 --> 02:58:48.930
James wood: Yeah.

2145
02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:50.820
James wood: And I

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:07.080
James wood: I'm doing lot better with controlling my tasks.

2150
02:59:10.530 --> 02:59:22.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I wonder if that's why your anger is worse, it's like, it's always trading one for another you know your panic attacks get better. Maybe your anger and your alcohol had to reach out for that. I don't know.

2151
02:59:23.940 --> 02:59:24.210
James wood: Yeah.

2152
02:59:26.100 --> 02:59:35.490
Dr Katrina Groves: So one thing about bright heart. You're joining this group. It's actually amazing the amount of counseling, they have they have their own

2153
02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:49.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Therapists like Tony, but different. They also have people that can do post traumatic stress and childhood trauma people that have been raped or abused.

2154
02:59:50.280 --> 03:00:03.600
Dr Katrina Groves: So we've got people that can see you. And that's going to be one of your, your main focuses I want you to do is, yes, you'll see me for group like once every couple weeks or once a month, whatever. But I want you to get in with

2155
03:00:03.690 --> 03:00:04.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Good counselor.

2156
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:11.370
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't think that's been helping for you at Crescent City right there's like no mental health, they're

2157
03:00:12.990 --> 03:00:14.760
James wood: Not, not. No. No.

2158
03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:17.310
James wood: No.

2159
03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:21.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, did you ever try to get on the telemedicine doctor there.

2160
03:00:22.260 --> 03:00:22.860
James wood: I did.

2161
03:00:25.050 --> 03:00:27.300
James wood: And nobody ever heard.

2162
03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:28.650
James wood: Anything.

2163
03:00:29.550 --> 03:00:35.430
Dr Katrina Groves: So with bright heart, you'll have that option. So I'll make sure to make a note and put you in for the

2164
03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:38.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Counseling.

2165
03:00:39.690 --> 03:00:42.990
Dr Katrina Groves: And your seizure disorder. When's the last time you had a seizure.

2166
03:00:48.450 --> 03:00:49.950
James wood: Again throughout the night.

2167
03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:52.950
James wood: We're

2168
03:00:54.540 --> 03:00:55.470
James wood: Sleeping more

2169
03:00:58.410 --> 03:01:00.360
Dr Katrina Groves: I think alcohol makes it worse.

2170
03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:24.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, it's. You're right. You can have seizures. If you've come off alcohol too fast. You'll definitely have seizures. So you have to go slow and

2171
03:01:25.770 --> 03:01:31.590
Dr Katrina Groves: But you can also have seizures. Just because you drink too much. So it's kind of like a narrow window.

2172
03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:37.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, are you still smoking.

2173
03:01:39.810 --> 03:01:40.260
James wood: Yeah.

2174
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:50.730
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Um, I assume you have no interest in quitting right now because of all this stuff that's going on.

2175
03:01:53.850 --> 03:01:55.920
James wood: Now, I went from almost you back down.

James wood: To about 10 days.

2177
03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:12.660
Dr Katrina Groves: That's great. I just think you you need to focus on the alcohol, maybe next and then maybe work on the other, but maybe they'll go together for you. I don't know.

2178
03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:14.460
James wood: Yeah.

2179
03:02:16.290 --> 03:02:20.580

03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:11.010
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:14.640

But

2235
03:06:20.370 --> 03:06:33.690
Dr Katrina Groves: That comes from drinking too. Is it gets your liver. So you're going to need some blood work right heart wants you to go get blood work when you can at the clinic, whenever the lab opens up and just make sure your liver is okay.

2236
03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:41.520
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Any stomach problems like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

2237
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:42.300

Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, I can barely hear you.

2239
03:06:59.250 --> 03:07:00.840
Dr Katrina Groves: I didn't, I'm not hearing anything

2240
03:07:01.770 --> 03:07:02.820
Dr Katrina Groves: You have to start over.

2241
03:07:03.690 --> 03:07:04.140
Belly.

2242
03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:06.360
James wood: Yeah, I didn't get it.

2243
03:07:07.770 --> 03:07:08.880
James wood: For about three weeks.

2244
03:07:09.930 --> 03:07:11.280
James wood: And I was feeling around

2245
03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:15.720
James wood: Heart like

2246
03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:21.780
James wood: It's

2247
03:07:28.350 --> 03:07:30.930
Dr Katrina Groves: It's hard above your belly button like a knot.

2248
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.510
James wood: In my

2249
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.860
James wood: Stomach.

2250
03:07:45.060 --> 03:07:46.440
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you throwing up at all.

2251
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:52.020
James wood: But I feel extremely

2252
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:54.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

2253
03:07:55.710 --> 03:07:57.660
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you want something for nausea.

2254
03:08:08.010 --> 03:08:11.670
James wood: No, that's okay. It's not, it's not about worry don't affect my day or anything like that.

2255
03:08:11.970 --> 03:08:28.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, you need to start trying to eat things. Eat soft foods, easy to digest like oatmeal or crema weed or, you know, bananas, things that are soft peanut butter, eggs, try to get some food in your stomach.

2256
03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:36.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Did you hear that, or do I am I am I going out.

2257
03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:38.670
James wood: Yeah, good. Yes.

2258
03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:51.690
Dr Katrina Groves: If you ever ever ever throw up the light or dark coffee grounds, you've got to go to the emergency room because if you're an alcoholic and you drink.

2259
03:08:52.260 --> 03:09:09.390
Dr Katrina Groves: The blood vessels and your stomach get really big and they can actually break open and you can bleed out. So any kind of blood or black Targhee stool when you poop or vomiting up coffee grounds that might be a sign you're having a bleeding ulcer.

2260
03:09:11.970 --> 03:09:12.810
James wood: Oh, okay.

2261
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:15.750
Dr Katrina Groves: So talk to Dustin about that too.

2262
03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:18.780
James wood: Okay, well,

2263
03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:25.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you have any tremors or seizures. Well, yeah, I know we talked about seizures, but

2264
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:27.840
James wood: Yeah, I hate

2265
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:32.160
James wood: Right now, where my hands are shaking. Yeah.

2266
03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:36.060
Dr Katrina Groves: And that's coming off the booze. You know, you're just coming off the booze.

2267
03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:38.640
Dr Katrina Groves: What about headaches.

2268
03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:43.380
James wood: I'm not the guy with the headache.

2269
03:09:44.010 --> 03:09:44.340
Okay.

2270
03:09:46.590 --> 03:09:51.210
Dr Katrina Groves: So tell me about your mood changes, then you've been really depressed.

2271
03:09:52.230 --> 03:09:56.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Any suicidal thoughts are you thinking of it like ending it all.

2272
03:10:00.450 --> 03:10:00.870
James wood: Really

2273
03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:18.990
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

2274
03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:21.210
Dr Katrina Groves: And I know you had

2275
03:10:25.410 --> 03:10:27.690
James wood: Oh, then I feel like

2276
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:36.090
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you say angry at the world.

2277
03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:46.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. Yeah. And I think the anger outside is because you're really sad inside and it kind of that's how it manifests itself.

2278
03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:48.690
James wood: Yeah.

2279
03:10:49.470 --> 03:11:04.860
Dr Katrina Groves: So remember that that old tape in your head is playing that your ex wife told you all this you know your your dad told you this, it's that old tape of like I'm nothing I'm worthless i'm i'm worse than terrible. You know, you got to

2280
03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:11.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Have helped to combat those thoughts because when you're clean and you're doing well. You're a good guy.

2281
03:11:12.180 --> 03:11:13.290
Dr Katrina Groves: You're a good dad.

2282
03:11:15.810 --> 03:11:18.210
James wood: No, no, no.

2283
03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:22.380
Dr Katrina Groves: What's happening.

2284
03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:26.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Somebody unplugged you

2285
03:11:31.950 --> 03:11:34.350
Dr Katrina Groves: Oops, might have lost him.

2286
03:11:57.270 --> 03:11:58.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Did we lose you, James.

2287
03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:05.970
Dr Katrina Groves: Think I have enough to keep talking a minute so

2288
03:12:07.650 --> 03:12:08.400

2290
03:12:19.650 --> 03:12:22.110

Dr Katrina Groves: In early alcohol withdrawals.

2293
03:12:32.850 --> 03:12:36.420
Dr Katrina Groves: The plan will be for him to continue his Suboxone

2294
03:12:37.980 --> 03:12:41.280
Dr Katrina Groves: I didn't get to ask him. Oh yeah, his script is due on the

2295
03:12:42.390 --> 03:12:44.550
Dr Katrina Groves: 20th, so I'll be able to see him.

2296
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:50.400
Dr Katrina Groves: On the 18th. I can't believe I added another person to the

2297
03:12:53.310 --> 03:12:54.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Genes

2298
03:13:00.780 --> 03:13:09.360
Dr Katrina Groves: Is so alcohol abuse ongoing, I'm going to add Cam Pro. Think about vivid trial injections. He has anger, so

2299
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:15.690
Dr Katrina Groves: He has post traumatic stress and depression.

2300
03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:22.920
Dr Katrina Groves: I'll see there's sometimes things they want me to know about the PTSD.

2301
03:13:30.750 --> 03:13:46.110
Dr Katrina Groves: He would benefit from em, Dr. As part of my plan. So I'd like to get him in what's Serena beers. She's really good with that he has absence, seizures, which are chronic and somewhat controlled on the medication you heard

2302

2303
03:13:52.470 --> 03:13:57.540
Dr Katrina Groves: It's still active. He's but he's down from two packs data half pack a day. So that's good.

2304
03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:09.390
Dr Katrina Groves: I gave him some encouragement and support he will be meeting with his primary care doctor next week for talking about anger depression.

2305
03:14:11.370 --> 03:14:16.650
Dr Katrina Groves: He also has panic attacks and tackle cardiac anxiety kind of all goes together.

2306
03:14:17.850 --> 03:14:22.920
Dr Katrina Groves: He states, they're under control, but I think they're not that he's just been drinking too much.

2307
03:14:26.490 --> 03:14:29.670
Dr Katrina Groves: And as we talked about the alcoholism is making his

03:14:35.430 --> 03:14:36.420

03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:46.290
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't think I got to get to the allergies.

2312
03:14:50.310 --> 03:14:52.500

James wood: Last, the last connection.

2316
03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:20.880
Dr Katrina Groves: I saw you say, oh no, oh no.

2317
03:15:21.930 --> 03:15:22.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Happening.

2318
03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:26.520
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so where were we

2319
03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:34.980
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't remember we were talking about the alcohol and

2320
03:15:35.610 --> 03:15:35.910
Mike

2321
03:15:40.170 --> 03:15:40.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

2322
03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:42.450
James wood: Or the Viper.

2323
03:15:43.770 --> 03:15:44.100
James wood: And stuff.

2324
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:45.210
Okay.

2325
03:15:47.070 --> 03:15:49.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, so I think I'm actually pretty much

2326
03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:53.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Dead getting done here.

2327
03:15:55.320 --> 03:16:03.060
Dr Katrina Groves: The Smoking. I think the smoking, you should just keep staying low if you can on the cigarettes.

2328
03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:07.200
Dr Katrina Groves: And I will be seeing you on the

2329
03:16:09.090 --> 03:16:09.660
James wood: On the

2330
03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:11.460
James wood: 18th of May.

2331
03:16:11.970 --> 03:16:14.580
Dr Katrina Groves: At 545 but check in at 515

2332
03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:20.550
Dr Katrina Groves: OK. And then do you need, you don't need a prescription right now you got that.

2333
03:16:21.810 --> 03:16:29.520
Dr Katrina Groves: I will send the Cam Pro in though, and I want you to just start with one three times a day and then work your way up to where you're taking two, three times a day.

2334
03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:50.580
Dr Katrina Groves: And it might work. Now just because it didn't work before is probably because you weren't really ready but now you're ready and it won't help you go not go through withdrawals, but it will help the cravings. Would you like some Clonidine to help with them the shakes, or what do you think

2335
03:16:51.630 --> 03:16:53.490
James wood: Yeah, that'd be good night.

2336
03:16:55.980 --> 03:17:01.920
Dr Katrina Groves: What about liberty me just for a short time to help you get off the booze. Yeah.

2337
03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:20.340
Dr Katrina Groves: I know we gave you libertarian before, but then you want you. I don't know. It didn't work. You kind of just kept wanting to drink and take Benz's so now that you're not on any Benz's I can do that just for a week and get you through the withdrawal period so you don't end up in the hospital.

2338
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:22.200
James wood: Okay.

2339
03:17:23.220 --> 03:17:25.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and what Pharmacy was that James

2340
03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:28.440
James wood: A Walgreens.

2341
03:17:28.980 --> 03:17:29.640

2348
03:17:55.050 --> 03:17:58.050
James wood: Yeah, it takes a while to be used to

2349
03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:01.620
James wood: Me, it's more convenient.

2350
03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:08.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, it's great. You don't have to go to groups anymore. And you'll still see the same people in groups on video so

2351
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:10.080

Dr Katrina Groves: So bright hearts gonna have you send you a lot of stuff still paperwork to fill out that's on the video that they'll do with you so

2354
03:18:29.490 --> 03:18:34.290
