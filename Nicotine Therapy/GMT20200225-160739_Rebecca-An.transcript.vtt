Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know.

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.180
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know, but I have a few days off. So that's been. I don't know. It's been a long time since I've had the whole day and night off.

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.840
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.750
Donna Jochimsen: Sometimes I can get it part of a day off. But I'm always there at night so

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you, what are you going to do

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.200
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I have a lot to do today. Today's my busy day. I have this appointment I have my 12 o'clock meeting, I have to go to the hospital and have them back some records for you got or for bright heart.

18
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.540
Donna Jochimsen: So I do have a lot to do today, but

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.410
Donna Jochimsen: When I get done with that, I don't know, maybe not very much for a while. I think this might take a couple of down hours and

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.350
Donna Jochimsen: Just enjoy doing nothing.

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wouldn't be nice.

22
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.990
Donna Jochimsen: It would be nice. Probably something will happen and that that will not occur, but I'm gonna try

23
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

24
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's all right, and everything's going well.

25
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.230
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it is. It is. I

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.790
Donna Jochimsen: I did pretty well with my eating yesterday.

27
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:08.430
Donna Jochimsen: That actually scared me because I realized that it was almost a compulsion at that point he does, you know, just to not just have a bite of a cupcake, but eat all of them and

28
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.930
Donna Jochimsen: It was like

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.320
Donna Jochimsen: Frightening. But I realized it's probably the same part of me that became a heroin addict or smoke cigarettes.

30
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.690
Donna Jochimsen: And so I decided that I needed to just stop at right now before it gets any farther than I did.

31
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:42.060
Donna Jochimsen: I did. I went to this, I bought a bunch of vegetables and you know that I kind of eat those. I just didn't buy anything sweet. I have. I still have some hard candies and some suckers, but

32
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.350
Donna Jochimsen: I may have to get rid of those two because I think that's what led me to the sugar thing and wanting to eat everything I could find.

33
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just think that it's part of it to you know to me.

34
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

35
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to find something to latch on to and usually that's the route, it goes

36
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.030
Donna Jochimsen: You know when you're trying to like sort of went down the ladder. Right.

37
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Time to

38
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do something. And that's why people gain weight when they you know when they quit smoking because they, you know, it's that that need, you know, to

39
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just, it's a crazy cycle.

40
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

41
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that you caught it.

42
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:41.730
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I, I've been horrified by I I got really overweight one time when I was having a lot of emotional problems I've hospital hospitalized twice for psychosis.

43
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:53.850
Donna Jochimsen: In one year and they put me on some anti psychotic drugs and I gained so much weight. I think I weighed 220 pounds at the end of that.

44
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:11.010
Donna Jochimsen: But as soon as I quit taking taking the medications that came off just came off. I didn't die it particularly exercise more than I do. I just did lose the way so I'm pretty sure it was the medications, but I don't ever want to be like that again.

45
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.370
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I, I don't know. I don't know how people do it like just really done it lifetime hard when you're when you are big.

46
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.970
Yeah.

47
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

48
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I tell you,

49
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.580
Donna Jochimsen: About five foot four

50
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.400
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it was a lot of way.

51
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that was a lot of

52
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:52.590
Donna Jochimsen: Horrible. Yeah, I was tired all the time I getting up was a problem walking was a problem, going to the bathroom and wiping was the problem. I could you know i i don't even I don't know how people who get those 600 pound people. I don't even know how they survive at all.

53
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.310
Yeah.

54
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a lot for a system to handle

55
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's for sure.

56
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:10.710
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, really. But anyway, I doing now being overweight at once like that maybe never wanted do that again. So I think that i think i think i've got a handle on it now.

57
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good, good. Yeah.

58
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.850
When do you find yourself.

59
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When do you find yourself wanting to snack. The most

60
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.050
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I'll tell you what, since I quit smoking. It's just all the time just constantly wanting to eat something so

61
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.400
Donna Jochimsen: I just like I said I've got my hard candies. I bought a bunch of vegetables and cut them up, didn't buy the dip.

62
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:47.490
Donna Jochimsen: I bought a bag of those little seedless oranges and so that they're pretty sweet. So whenever I want something I just, I'm grabbing that and I haven't felt like I want

63
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:56.280
Donna Jochimsen: That sort of slow down the desire to eat all the time to, for some reason, when I ate sugar. It just made me want to eat more.

64
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.850
Mm hmm.

65
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's definitely addictive substance, just like everything else.

66
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.860
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

67
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.290
Donna Jochimsen: My sponsor pointed that out to me.

68
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.730
Donna Jochimsen: The other addiction you to get past

69
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.500
Donna Jochimsen: So,

70
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.230
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it's easy to think I did the other

71
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:27.960
Donna Jochimsen: Day I have I you know I have when I quit using heroin. I smoked cigarettes and then when I quit doing that, then I, I didn't see the eating thing coming. No, because

72
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:39.330
Donna Jochimsen: I haven't, I haven't my weight hasn't changed in 10 years so I didn't really think about that. I would start stuffing my face with cupcakes.

73
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.520
Donna Jochimsen: I think that's over.

74
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Good. I'm glad it only lasted a couple days. So that's a good thing.

75
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.390
Donna Jochimsen: Well actually lasted lasted about 10 days actually

76
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:09.840
Donna Jochimsen: I knew, I KNEW I've gained a few pounds, and I knew that if I kept going. I was going to gain weight fast I gained weight really fast and usually it's hard to get it a lot longer and harder to get it off.

77
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

78
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's

79
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm glad you caught it and got vegetables to put into place.

80
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.690
Donna Jochimsen: Recruit yes

81
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Natural I can I just gave myself permission to eat all those I want and I find I don't like to eat as much of that as I did the

82
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.390
cupcakes.

83
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:49.830
Donna Jochimsen: I'm gonna blame my daughter. She made the most killer cupcakes my granddaughters birthday party was Saturday night, and I went to dinner up there. And my daughter made the best cupcakes. I've ever had. They were so good and and I told her that. So she sent me home. Four of them and

84
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.530
Donna Jochimsen: I had one when I got home.

85
00:07:53.670 --> 00:08:01.470
Donna Jochimsen: I had one in the middle of the night and then I had one for breakfast, and then one right after that, just for no reason at all, but

86
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.750
Donna Jochimsen: I mean for cupcakes. In about 12 hours with that came down to

87
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a lot.

88
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.800
Donna Jochimsen: That's a

89
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.730
Donna Jochimsen: Lot, I felt

90
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.300
Donna Jochimsen: I felt I felt all puffy and bloated.

91
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.080
Donna Jochimsen: It wasn't a good thing at all.

92
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are things going with your sponsor.

93
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:41.850
Donna Jochimsen: Good, good. I talked to her about the eating thing last night. She's the one that pointed it I pointed out to me that that's just another addiction and that when I eat a lot it. It makes me feel calm and good inside for a little bit, man. It's a problem later on.

94
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.250
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

95
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have you guys started working

96
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your steps, yet I know we talked about this, what

97
00:08:52.050 --> 00:09:01.200
Donna Jochimsen: We've worked. I she's been my sponsor actually for a long time. And we've actually worked the steps probably three or four times together.

98
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.240
Donna Jochimsen: I she's after me to start again and I have not started yet.

99
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:15.960
Donna Jochimsen: But I will like she said, every time you do it. Something new comes out and gain more knowledge about yourself. So I'll do it again.

100
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, because, you know, the doctor like see here

101
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was going on with

102
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.560
Donna Jochimsen: No, and

103
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:41.400
Donna Jochimsen: I know, Dan, and she's right. I've done, I've done, I've done them four times, but three times with her and and she's right every time I do them little more comes out something new pops up to think about. So it's a good exercise. It's

104
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.930
Donna Jochimsen: Kind of hard for me.

105
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:52.110
Donna Jochimsen: When I get to the to the part of you know about real realizing what you've done to others and and making them and it's hard for me because that

106
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.470
Donna Jochimsen: Makes it kind of takes me back to the guilt that I that I can feel about it.

107
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.040
Yeah.

108
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:15.180
Donna Jochimsen: just remembering the all those things going over them again makes me feel terrible. I mean, I, I, my kids were okay but I was a heroin addict. I wasn't there for them emotionally like I should have been

109
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:23.400
Donna Jochimsen: They'll try to tell me. Yeah, but you're a good mom. And I'm like, but but but I wasn't there for you all the time.

110
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

111
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.490
So,

112
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:38.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's two separate. I mean, you can robotically get up and and be there and take care of them physically their physical needs in there. You know what I mean, but

113
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.980
Donna Jochimsen: They're like

114
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, is totally different.

115
00:10:44.220 --> 00:11:00.330
Donna Jochimsen: me a long time to realize that I always said to myself, well, I always said clothes took care of my kids to them where they needed to be. And I did do all of those things. But I was emotionally unavailable. Yeah.

116
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the part that they don't get yeah

117
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or something.

118
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.400
Donna Jochimsen: I didn't get it at the time.

119
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And some, you know, some recognize it, but some dumb, you know,

120
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's your communication with your kids right now.

121
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.840
Donna Jochimsen: Really good. It's really good.

122
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:39.450
Donna Jochimsen: I think I've talked to everybody. This week I spent time at my middle daughter's house on Saturday night about three hours and I really happy about that relationship. That was my hardest one in 2003 I was having so much problems with with my addiction that

123
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:54.270
Donna Jochimsen: My counselor actually talked to my family about going to Ukiah to the Methadone clinic there at the time, they didn't have Suboxone came out I think just it became available down there right before I left, but

124
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:01.080
Donna Jochimsen: And there is no methadone clinic where I live, but I was unable to get off of heroin so

125
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:10.230
Donna Jochimsen: My family agreed and I went to Ukiah lived in a little small hotel, sort of like an apartment or a little cabin.

126
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:21.090
Donna Jochimsen: And I, they wanted me to stay for a year. And I said, I did stay for a year. I didn't use I I did really good, but

127
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.540
Donna Jochimsen: My middle daughter really

128
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:32.610
Donna Jochimsen: resented me for that I wasn't she probably was 14 at the time and

129
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:40.830
Donna Jochimsen: I left you know and that really bothered her. I thought I was doing a, you know, for a good reason.

130
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.150
Donna Jochimsen: And that I will. I didn't need to do something for sure, but

131
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.920
Donna Jochimsen: She had really hard feelings about that.

132
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.350
Donna Jochimsen: That I didn't realize I knew, I knew she was really rebellious. I knew that we didn't get along very well, but I

133
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:09.360
Donna Jochimsen: Did not know I you know I, I just, I really didn't think of it because I thought I'm going to the Methadone clinic getting off of heroin. This is a good thing for my kids, but

134
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.350
Donna Jochimsen: Just being absent from her life for a year.

135
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really her time. Yeah.

136
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.070
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

137
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so things have gotten better.

138
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now that she's talking

139
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:30.060
Donna Jochimsen: She, she talked to me about it. You know, I didn't realize that that was what the problem was. And yeah, things have gotten a lot better.
