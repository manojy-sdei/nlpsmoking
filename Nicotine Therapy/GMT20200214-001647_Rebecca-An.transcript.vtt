Michelle: Hanging in here.

3
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's everything going

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.950
Michelle: Same really trying to figure out what to do.

5
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Still haven't gotten any decisions made and or option opportunities.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.390
Well,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.310
Michelle: I mean,

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.850
Michelle: We're pretty much like I mean we've already talked to, like, HUD. And we've already talked to the DHS office and they

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.360
Michelle: They want us to put in like a 30 day notice with HUD. And then we have to be up there and wait for an interview and

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:56.400
Michelle: Wait for, I guess them to get all their paperwork and everything in order for us to be able to find like a HUD approved place but they they told us, like what's going to, it could be a while so we have to either have somewhere to stay in the meantime, or

11
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.430
Michelle: You know. So as of right now the way that it's looking. We're going to be living out of our van for a while, unless we can figure out like

12
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.250
Michelle: A room to rent or something.

13
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.380
Michelle: I don't know.

14
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

15
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What area where you move into

16
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.070
Michelle: We were looking to me to Coos Bay. My father is pressuring me really badly in order for us to even get the van. He wants us to move to Tuesday.

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.870
Michelle: And we're in Crescent City, California right now. So it's a good like two and a half, three hour drive from where we are.

18
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a completely different state. Yeah.

19
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they want you to put a 30 day notice and with hadn't California

20
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.740
Michelle: And then we got our 90 day eviction here. So we literally have for until March 31

21
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.240
Michelle: To be out of where we are right now.

22
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And there's no way that they can expedite the process in Oregon.

23
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.000
Michelle: Know,

24
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you don't have any place to stay in Oregon. Your dad. You can't say with your dad.

25
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:21.570
Michelle: My dad is a slacker. And he lives out of his van that he just bought to give me his old van and when he's off on his days off. He says, with my grandparents who stays with his mom stepped out but

26
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.240
Michelle: We can't stay there.

27
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.090
Michelle: We just

28
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: stuck between a rock and a hard space.

29
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.090
Michelle: Yeah, I mean, because like just here where we are. There's, there's

30
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.640
Michelle: Every, every like HUD DHS every person that we've talked to just keep saying good luck. There's just nothing available in our area right now.

31
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.140
You know,

32
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what, why, can I ask why you got an eviction notice

33
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:16.020
Michelle: They never gave us a reason. AND WHEN THEY HANDED MY FIANCE the paperwork on it. All he had to say was, because we're us rich people looked down upon people like you, what our neighbors. It's there's there's four units here and our neighbors on to end behind us and

34
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.300
Michelle: Worked with the owners are friends with the owners and

35
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.130
Michelle: Oh, back in October, I think it was

36
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:39.390
Michelle: She came over the owner Christian she came over and she had told me that my next door neighbor here right on the other side of this wall complained that we were blasting our music at 6am

37
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:52.350
Michelle: And and number one on the end said that there were creepy people coming to my house. Nobody comes to my house and my child isn't even up at 6am

38
00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.300
Michelle: I wouldn't even be blessed my music at 16 and we've been here for two years now. So it's like

39
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:19.710
Michelle: You know, honestly, I really don't know. They from the moment we met them. They've always been extremely judgmental that we had another unit where we were before we moved in here. They had purchased while we were living there. We were a year in there and when

40
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:34.680
Michelle: they purchased it, they moved us here because it was a two bedroom and where we were at was just a small one bedroom and in the beginning, they were all nice and they were all friendly towards us, but we were having problems with an issue of with a woman upstairs, who was

41
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.700
Michelle: locked out of her mind on on speed and just

42
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.670
Michelle: Crazy like she was crazy. Like, she would like literally harass me for no reason. Just to harass me and her

43
00:04:48.930 --> 00:05:05.880
Michelle: Boyfriend assaulted my guy for putting his hand in, but she got my face. One day, as I was sitting on our porch, smoking a cigarette, minding my own business, she got in my face. And he put his arm in between us and she tried to say that he pushed her when he didn't

44
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:18.600
Michelle: And the cops were called and her dude like just came up out of nowhere, running Adam and just soft my dude in the face and the cops came and they arrested her guy. And ever since then. She's just like,

45
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.990
Michelle: It doesn't matter if I'm just my back is to or whatever, like she was just an internet, you know, and

46
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:37.080
Michelle: So when they bought the place they moved us over here, not just because they were the process of evicting them and things were just escalating and getting worse. So we were we've qualified for a bigger place so they moved us to here.

47
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:54.030
Michelle: And then after we moved here. We had no problems whatsoever until the people next door moved in and number one moved in and they're just, you know, they're just judgmental people, you know, like, I mean we're not rich, you know, we're just

48
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.550
Michelle: Average people you know and and i'm sure

49
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.410
Michelle: You know,

50
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:15.390
Michelle: The world is getting crazy people are frickin just being judgmental and and it's it's getting to be scary. You know, like when I mean we literally have not done anything wrong. I mean,

51
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.500
Michelle: My dad drives a Harley sometimes, and he shows up in this do rag and, you know, and this bike and

52
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.900
Michelle: They called my dad creepy went before they even knew he was my dad, you know, so it's just like who are you to judge who's creepy and who's not. You know, like

53
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:41.520
Michelle: Yeah, there's yeah my dad's a contractor and he flags and they have like my brother's a fisherman, you know, so we just like

54
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.530
Michelle: They're just completely different kinds of people like you could just tell by the way that the address and the way that they drive you know just

55
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.110
Michelle: Yeah, you know, and we're just

56
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.600
Michelle: Same thing with the owner

57
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.040
Michelle: There that

58
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And no, there's no talking to the owner about giving you

59
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

60
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:13.710
Michelle: Now she's I watched what she did. There's, there's a lot more involved. You know, because she was super nice and friendly in the beginning and

61
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.180
Michelle: She had another girl that was unheard over on history and I mean I know she had her reasons and stuff. And we don't

62
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:30.300
Michelle: The reasons were completely different, but she made quite a lot of comments about like not dealing with her anymore, but was like, Oh, but you guys wrote, you guys are different, you know, and

63
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:41.070
Michelle: She just kept making a lot of comments about not wanting to deal with HUD anymore. And we're the only other were the only people left. She kicked out everybody else over there and moved her son in and

64
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:52.080
Michelle: Yeah, so when they remodeled, the one over here, they, they did they put in foreground counter crops. I mean, they just kind of like cater to like the

65
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.080
Michelle: You know, it's hard to explain, really.

66
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You. I get it.

67
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.440
Michelle: You're on live it like

68
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.390
Michelle: You know,

69
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's the only way you're going to believe what I'm really going through unless you're living it to right and how has everything else been going. I mean, that's a big stressor, but

70
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.690
Michelle: You know anything

71
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:20.910
Michelle: Else is I'm working on my schoolwork. I stay home a lot. I really don't go anywhere we go for walks to the store to the park or whatnot, you know,

72
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.480
Michelle: While the weather's unclear little bit here.

73
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.980
Michelle: I've just been staying home and trying to

74
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.560
Michelle: Hack all this up.

75
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to figure it out.

76
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.610
Michelle: Yeah, my dad. My dad.

77
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.850
Michelle: Yeah, I mean, he's made some promises and my dad's made promises in the past, and he never fulfilled. He's never fulfilled.

78
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.740
Michelle: And

79
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:55.140
Michelle: Really really hoping like he's he's going to give us that man because at least we have the van to fall back on, you know, and I mean it's going to be summertime. You know, like

80
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:01.530
Michelle: If anything, we can go camp on the frickin riverbed or kept the beach, you know, we're going to be camping all summer.

81
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.220
Michelle: You know cuz I am

82
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so just so that I have some clarity on this whole thing you've already contacted or again head.

83
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.880
Michelle: Yeah, we have to

84
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.560
Michelle: We haven't contacted the Oregon HUD yet. My dad is going to help me out with a storage unit for all of my stuff.

85
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.490
Okay.

86
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:41.610
Michelle: We have to be a resident of Oregon to in order to get on their state assistance in the HUD and all that we have to be a resident of Oregon. We have to be able to prove that were a resident of Oregon.

87
00:09:43.260 --> 00:10:02.370
Michelle: Going to be residents and in order for them, like California. It's like a whole drawn out process of like a whole like I guess I've been I'm guessing a month because they want California to be like cancel the state assistance that we get for here and then

88
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.460
Michelle: Started up in Oregon. But the way that like it's paid you know

89
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:24.270
Michelle: Yeah, we're waiting till March to give our 30 days because that's, you know, after you know the first of March, that's when our threads, you know, is that, and we don't want to like

90
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.940
Michelle: And

91
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know

92
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.760
Michelle: You know, like, cuz I know HUD still paying the rent.

93
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.350
Michelle: So, okay, you are a citizen in Oregon, we would have to be responsible.

94
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.240
Michelle: For the complete rent here.

95
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.960
Michelle: Right. You know, like it's, it's, yeah.

96
00:10:44.160 --> 00:11:03.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, um, I moved down. He moved from Oregon to California and what I know is that when you go in after you put your 30 day notice in and you go in and sign up for housing. Housing down there and you let them know that you're homeless.

97
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that

98
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have to transfer to Oregon because you're closer to your dad, but you don't have any place to stay, makes up for you know sleeping in a van I'm

99
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry. Nice. Appreciate it. Anyways, that kind of puts you as a priority on their list in Oregon.

100
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So once you put your 30 day notice in here in California, you know,

101
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would start the process and Oregon and what they mean by a resident is, you know, when you get your driver's license. Here, you got to take in like two pieces of mail right put something in in the mail.

102
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To your dad.

103
00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, kind of put his name and then your name underneath it and that establishes residency.

104
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Having that mail through the Postal Service and it can't be an empty envelope. Don't send an empty envelope. I found that out the hard way, you know,

105
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do know that you know it's going to take a little bit of work. But once you guys do.

106
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Start the process in California, you know, the faster that you get everything applied for an Oregon, the faster. You're going to come up on the list to

107
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:46.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Write and there's other programs to that Oregon has for this kind of thing. So, you know, just make sure that you're asking, asking them, what else is available. How else can I get help in this way, and see you know what they have to offer. And every county is kind of different, and

108
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The county that you're not on probation or anything.

109
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.180
No.

110
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:52.950
Michelle: No.

111
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right.

112
00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's another in Oregon. Anyways, that's another in into

113
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Housing short term housing.

114
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's what I know about Oregon is that once you get your, your stuff, put in here in California immediately start the process over there and get your paperwork submitted get you know that the proof of address you know from your

115
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Send it to your data ahead of time. You know what I mean, so that you have all these things ready and just start doing you know the process. The great part about it is it's going to be the end of March, beginning of April, the weather's getting ready to change.

116
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things are going to get a little bit warmer, thank God.

117
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's

118
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:55.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that piece to and pay attention. You have the internet. So start paying attention to places, you know, short term rooms for rent. You know, the people are always, you know, wanting to sublet a bedroom.

119
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and you can explain your situation, it's you three right yeah you're you. Your boyfriend and baby, yeah.

120
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:17.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just, you know, let them know what your situation is and what it is that you can afford to pay you know put towards rent and, you know, there's another option for you and just something to explore

121
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, yeah.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.450
Michelle: always forgive me.

138
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sean now.

139
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.280
Sean

140
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: John

141
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.830
Michelle: JOHN. JOHN. JOHN

142
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. I was just wondering, we have to change our appointment time I have somebody else that

143
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has been putting it putting a slot. As a matter of fact, I haven't seen you in a couple weeks is so I was

144
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: WHEN THEY SHOULD WE DO popped up. I was like a Michelle. Michelle Oh god. MICHELLE. MICHELLE. Very good. Kimmy respectable, you know, because I hadn't seen you in a couple weeks. I was like, I hope she's okay

145
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and that things are going along nicely for you.

146
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.070
Michelle: Yeah, they're they're working. I'm trying to be hopeful and not

147
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.270
Michelle: Just. It's just a lot of stress.

148
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is a lot of stress. But here's the thing. Okay.

149
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember, a couple things that you're in a complete transition in your life right now you're getting ready to move from one state to the other and that alone is stressful.

150
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and then

151
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not knowing what exactly it's going to look like when you do make that transition

152
00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is stressful again.

153
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what I know Michelle is that if you

154
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oregon is a lot. It's been my experience that Oregon is a lot easier to deal with and work with then California as far as

155
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, getting help in different areas.

156
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:25.140
Michelle: I've heard that too, actually. And I'm hoping that that's true because

157
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:40.530
Michelle: Around here. They just, they don't they don't do anything like to really help you. I mean, I learned that when I was pregnant with the RIAA you know they just they leave yet, you know, whatever's available that comes up first. I mean,

158
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.380
Michelle: There's no him.

159
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:52.050
Michelle: I know it's it's good. I just, I have a lot of other additional stress added to it to

160
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:59.670
Michelle: To be able to even drive the van, you know, because I and then just

161
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:07.050
Michelle: Let me know mean my father. I mean, he's he's told me like he's willing to help me out. But I just

162
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.800
Michelle: Yeah, I'm really worried. I really am. I'm going to end up with nothing like I always I always do and

163
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.020
Michelle: Then

164
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he's promised you things in the past and then hasn't followed through.

165
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:34.440
Michelle: Oh yeah that's that's that's what happened when we moved up here when we moved up it will be very first moved up here. We did talk to me and to help me out. He was, he said he was going to get a vehicle.

166
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:52.650
Michelle: And he was going to help me get a vehicle so so I could get a job you know and and any ad is gonna help me with a place to stay. Well, in the very beginning. He had me staying with my with his cousin, they mean, I guess, like what my, my first cousin or second cousin.

167
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:10.950
Michelle: And she was, she was an alcoholic. But just like had some issues like bad like that where I was staying was in their shed with no insulation, no nothing. And, and, you know, just a bunch of like it's

168
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:27.240
Michelle: I was I was by myself time Alex hadn't come up from Arizona yet, but I was by myself and he was he was working, and he had paid my his cousin to have me sleep in her shed with

169
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:47.310
Michelle: A portal. I mean, it was, it's just a piece of property in the in the boonies that she's got her fifth wheel trailer on but there there's there's no shower. There's no toilet, you got to use the porta potty. And I didn't have like anywhere. That was really like stable or warm, but

170
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.680
Michelle: His, His thing was, he was going to get me a van where I could sleep in my band.

171
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.790
Michelle: Like him and just hang out with him while he's at work kind of thing and

172
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:09.000
Michelle: Get a job and there's no excuse of why I can't get a job and save money. If I've got a vehicle that's completely paid for and you know I'm able to get to and from work, blah, blah, blah.

173
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:17.130
Michelle: And this is like same mentality right now is he's going to give me this vehicle and there should be no reason why I am, which is all

174
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:25.230
Michelle: True and everything, you know, like either there would be no reason for me not to be a job like get a job. That's not the issue.

175
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:35.400
Michelle: The issue is, is, is he going to do what he says he's going to do because he's not just promised me the band. He's promised me that he's going to put all my stuff in storage.

176
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:45.660
Michelle: And these promised me that he would pay the first month insurance on the van. He would pay for the first month's rent on the storage unit and and

177
00:20:46.800 --> 00:21:03.420
Michelle: That's, that's just a lot for me to, I mean him never following through on anything that he's ever said you know and and he he left. That's how we ended up homeless. To begin with, was because of him. We were all sleeping in his van and we, you know, like

178
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:13.500
Michelle: In his truck at the time when we very first moved up here after Alex would come up here and the band and the place where I was staying there had fallen through

179
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:24.210
Michelle: He didn't want to fix the van, or what he had gotten two vans one with a bad transmission and one something or other. Will you fix the van that you bought for himself.

180
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:35.790
Michelle: But never fix the other van that he bought for me and said he was going to fix and blah, blah, blah, blah. So we got into a huge argument over it because we were all living in his truck.

181
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:50.190
Michelle: And he left. He left my my my guy and I homeless up in Florence Oregon with nothing but the our suitcases and my dog and we hitchhiked all the way down.

182
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:58.950
Michelle: Here city where I had a friend who was graciously and kind enough to let me shower and do some laundry like once a month.

183
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.110
Michelle: You know, and

184
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:10.890
Michelle: We found out I was pregnant with the RIAA and and that kind of speed things up a little bit, but

185
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:26.310
Michelle: Not, not really by much like we we were by the skin of, like, I mean, just before like like a couple months before I get a I had her is when we finally found and got into that place.

186
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:27.780
Michelle: But

187
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:30.810
Yeah.

188
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:38.820
Michelle: When I was out there. I mean I had been, you know, we think we started in May.

189
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:47.730
Michelle: Where we filed for, you know, caches and housing. It was we started in May. We didn't get into a place until

190
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.890
Michelle: October, November.

191
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.360
Michelle: And I had a worry I had her in January.

192
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.840
Michelle: So like we were out there for a long time.

193
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.700
Michelle: Like just waiting for something to come available waiting on the waiting list.

194
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

195
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.650
You know,

196
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:16.560
Michelle: So, I mean, I am I'm worried about that too. You know, I, you know, because they tell you it's not illegal to be homeless with your kid, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I mean, even if it, you know, we're just

197
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:23.310
Michelle: Being hippies for the summer camp and, you know, or whatever, it's, it's, they still looked down upon it, you know, they say it's not

198
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:36.780
Michelle: Illegal but it's, it is still technically because if somebody calls CPS on your whatever, and they come out and how you bathe in your kid every day. How you feed their the food every day. You know when you you know

199
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

200
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:48.630
Michelle: You know, the year you're unfit you're not providing quality, whatever, whatever. What they deem quality, even though you know i mean i mean shit.

201
00:23:50.580 --> 00:24:01.710
Michelle: It tell you the way I grew up and it would be a lot worse than camping in the back of the van on the beach or the or the river for the summer and tell mom, you know, makes enough money to be able to get into a place

202
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.360
Michelle: Because I am I that's that's that's the plan to is

203
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.620
Michelle: I'm not, I'm not going to sit out there and and

204
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.540
Michelle: Wait.

205
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:29.370
Michelle: I mean, because I'm if I had the money, I'm sure I could be able to get into a place without having to, you know, rely on the state to they're waiting lists or whatever, find something that accepts the HUD or whatever.

206
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.940
Michelle: You know i'm not i don't i don't want to. I can't wait that long.

207
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:49.710
Michelle: Yeah. Stay isn't like going to step up. Then I'm going to have to, like, step up, you know, and part of, like, getting the schooling done is being able to like have my diploma and there would be absolutely no reason because I have over 10 years experience as an in home caregiver.

208
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:58.650
Michelle: I just don't have my diploma. I have certificates of classes and courses that I took in Arizona and worked at Seaview

209
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:10.920
Michelle: In Oregon that when I was living up there and Brookings with my grandparents property before they sold it. I had a job, you know, like it's just we've been back and forth with them.

210
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:20.550
Michelle: Just trying to stay closer to my son, like we've been back and forth from Arizona to Oregon last since 20 2014

211
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:32.550
Michelle: Living like my grandparents. Oh, my dad, he's going to help me out. We're going to live up on the property. Oh, we sold the property. Gotta go. Daddy's gotta go. That's got to figure out what he's going to do, I'm on my own now,

212
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.680
Michelle: It's like I always get left on your on your own. But when he needs help, they step up.

213
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

214
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.550
Michelle: They take they completely take care of everything.

215
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.070
Michelle: You know, like, I mean,

216
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.000
Michelle: Yeah, they're

217
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.510
Michelle: My uncle is a millionaire.

218
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.790
Michelle: And he pays for the house, but they pay like the bills of the house. You know, like

219
00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:03.270
Michelle: Electric and whatnot, whatever, and they have they're both retired from IBM so they have a retirement pension which is like four or five grand. Each a month.

220
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:12.330
Michelle: Just direct deposit. I mean, so my grandparent has, like, I mean, they've got like $50,000 stashed in the bank, like they've got money, they just sold

221
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:20.400
Michelle: The property 25 acres. So it's not like like that. And then when I say they do everything from my father, they do.

222
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:31.080
Michelle: If he needs 1000 2000 doesn't matter how much he just paid $6,000 for a boat. He just bought. He just paid

223
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:45.210
Michelle: I don't even know it was like 20 grand he owed left on his Harley and he borrowed. I mean, he's paid it all back over time because he makes good money.

224
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:56.580
Michelle: But his entire life. I mean like before we move like that because how will like I got in, like, my grandparents have lived up in Brookings Oregon since

225
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.390
Michelle: The mid 90s. I WANT TO SAY MID 90s, early 90s.

226
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.730
Michelle: When they first retired.

227
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:07.980
Michelle: And

228
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.090
Michelle: Like, that's how I got associated with Oregon and whatnot. But I, you know,

229
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:29.910
Michelle: They bought a house for my dad literally bought him a house, and when he was divorcing when he found out his first wife cheated and all that and he he he moved. He moved us to Oregon him and I

230
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:31.920
Michelle: And

231
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:46.050
Michelle: I mean literally vehicle. They paid for it vehicle needs to be fixed. They paid for it, they've paid for everything up until this point in time. Like, even though he's working if he wants something

232
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:53.400
Michelle: We get they give him like they literally given the money but anytime. I've ever need help. It's like

233
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.070
Michelle: We're you again like yeah

234
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.180
Michelle: You know,

235
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just got to be frustrating.

236
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.430
Michelle: It is. It's extremely frustrating it is, you know, because I i

237
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:14.460
Michelle: When I was pregnant with the RIAA you know i i had. It was a heat. Like, I mean it's kind of

238
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:23.550
Michelle: Hard for me, too, because I couldn't find it a mall. You can find it, the mall. When I was pregnant with the RIAA when my dad left me homeless. This

239
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.710
Michelle: In what two years ago now to two and a half years ago.

240
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.170
Michelle: Going on three

241
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:41.610
Michelle: I you know I you know I told them every like I just unloaded on him. You know you cater to him, you know, and here I am pregnant and I'm not, you know, like

242
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:56.310
Michelle: not asking for anything for free. I'm just asking for a little bit of help you know and and and I, when I mentioned the pole. My dad's situation with the money and whatnot, you know, her husband bill.

243
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:07.320
Michelle: He's been in and, you know, the kids is like my dad, my uncle two uncles. He's been in their lives, since they were young teenage boys, but you never had kids zone.

244
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:18.300
Michelle: And he's always been super, super green. So he and my grandparents. I've had issues over the years with my grandmother giving my father all the money. So just this last

245
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.930
Michelle: I think two, three years ago because they

246
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.040
Michelle: Oh, it was like

247
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:39.150
Michelle: I want to say like six, seven months after a riot was born. My grandmother like went off the cuckoo's nest and

248
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:52.680
Michelle: Their doctor to grow for meds and she shared bipolar meds and cold turkey and she just went completely manic and bonkers, and they had me come in to try to help her.

249
00:29:53.550 --> 00:30:02.580
Michelle: You know, because I have all the experiences the caregiver, they had me they would that we read, we all reconciled because obviously we had gotten into a place I had to ask my

250
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.810
Michelle: Dad for my stuff.

251
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:11.130
Michelle: You know, so I had to like reconcile that relationship to get my stuff back because we had finally gotten into a place, but

252
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.730
Michelle: I confronted him about it. Just as when I was pregnant when I was homeless and

253
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:26.310
Michelle: It was they they separated their money. So Bill has his money and she has her money and

254
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:34.770
Michelle: She gives them money on the side, and he borrows the money and borrowed more money from Bill, but he has to pay bill off.

255
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.340
Michelle: And doesn't have to pay my grandmother off.

256
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.640
Michelle: It's kind of weird.

257
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Situation. So

258
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, he's not willing to borrow money to help you get settled.

259
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, no. So another thing to consider too is

260
00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't forget about community action up there too. They usually have programs that will help with

261
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With housing and resources as well.

262
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I know have a place in McMinnville, Oregon. Do you know where McMinnville is

263
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like

264
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where's my friend. Oh, kind of on the outskirts of Portland.

265
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's a little bit farther up, but I do know that of this program up there that does

266
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Provide housing to help you get on your feet.

267
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And help you access resources in the community to be able to get a place and be able to have a safe place.

268
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The only different. The only thing that is kind of screwed Bali about it is that you and

269
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:56.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a men's house and women's house so your partner would be in a men's house and you would be

270
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:08.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the women's house with the baby. But that's an option too short term until you guys can tell you can get a job or you guys can pull together and get the resources to be able to get us a place for

271
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: FOR YOU GUYS TO BE BACK, YOU KNOW, together, you wouldn't be like separated you just be sleeping separate, you know, in the short term. I mean, I know of that program. So if you're interested, I can give you that information.

272
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:36.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just I'm telling you, Michelle. Just start really diving in and looking in the area that you're planning on going. And if that's not an option. Expand out your, your area a little bit

273
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see what resources are available, the more work you do on the front end while you're you've got a little bit a few weeks. You know, before you have to go and the more resources, you're going to be able to come up with and

274
00:32:52.980 --> 00:33:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The less stress. It'll also help you reduce your stress because you're actually working towards, you know, a resolution so that you don't have the stress of being homeless. You don't have to depend on your dad, you'll be able to find the resources that you need.

275
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do it you know do it in a safe way that you and the baby and your partner have safe places to go.

276
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

277
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's

278
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just an option to think about, you know,

279
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

280
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's see, what else asked all start thinking of different

281
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Different things and I can certainly do some research with the people that I know in Oregon, to see if there are resources that I don't know about that. I can be. Are you towards to see about

282
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Helping you

283
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.430
Michelle: Yeah okay I

284
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.490
Michelle: I'm hoping he will come to me because like

285
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:03.420
Michelle: I there's so much shit. I don't even I, there's no way I'd have to

286
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:14.790
Michelle: It has to go and storage in it. Otherwise, any one of them. I can't, I can't get rid of it all. I can't sell it all. I can't keep anything, you know, aside from

287
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.200
Michelle: You know backpack of clothes and

288
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So one step at a time. Okay. I mean, you can really take the scenario with your dad and and make it as as the goal, the option to get this van and for him to follow through with getting your storage in it.

289
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know and do the things that he's promised you, but the history shows that he has he struggles with coming through.

290
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so if you think about it in that realm, instead of sitting in the fear that he won't come through start really exploring yourself start looking at other options and other directions that you can go yourself.

291
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That can help you feel a little bit more secure in this whole process.

292
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.810
Michelle: You know, because I just

293
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See it, I can see it on your face. I'll tell you what I what I think you do, and you correct me from wrong, but most lately. Most of your day is consumed with the fear of him falling short.

294
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.210
Yeah.

295
00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that

296
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:41.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That doesn't, you know, that doesn't help that doesn't solve solve problems that it actually raises your anxiety, you know, makes you know things for you a lot more harder. So if you explore these other options and have a game. Another game plan in place.

297
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For your family you and your family, then you'll have a little bit of security under your belt. Does that make sense.

298
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.890
Yeah.

299
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.730
Michelle: Yeah, so I'm the only

300
00:35:53.970 --> 00:36:03.300
Michelle: The only other option really to be would would be to hopefully either me because we're putting in applications here locally to to just kind of

301
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find another place had house.

302
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Just keep your keep, you know, keep your options open.

303
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. But, you know, if you're either, you know, walking in fear, you're walking in faith, right.

304
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:31.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you're walking in fear your nerves are on edge. You know, you're not present for your family, you're there, but you're not there, because you're focused on, you know, what am I going to do

305
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:46.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take breathers of it. Allow yourself not to think about it for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. And I know that's sounds impossible, but I'm telling you the relief of the anxiety, for it will definitely feel feel better.

306
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But would you be willing to what about do they have Community action in California.

307
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:03.060
Michelle: I know I don't know I'm honestly never heard of anything around here that helps you like glue and

308
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So take a look at it in in the area that you're planning on moving. Okay.

309
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do some research and let's see what you can come up with. All right. Yeah.

310
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And. Okay, so I have to change our time that we meet

311

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm, you know, I'm going to express that are, I'm going to ask that you also pay attention to, you know, your self care and what you're putting in your body as far as food goes and that you're getting enough sleep because this is such a stressful time

329
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of times we lose our appetite. We're not sleeping really well and it really kind of throws everything that we're working on off kilter.

330
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.890
And so

331
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.890
