00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.589
Angelina C: Be waiting, but I've been here.

2
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.460
Okay.

3
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, Angie. I'm glad you're here today. Thank you. I am. I've got a little issue here. So I am. I've got to be able to eat. So if you would just allow me to. I've got to eat or I won't make it the rest of the day.

4
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.940
Angelina C: That's fine.

5
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm while I'm doing that.

6
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know if maybe some context in your life has changed. Are you still working. You're still living the same place just kind of update me a little bit.

7
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.810
Angelina C: Okay. Um, let's see. I'll kind of go back to last week because we missed yesterday's group and everything's been going, Okay, I think I hit menopause. So this is no fun.

8
00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.870
Angelina C: The sicknesses. They wanted me to go get because I had a doctor's appointment Tuesday. They didn't want me going, and because of the lupus. But I told them, since I'm

9
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.290
Angelina C: In the public eye, anyway.

10
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.290
Angelina C: My symptoms have been like this for like three weeks, but it's allergies. We've come to conclusions, but Tuesday, they, they told me I need to call the hotline and go get tested for it so

11
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:28.020
Angelina C: That's what I've been doing. And then just work has been doing a lot better. It's just menopause. Now, and it really sucks. I'm not. I never sweat. So to me, sweating is just

12
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.580
Angelina C: So I don't

13
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me understand you're sweating and so who's asking you to get tested and for what okay

14
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.560
Angelina C: My doctor my regular primary

15
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:54.660
Angelina C: Asked me to go guess because of my cough and the field that I work in sheet. We have a clinic here. I've been sitting on the hotline. For the last two days.

16
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:06.270
Angelina C: To see to go get tested. So she just said that I call them. This is a thing I call them, tell them my symptoms and stuff. What I've been having for the last three weeks.

17
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:17.190
Angelina C: And it just the cough, the chills. The sweat. But I'm a lot of it was allergies that was causing my sickness, like the cold part like my runny nose and stuff.

18
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.840
Angelina C: And so she just told me to call the hotline, which we can't get through on and then they'll tell me if I have to go get a test done for it. The coronavirus

19
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.170
Angelina C: So that's what I've been doing. So that's pretty much it. And then nothing else has really changed. Everything's been doing really good since work.

20
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.380
Angelina C: I've they've kind of switched our schedule around so I do like a day shift. So like on I wrote down my hours for you because like, Monday, Tuesday, I'm off.

21
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:56.520
Angelina C: This next week, but on Wednesday, I get to do a day shift from nine to two. So that's kind of cool. I'm kind of excited to try that and then Thursday I just do a two to six so

22
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.050
Angelina C: I like the way it's going now. I like it. It's not as stressful at work, but let me think. What else was there. Um, I was going to tell you

23
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's also see I'm at some point, I'll be able to turn my video on. Let's see if we can get yours to work.

24
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours.

25
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.760
Angelina C: I don't. Yeah, my I have my do not disturb sign on. I don't know. You were there first.

26
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like you to do is I'd like to try and press the Start video button.

27
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.620
Angelina C: Now, they just blocked you out.

28
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: No, actually, there's no

29
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.850
Angelina C: There you are.

30
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

31
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.710
Angelina C: And you see me.

32
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.450
Angelina C: Okay, and I still put my Do Not Disturb and then it kind of comes through and it just goes real low

33
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.270
Angelina C: But um yeah I know things are going good. My husband's going to try to come home for three days.

34
00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:06.240
Angelina C: This week because of the oil fields. He was real stressed out that they were going to lose their jobs, but there's always work. So he knows he's not going to lose his job. So that's a good thing. But he'll be home Monday for the first time in a couple months. So we'll see how that goes.

35
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.770
Angelina C: I think that's pretty much everything else has been going okay um

36
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it impacted you hearing that you are being asked to be tested. You sound calm. Is that how it feels.

37
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:34.410
Angelina C: Um, no, um, I kind of was getting this the header explain. I was already getting the symptoms, um, of it before this even started.

38
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:50.430
Angelina C: People on my nose and stuff. So they. It was just allergies and I haven't been able to get an allergy shot. And so when she told me I kind of had a clue because everybody at our work has already been sick prior to this kinda but since we've had so many travelers in and out.

39
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.930
Angelina C: To me honestly going. Last year we lost so many of our clients last year. That's one reason I'm not nursing anymore.

40
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.870
Angelina C: I lost almost all my clients last year to the flu. So literally almost shut our company down because we've lost so many patients last year.

41
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:23.760
Angelina C: So to me, that's one reason I got out of the nursing, because it was just real, it took a toll on me last year. So this year, to me it just feels like a bad flu epidemic. Again, honestly. So to me, I'm not in a panic over it being in the nursing. So to me, I'm not too worried about it.

42
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.020
Angelina C: And like I said, with the sweating and stuff I i

43
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.790
Angelina C: Took a

44
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:42.600
Angelina C: Energy thing the other day energy drink little thing and it screwed me up my hormones, everything went to whack. Now, I guess that's what they're thinking. It's just, I'm in a pause now so

45
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Energy thing. Are you saying an energy drink.

46
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.310
Angelina C: Yes, and

47
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection between an energy drink and your hormonal balance.

48
00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.430
Angelina C: It feels like that. That's what it feels like triggered it because I was kicking black cars for like two months there before I got on my car accident.

49
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:11.430
Angelina C: And then after that I just quit taking that the sweats and everything went away, but it came back now. So I think it just like the stuff we're off for so long after taking it.

50
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:21.510
Angelina C: Still, but yeah, now I'm it's just the the the sweat and chills like I'll wake up in the middle of the night soaking wet this growth.

51
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.420
Angelina C: And I don't sweat. I don't anymore. DEAL, MAN.

52
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:43.500
Angelina C: So that's what's yucky for me. But other than that, it doesn't really worry too much, but that's just because of the nursing field. And what I've been through already so I don't know if we can find a place to set down the fun. I'm super good find someplace to set

53
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You can find somewhere that has maybe maybe can bring your eye level to mine so you

54
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.870
Angelina C: See if I can do that over here. I might be able to do that right here.

55
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.870
Angelina C: Or something maybe

56
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.920
Angelina C: Are you doing

57
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Mike, I was hungry. I'm still hungry. My ears are congested. So I'm having to tilt my

58
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.180
Head, so I apologize behavior.

59
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.990
Angelina C: Are you scared of getting

60
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.980
Angelina C: Not really.

61
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I think a good way to put it is sort of a relaxed vigilance I've made myself the point person that goes shopping. I'll go to the pharmacy. I'm the one in the family that

62
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The same shoes from the supermarket into the house. So since I'm that person I've decided I'm better suited because of my personality.

63
00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For that I will be mindful of it where other people won't think of it. So I've decided that for my self and protecting my family that I'm probably best suited for that so far.

64
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Today was a difficult day there was some resistance around probably some good ideas but most days we've been in isolation. Actually, no one's gone outside. No one's visiting friends we all are hunkered down and then I going to go out and get some get some food and

65
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: People are going online. They're going to school online. And so, schools, about to restart for two of them.

66
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: On Monday, one college student is already online all all this week. So we're just life goes on my life barely changes. In fact, I'm doing more shopping and i was i basically was a to go anywhere. And I was home all the time.

67
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.740
Angelina C: Do you work out of your home.

68
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.910
Angelina C: Yeah, where you're like, you get to it. Oh, how nice. That's nice. What it looks like an office. That's why I say it looks real pretty like

69
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:57.810
Yes.

70
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

71
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:10.200
Angelina C: Oh, that's nice. So that's real nice. So at least you get to work out at home. Yeah. No, I'm not in like even some people come in like you're not wearing gloves. You're not wearing a mask but

72
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.530
Angelina C: And the other reason is me being a high risk being that I have lupus. They were real worried about it.

73
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:29.880
Angelina C: But the way my body feels. The only thing I'm going through is heat flashes like I'll start burning up sweating and then I get called but that I can. I'll go get Coco. Somebody told me they all natural cocoa and it's a teaspoon of it you take, it's a natural

74
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: The 45 would be quite young to be going through even early menopause. What makes you think that's what it is that your doctor kind of think so.

75
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.110
Angelina C: Well, I had a complete hysterectomy.

76
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.080
Angelina C: At in 2003 and I had one ovary left and then

77
00:09:50.280 --> 00:10:04.110
Angelina C: And then now when I did my bloodwork last about a year ago my zero masters and zero. But ultimately, what's the day they called me to go get my estrogen of the day I went in for a blood clot. My leg to the emergency room so

78
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.410
Angelina C: That's kind of where we're at.

79
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so can we revisit estrogen for a moment.

80
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.440
Angelina C: Yes, anything

81
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And we yeah you said estrogen and zero.

82
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand how is it left there, or are you taking

83
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Supplements to make sure

84
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.430
Angelina C: That changes I I was kicking back Koster.

85
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:41.040
Angelina C: About six months ago, seven months ago. And then I just quit taking it, because all the hot flashes like it went away, but my bloodwork showed my estrogen was at zero. So I'm thinking

86
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what I'm going to look up whatever you just said so that I can inform myself, but I don't know what you're saying.

87
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:56.460
Angelina C: I'm I didn't understand it either until I went in and then I had the blood clots. I thought it was just because I get real bad Charley Horses

88
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.310
Angelina C: I'm from my potassium. I have a potassium

89
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:15.630
Angelina C: Deficiency and so with my potassium deficiency. I started getting real bad Charley Horses, so that's what I thought it was until I couldn't walk on my leg and then I went in and it was a blood clot. So I've been on blood thinners sense. So you can't take both at the same time.

90
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you saying the word and I see if I can find it this out and looked it up, it was. Wait, let me get back to it again BL a CK space CE O H. O. S. H. Okay. So, yeah, I'm seeing something in here and says,

91
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an ester an extract

92
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And and how did you come about this being your treatment for your zero estrogen. How did you come about this being the treatment of choice for you.

93
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:59.490
Angelina C: I went when I went, what happened. I didn't know what to do. I was going crazy because I like I said, I don't even wear deodorant. I don't sweat.

94
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:11.220
Angelina C: So for me, when I sweat. It's like I feel like I have the flu almost so when it started that I was seeing another doctor at Presbyterian and Albuquerque, and she was telling me that

95
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.460
Angelina C: I can't take the my

96
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.110
Angelina C: blood thinner that I have with the estrogen.

97
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.260
Angelina C: When you have a blood clot. You can't take it.

98
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:34.140
Angelina C: And so I looked online, like that. And I found somebody recommended the black cohosh so I started doing the black cars and then I just quit taking it, I guess. And out just came back again.

99
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:43.800
Angelina C: Well just recently. I don't know what it felt like I took a energy drink or size something triggered it because I was doing just fine. I was doing just fine to, like, a week ago.

100
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you start, I understand you stopped. When did you start taking sorry you probably told me

101
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.540
Angelina C: About I want to say about March, April last year.

102
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Start that

103
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on. When did you start taking estrogen.

104
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know there was a stopping because you had the blood clot, but

105
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.190
Angelina C: I wanted to know when

106
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.450
Angelina C: I never even I started bus. Okay, so last January.

107
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.310
Angelina C: I was still out here in Edgewood and I've seen a doctor here and Edgewood and

108
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:30.840
Angelina C: That's when I went into the emergency room because I was trying to get out here with them before to Dr. Out here for a primary

109
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:42.300
Angelina C: And then I went back into Albuquerque. And I was saying with my mom. And that's what my mom and my aunt and have used that so i i tried. I was recommended that. So I asked my doctor and they said it was okay.

110
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:55.980
Angelina C: So I was taking that for a long time. But then I just remembered about my car accident around that time is when I quit taking them. So it's been about July, August, September, October, November, December, January now eight months, I've been off of it. So,

111
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes region. Yeah.

112
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.960
Angelina C: But this lady gave me this name. Let me show you what

113
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.570
Angelina C: She gave me this name last night she wrote it down and it's supposed to be like a cocoa.

114
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.870
Angelina C: And it's supposed to, um,

115
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.630
Angelina C: Help, but it's all natural. And it's at Walmart. It's like four bucks. And it's a big thing, and you can get it and it works better than the other stuff. I was taking

116
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.640
Angelina C: It's like cocoa. I know that it's a cocoa.

117
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.100
Angelina C: I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

118
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So the bottom line is, you're not distressed you attribute it to sort of this rise and fall of estrogen levels so you can attribute that to that. So you're not really unsettled emotionally, you're kind of like I kind of already have it figured out. Yeah.

119
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.880
Angelina C: Kind of, but it is a it is. I'm like my anxiety.

120
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.030
Angelina C: And things like that. I feel that

121
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.570
Angelina C: When it started back up is when I got real stressed at work. And that's why I started getting the headaches real bad.

122
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:27.090
Angelina C: About two weeks ago, or when it all started with you when I started telling you what was going on over about a week and a half ago all this shit that happened at work. That's when I noticed when I got real stressed out. That's when it kicked in. It seemed like so. I don't know.

123
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:35.160
Angelina C: If the stress had anything to do with it or or if it's just me and my body. I don't know.

124
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't like this wedding, you had the

125
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Doctor explain this would be a pretty normal experience. This is to be expected because I kind of normalize

126
00:15:51.150 --> 00:16:01.770
Angelina C: Not really, because when I had my hysterectomy. I was 30 something I had, and they left one ovary. But other than that, I

127
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.240
Angelina C: I don't know, it's, it seems like I have it under control, but I just don't like the feeling I guess you could say I'm uncomfortable that way.

128
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:24.900
Angelina C: Like I never break out. And since I sweated. Oh, it's like freaks me out because I don't usually break out. So now that I'm sweating so much I get I'm starting to break out. But other than that, I can handle it. It comes and goes. So

129
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.430
With your

130
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Husband returning. There were issues that we were just starting to talk about. We're starting our relationship and fidelity pieces really emotionally charged topics.

131
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing around his coming back.

132
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:51.300
Angelina C: Um, I, I've had a I'm happy for him to coming back.

133
00:16:52.350 --> 00:17:06.000
Angelina C: But just little things that he spits out makes me start feeling like, What are you doing, like, why, like I work with this kid he's 21 years old, he moved to the night shift a 21 year old little fat Doughboy cute cat. Right.

134
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.700
Angelina C: I'm 45 I'm old enough to be as damn long

135
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.480
And

136
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:22.290
Angelina C: Just a little marks. He makes under his breath, like, oh, of course, you'll say, I'm not sure, because there's a guy there but just little things like that his little comments. He's making are really, it bothers me but

137
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.800
Angelina C: How do I say it like what was the other thing.

138
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:36.300
Angelina C: Or say for example, the guy. He works with, say, for example, he's black. And I was with i i wasn't with a black guy but

139
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.600
Angelina C: He feels that I was with this black guy. And so he's like oh he's somebody you're like, like just this little comments he keeps spreading out

140
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:53.070
Angelina C: And annoying to me. But it's kind of like, I don't know if I know he's alone out there and I know how hard it is, because I've been on the road with him and know when you're out there alone. I know it's hard and lonely but

141
00:17:54.390 --> 00:18:04.560
Angelina C: Just little things. He spits out just I'm trying to deal with it. But let it go. Kinda like say of course you work the night shift because there's a guy working on the night shift.

142
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Me to very solid examples.

143
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see what you do with it. But he says, well of course you're going to work the night shift. There's a guy working

144
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to hear what meaning you make out of that comment.

145
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.810
Angelina C: But, you know, obviously I don't because you say brush it under the rug, honestly.

146
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

147
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.260
Angelina C: So I'm kind of confused on your question, I guess.

148
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I know your solution is brush it under the rug.

149
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.070
Angelina C: Because I don't like it. I just don't like it.

150
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.710
Angelina C: That's not avoiding wait

151
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have a meaning you did do one you just brushed it quick. So let's just see just we just this takes like that time work stuff where we kind of slow down.

152
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So you hear it and you interpret it.

153
00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean to you. This is me already know what you were going to do. We're going to box it up. We're going to try to forget about it. I get the solution, but you do something with it. You make meaning out of that comment. And I want to know what it means to you. He says that

154
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.590
Angelina C: What hurts.

155
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how you feel. See if we can get to the thoughts that go through your head.

156
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:26.940
Angelina C: I don't know, I just, I don't know, to me it feels like I don't know. I really don't like I don't know. I guess it's

157
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:36.900
Angelina C: It's so new to me because now that I have you to talk to, I guess, like somebody that understood not the only understands, but

158
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.600
Angelina C: To finally hear and it not be my mom and be like, Oh, no. You got your story wrong that's

159
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:49.350
Angelina C: Are like for you to hear me. So it's kind of like, remember I told you I back. I feel so dumb. Sometimes when somebody asked me something that

160
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:59.400
Angelina C: I don't even know how to answer it sometimes. And you told me. Stop and think. But sometimes I just, I don't even know how to answer it. I feel so thumbs up. Okay.

161
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then let's see there for a second. I can reassure you about that, that I can help you with right away.

162
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.210
Angelina C: Yeah yeah

163
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you as soon as you get that feeling.

164
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Really turned on the compassion because I spend all day every day. I'm like an expert at distinguishing between I even know the difference between a belief and a thought.

165
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That really what

166
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I can tell. So I'm already, we don't we don't. You don't have to feel insecure about it. This is my spot that like I know the ins and outs of communication and words and all of the dynamics of things.

167
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're in it which means all of these things have this emotional intensity and I don't have it. I'm way out here, as if it's just this neutral book, you know, it's just like, Oh, well, yeah. Can anyone see this. This is the map. It's right here. And you're like, you're like this.

168
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're right. Your nose is like, right. Yep. See the map because you're you're in it right but i have i can see it all up out here. So don't be hard on yourself when when I'm like this. And I was, I had one today. So I'm like this. I only see what

169
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only see what's like right there, that little

170
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.690
Angelina C: Died.

171
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't step back, either you are normal.

172
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:38.400
Angelina C: It is hard. It just makes me feel like I think we're all the, I guess that's unlock that hurts to is because that has a lot to do with me growing up and not being able to communicate.

173
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:45.960
Angelina C: Title my alarm and to be able to communicate with people and to be shut down like I used to be.

174
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:57.960
Angelina C: The one to go. I used to be the go getter, go do this, go do that. And then it just seems like you get shot down so many times that it just feels like you're nothing. I guess you know I get it, but

175
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's hard. You don't have to have it in here. Um, so as quick as it comes, you can name it like you did you say real quick. Okay, I'm feeling kind of stupid. I don't know how to identify it and then let it go.

176
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not thinking I'm thinking, There's something I've just got to be a better educator, I've got to come at it from a different way. But I'm never thinking that, Angie stupid never

177
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Never, never, never, I

178
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Genuinely mean that I look at it more like, Oh, I've got to try a different skill at this from a different way. Okay, so that's never crossing my mind.

179
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.520
Angelina C: Right. Today's a

180
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really bad your day. Okay, so let's try this again.

181
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons why I'm asking you to really zero in on something is

182
00:22:50.190 --> 00:23:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we have some control and it's kind of fun to feel like in a moment where I feel out of control to get power back. So that's why I'm getting us over to the thought. So this is how it goes. These are words you really like working at night because, of course, there's a man there.

183
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you hear it. And then guess what happens, you make meaning and analyze it.

184
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I would he would we all do. But you do it in your style. And so that's what I'm trying to get out. Now what I know, it's so it goes like this. He talks.

185
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You hear it and you analyze it. What you do is emotionally. You get hurt. And then you don't like to feel hurt and you box it up sweep it under the rug and you, you say to yourself.

186
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to think about it. Now, that's the solution. Sometimes what people do is they act out and they might get angry. They might take it out on someone else.

187
00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people might use drugs and alcohol when they try to box it up, it doesn't stay boxed up and under the rug last week over sex. We under sex. We overwork we sleep. We do love gamble. We can do any number of things over eat.

188
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of ways to solve.

189
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The hurt, but the part that I'm trying to get at is this and I'll give you an example. And you might find your own meaning when I pretend like it means something to me. So if I hear this coming at me. This is the meaning that makes up for me.

190
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm untrustworthy.

191
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.450
That's what it means to me.

192
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not trusted and not only am I not trusted he has solid evidence that I'm not trustworthy. He's right.

193
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's one version. That's a made up story I made that up.

194
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you when you hear him say that, which is a very passive aggressive thing to say.

195
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can go into ways he could say differently, but just for now, we're not going to change him.

196
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to know what it means to you that someone says, oh, of course, you're going to want to work at night. There's a guy there. What does it mean to you. What goes through your head. What are some of the thoughts that you think about

197
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.250
Angelina C: The he's doing something that he's done some that

198
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.380
Angelina C: Just like his little remarks, I feel like either

199
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:33.000
Angelina C: Was either at a strip club or something because he just the way he acted so I just start assuming right away that he's up to no good, you know,

200
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:48.210
Angelina C: So that's usually when we're getting along fine. None of that gets thrown around. But he had a one of the guys. He works with that he's going to bring this truck back up on Monday. Say for example, I'm just going to kind of throw this out there with

201
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.200
Angelina C: This is

202
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.370
Angelina C: This is what makes me honestly nervous that he comes home because

203
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:01.290
Angelina C: I feel even though he's been away he he has an addiction to

204
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:11.550
Angelina C: And I feel that when he hit his friend came back this last week from coming up to New Mexico, he was acting different he quits car he he doesn't talk to me to like

205
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:28.320
Angelina C: I shouldn't say doesn't talk to him. He just want to interest phone and say, sleeping, but when two days go by, he doesn't realize two days gone by and I'm still like okay well you know I just give up. I get to where I don't care because I either. I know he's done something or

206
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.100
Angelina C: I don't feel like he's talking to anybody. But now, like

207
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:42.000
Angelina C: For example, his comment was, oh, the strip clubs are closed. He knows I can't stand that because that's where he used to go when we break up with strip clubs. So when he threw that out there kind of

208
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:52.020
Angelina C: It bothered me. It really did because I started thinking to myself, you know, I understand he's away. I understand he's gone for six weeks that he wants to save his money and do all this but he's pitching at me.

209
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.450
Angelina C: Because I'm buying groceries. I haven't gotten. Oh, I did splurge a little bit on makeup, but other than that.

210
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:03.000
Angelina C: Honestly, I'm making nine bucks an hour with me and my daughter, and he's paying all the bills, which is great.

211
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:09.000
Angelina C: But we go get groceries and come home and that's like almost my whole paycheck. One of my for every two weeks.

212
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:16.140
Angelina C: And then he'll say, oh, I make that in a day. I can make that in two days. I get that. But I'm not quitting my job even though it's a little easy one because

213
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:23.070
Angelina C: I at least I have some income. I got stuck without WE WERE ABSOLUTELY HAVE NOTHING absolutely rock bottom, nothing.

214
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:34.230
Angelina C: And I'm not doing that again I rather stay at a gas station make nine bucks an hour and at least have something coming in. So he just put the little things he says just just hurts. This is a little shaky comments but I

215
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:44.160
Angelina C: You know I I don't expect him not, you know, he's a man. I get that, that he's been faithful to me before, and he's done it good before so I know he

216
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:55.650
Angelina C: You know, and it's hard. They're all down there with guys and stuff. I'm trying to trust him. I have my daughter here. My daughter human walks and hangs out with me at work, you know, show up down there hanging out with me at work and stuff, you know, when she gets bored.

217
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.830
Angelina C: But it's kind of like I

218
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:09.150
Angelina C: I feel like 35 years of this relationship. I put so much into and, you know, it's hard to as we went to high school out here. So there's a lot of people that I see from high school, too, but

219
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.590
Angelina C: It's hard, it is because I sit there started thinking, well, and then he'll say, Oh, I'm out here working all by myself and, you know,

220
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:24.420
Angelina C: I'm the one that's all along, but he'll start, how do I say it like he'll start throwing out shooting there. It's like, you know, you were. You could have got a job here.

221
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.590
Angelina C: And stayed local but he's always wanted to try the oil fields and he loves it.

222
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:38.730
Angelina C: So that's good. I'm happy for him. But right now, he's going to go and he'll come home. This instead of coming on the full week after six weeks. He'll only be home a week. He's only coming on three days.

223
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:47.610
Angelina C: Because he doesn't want to lose a spot, which is fine and he can't go to Walmart to send me money now because they can't park the trucks at Walmart parking right now.

224
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:55.920
Angelina C: They won't let them park their trucks there for some reason, I don't know what I don't know. So, oh, that kind of an excuse. You just didn't send it home to me. You know what I mean.

225
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.090
Angelina C: So that's what I'm dealing with that. It's kind of like

226
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:08.910
Angelina C: I, I hope in the next two years, we knock this down, get a new house. There's so many dreams I have. But he, I think.

227
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:21.060
Angelina C: He wants one thing, but does another kinda not not all the time. Just one like he was clean. He's been clean over eight months. And I'm just so scared for him to come home now that he has money.

228
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.390
Angelina C: You know that's what worries me.

229
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:25.650
Angelina C: Was moment.

230
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: drug of choice. What was he doing

231
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels offseason part as

232
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.340
Angelina C: Well, and yeah, he has done that too. Yeah.

233
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.860
Angelina C: He's done math to but he

234
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Prefers opiates. That's just go to

235
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.450
Angelina C: Yeah, so that's why it cuz I was supposed to me, good my doctor wanted me to make a

236
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:59.040
Angelina C: And I promised my youngest because she was doing what stuck out to me through rehab that I would never get back on them again and now my doctor sending me to the pain clinic because now that I've been on the the Suboxone and

237
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.680
Angelina C: I don't know if I've already built a tolerance or what, but I still have that breakthrough pain real bad.

238
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:16.350
Angelina C: Like the other day I had it so bad at work. I almost thought I was going to pass out. I literally got light headed, and it would hurt my back was hurting so bad, but I know I can make it through.

239
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:24.090
Angelina C: So they put me on approximate I started bleeding. I can't do it with my blood thinners so certain things we're trying to do around it.

240
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:31.440
Angelina C: And they want to send me to Santa Rosa to the Pain Clinic and I'm too scared to go because I don't want to get back on those again. I just think it gives us Aster

241
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.060
Angelina C: Either leaving been and be uncomfortable than happy to bring that back in my mind.

242
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't think you'll be able to stay in this program so

243
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is an interest.

244
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.920
Angelina C: That's what scared small

245
00:30:44.460 --> 00:31:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No way to you like this job, in some ways, there's no way to really come to terms with this condition with your back that they're, they're just sitting too and standing like a little combination there.

246
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:12.810
Angelina C: Yeah, it's good to hear. I can hear you, Mike, what am I get us. I put my do don't disturb on like you told me and then I did it, but when some when something comes through. I can't hear you. Sorry. Okay, what

247
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the volume. Good.

248
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check. So I think I also had to two levels down so I just turned it up a little bit. Also, so I'm hearing you. And I can see I just saw that you had some tears. So the pain is a really big concern for you also.

249
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: See implications that that might mean because this is they don't prescribe short acting opiates. It's just the buprenorphine. So this would be a big decision you know whether to stay or, you know, whatever. So, can, can we explore

250
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever had some pain relief when you incorporated a very structured routine stretching exercise like a yoga every morning.

251
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Every, every evening.

252
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.340

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:16.020
Angelina C: Yeah, I was doing. I used to get up a walk was my go to like I go out there and walk for miles to mastermind. As long as I can keep going and just if I have a lot of my mind. That's my go to, but

254
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:23.460
Angelina C: I haven't done it. I'm even thinking of walking to work because we have to put things in our car because we can't. We're not supposed to be driving

255
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:37.230
Angelina C: That we don't close to 10 so I have it in our car and I was even the I can even walk. It's just right here, kinda, but it's still cold and my glass out have been screwed was dumping rain, but it just little things like that and i i honestly

256
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.840
Angelina C: Feel like this go around.

257
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:50.610
Angelina C: Money wise Eric Thomas. So we're now that we're kind of doing okay. It seems like the world's falling apart now that we finally have an income. Do you know what I mean, like we got an incoming everything coming but

258
00:32:51.420 --> 00:33:02.070
Angelina C: I, that's what I stress about like he's pitching me to save my money. I don't even know how when I'm just getting groceries. We haven't even gone to Albuquerque to get Michaela bra. Nothing, it's just been on food and it just makes me feel like

259
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:14.040
Angelina C: You know, we've never monies and every movie problem until the opioids came into the picture. He's never even money's never even be an issue. And now,

260
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:21.240
Angelina C: It's kind of like I finally asked him yesterday. If we, I know that we have Leagues Under the house but I told him.

261
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:29.790
Angelina C: Because he sent Michaela how much he made in one week it was like 2600. I said, Can we at least get the water on I'll go turn it off at least we'll have running water, you know,

262
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:36.570
