10
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Excellent.

11
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

12
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

13
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

14
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To meet with your PR later on in the day, you said you were going to swing back at 130

15
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.760
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, to go get a new ankle bracelet. They had to put another one on me. Okay.

16
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How long's that gonna be on there.

17
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.380
Shaun wilkins: Six months.

18
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, do you want to talk a little bit about your concerns because you look like what I would describe as a big reaction.

19
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you want to talk a little bit about what that what you were interpreting as I thought I was doing exactly what you want.

20
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.550
Shaun wilkins: Yeah.

21
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.210
Shaun wilkins: And I just, I just kind of thought. I thought you were trying to like

22
00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:01.470
Shaun wilkins: Like evolve yourself my life all crazy with my PO like like I thought like if he asked her son when he asked for something. I'll tell you, you know, I mean that's that's what I did like offering him nothing okay

23
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.390
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, and

24
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I thought you were literally telling me he had already asked for mental health assessment. I thought

25
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.040
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, yeah. No, but I was talking about the monthly the monthly things. All right.

26
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes. So it is so we'll discuss that typically and I'll stay up front. I won't send anything unless you tell me too bad. I'm going to say many times

27
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:39.360
Shaun wilkins: I'm sorry, I was just tripping man I was really just, I just started tripping out that day because it's hard for me to trust people are really when you today, for some reason, red flags are popping up like what's going on here. Like, I don't know.

28
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.210
Shaun wilkins: You got scared. Yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw that and it's easy for me because I don't have anything to hide. I thought it was advocating for you and didn't feel like that. So, full stop on that. No problem.

30
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.330
Shaun wilkins: You'll know

31
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll tell me

32
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do want it sent and again I didn't write it. So there's also that like I didn't write your bio psychosocial someone else did. And it could mean that what your PL wants is a psychological evaluation or something, I don't know, but you'll tell me. So we'll just kind of step up.

33
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.050
Shaun wilkins: And I said, he said just a mental health assessment. Yeah.

34
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.920
Shaun wilkins: Well, it's not my deal it's it's all my paperwork. So he asked me to read my paperwork and whatever's on there. It said that. See, and he just told me last year counselor. They can do that.

35
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So we've been here before. And I gave you a we have it and I'm about to send it, and you did a full stop. So again, I'm waiting to hear one of your please send it to my PL otherwise I'm doing nothing.

36
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.080
Shaun wilkins: That's cool. My bad. I didn't mean to flip out on I just

37
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:57.390
Shaun wilkins: I just kind of started just, I don't know. It's hard for me to trust people like you that he talks, because I'm high profile and he was telling me yesterday that that uh, like when anything happens with me his bosses and everybody gets involved. You know what I mean. So I

38
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:07.620
Shaun wilkins: Just, I don't, I'm not trying to get in trouble for nothing like even something that's not there. Like I never know. You know, if I'm going to get trouble for something. I don't know.

39
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, we can do a little and I get that because you've really been hurt in the past.

40
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might mean it wouldn't be uncommon for someone to be a little hyper vigilant, like maybe see threat that may not be there. So in general, what I can do is I can

41
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Excuse me, I can go over. Basically what the bio psychosocial looks like.

42
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: A typically a clinician doesn't send it to a client. And let me tell you why.

43
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is clinical information. This is a clinical impression and if if a clinician isn't sitting with the client to go over every little bit of it, what ends up happening or the possibility

44
00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a client misinterpreting it right just even are this exchange got like kind of misinterpreted, in a way. So you can see that the risk is high, it is bad practice.

45
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your document to be sent directly to a client, unless you're sitting there with them and you can walk them through it and say this is what this means, this is what this means. And again, I'm not the one that wrote it. So it's even more difficult because I'm not the one that wrote it.

46
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.680
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, oh yeah, no, I think I'm hyper vigilant be good because I got PTSD of hyper vigilant with everything. Yeah.

47
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I

48
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Work with y'all all day long and I get it.

49
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll be super careful as much as I possibly can. But I don't know if you remember that, I promise. I'm like, and I can tell us

50
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.930
Shaun wilkins: All

51
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: At one point or another. I'm going to let you down. I will mean to because I'm human, and I'll seem threatening and scary. Even though my intentions might be beneficence good

52
00:06:48.990 --> 00:07:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Still it's scary to interact with another human they they heard us they they they do things that that are selfish at times. And so as long as you and I can talk, I think we'll be okay.

53
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.620
Shaun wilkins: That's why I stay away from people. That's why I go to work, come home. I don't associate with nobody I just

54
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.320
Shaun wilkins: You know, maybe I just try to stay away from. Anyway, I too.

55
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's where we'll start today is I'd like to give you this is really neat little inventory that assesses, a lot of the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and we can start there and take a look at some pieces of that. Are you open to it.

56
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.870
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, I'm doing

57
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's what we'll do. Cool, cool, cool.

58
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.700
All right.

59
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.560
track it down.

60
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'll probably do is I can share the screen with you know how I've been able to share my screen. And we can

61
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.190
Shaun wilkins: Go.

62
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We can go over each one. We can do it that way. Well, how are you feeling today, even as you're talking with me. Now, let me just do a little check in. How are you feeling

63
00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:02.250
Shaun wilkins: Good. All right. I just got up, I worked all night and I just woke up trying to get the first cup of coffee me

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I gotta have that coffee, you know,

65
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's see. All right. What did I call this since I can

66
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Get sitting somewhere else. I gotta track it down. I didn't know we were going to do that today. So I apologize.

67

Shaun wilkins: Last night I got this. I got this taxi, I take this taxi, then it. I'm going to they picked me up dropped me off every day. And then last night. Oh no, it's 3918 so it's 3901 I was pissed. They're all wasn't your manifesto. No, it's not. I got the email right here it says 91

Some wonder word

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you've got a lot at stake. It's not like a regular pickup and drop off not like a lot at stake.

Yes.

92
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's gonna be like hearts scale.

93
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.990
Get you to look at it.

94
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.450
Up.

95
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Taste.

96
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll do this one together. This is kind of a nice place to kind of get a reference of how your symptoms are presenting these days. Okay.

97
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.260
The

98
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's on a lifeguard scale it logs off number four which is extremely

99
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I get the share. Here we go.

100
00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll read the instruction to you. It's basically Below is a list of problems that people sometimes have in response to very stressful experiences. And that's a

101
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: nice way of saying a traumatic experience.

102
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So please read. Read each problem carefully and then circle. One of the numbers to the right to indicate how much you have been bothered.

103
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: By that problem and past 30 days. So it gives us a sense of what what it's been like for you. The last 30 days, but over on the right is it is number four.

104
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.880
Shaun wilkins: Is extremely

105
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: For a lot of people. It's extremely

106
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.730
Shaun wilkins: Yeah.

107
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.140
Shaun wilkins: So can we do

108
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so look at it just from this word I'm bothered I'm bothered by, you know, it'll be one through 20 I'm bothered by it, not at all a little bit moderately quite a bit are extremely so let's

109
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.300
Shaun wilkins: Do the first two or four

110
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see.

111
00:13:52.380 --> 00:14:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, repeated disturbing and unwanted memories of a stressful. That's number that's a four. Yeah. Extremely and number two, I don't

112
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:02.880
Know,

113
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:16.470
Shaun wilkins: That stuff pops in my head every day because I don't understand how it does because I like a song or something. I'll hear a song and I was locked up with as I was going through that stuff when that song came out. Yeah, I don't know, just weird stuff like that. I can explain it.

114
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: triggers a memory yeah psychology and neuroscience offer some pretty useful explanation about why that might be happening.

115
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go a little slower so that I can know this information to so repeated discerning dreams of a stressful experience you're putting a four which is extremely bothering

116
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It bothers you, to the degree of extremely number three. Suddenly feeling or acting as if the stressful experience for actually happening again.

117
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:51.780
Shaun wilkins: See, I guess that's what I started panicking on like you are people thinking that somebody trying to hit me up.

118
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

119
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.300
Shaun wilkins: And now, I mean,

120
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a 4.33 okay

121
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.490
Shaun wilkins: Because that's why I started trippin on people.

122
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.220
Shaun wilkins: Tripping okay good everybody's everybody's hurting everybody's against me.

123
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's keep going. These are pretty useful places for us to explore in the future. So let's take a look at number four.

124
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now remember this is a register your own register of how much it bothers you, how bothered. Are you feeling very upset when something from mine did you have the stressful experience.

125
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.850
Shaun wilkins: Three quite a bit. Okay.

126
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we have five having strong physical reactions when something reminded you of the stressful event. So that's a physiological a somatic response that's the heart pounding sweating. Sometimes our jaw gets clenched

127
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Our, our can't even hear sort of that blood in our ears. We start you know we can feel it physically

128
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.230
Shaun wilkins: Your heart starts pounding and you lose your breath. That's because your heart's pounding.

129
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing from zero to four.

130
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Last 30 days, which is like how to stress.

131
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.220
Shaun wilkins: For years prior to two, okay, because it's a boxing keeps me more calm. Okay.

132
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Number six, avoiding memories, thoughts or feelings related to the stressful experience.

133
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:34.680
Shaun wilkins: You know, you try to avoid them. But you can't because they just pop in your head. I've tried to avoid those things by the pop in the just the. I can explain. They just just boom. Yeah, I mean, you can you can avoid it.

134
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So if this is this is a really this is a watch the phrasing of this what this inventory is asking you to do is to look at how bother. Have you been by you're avoiding memories, thoughts or feelings related to the stressful experience do you assess it is extremely a bother some three

135
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite a bit to moderately

136
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.450
Shaun wilkins: One thoughts or feelings. I don't know if I can if I can avoid oh

137
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, unfortunately, it doesn't take yes I avoid or not. See if you can find

138
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A bothered you are was your first response when you saw that

139
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:25.440
Shaun wilkins: The first one, that's what I was thinking I could, I don't know, I can't answer that because I did you can avoid them. They just

140
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.670
Shaun wilkins: Pop in your head.

141
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I got it. How bothered. Are you by the fact that you can avoid them.

142
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.150
Shaun wilkins: I'm pretty water quite a bit. Three. Three.

143
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. We found it. Okay.

144
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got one for six. Let's see what happens with number seven. Same kind of thing. It's really registering your assessment of how troubling. It is for you, avoiding external reminders of a stressful experience. For example, people places conversations activities objects, objects or situations.

145
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.780
Shaun wilkins: To three

146
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.090
Shaun wilkins: Anyway, great.

147
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then we got a great so trouble remembering important parts of the stressful experience like maybe you wanted to remember an important piece of it.

148
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.370
Shaun wilkins: 00

149
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.870
Okay.

150
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

151
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.920
Shaun wilkins: almost lost my life.

152
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Number nine. How strong or having strong negative beliefs about yourself or other people or the world, for example.

153
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sorry, having strong negative beliefs about yourself or other people in the world. For example, having thoughts, such as I'm bad, there's something seriously wrong with me. No one can be trusted. The world is ok that. There we go. There's that sort of what you were calling triple thing.

154
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.170
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, awesome for

155
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, gotcha number 10

156
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: How bothered. Have you been the last 30 days where you're blaming yourself or someone else for the stressful experience of what happened or for what happened after it.

157
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.170
Shaun wilkins: For four. Okay.

158
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Number 11 having strong negative feelings, such as fear horror anger guilt or shame.

159
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.010
For

160
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.890
Shaun wilkins: All right. Number 12

161
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy.

162
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, curious about that one.

163
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.280
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, pray. Three. Three. Okay.

164
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know about those activities definitely want to understand that. So then we got 13 feeling distant or cut off from other

165
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Four.

166
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: 414

167
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Trouble experiencing positive feelings. For example, being unable to feel happiness or have loving feelings for people close to you.

168
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.340
Shaun wilkins: Know zero

169
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't bother you.

170
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.120
Shaun wilkins: Know I love my family.

171
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. Okay, number 15

172
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Bothered by a sense of irritable behavior angry outbursts for acting

173
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.400
Shaun wilkins: Is Lee.

174
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.720
Oh,

175
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.900
Shaun wilkins: Oh,

176
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.350
What do you got 333. Okay. Okay.

177
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: taking too many risks doing things that could cause you harm.

178
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.120
Shaun wilkins: Sure. Right now I'm trying not to do that. So zero

179
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you you're not bothered by the last 30 days. It's been a zero.

180
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.200
Shaun wilkins: I think I've been a risk taker, my whole life.

181
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:59.280
Shaun wilkins: They were seeing on my trial that I've had PTSD, since I was a kid, because they were trying to see that they get that I got it for what happened to me. But they're saying, Oh, I've had it since I was a little kid.

182
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe this is an interesting one because if our right because you. It's so normalized from for you what you just said.

183
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So just look at the last 30

184
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:12.840
Shaun wilkins: Days.

185
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up doing something. So I know you had a sexual encounter with someone was, would that constitute one of those, like, whoa, maybe

186
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.100
Shaun wilkins: Would that be one.

187
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.290
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, just got kind of crazy.

188
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing things that could cause you harm you ended up being harmed.

189
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Without a risk, maybe, I don't know.

190
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.110
Shaun wilkins: That, you know, I guess it was risky behavior because I didn't use protection. Right. Yes.

191
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because you don't know her right

192
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.150
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, I know. I've known her for like 20 years

193
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.370
Shaun wilkins: Well, we don't know what she's been doing. Yeah, it's right. Not good.

194
00:21:51.570 --> 00:22:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now go inside and assess yourself what you believe about yourself how bother you are buyer behavior. It was at zero. Should I keep it zero, or are you bothered by your behavior, putting

195
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.120
Yourself.

196
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.840
Shaun wilkins: To. Okay, let's move to 17

197
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.070
Here we go.

198
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Being

199
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

200
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.800
Shaun wilkins: Well, for

201
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the one.

202
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then at

203
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.430
Shaun wilkins: Various for

204
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:21.990
jumpy.

205
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:28.140
Shaun wilkins: Loud noises irritated me so bad, man. I did also flip it out. I know.

206
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a strong symptom.

207
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.010
Shaun wilkins: Of the traumatic disorder symptoms. Yep. That's a big one. And then we have

208
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: 19 having difficulty concentrating. So when you want to really focus. Does it seem like your mind wants to

209
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.650
put you under

210
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.690
Shaun wilkins: Water. Yeah.

211
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Three. Three. Got it. Last one trouble falling or staying asleep.

212
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.620
Shaun wilkins: By two, two. Okay, yeah.

213
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, yeah. The symptoms are high.

214
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.230
Shaun wilkins: Yeah.

215
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

216
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:08.640
Shaun wilkins: You know what, I don't, I don't like I don't think they understand like what I've been through so I don't think they understand really like how

217
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:20.070
Shaun wilkins: Because, uh, I think my symptoms are pretty bad, because I think we just I sat in a cell for years as solitary confinement. I did three years and too much street solitary confinement.

218
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.130
Shaun wilkins: And I think it really messed me up.

219
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.150
Shaun wilkins: People are

220
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying insane.

221
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:32.070
Shaun wilkins: I think I did a couple times because I used to talk to myself in the mirror didn't get my losing my mind, this

222
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.720
Shaun wilkins: And then I was fighting for my life. And then people would be banging on my walls, call me a baby killer and

223
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.320
Shaun wilkins: Stuff out have everybody seeing, they're gonna kill me like every inmate guards were telling me that I'm going to be killed.

224
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:50.520
Shaun wilkins: You don't. I mean, it was, it was innocent. I was telling her about me innocent way, believe me, it was a watch. No one believed me so I was all over the news.

225
00:23:50.970 --> 00:24:01.740
Shaun wilkins: And then I got out everybody was like kind of like what the hell you know i'm saying is I was telling her about Venus. It has nothing to do with this, and no one and then this guy three years into it comes forward admit that he lied that he set us up.

226
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:16.800
Shaun wilkins: Then everything started changing from them and then they found out that he was even involved that he falsely confessed that they over. Do they overturned his case yeah 134 years they overturned his case, he got out. Yeah. I mean, he ended up getting on to do that.

227
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would he admit to something like that.

228
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:26.010
Shaun wilkins: Oh, he admitted a four counts of murder and then set us up because these cops cops stinks. I shot up his house.

229
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:36.810
Shaun wilkins: And that means this gear that case things I shot up his house. Someone told him I shot of his house and he tried to see in the newspapers that I told him I did it. That's a lie. It would have charged me

230
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk a little bit about the course of treatment because right now we have now settled in enough that we can start to look at some of the interventions that have some statistical efficacy with symptoms of PTSD. Can we talk a little bit about that. Yeah, yeah.

231
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So there are some treatments out there. Thank goodness that have a positive impact for people and what you just told me earlier is that you have two things you have what sounds like complex trauma, which means you may have had some challenges when you were growing up.

232
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you haven't told me those stories yet. But you just said, I think I had it when I was young.

233
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.850
Shaun wilkins: Psychology sourcing

234
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that says to me that when you start to tell me what if you decide that I'm trustworthy. When you do tell me those stories. If you find me trustworthy.

235
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is there will be missed attunement from a primary caregiver. There may have been sense of you're not feeling safe as a little person there's going to be probably some stories in there were there were, you were, you were hurt and

236
00:25:49.500 --> 00:26:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And what can happen with that Sean is when we're hurt our development, our brain literally doesn't grow on time. It doesn't grow the same way as it. What if we had a safe nurturing environment.

237
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. And so we say, okay, and guess what the good news is our brain.

238
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: grows, it changes and because we know this. Now you can heal.

239
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's exciting.

240
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's number one. Number two, so I just talked about complex developmental trauma never want to talk about what's called like a shock trauma.

241
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in a car accident or that you're going to jail right that that horror experience that's a shock event. So you have both. You lucky guy I say sarcastically

242
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.610
Obviously,

243
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but you're not alone. Okay, the people that I'm working with have gone through really some shit. Okay. Oh, just number one, you're not alone. This is, this is

244
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: A space. A lot of people are going through this and I want to talk to you about some of the treatments that have been shown to be effective.

245
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What tends to be effective and this may seem really kooky but it's actually what a big piece of whether the the technical work. Let's say we decided to do some em Dr together that's that's a specific intervention.

246
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's interesting is, whether you and I trust each other and that may blow your mind. But the fact that you and I may develop rapport.

247
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you get to look at another human being and really learn maybe for one of the first times I can be vulnerable.

248
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at me, I'm handling it. I'm okay, trusting another human being, believe it or not, it may seem wild, but what research will show is yes em dr is great for reprocessing trauma.

249
00:27:50.760 --> 00:28:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it's a crappy relationship and these you got, you know, if the therapeutic alliance isn't there, it's not going to be as effective. Isn't that amazing

250
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Watch this. If the rupture. If the damage was in a relationship, let's say, a primary caregiver sort of failed us, all of us me failed me in some way, the healing, ironically,

251
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.020
Relationship.

252
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So people say, well, you know, what's the deal with a counselor, I can do this. I got friends i got i can i don't need I what do I need a therapist for this is stupid. This a waste of my time. But what science talks about

253
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the importance of attachment and then a lot of our wounding happens from an attachment wound. When we were younger. So ironically

254
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.270
Shaun wilkins: It's going to be in here.

255
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That you may experience some healing. I don't know how long that's going to take

256
00:28:46.590 --> 00:29:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's an important piece of it. So when you decide, oh my gosh, you know, hey, I'm my dad, I kind of went a little. I was a little hot there with that text. Sorry about that, that, that contributes to our relationship here and it's an important part. Okay.

257
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So have you ever done any em, Dr. Have you ever worked with anyone working through either one of the traumas.

258
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:17.550
Shaun wilkins: I've never gotten help since I've been on. I've never see talks I stayed out for 10 years and that I picked up disarm Aubrey

259
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:31.110
Shaun wilkins: And I went back to them, for I was in there for 11 years. So I've never, I was just selling the streets running doing math right around. So in math, math, and I never got help not once I never went to counseling and they're lucky.

260
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

261
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.430
Shaun wilkins: I never got help inside there. I never went to

262
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a shame it truly is.

263
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.380
Shaun wilkins: Nobody there.

264
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, sometimes I hear people say that that there'll be someone in in one of these AA meetings or something that they connected with other people say what you say like there was nothing nothing positive about it.

265
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me tell you a little bit about my approach so

266
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say a lot of it is cognitive, behavioral, and you'll know cognitive behavioral because I'll be asking you, things like, what are your beliefs about yourself.

267
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what are your thoughts. And did you know that they cause feelings and we would stay there for a little bit. But what I've seen with trauma is we can only get so far you can only get so far because some of our wounds are stored pre verbal

268
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do we use words to heal when some of this is just stored in our body. So you're going to see me doing some things that seemed kind of kooky and and believe me. People are like, really, this stuff is so weird. I just can't do it.

269
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But because you trust me, you end up doing it anyway. And you feel better. So I believe in. LAUGHTER I believe in you can make fun of me.

270
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always throw me under the bus and say, oh, this kooky therapist is having me do this so that's that's getting into the somatic transformation stuff where I might ask you this, I might say, much like what I did earlier, I might say, Sean.

271
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know where you're feeling anxious right now in your body. So you know how you're kind of moving around a lot, you're kind of like kind of your, your emotion, your kind of rata tap, tap, and kind of get that done. You're moving around.

272
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see, I can only see your shoulders up. Now, if you were here in my office I would be able to see all of you, and I'd be able to bring out each little piece and say what's going on with this part of you.

273
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm relying on you telling me and narrating and telling me what's going on. So there's a lot of a lot of reliance on you're telling me that I might say,

274
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say, How's your gut. Let's do a body scan. How's your gut feeling. How's your chest.

275
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now how's your head how your arms, I might ask you at times to do some exercises that are what's called grounding or emotional regulation exercises.

276
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and they're going to be different because you haven't done this stuff before and and I'm fine. If you want to laugh because most people are like, this is just cookie.

277
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.500
Shaun wilkins: Well, I've done yoga and all that stuff, everybody was laughing

278
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good. See you okay right so it'll be kind of like that I might also explore what's

279
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming from a little bit of a psycho analysis perspective, which is the transactional analysis is getting into the inner child the adult in the parent

280
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Ego states inside of us that might be that. And the last one is the eye movement desensitization work, which is the EMT or and that's the stuff where you might be looking at either my finger.

281
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving from the left and right hemisphere, or I might show you if you weren't on a phone if you were on an actual laptop, you might be looking at a light moving left and right.

282
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.080
Shaun wilkins: Yeah.

283
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm happy to always I can stop and I can do psycho education. But what I've learned over the years is that insight.

284
00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: can only get you so far you can know why something you can know the neurobiology, I can talk to you about the poly bagel system. I can talk to you about the Vegas nerve and I can educate you until you know more than I do, and you can still be hurting

285
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't inside alone. I wish it was, and then Freud psychoanalysis would have been all we ever needed

286
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:33.150
Shaun wilkins: You know what I read, I read this little book out this little book and was on antisocial personality disorder. And this guy read it in there. It said some about borderline. And this guy myself I was led to this guy for three years and he's all this is

287
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. You just got muted say that you're selling. He said he's borderline or he said you

288
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:46.620
Shaun wilkins: Know, he said. He said, your board. He's all this is you right here. And then so we read it.

289
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:55.170
Shaun wilkins: I started laughing I was, Oh, well, let's see if you're right. So I had three psychological exams from three different doctors and it said that I was Antisocial Personality disorders and it said borderline

290
00:33:55.770 --> 00:34:04.230
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, that was weird that he said, look, this is you, because he's lived with me for three years, but it says in there that I have a it's the talks about like where pieces of shit.

291
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is. That's what it said like the world what is

292
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.820
Shaun wilkins: It. Oh, hold on, hold on, it does, does the symptoms of what it says that the way we are. It says you're a

293
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.900
Shaun wilkins: Piece of shit. And I was like, wow, I was I dizzy that they're saying I have this

294
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.610
Shaun wilkins: Know that

295
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, listen.

296
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that what you said is useful, except the label PIECES. PIECES should has nowhere to go pieces. It says forever. You are That.

297
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece of shit gets to shame and I don't know if you've picked up on that about me not interested in shame. Let me tell you what I know about antisocial personality disorder and about Borderline Personality Disorder. Those are heavy hitters no doubt they fill the jail system.

298
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

299
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.260
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, it says I have those

300
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

301
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're what you did. Did you read about the ED.

302
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.510
Shaun wilkins: It says that we lack the ability to love.

303
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.860
Shaun wilkins: It says that we are

304
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:10.920
Shaun wilkins: Like it talked bad. I was like, are you kidding me. I was like, it said it like we can't even it said, Whoa. Come on, superficial charm will will appear intelligent but we're not

305
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it

306
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't say you're not so

307
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The key piece. So for for anti personality. We're not going to call you a ship. I won't do that. I will call you yet. But let's just do that, you know, the

308
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the pieces and I hope you can hear, I don't agree with that summary, I do believe

309
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: People can rework different parts of their brain. Okay, I don't think it's a period at the end of that diagnosis. It is a point of departure. And I think you can cultivate change if you want it. The key feature feature with that label antisocial personality disorder is this

310
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how you know

311
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll use an example, let's say you were in group.

312
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you saw someone

313
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And for a moment. This is what empty looks like you go outside of yourself.

314
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you feel their pain for just a split second. Oh man, that would be so hard to have been sexually abused watch because that might be in a group, right. And then guess what you come back to you.

315
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'd go to be saying yourself. Oh, that's not me, but didn't happen to me. But for a second. This is empathy. I went outside

316
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had compassion for what it would feel like to be another human being, traveling along this journey to have hurted like that and watch. Then I come back to me. I know it didn't happen to me but I come back to me and you know what I do.

317
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I speak gently and I'm kind to that person. Because I imagine what it would be like to have been that hurt. Now watch what anti social, watch this.

318
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the difference

319
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:01.620
Shaun wilkins: To see you want me to you what I think when when I hear somebody that's that sexually assaulted, I think, are they lying.

320
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:08.280
Shaun wilkins: Oh, is he doing good. I don't know. I don't, I can't go feel for someone else. It's weird. I can't

321
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.880
Shaun wilkins: Feel like I'm like why am I supposed to feel this pain.

322
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll tell you. So it could be, it could be. Listen, we're not going to go with piece of shit dirt bag thing. What we're going to go with is

323
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This capacity for empathy. It is a brain function for whether the etiology was environmental or whether it's just something that you were born with, I don't know, like I just met you. Who knows. We'll find out.

324
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But the PERT let's go with my little story. Okay.

325
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.290
Shaun wilkins: And thank you for sure. Go for

326
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It. No, no, it's okay. I'm the person. Let's say that what's going on is an anti social peace, what might happen is they see this person and they store it.

327
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And they say,

328
00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say something nice, but I don't feel like I care and I might use it to exploit the vulnerability of that person.

329
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right.

330
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be exploitation, that would be that's that.

331
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.490
Shaun wilkins: Funnel making fun

332
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.390
Shaun wilkins: Of them and stuff like that.

333
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you're really intelligent, you don't do that in a group, because what's the

334
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.680
Shaun wilkins: Therapist.

335
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To do. Right. Yeah.

336
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapist is going to cut you off. And I'm going to protect this person because I have to have

337
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.800
Shaun wilkins: Good. I don't think no one would jump out in a green tea.

338
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But that's why you're not going to do that. But you might store it or one might store it and exploit. I say, oh, this person.

339
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is vulnerable and I could use this to exploit. So watch that's different than I just can't feel it. I can't feel it. I can't feel what another is feeling

340
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:58.350
Shaun wilkins: But this is I like the ability to love it. Awesome. I love my family I love my nephews and nieces. Like, I love that a lot, you know I'm saying, like, oh, that's why I don't understand. Nothing's wrong.

341
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on, hold on, let's let's keep exploring this is fun.

342
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.820
Shaun wilkins: I just have a hard. I have a hard time loving other people. I don't know.

343
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.890
Shaun wilkins: Okay, let's take

344
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, let's take the people. Let's take a cousin nephew said, How old is the nephew, just pick one sec.

345
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.510
Shaun wilkins: Okay.

346
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's how you might know if you really love them. This six year old comes to you and says, I don't like you, I don't want to play with you. What do you do

347
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.420
Walk away.

348
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but do you care what that little person is going through to care and want to understand

349
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.950
Shaun wilkins: Reem I do. Yeah.

350
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. But you don't use it against them and are indicative and blah, blah, blah, blah.

351
00:39:52.050 --> 00:40:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: For you. So for a child, right, you may have experienced so much sort of negative experience in your life that you can you can hold this sort of empathy for the innocence of a young person.

352
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe for adults who you have a different maybe standard of expectation for them. So that's a good sign, Sean.

353
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The key is you don't want anything back from the six year old, you see it.

354
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you, if you purely only want what you can get that you're going to push that six year old away and you only want that six year old to give you affection, you only want it heading this way.

355
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you did for that six year old, my little scenario is you gave unconditionally said this little guy gets to be pissed off at me, he gets a lot like me sometimes. That's the way it is.

356
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I continue to care for him. He's having a bad day, little man just working it out you don't exploit it, you don't make him feel bad. He gets to do his own thing. It's not just what you get. You see it. So you do have it. So that's not true. Is it

357
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you about these what the diagnostic manual does is it takes

358
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: A whole range of human behavior on the whole range. I have an anti social peace. I have a piece of borderline. We all do. But here's what the diagnosis does is it's the extreme

359
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It captures the most extreme of all of these features that we share I share a little anxiety I share a little depression. Sometimes I might look look like I'm bipolar or whatever.

360
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We all have a little tiny bit of it. It's the fact that it's so consistent. So that's, that's why when you're assessing someone you do it over time. And it's a continuous pattern pattern pattern pattern.

361
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I hope this has opened your heart and your mind that you're more than just a label. I don't like labels.

362
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.130
Shaun wilkins: I tripped out when I read that Dean. I was like, wow, they're seeing them this

363
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.310
Shaun wilkins: Is good to me. Oh, OK.

364
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the upside of that label could be this.

365
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's where you're not. And here's where you are. You may say some pieces of this are

366
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: My maladaptive so you know how earlier you were saying I'm avoiding people I don't really want to. I just, I don't trust them.

367
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.220
Shaun wilkins: I just want to be around always don't want no problems.

368
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And we humans have eyes appearing in the front.

369
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Row in front of our face because we're wired for connection, you may want to overcome your human nature to want to connect meaningfully

370
00:42:41.610 --> 00:43:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's there. Nonetheless, and this sense of isolating you're missing out on the richness of what life has to offer. I know you're scared. And I'm not saying go make a best friend right now but down the line. I'll be continuing to say wire to love and connect. It's what gives us to

371
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.860
Shaun wilkins: Know what the. Why is the world so cold.

372
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're scared and selfish. We get scared, we think about it. If you I don't know your stories. Yet, Sean. But if you grew up, let's say in a home where you didn't have to worry about scarcity, there was enough love nurturing and resources around you.

373
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you might have gone a different direction in your life.

374
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, so, so used to you take you'll take a me now it's just you and I in here so we can only talk about each other. So you take me. Maybe I had a little more, maybe I had just enough

375
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.480
Shaun wilkins: We don't know. But there's nothing to be ashamed about that's

376
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

377
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.840
Shaun wilkins: You haven't been proud of that your family. Do you come from a good family.

378
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe. Well, you know, you'll never know my story because this is about you. But my point.

379
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

380
00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't know if I am very firm now won't know much about me, it's better, but

381
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what's up.

382
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.850
Shaun wilkins: So,

383
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's important because you keep you keep remembering that this treatment is for you. And we get to keep finding out all but I want to know, okay, well then let's let's talk about that need to know. But let's go back to just enough

384
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I hope you've heard today.

385
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That labels are a point of departure, they can say, well, this captures a little bit of it. How can inform our work. And so what I heard today.

386
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't like that one, that one song. I don't want to hear. I can't love I know love, I love, I love my cousin's their sweethearts, and it's not just about me, I would I would give and not want anything back

387
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And at the same time. Notice in group, it's harder, but guess what,

388
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Those people in group, just like you were six year olds to

389
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We have an innocence in us. We have a goodness

390
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:07.620
Shaun wilkins: And I know there's there's people out there. I think about that every there's people out there headway worst one I've ever had saliva. You know what I mean. So that's I think about that to me like I did, there's people out there to have a bad

391
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You are doing all right and you're okay today, but it may not feel like that, Sean, because those memories.

392
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Are being relived as if they were happening now and I can give you the science on another session of about the hippocampus about the amygdala.

393
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: About the insula about the prefrontal cortex, we can get into that and you can learn the neuroscience behind it.

394
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Which, of which you have no moral imperative. He didn't decide, well, I'll remember this, and it'll be horrific and I'll keep reliving it for the rest of my life. You didn't ask for that. This is

395
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:45.900
Shaun wilkins: The prefrontal

396
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We, my point is, your brain is going to do its thing.

397
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:53.550
Shaun wilkins: You don't make

398
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do that. If you're wired to go do particular things that have been developed over, you know, thousands of years.

399
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:06.030
Shaun wilkins: Like this brain runs me like, like, like you can't, I don't see controlling it because it controls you it does what it wants.

400
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But watch how are you separate from your brain.

401
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, by are going to get to know that right

402
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.230
Shaun wilkins: But, but you can't stop with your thoughts, though you can't

403
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Store. Oh, well, you're going to find out some interesting things. Guess what, you know what you're you know what your brains connected to

404
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body, and this is where it gets cookie and you'll have to giggle and you'll have to laugh and say my therapist is off her rocker. But if you end up feeling better. Isn't that the point if you're happier and feeling more at peace in this body and not stressed. Wouldn't that be nice.

405
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.570
Shaun wilkins: Yeah yeah and I want that for you to

406
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Today you worked very hard. You heard new information. You got to check out some some misinformation that you got in custody. Okay.

407
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:01.800
Shaun wilkins: And there's hoping that now. I was just reading a book that was a little pamphlet. It was like a little skinny book.

408
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:12.060
Shaun wilkins: And I grabbed it was on antisocial personality and then because everyone says they have that I guess then there's my roommate, we started reading it and he read that he's all hey this is you right here and

409
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: He started laughing Why doesn't he diagnose it to himself said

410
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:21.240
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, we read. I said, well, let's see if you're right, because I had all my paperwork in there and we pulled it on its head.

411
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.150
Shaun wilkins: I was like, wow, is it said the board antisocial personality disorder that it's a borderline

412
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you when you're in group playing with this as a little piece of homework.

413
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right after you get offended watch scared nervous pissed off. You're going to know it, probably with pissed off. Most people protect. I mean, it's so fast. You don't even think about getting pissed off, we self protect like

414
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Like Screw you, buddy. We it happens really fast. But underneath that catch yourself and you might be in one of those quiet moments where you got offended and insulted in threatened or

415
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A sense of being controlled that you probably register that when someone's trying to control you in there. Maybe it'll be me you'll you'll register it before you take action on it. Try this on his homework.

416
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.600
I wonder how one of yours feeling right now.

417
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, that'll be brand new for you. But try it and see what happens. I know it's weird. You don't even have to say you're doing it, I kid you not, in the quiet of your own home over there in New Mexico.

418
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's practicing the sense and skill of empathy.

419
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what happens when you go right, you're not in a fear response anymore when no longer are you focused in the neural network of threat and I'm being controlled and I've got to defend that position.

420
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try it, even for a split second. I'm going to go outside of myself. I'll come right back. Wonder how one of yours feeling

421
00:48:53.610 --> 00:49:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to read her tone of voice that she looked at me, she making fun of me. What's she doing wonder how she feels right now and then come back to you and see how you feel.

422
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it, and see what

423
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you journal it to come back to me and you say, Yeah, I did that a couple times and I'd be curious to see which dummy. All right. That's the homework and do it with family to eat. Nobody's going to know you're doing it.

424
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:21.690
Shaun wilkins: Yeah, right.

425
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do with the guide the clerk, you can do with your PO, you can do it anywhere you want. Just go outside for a moment and imagine and wonder how they're feeling and then come right back. You want to stay out there long split second.

426
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Come right back to you. Okay, that's practicing that skill of empathy. All right. Um, are you still liking this time of day.

427
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.800
Shaun wilkins: Maybe, yeah. Yeah.

428
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.570
