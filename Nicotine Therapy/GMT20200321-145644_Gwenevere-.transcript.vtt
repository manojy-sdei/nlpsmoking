Rhonda Towne: The guy just, I don't know what the heck happened. He kept he went he kept going to the office and checking up on it and

54
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.570
Rhonda Towne: It was just a big mess. I was so upset. I was like,

55
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:25.260
Rhonda Towne: He left that job that he was okay with. I mean, it wasn't the greatest job in the world. But still it was income to come for this one. And yet you never even

Rhonda Towne: You know and i mean i do

57
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that put a lot of pressure on you.

58
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.080
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, because I was only one working

59
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been in that position before where not only you know kids but but you were the primary breadwinner for a little while, but you've been in that position before

60
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.460
Rhonda Towne: No, never. Not even when I was married to the dad never

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.030
Yeah.

63
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.520
Rhonda Towne: I thought were

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.050
Rhonda Towne: Appealing

65
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

66
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We were talking about last time you

Rhonda Towne: Yeah, well, I

70
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought I saw someone I'd have to confirm, but I know you were trying to make your way over to Tempe.

71
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I saw something come across where Arizona is

72
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: They are providing services, but I don't know if it's just for commercial and self pay, but there are services there through bright heart.

73
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, there's some political things going on associated with this sort of global crisis that we're all in and it may impact an increase availability.

74
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the physicians to prescribe in other states. So I'll keep you posted if something changes.

75
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that still on your radar. I know there's

76
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.880
Rhonda Towne: You know we when he was out of work HIS BROTHER LIVES IN VEGAS.

77
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:35.550
Rhonda Towne: And we were actually thinking about moving to Vegas. Okay. And either way. I'm back in Tempe.

78
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:44.880
Rhonda Towne: It's called access their, their Medicaid program and I had an ex. I had a doctor there Dr dinsdale

79
00:08:46.050 --> 00:09:04.860
Rhonda Towne: But the thing. Oh, I don't know. The only thing is, we didn't none of it. I only saw him once a month. That's it. No therapy. Nothing. Um, and it was Suboxone he not Suboxone sub effects that he prescribed the pill one which was

80
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.070
Rhonda Towne: I just, I don't know. It has its ups and downs. I guess on that one. But yeah.

81
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.770
Rhonda Towne: Um, but yeah it. I had my own doctor out there so

82
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:26.340
Rhonda Towne: I probably would have looked back into that had I decided to go there. Okay, but I don't know about Vegas so that you know i mean

83
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How serious are you thinking about going to Vegas.

84
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.520
Rhonda Towne: Nevada. Well, this is one, he didn't have a job.

85
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.050
Rhonda Towne: His brother had everything lined up to now that he's working again.

86
00:09:41.190 --> 00:10:01.290
Rhonda Towne: We're okay for now but on what we both been saying was on since my daughter strand is graduating this year and this may be the only one that leaves is Jacob and he's 17 so once he's done with school that's pretty much the only thing that's keeping us here is the kids.

87
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.450
Rhonda Towne: Are all grown. I mean after 18. I mean, I'm like,

88
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.570
Rhonda Towne: It's time for me now.

89
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.520
Okay.

90
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.770
Rhonda Towne: So,

91
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.480
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

92
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:24.330
Rhonda Towne: And then on my second one, Josh, um, they completely cancel has a PD thing.

93
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.050
Rhonda Towne: The training everything

94
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:37.320
Rhonda Towne: So he was supposed to be doing that right now. So we had no job, but to work. Keep working till he had they reopen everything

95
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:56.280
Rhonda Towne: And then my second son Maya was working at this place called horse angel or some kind of bar where you can eat and whatever you he was working in a kitchen and they will evolve that down so I got him a job where I work. So

96
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:08.550
Rhonda Towne: Yeah I yesterday was his first day and everybody was like you. Yeah, that's your son. And I'm like, yeah. And they're like, No way, you know,

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, you do have

100
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a real young look to you, you do

101
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:29.700
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, everybody always thought I mean I have little kids or no kids or something. And I'm like, I trust me. I said, I'm my

102
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Age beautifully really do.

103
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.460
Know,

104
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.700
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I think it's just

105
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:53.010
Rhonda Towne: I mean, I'm so glad I didn't do anything. When I was younger, or when I was pregnant with my kids. My name is hit Tylenol, with all my kids. And now I'm like, my body is mine. I

106
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.560
Rhonda Towne: Want but yeah

107
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I

108
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I heard in there. It's sort of a nice tie in to the topic that I was thinking of covering which was about self compassion because it sounds like when you said this is time for me.

109
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you've. It's not a sense of I've sacrificed a lot of time to my children.

110
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:34.710
Rhonda Towne: You know, what is it, yeah. I mean, I'm. That's what I tell my kids I said I dropped out of high school, I was valedictorian that year. You know what I mean. I dropped everything to have Josh, I decided to do the right thing of getting married to your dad.

111
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:49.080
Rhonda Towne: You know what I mean to do the whole family thing. I gave up pretty much everything to have you guys now I'm not asking for reward or anything by said now that you guys are all older

112
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:59.070
Rhonda Towne: Um, it's, it's, it's, it's my turn. I want to move where I want to move. You know what I mean. I want to see the world or whatever.

113
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:11.970
Rhonda Towne: So yeah I and I told them, I said. And then, and my kids, they're all. I mean, none of them are drug addicts. They all are going to finish high school. You know what I mean, if that's the last to

114
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:25.290
Rhonda Towne: The older to did and they are all going to go to school. So yeah, man. I might know I didn't waste all those years, just so you guys could screw around

115
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.070
Rhonda Towne: So,

116
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to move or I want to move. I want to see the world or whatever.

117
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.200
Rhonda Towne: I just want to travel. That's what I wanted to do. Yeah.

118
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.870
Rhonda Towne: So that's what I told him, I said, you guys are not going to waste your lives.

119
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.300
Rhonda Towne: For what I sacrifice.

120
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.110
Rhonda Towne: You have so much still to do

121
00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:08.640
Rhonda Towne: So, and that's what I tell the boys, I said, that means no girlfriends know skinks coming around whatever you're going to finish school and you're going to provide for your family should come, you know,

122
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:15.000
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, not living paycheck to paycheck. I said, No, you're going to school first and then you can think about

123
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.910
Rhonda Towne: Having a girlfriend or whatever.

124
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So this ties into one of your goals. Today's the day we got to review some of those goals which is live a full life. Notice that what you just said is that a big piece of what's missing is the traveling and go where you want to go.

125
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.630
Rhonda Towne: I think that is but

126
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:49.290
Rhonda Towne: My number one is always the kids, you know, and I mean I have to watch out for them, no matter what. And as long as they're happy, then I I'm all right.

127
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that match with you're wanting to travel because

128
00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.000
Rhonda Towne: I can't do it yet until they're all grown

129
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.440
Rhonda Towne: Till I know that there will pay and then I can finally

130
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.360
Rhonda Towne: You know,

131
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.890
Rhonda Towne: We go my way

132
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that thought. I want you to project a year into the future, because you've decided it is it you've decided 18 is when they're okay so

133
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It is very possible, given the number of your children that someone's not going to be okay. Are you still going to give yourself permission.

134
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To be happy and live where you want to live, whatever it is, because

135
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of years left in their life.

136
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when do you get to go live. Maybe it's a relocation. I don't know what it will be for you, but it right now, it's looking like this. It's been either or it's been sacrificing your happiness for your children.

137
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have been happy because they are healthy and happy and going to school and I get that.

138
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But remember live a full life if you put it on hold. Again, because one of them.

139
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't know what to do or is unhappy. You see the challenge that you might get held back again.

140
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you put the two together. How can you still be moving forward towards something that you want to do.

141
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe allowing your children to maybe go through their own frustration their own difficulties, but you get to be happy if one of them isn't happy. How can you put those two things together. Will you be able to, is it even something possible

142
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:55.650
Rhonda Towne: I actually, I that isn't possible. I know that because let's see about two, maybe three weeks ago somewhere right around there.

143
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:14.070
Rhonda Towne: The one that's working with me now Maya. That's kind of my underlying wasn't only to help them get a job, but I did it to keep an eye on him, because where he will one day his dad just text me, call me in the morning and he was like

144
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:23.430
Rhonda Towne: This morning, Maya came back from work. He's all usually he gets off about one or two in the morning, you know, the bars or whatever they closed late

145
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:37.560
Rhonda Towne: So he said, no, this morning. He came walking in and he smelled alcohol and my out if he is. He's not like that. My eyes just the last person you would think would

146
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:49.950
Rhonda Towne: You know what I mean. And I was like what happened, I guess, and then Travis said he was frustrated. He just tell it, saying that he

147
00:17:50.970 --> 00:18:07.830
Rhonda Towne: He doesn't feel worthy to do anything. He doesn't want to do any just working, working, I said, well, he needs to go to school, he needs to get back into school he needs to do something for himself all he's doing. He's got too much time on his hands. Okay, so

148
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:17.700
Rhonda Towne: I was it really shocked me. And it really hurt my feelings, because they know how I feel about alcohol and anything drugs or whatever.

149
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:27.180
Rhonda Towne: But thank God. He didn't do any of that. It was just our call. So I took like three days off of work because

150
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:37.830
Rhonda Towne: I mean, I don't know my son's going through crisis. I'm going to be there. Okay, so his older brother, Josh, the one that's in the academy.

151
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.870
Rhonda Towne: Had to take off. Few days as well. And I told him, maybe talk to your brother, because

152
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:59.730
Rhonda Towne: Maybe he just needs a somebody his age or something because I'm going to be mom. I'm going to sit there and I'm gonna let her have more than anything. I mean, yeah, I'll be there for my son, but it's different from a mom to a brother. Yeah, so

153
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:22.560
Rhonda Towne: He was even talking about moving out and everything. And I told me if you move out. It's not the right way. It's not your movie now because of what any any felt guilty. So I mean we just had this whole crisis at home or bit and it finally died down and he finally decided to stay home.

154
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.760
Rhonda Towne: He wasn't going to drink again and I guess it was just some friends at work too as well.

155
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:41.250
Rhonda Towne: And I was. And then there are times in the evening when I do go to his work to give him like a drink or Red Bull or something and

156
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:49.260
Rhonda Towne: I saw one of the person he was. I guess he was hanging out with and I just went off on that guy.

157
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.360
Rhonda Towne: I know my didn't appreciate it but I was like

158
00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:05.340
Rhonda Towne: I said, I don't know if you have a mother, but this is my son, whatever the hell you're doing. I said, Do not park with my son.

159
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:20.220
Rhonda Towne: I will come up for you. This is Mom talking. I said your mom. I don't know. She drinks or whatever. What I said that's not our family that's not our household, my son doesn't know that life.

160
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.020
Rhonda Towne: I said just, I said, Stay away from my son.

161
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:40.080
Rhonda Towne: So when the bars closed down. I don't know, in a way, it was kind of a blessing, I guess. So I got him the job where I'm at, just, I don't know, keep an eye on him, or whatever. But he's, he seems to be all right i mean

162
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days a week.

163
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.590
Rhonda Towne: Same as me. Five, six days a week.

164
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:49.950
Rhonda Towne: He's only off on Saturdays.

165
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's the one that has one more year of high school.

166
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.040
Rhonda Towne: No, that's Jacob. That's my youngest one, he said.

167
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.090
Maya.

168
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.040
Rhonda Towne: Maya is just turned 20 okay

169
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And he just was hasn't really found what he wants to do. He doesn't have any passion for anything at this point. So it's kind of he's kind of aimless, you know,

170
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:30.600
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, we gave him. We decided his dad and I decided to give him some time after high school, you know, to do what he wants to do because he's been working since he was 16 they've all my kids have all had jobs at 16 and

171
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.190
Rhonda Towne: I don't know. He's had his own car in high school. I don't know if it was too much leniency, but

172
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:47.490
Rhonda Towne: I, I told him it now. My is time to start going to school. So the summer. I told him I do you want to or not, I will go with you to seeing him.

173
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:58.980
Rhonda Towne: And you're going to register for some classes because you can't keep working these kinds of jobs, you need to you need to go to school, you're still young. Yeah.

174
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.530
Rhonda Towne: I know, yeah.

175
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.130
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, the right thing. He started in high school.

176
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.510
Okay.

177
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So that sounds like the assertive communication that you don't have a second thought around when it comes to your children, you don't really have a problem with speaking your mind with asserting your values.

178
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so interesting. The, the juxtaposition between what you will do to advocate for your children versus what you will do to advocate for yourself. It's like, it's so different.

179
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.460
Rhonda Towne: Yeah i i think i noticed that in a way how

180
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:51.600
Rhonda Towne: I don't know my kids I don't know when it's your kids different versus you always put yourself last summer, like I out

181
00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:00.780
Rhonda Towne: Either you just you just think of yourself. Last one. When it comes to the kids. I guess that I don't. That's how I am. I don't know.

182
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.310
Okay.

183
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.880
Rhonda Towne: I don't know, I, I've seen other women, where they don't even care about their kids are

184
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an extreme. Do you think there are people that are somewhere in the middle.

185
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.810
Rhonda Towne: I'm pretty sure they balanced it out. I mean, they'd be learn

186
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm talking about when I said

187
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: picturing that someone might be in distress. So what's going on with my right now.

188
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The extreme is your happiness is on hold.

189
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus, making sure that you have happiness also

190
00:23:43.320 --> 00:24:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't an either or not. It's your choice, obviously. But my concern, of course, is always if you're not doing things that you enjoy in your life, the risk of going back and wanting to escape into a substance stays high we want to lower that

191
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.170
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

192
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.310
That's my

193
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:15.960
Rhonda Towne: That's what I notice that date, those three days. That was how I mean I've never experienced anything like anything like that with my kids. I never meant never even my mind. My dad even fathom it

194
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.640
Rhonda Towne: And those three days I was like I was so stressed. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't even eating.

195
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:34.650
Rhonda Towne: I think I lost like 10 pounds. And I thought, God, I wish I could escape into something

196
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:51.600
Rhonda Towne: You know, I mean I escaped into something but yet I i'm still there for my son, no matter. You know what I mean, whatever. But I thought I can't do that because just freaking hypocrite. I'm going to tell them no drugs, no nothing. And then here I am.

197
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.400
Rhonda Towne: You know,

198
00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:02.250
Rhonda Towne: I said, I can't do that. I gotta eventually grow up. I'm I mean I'm old. It's time to grow up.

199
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You caught it. That's a big deal. Rhonda what you did.

200
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So now you see why for these months and I think we're going on years at this point when I keep saying let's be vigilant, let's keep looking at relapse prevention, what are the triggers. Is it exhaustion. Is it pain. Is it that you're sacrificing your own happiness.

201
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We needed to keep looking at it and you caught it.

202
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you caught that you had a choice you caught that you wanted to escape the uncertainty, probably a little bit of fear. What's going to happen to my son. I don't know what to do some of those

203
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:40.920
Yeah.

204
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.540
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

205
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:43.380
I was

206
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.820
Rhonda Towne: I mean I driveway and I'd be crying at our

207
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.260
Rhonda Towne: Book, but I didn't show it to them.

208
00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:02.610
Rhonda Towne: I mean I broke down on my oldest son. You know what I mean is it different, but when it came to my, I was like I had to keep my shit together. Okay.

209
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you the neat thing is you thought about the negative consequences. I don't want to be a hiccup hypocrite. I want to be a role model for my kids and part of it is when you call grow up. I'm assuming you're saying stop escaping and use making excuses for using substances.

210
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want that.

211
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: For your kids, right, you're telling your son, don't drink and here you are. Well, now I'm going to go use a drug. So that would make me a hypocrites, you caught it.

212
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what now one more thing you did some crying. Who did you reach out to talk about the feelings, because you didn't reach out to me.

213
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what to did you talk to, who do you trust where you've got to really let it all out. Who are you talking to you through get to get support through this

214
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:53.850
Rhonda Towne: Wow.

215
00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:02.250
Rhonda Towne: I, I will I cry to my oldest, but I think it was a different reaching out versus Randy.

216
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.490
Rhonda Towne: It was pretty much Rodney that

217
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you tell me

218
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.760
What you told him, but

219
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:29.250
Rhonda Towne: At the same time, I, I, kind of, I'm kind of had a hard time because he doesn't have kids, he does not know the closes, we have is the dog. You know what I mean. And I told him. You know what I mean I'm I'm hurting here, my, my heart is broken.

220
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.450
Rhonda Towne: And I said,

221
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.370
Rhonda Towne: It's my it's my on you know he knows about it and

222
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.290
Rhonda Towne: I said it's

223
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.790
Rhonda Towne: I don't know what to knew how to keep it together.

224
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:52.800
Rhonda Towne: And I said, you don't know i mean i said i wish you knew what it was like to have a kid.

225
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.010
Rhonda Towne: You know, you'd give both your kidneys for them or whatever.

226
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:10.440
Rhonda Towne: Yes. Yep. There, there's a difference. Yeah. You know, I said, I wish he knew what I was going through, but he was there, nonetheless.

227
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you were at least able to show some of that what you're sharing. Now, just the, the intensity of how

228
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you scared that something might happen.

229
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:50.910
Rhonda Towne: again in the future. I think he said he's learned is less than alcohol, he goes. Now I know, Mom, why you say you know alcohol is disgusting because it was I only tried it one time and he goes, I promise you I'll never do it again. But the one thing that we all my son Josh and I had to

230
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.800
Rhonda Towne: Was had a hard time with was their dad their dad is

231
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.850
Rhonda Towne: You know what I mean is, I'm not he

232
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:13.860
Rhonda Towne: He understands so much but it's more a district that strict thing like you screwed up. You're out of my house kind of deal. And I'm like,

233
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:28.830
Rhonda Towne: You can't judge him. You can't always not trust him now because of what happened. That's different. I, I told him you. You just have to talk to him, and you can't judge him. I mean, we've all been there.

234
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So did you kick him out.

235
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:39.660
Rhonda Towne: Know, he, he just, he didn't. And he just told me he goes, well, my eye.

236
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.380
Rhonda Towne: You did what you did and we won't talk about it again.

237
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:55.590
Rhonda Towne: That's all he said, man, they just gave him a hug and and stuff like that. But it took Josh and mine to talk to his dad first before he went off on Maya.

238
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:07.260
Rhonda Towne: I tell them, if you question him. If you talk down to him or anything. He will never trust you yet. You won't ever open up to you about anything.

239
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:26.610
Rhonda Towne: He'll feel judged. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And I said, just leave it like it as it is like another day, just don't. But it didn't happen kind of deal just be there for your son me your son's going through some things. Didn't you notice anything

240
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:41.430
Rhonda Towne: And I don't know I text my kids. I don't know how many times a day. And I always ask them, you know how they're doing everything okay today. I've always done that. That's always there.

241
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:45.630
Rhonda Towne: And it just

242
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.080
Rhonda Towne: I honest to God never thought

243
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.540
Rhonda Towne: I'd see

244
00:30:52.740 --> 00:31:02.520
Rhonda Towne: Maya going through any of this. And he does not look like the type I mean he just, he just was the last person I thought would have done anything

245
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.710
Rhonda Towne: But

246
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:12.510
Rhonda Towne: He seems to be fine. And then I was kind of relieved to now that he's working with me keep an eye on him.

247
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

248
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.460
Rhonda Towne: That's my motive. I'm he doesn't know it but i mean you know what I mean.

249
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.920
Rhonda Towne: I just need to know he's there all the time. I just need to know where he is.

250
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:38.250
Rhonda Towne: So, and that's what they were doing was, he was like, well, my boss said, we can file for unemployment and I'm like, No, you're young, you can work.

251
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.570
Rhonda Towne: Those benefits still come from whatever you are working that still your money, save it.

252
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:55.860
Rhonda Towne: For when you really need it. I said, you're young, you can get a job and I call my boss and she was like, she didn't even interview him. She just hired him.

253
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.530
Rhonda Towne: So yeah, I sit here.

254
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.600
Rhonda Towne: That's what I always tell them you guys are young. There's so much you can do.

255
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:18.480
Rhonda Towne: I mean, if I was your age, and I you know what I mean, no kids, I, who knows what I would have been able to accomplish.

256
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if that's part of how your heart aches.

257
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: For yourself to give yourself that space that

258
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You missed out on some of that freedom to

259
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.360
Rhonda Towne: Oh yeah but

260
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:50.850
Rhonda Towne: Like when I was still 19 and I was still having my kids I used him go through a depression phase every May, you know, and I new kids are graduating, because I never i didn't i didn't ever graduate. I used to

261
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.570
Rhonda Towne: would pass like month or two later, but

262
00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:01.080
Rhonda Towne: I mean, when I knew you know when I would hear oh so so graduating, blah, blah. And I'm like,

263
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.490
Rhonda Towne: It just hurt me that I didn't get to do that.

264
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:17.910
Rhonda Towne: Now they have so much programs. You know what I mean, you can still have a baby and still being school and and everything, but back then it was like you didn't do that.

265
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.070
Rhonda Towne: You know,

266
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.020
Rhonda Towne: There was no no option but to drop out of school.

267
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do your when you have your those important conversations with Randy. Do you include okay well let's say we move to Nevada. A year from now, or whenever

268
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you include things like I think I might want to go back to school over there, too, is that part of the conversation or do you keep that quiet.

269
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.400
Rhonda Towne: No, I haven't really said much about that. Um, I just

270
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.160
Rhonda Towne: It's always

271
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.920
Rhonda Towne: We always think about, oh gosh there's more opportunities there to do stuff.

272
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.870
Rhonda Towne: I mean,

273
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.990
Rhonda Towne: Here, like with school

274
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:20.370
Rhonda Towne: Sir, little certain things. I'm like, I, I need help. I gotta go talk to Josh about school stuff, you know, and he he's like, okay.

275
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.560
Rhonda Towne: So, but I think he knows there's an underlining

276
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.280
Rhonda Towne: Wanting to go back to school. He knows

277
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:41.130
Rhonda Towne: And I've even asked her, that I'm like you're a veteran. It's free for you to go to school. Why haven't you pursued more he would have been

278
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.110
Rhonda Towne: An EMT, had he not dropped out like

279
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.650
Rhonda Towne: Almost a year before he was supposed to be finished.

280
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about Randy.

281
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.340
Rhonda Towne: Yeah yeah

282
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So i can i disagree a little bit with he he should know

283
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:08.070
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I know, I, but I'm my woman I'm thinking he should automatically know that

284
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.240
Rhonda Towne: But this I mean

285
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.210
Rhonda Towne: I mean, being here i mean i i

286
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.440
Rhonda Towne: Don't know whole

287
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:16.920
School

288
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been in school, you were gone to school out here and I'm just, I'm just bringing it up. I don't have a second I'm looking at our at the goals of years here and I don't see one that's, you know, you used to have stuff like go back to school, used to be in there.

289
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see it in here anymore, but it used to see. I want to have a savings account make an appointment with hospital look into gym membership. I don't see anything about school, but I know you used to talk about it a lot. I need to register again.

290
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.130
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I need to do.

291
00:35:54.870 --> 00:36:10.830
Rhonda Towne: I know. Well, I believe. Actually, I don't believe, but I know I only have one class left at CNN and I'm pretty much done there. I already applied to you and am I got approved and I paid my dollar theme.

292
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.690
Rhonda Towne: That's the only part that I haven't gotten to it, the financial part of it.

293
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.060
Rhonda Towne: Because

294
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:32.370
Rhonda Towne: I only got basketball for like $2,000 because it's just me. Yeah, would have been different had I had four kids and apply professor, but

295
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:47.400
Rhonda Towne: She was like, do you have Kansas. Yeah. I have four. And she's like, well, you can include them. And I'm like, but they're older. Two of them are older, a mama. You know what I mean. I was trying to be honest. But the lady was like no, you can include them still. And I'm like, No, I can't.

296
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.680
Rhonda Towne: But I read the paper.

297
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, they're not. They're if they're like, under what 23 you can't use them as dependence.

298
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.800
Rhonda Towne: Kenya. This under 18

299
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking for tax purposes, maybe

300
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:10.140
Rhonda Towne: Okay, yeah, they all by older the older to file their own taxes, the younger, too.

301
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:22.770
Rhonda Towne: We just found out Cheyenne was pretty much worthless 18 you know get anything for 18 year olds. You can Jacobs only good for another year he 17

302
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.990
Rhonda Towne: So,

303
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you one question, CNN, just because you already know in your head, what the answer is. But I don't

304
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You have one more class until what happens after one more class. The he

305
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.920
Rhonda Towne: Was no

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

A base.

311
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:51.900
Rhonda Towne: Cheap

312
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.230
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, that will take us seeing them.

313
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

314
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I have one class at CNN left

315
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:10.620

318
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:42.660
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, and all that you and him. I can't take any of those certain the among the majority of the rest of the classes after your associates only had the met you and him.

319
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just asked you something. How much is that class.

320
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:58.170
Rhonda Towne: Um, it's like one of them, I believe, is 894 and a paper somewhere in the house.

321
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.060
Rhonda Towne: Okay, that is one class.

322
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what 894 is it

323
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.540
Rhonda Towne: What do you mean hundred 90

324
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank you. $894 for one class.

325
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.440
Rhonda Towne: Yeah. And then, yeah.

326
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you have, how much of that covered through student loan.

327
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Or four da followership

328
00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing.

329
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.580
Rhonda Towne: That's what

330
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone you have one class that's going to cost $1,000 let's just round it up.

331
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that to sit with that for a second. You could have the ability to sit for the license to work in a field that probably interests you more. Am I right.

332
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:42.840
Yeah.

333
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, hold on.

334
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How many thousands of dollars. Have you paid off on that pile of medical bills that you don't like to look at how much money have you paid off.

335
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.370
Rhonda Towne: Maybe almost two, I would say about almost 2000

336
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that make you think about

337
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:14.640
Rhonda Towne: I mean, I probably I probably honestly would have been done by now. If

338
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.830
Rhonda Towne: Like with this job that he didn't have come up or

339
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:36.120
Rhonda Towne: Something with the kid they needed braces. I tried getting them through through Medicaid Jacob was the automatic approval losses on just kept saying it's an automatic approval because of because of his bike.

340
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:37.950
Rhonda Towne: We

341
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:56.160
Rhonda Towne: I even went to the office took the paperwork everything Medicaid was asking for and it's still an item i, four times and still nothing that's 125 every month just for him and 125 for Cheyenne every month for the next 30

342
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.540
Rhonda Towne: To 50 months for them. So I mean just

343
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.130
Rhonda Towne: keeps coming. And I'm like,

344
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I get it. And that's a trap, and I get. I get it. We could call them golden handcuffs right we're grateful that they're golden we're keeping money coming in, but you may feel trapped at this job.

345
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my question to you, have you sat down and this is, and I know it's probably uncomfortable, but just so we can see real numbers. Notice I wanted to see the actual number because if you sat down and you looked up how much a medical assistant would make

346
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.520
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:41:41.820 --> 00:42:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see it there might be two months where you were sitting on more debt than you are comfortable with. But maybe after the third month maybe after the fourth month you had extra money, not only to pay down the thousand dollar debt to the school, but now you have money.

348
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To pay for things for your kids start to save for a big travel, you know, some big adventure and you're happy going to work.

349
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.870
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

350
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Heaven forbid Rhonda be happy.

351
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. Yeah.

352
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it doesn't say to the world. You don't love your children, it doesn't. There's no way your kids would see it that way.

353
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's look at the timeframe. It's how long is a class. Is it three months. Okay, look at realistically. I mean, if you just black and white, put it on paper. Now, I might not have all the numbers right in my head.

354
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're almost done.

355
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.540
Rhonda Towne: And yeah, I

356
00:42:53.760 --> 00:43:12.810
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I have like they I was looking what I was talking to the advisor at Union and when, if I keep my classes spring in some fall. It'll be within two years, but I always like to go during the summer when nobody there, you know,

357
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just get clear, hold on. I got confused. I heard one class. Now, I hear two years. How do those two things go to tell me what you mean.

358
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:44.190
Rhonda Towne: That's where the rest of the, the, quote, the rest of the the credits. I need like I said some of the classes. They don't offer a seen him. They only offer at you and him. So when I transfer to you. And then I had another two years before I'm done though major classes.

359
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there I had, I was off, I would. You see, I was thinking you only have one more credit and

360
00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't mean done. Okay, so there's more more time, more money, more effort that's needed. Still, it's two years, two years, you've probably been in this program for two years, it passes.

361
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Very fast Rhonda.

362
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:21.750
Rhonda Towne: I know hey I was. I thought about that, especially with Josh. My oldest. You know what I mean. I mean, he has his bachelor's he has, you know, everything in his masters and I'm like,

363
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:35.730
Rhonda Towne: I seen him struggle I seen him go to school, of course, he's really smart young he can remember everything. And I thought, Wow, he's already done, and here I am just playing around. I could have been, you know,

364
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.320
Rhonda Towne: Finish.

365
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:38.910
Rhonda Towne: I

366
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to keep reminding you of the things that you shared with me about what's important, because when I see you. It just looks like sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice and I get on with you. I would give all my internal organs for my children to I'm

367
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: With you on that.

368
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. It's very clear and I will the needle move from that position. I'm with you on that one.

369
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And there are times when parents have to say.

370
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to refuel I need to rest. I need to have meantime it doesn't say to a child, I don't love you and you're not important. It says

371
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I have got to do this job of being a parent and person, but I need rest I need time for reflection I need to read something I enjoy do something. I enjoy. That's part of being a parent to is teaching self care.

372
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Modeling

373
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I'm introducing that part.

374
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Rhonda. I want to, we're at the end of the hour. I wanted to do this thing with you.

375
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I

376
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you do a screenshot of it and maybe we could, if you give it some think

377
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

378
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.100
Okay.

379
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We can explore it next time.

380
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's two pages if you only get to some of it that's fine because they're

381
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So that one. Tell me when you took the picture.

382
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.500
Rhonda Towne: Or

383
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.110
Rhonda Towne: Good.

384
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then here's Page two.

385
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Through 26 to see it.

386
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So when you have time

387
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you're in a moment where you're reflecting hey what about my life satisfaction. Am I just, just give, give, giving. Let me see if I can also take a look at my including self compassion. Am I still paying attention to my recovery, am I paying attention to my long term goals to

388
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be a place to start just kind of take a peek at those and it might be a point of discussion for us. The next time.

389
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.920
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Okay.

390
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's set something in place in. Let's see, April, May be like

391
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you don't know your schedule all the way into April.

392
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Could we say

393
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.660
Rhonda Towne: Okay, April.

394
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Between April 13 and April 17 somewhere. Is there a way to guess what it might work.

395
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.880
