00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:33.030
Belis Aladag: I understand that you have. It looks like I checked to the database. California has a database of controlled substances, so I can see from that that you have a prescription for Suboxone right through. Dr. Moore was the last person.

14
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.990

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.310
Eight dash two

19
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.150
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

20
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.220
Kennerh Blaine: eight milligrams to milligram

21
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.860
Belis Aladag: And how much of those are you

22
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.280
Taking

23
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:16.740
Kennerh Blaine: Um, it's the film and it's one in the morning and one in in in the evening or at night. OK.

24
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.700
Belis Aladag: So the bison day you're taking it um

25
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.710
Belis Aladag: How long have you been

26
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.390
On this medication.

27
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.050
Um,

28
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:40.170
Kennerh Blaine: February 29 I checked into Valley Recovery Center and Sacramento to detox. I was there for five days.

29
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.660
Kennerh Blaine: And then

30
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.100
Kennerh Blaine: The next day,

31
00:05:48.240 --> 00:06:06.180
Kennerh Blaine: I was really didn't feel good and I went in the hospital amid admitted me my potassium was extremely low. And so that started me on the soapbox and then then County is in the process of trying to get a pilot program going and

32
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.070
Kennerh Blaine: When I discharged from the hospital. It was supposed to all be set up. Well, they're still in the process of

33
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.190
Kennerh Blaine: Having it set up. And so, Jake Miller through

34
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.440
Kennerh Blaine: In law hospital.

35
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:31.590
Kennerh Blaine: He's in charge of all this kind of stuff. And so he's been working with the doctor to give me a five days supply

36
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.870
Kennerh Blaine: Every five days until we can find out a more permanent solution.

37
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.100
Belis Aladag: Okay, I see. Well, I see. So you you're very new to this medication and

38
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.390
Belis Aladag: You're looking for stability and continuity and so that's what I hope to bring for you today.

39
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.860
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, that would be wonderful.

40
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:04.290
Belis Aladag: Yes, yes. So that'll be our goal is that we see each other, you know, weekly, are you comfortable in a

41
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.220
group setting.

42
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.820
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

43
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:17.340
Belis Aladag: Okay, so, um, you know, because you've been stabilized. It sounds like on one film twice a day.

44
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:26.910
Belis Aladag: I think you'd be appropriate for a group follow up. Is it, you know, on a weekly basis where we just chat. It's you and a couple other people

45
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:38.790
Belis Aladag: Also on Suboxone use most of them and just a second and say, Hey, how's it going, any questions about the medication, any concerns and then the rest of the

46
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:59.100
Belis Aladag: Visit is run by a therapist who focuses on recovery things, um, because so. So with that, let's segue to that. So tell me about your past history. What was, were you using of using opioids. How did that come to be. Tell me all about it.

47
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:16.710
Kennerh Blaine: Um, yes. On July 24 1989 I checked into a drug and alcohol facility and woodland California and I hadn't shot heroin or drink alcohol since then.

48
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.220
Kennerh Blaine: April of 2001 I had gotten a back injury at work.

49
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.020
Kennerh Blaine: And

50
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:42.750
Kennerh Blaine: It was workman's comp. And so I wasn't taking very much medication, but I was also getting all kinds of other stuff massages and chiropractor and and and then that all physical therapy and then that all just quit.

51
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.710
Kennerh Blaine: And so I did real good on the medication for quite a while.

52
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.250
Kennerh Blaine: And then the last two, two and a half years. My mother moved in with us.

53
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:17.790
Kennerh Blaine: I had to do a power of attorney actually on both my parents and I had to take all the power away from my dad because my mom would go in the hospital and my dad would go AMA or and they get back home and she would fall and hurt herself. And so then she came to move with x and

54
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:36.570
Kennerh Blaine: So anytime she failed or lit needed lifted or whatever I was doing that. And of course, in doing that, the more pain that more Maj. The form as the last pain. The more you do the more meds that cycle. Ensure your

55
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.970
Kennerh Blaine: And then probably the last

56
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.360
Kennerh Blaine: Nine months or so.

57
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.450
Kennerh Blaine: I put both. I had to put both of my parents into a

58
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.110
Kennerh Blaine: Memory care facility.

59
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.240
Kennerh Blaine: And

60
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:04.140
Kennerh Blaine: Income, the emotional aspects of all of that. And so I was

61
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:16.320
Kennerh Blaine: Trying to drown my emotions with the pain medication and staying busy and doing stuff and it got ridiculous.

62
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.380
Sorry about that. That's that must be hard.

63
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.190
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, tough decisions we have to make, you know, I'm a mama's boy.

64
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.490
Belis Aladag: Will you do the best you can. That's all she can ask from you.

65
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.730
Belis Aladag: And me as

66
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.560
Kennerh Blaine: Well, the medical aspect.

67
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.340
Kennerh Blaine: We have medical aspect got more than my wife and I can handle so

68
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.620
Kennerh Blaine: We had to make sure she is taken care of properly.

69
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.820
Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're visiting

70
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.730
Kennerh Blaine: Well, not right now because they're all closed down because of the virus.

71
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.270
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, right. And I'm allowed to go into any

72
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.010
Kennerh Blaine: Lesson hospitals.

73
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.380
Belis Aladag: That's true. I forgot. Oh God, what a. What an interesting time

74
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.450
Belis Aladag: Okay.

75
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.050
I see.

76
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.330
Belis Aladag: Yeah.

77
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:43.740
Belis Aladag: Haha. Okay, so you've been dealing with that. And that's a lot of emotion. And yeah, so you had access to the medication, etc, etc, just got out of hand and then you decided to take control and go into the detox. Right.

78
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.830
Kennerh Blaine: Correct.

79
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:58.320
Belis Aladag: Okay, and then you found out about Suboxone and now do you feel the Suboxone helps you somewhat with the pain as well. It should be helping with your back pain.

80
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:09.240
Kennerh Blaine: It does that and it helps with the craving of the opiate also excellent

81
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:15.420
Belis Aladag: That's what it's supposed to do. You're supposed to be feeling normal cravings.

82
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:31.860
Belis Aladag: And yeah, you still have life's challenges that you you know and and we still have to face whatever we need to face, but at least it's it's a notch easier to stay away from that temptation.

83
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.560
Belis Aladag: With this medication.

84
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.770
Belis Aladag: So,

85
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.790
Kennerh Blaine: Sorry, I agree.

86
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:58.710
Belis Aladag: So, so I say, it's important that we continue it for the time being, and then we'll see how this goes. You know, the treatment could last years, it could be a year. It could be anything you want it to be. We're not in a hurry to get you off of this stuff.

87
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.440
Belis Aladag: If because okay the, the thing is, it's, it's

88
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.680
Belis Aladag: It's helpful to

89
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.960
Belis Aladag: It's helpful to know that the longer you're on it, the more healing your brain goes through

90
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.090
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, it makes sense.

91
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:30.030
Belis Aladag: Because of all the ups and downs of the shorter acting the different opioids. Were you on Norco or oxycodone, or what were you on

92
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.840
Kennerh Blaine: Norco

Kennerh Blaine: Is not really legal problems.

299
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:54.390
Kennerh Blaine: Uh huh. I mean, you know, I have no do you eyes. I'm, you know, not on probation and parole. None of that stuff.

300
00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:13.170
Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay. I'm okay. Good. I'm so glad I'm anything else that we should address that we're not addressing. Oh, nor can. I'm going to prescribe Narcan. Did I tell you this Narcan is a

301
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.730
Kennerh Blaine: Reversal no

302
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:18.240
Belis Aladag: It's, it's

303
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.570
Kennerh Blaine: I agree. Yes, I know. Yes, yes.

304
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:33.270
Belis Aladag: Yeah, and it's a good thing to have around. It's a spray in your nostril. In case your wife finds you you're not breathing. She can use it, it doesn't harm you. If it's not an opioid overdose.

305
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:43.020
Belis Aladag: But, you know, technically Suboxone is in the opiate family. So we like to be careful and give it with that as well. I mean, the likelihood of you having a problem.

306
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.390
Kennerh Blaine: You box. Very little.

307
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:45.960
Belis Aladag: Your well

308
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.810
Belis Aladag: And remember,

309
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:57.600
Belis Aladag: It's good Samaritan thing where you're legally covered if you have to use it on someone else I'm in California, it's

310
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.130
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, if you see

311
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:16.290
Belis Aladag: Somebody passed down. You don't know why. And it's not going to harm them. If it's not an opioid overdose. But if it is you got to call 911 because it's only effective for like 20 minutes to reverse. So then they can slip back into the overdose. Can you got to get them to 911

312
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:18.780
Kennerh Blaine: Okay.

313
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:29.100
Belis Aladag: Okay, so every month you'll receive a manila envelope with a drug test component and

314
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.400

316
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:53.190
Belis Aladag: When you get the envelope. Don't open it, it's very tempting, but don't open it called the virtual clinic first and say, Hey, I got the envelope. Do you want to walk me through this test and then they'll watch you open it.

317
