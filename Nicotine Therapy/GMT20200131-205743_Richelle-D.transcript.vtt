85
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.510
Nicki Cummings: Um, she hasn't. Let me see them. She didn't let me see them last weekend.

86
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.070
Nicki Cummings: Because

87
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.520
Nicki Cummings: I do

88
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:58.200
Nicki Cummings: Because I live with my grandmother as soon as I get my own place. Then I'm planning on getting visitation, because I cannot upload

89
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:11.820
Nicki Cummings: To the visitation either my grandma sick and I can't have my kids come over, or my grandma's feel up to it. I can't have my kids come over and then Alan, which is my biological mother's name will just use that against me.

90
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.880
Nicki Cummings: That's how can I mean she is

91
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.410
Nicki Cummings: Anything for me. She does.

92
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.330
Richelle Direny: Okay. So walk me through walk me through the last week. Walk me through what happened.

93
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:40.320
Richelle Direny: Last week, let's process what happened in the last week. So walk me through everything from what's the one when it started to leading up to what's going on right now today.

94
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.300
Nicki Cummings: Last week she would not let me see my kid.

95
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.570
Nicki Cummings: I was stressed out.

96
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.400
Nicki Cummings: I wanted to use instead of using I took more of my tags. So I'm

97
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:14.430
Nicki Cummings: So I called in today to see if they would fill me a few more savvy tags until I got my rebuilt instead of using I just said more

98
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.440
Richelle Direny: So much more digitized. So how much are you prescribe what is this prescribed dose per day.

99
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.380
Nicki Cummings: On prescribed to savvy texts a day 60 milligrams a day.

100
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.260
Richelle Direny: And how much did you take each day when you said you took more. How much did you take each day.

101
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.080
Nicki Cummings: Three. A day

102
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.570
Richelle Direny: So you were taking consistently in the last three that I'm in the last three per day.

103
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.490
Nicki Cummings: Yes.

104
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.940
Richelle Direny: Okay. And this was because your mother wouldn't allow you to see the kids this week.

105
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.830
Nicki Cummings: Yes, it was because I was stressed out and I

106
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.970
Nicki Cummings: That's just what I did.

107
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:20.250
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right. So what now in terms of for me in trying to help to walk you through just to kind of bring the emotions down because I understand you're overwhelmed. If you're not able to see the kids. You see them on a weekly basis, is that correct

108
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.660
Nicki Cummings: Sometimes if she allows it.

109
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:35.610
Richelle Direny: Okay, so this past week she didn't allow you to see the kids because your grandmother wasn't upset, having the kids over or because you couldn't get to go see them.

110
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.670
Nicki Cummings: Now because she didn't want to bring them she just didn't want me to see them.

111
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.760
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm trying to understand

112
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.240
Richelle Direny: Why

113
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.740
Nicki Cummings: Does not have

114
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.360
Nicki Cummings: She's not rational.

115
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.830
Nicki Cummings: There's no rationality of her

116
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:16.860
Nicki Cummings: She does things inside of me, in spite of anybody. You can call any person of my family and ask them if she's a rational person and they will all tell you the same thing. It's not just me being biased or being, you know,

117
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:28.380
Nicki Cummings: Oh well, just because her mom, you know, she's just talking crap. No, she is a completely irrational person.

118
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.290
Nicki Cummings: That's why.

119
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.240
Nicki Cummings: Because the

120
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.230
Richelle Direny: Other one was the last time you saw the children.

121
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:39.900
Nicki Cummings: Two weeks ago.

122
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:51.240
Richelle Direny: Two weeks ago, and so she did not allow you to see them in the last week outside of this week she still wouldn't allow you to see them in the last two weeks.

123
00:16:52.410 --> 00:17:00.510
Nicki Cummings: No, she won't answer my phone calls to answer when text messages text me back. She doesn't know that

124
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.920
Richelle Direny: Now,

125
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.960
Richelle Direny: Did you try when you text are what were the contents of the text message.

126
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.840
Nicki Cummings: Or the girl doing

127
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.720
Nicki Cummings: Will you tell them I miss them.

128
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.840
Nicki Cummings: I always

129
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:28.590
Nicki Cummings: Try and be a kosher as I can because I don't want to make her mad because, heaven forbid, anyone makes Elena

130
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.710
Richelle Direny: When was the last time you took

131
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.290
Nicki Cummings: Yesterday,

132
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.840
Richelle Direny: So you haven't had any today.

133
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.160
Know,

134
00:17:45.720 --> 00:18:01.230
Richelle Direny: They could it be that you're going through withdrawal because you have because you've been you've been you increase that over the last week, could have been that you you're going to withdraw because you ran out of the sub tasks and now you're not able to get your, your, your

135
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.680
Nicki Cummings: I mean, that could be a reason but

136
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:17.910
Nicki Cummings: I'm not understanding. They said I would talk to you about getting my reveal that I had to talk to you about getting extra insulin Tuesday. So I'm really not understanding what

137
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:30.720
Richelle Direny: OK, so the world. Well, you're in a crisis and you're overwhelmed because as you stated, you have not been able to see your children in the last two weeks. That is a change in

138
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:39.840
Richelle Direny: You know in your norm. Have you been always able to speak with your children have speaking to me. It's not for the purposes of

139
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:47.790
Richelle Direny: Getting the getting a refill me because that's what the doctor does the doctor is the one that gives you the refills.

140
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:54.840
Richelle Direny: But outside of remember you're going through a crisis, you're, you're really overwhelmed, emotionally, mentally, you are

141
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:14.460
Richelle Direny: Like you see your craving has increased. So what you've been doing was taking more than the desired amount of our the prescribed amount of sub so then take getting a refill. It's not necessarily going to change your, your bill your current crisis.

142
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:26.250
Richelle Direny: All it is is that you're trying to numb the pain of the fact that in the reality of you not be able to see the children and because of what's going on with your within your whole family contacts.

143
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.200
Richelle Direny: Within your circle.

144
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.390
Nicki Cummings: Or my, my kids are coming this weekend. So I have no medicine.

145
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:44.640
Richelle Direny: But you have to be saying, Oh, but you have to also be stable in order to see that you have to because and that's it. I was just trying to understand like the dynamic, give me the sequence of events. You'll also have to be stable.

146
00:19:45.210 --> 00:20:02.850
Richelle Direny: In order for your mom to trust that you are not under the influence of anything to see them. And so that's the reason why it's recommended is highly recommended for you to do therapy for you to see the therapist and have a conversation so to speak with me so that we can

147
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:17.430
Richelle Direny: Work through your current crisis, the crisis is not necessarily that you're you're you ran out of the medication you're using your medications to cope with your crisis, you're using the Soviet text to cope with your crisis.

148
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.240
Nicki Cummings: I did this past week. Yes, I did.

149
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:37.350
Richelle Direny: Okay, and that's where it is. So your crisis. It's not that you don't have the Sunday Times, because the reality of it is you still are not able to see the children, you still are in the same situation that you're in. So in order. Now let me ask you this, as your mom have

150
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.900
Nicki Cummings: Coming two days. Oh.

151
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:46.080
Richelle Direny: Oh, but then, so if they're coming today. It's that we need to work through

152
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.280
Richelle Direny: Your emotions right now so that you can get

153
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.930
Richelle Direny: You can get stable to in order to be able to meet with them and to speak with them.

154
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:11.730
Richelle Direny: You've been taking more than the prescribed amount and you're going through withdrawals right now, do you think that is in the state that you're in that your mom is going to trust that it's okay for the children to see you and getting

155
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.970
Nicki Cummings: She drops them off and she leaves.

156
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, but remember the children are. So how old are your children.

157
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.120
Nicki Cummings: Five five and four.

158
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.030
Richelle Direny: So you have twins swimming what girls.

159
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:40.920
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay, so you have twin girls and you have a four year old what yes your children are going to be happy to see you. But then, do you want to be able to see them and enjoy your time with them or still be in somewhat of a state of a high and and see them and you're not really enjoying

160
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.170
Nicki Cummings: The time i'm not high

161
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:51.180
Richelle Direny: No, no, I didn't say your high. But remember, what you're saying is that you need to meet with me, just so you can get the medication that is the doctors call

162
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.910
Richelle Direny: That is the doctors call you're not I'm scheduled to see the doctor until Monday.

163
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.880
Nicki Cummings: I worded that wrong. That's not what I meant. I

164
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.320
Richelle Direny: What, what word of it. Did you word wrong.

165
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.040
Nicki Cummings: I don't know.

166
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:32.940
Nicki Cummings: The dark dirty calling the prescription. If I take it every single day which last week I took too many. I know I did. I called them. I told them I was wrong. I admitted my fault.

167
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.890
Nicki Cummings: So, ask them to call me in a three day script.

168
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.900
Nicki Cummings: To get me through

169
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:49.050
Nicki Cummings: Taking the normal amount that I'm supposed to be taking so i will i put your all's well I have my children.

170
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:57.450
Richelle Direny: But don't you think you are you going through withdrawal right now because you haven't taken it you're going through withdrawal right now.

171
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.520
Nicki Cummings: Yeah. And they called me a prescription. And if I go

172
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.770
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I want you to just, I'm going to repeat back and everything that's going on.

173
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:20.790
Richelle Direny: Right now you called in because you are you're overwhelmed because of, you know, being able to see

174
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:27.750
Richelle Direny: Kind of what your mom has been doing not allowing you to see the children. You haven't seen them in two weeks. You're stating that you're going to

175
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:37.200
Richelle Direny: Today, you're saying you're going to see the kids today, but then you also want to. So I'm just trying to understand in your definition, your state.

176
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:48.870
Richelle Direny: Of crisis. I'm just trying to understand that because you said that you weren't able to see the kids, but the kids are coming today. And then you want your script, what you said the doctor called it in. So I'm still I'm just trying to understand

177
00:23:51.480 --> 00:24:02.040
Nicki Cummings: I don't know, then they told me I needed to talk to you. So that's why I would rather set up meetings with you that that's why I don't understand what

178
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.230
Richelle Direny: We're supposed to but all of it.

179
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:13.260
Richelle Direny: I just want. I just want to repeat back to you, kind of, because it's not just an emotional state of being. It's a mental state of being as well and

180
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:25.740
Richelle Direny: You. It's like you're saying a whole lot of things you're seeing a whole lot of things. And so getting setting up meetings weekly is no problem that is fine. We can set up weekly meetings.

181
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:33.510
Richelle Direny: But you're saying that you you are overwhelmed and right now you're in emotional crisis because of

182
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.820
Richelle Direny: You're missing your children.

183
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:44.820
Richelle Direny: You're missing your children and your mother at times spitefully keep them away from you, whether it's physically being able to see them or speak to that.

184
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:52.710
Richelle Direny: But you're saying that she's going to drop them off today. So you are going to see them today. You'll also want your scripts, because you have been

185
00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:01.560
Richelle Direny: taking more than the prescribed amount. So you want your scripts, you're going to get it. You said that that you were told that if you meet with me, you will get it.

186
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:13.500
Richelle Direny: But you said that the doctor already called it in so you will be able to get it and you have three days. So I'm still trying to understand your right now. What is going on.

187
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.960
Richelle Direny: Right now, that's

188
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:24.180
Richelle Direny: Let's kind of see what I'm saying. Because everything that you're overwhelmed about according to what you're telling me you're going to get

189
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.830
Nicki Cummings: Right.

190
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.420
Richelle Direny: So what is the disconnect. Tell me to connect the dots.

191
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.280
Nicki Cummings: I'm not sure I'm

192
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:43.920
Richelle Direny: sick of seeing your weekly twice a week. That's no problem that's not an issue like you said, instead of when you were told during your intake that you won't be able

193
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.600
Richelle Direny: That you would only call in when you need it or you feel that you needed

194
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.450
Richelle Direny: More than what is recommended that is fine, you will get it. But we still come back to

195
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:05.880
Richelle Direny: What is currently going on. Now let me ask you this. Your mother has, it has had your children for the last few years.

196
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:15.150
Richelle Direny: I care plan that you're working on with it. If you follow whatever there is.

197
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:29.340
Nicki Cummings: No, I have no care worker, I have no doubt me, I am sitting at my grandma's house. I'm trying to get my license. As soon as my contacts come in.

198
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.330
Nicki Cummings: I can get my light.

199
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.080
Richelle Direny: Hold on, taking some of this, I want you to process what

200
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.060
Richelle Direny: Does your mother have full custody of the children or

201
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:39.840
Yes.

202
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.070
Richelle Direny: So your, your parents were terminated.

203
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.810
Nicki Cummings: Yes.

204
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.270
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

205
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.010
Nicki Cummings: Because the judge said that he doesn't feel comfortable

206
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.440
Richelle Direny: Right terminated.

207
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:10.740
Nicki Cummings: Because the judge said he does not feel comfortable giving me because the my kids because I'm not married.

208
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:19.410
Richelle Direny: When was your parents or rights terminated. And when did your mother. Yeah, I was granted full custody of the children.

209
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.480
Nicki Cummings: Two years ago.

210
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:32.040
Richelle Direny: Okay, so for two years. You have not been illegally based on the law biologically, you will always be their mother biologically, no one

211
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.470
Richelle Direny: ever said that from you. Biologically, you are their

212
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.180
Richelle Direny: Mothers legally

213
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.030
Richelle Direny: The law states that at

214
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.410
Richelle Direny: Their mother right

215
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.140
Richelle Direny: And you're saying that that occurred, two years ago.

216
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.770
Nicki Cummings: She's their parent, guardian. Yes.

217
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.900
Richelle Direny: Okay. And that happened two years ago. So your parents or rights were revolt years ago.

218
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.500
Nicki Cummings: Yes.

219
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.330
Richelle Direny: Okay, now

220
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:14.760
Richelle Direny: You're saying what was going on that made you decide, instead of taking two scripts per day as prescribed what what occurred. What was the crisis, what happened that made you increase, increase it to three scripts for day

221
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.300
Nicki Cummings: Three pills per day.

222
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.540
Richelle Direny: Yes, I'm sorry, what what occurred.

223
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:29.070
Nicki Cummings: What triggers just overwhelmed. Instead of using I figured I would just take another one.

224
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.960
Richelle Direny: Okay. So Nicole.

225
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:40.680
Richelle Direny: I'm here for you and I will continue to be here for you, but I need to also be able to work through it with you because if your mother.

226
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.340
Richelle Direny: Has had custody full custody of the children since two years ago.

227
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:58.080
Richelle Direny: And in the last week, you started taking more than the prescribed amount of medication that is the part I'm trying to

228
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:13.350
Richelle Direny: Understand, because if if you being overwhelmed because you no longer have custody of your children that would have been reoccurring since two years ago. But right now, you're telling me that your mother has had custody of your children.

229
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:23.340
Nicki Cummings: That's not the case, it's the case that shit. Let me see them my contacts didn't come in. There's a whole bunch of stuff that happened this week.

230
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:31.680
Richelle Direny: That I'm trying to. That's the part I'm trying to get clarity on so in the fact that she has full custody of your children.

231
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:47.250
Richelle Direny: Over the last two years at some point in time, she has allowed you to still be a part of their lives where she allows you to see them on her. What is on her terms, but she still allows you to be an active part of their lives.

232
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:59.910
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. Now, specifically when you decided, I am just really anxious, I am very overwhelmed life as I know it is falling apart.

233
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:10.830
Richelle Direny: What happened that you said you know what, I need to feel better. I'm really feeling like Luke using right now and I'm going to take one additional script. What was that moment what happened.

234
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:21.810
Nicki Cummings: When she said she wasn't gonna bring her my kids when I called my doctor's office and they said that my contacts were in yet I'm

235
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.560
Richelle Direny: Okay.

236
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.150
Nicki Cummings: I don't know, it's just everything

237
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:37.260
Richelle Direny: I know it's everything at once, but we have to work through it. Now the other question I have is this

238
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.440
Nicki Cummings: I don't have time to work through it. My kids are going to be here and a half an hour.

239
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:49.800
Richelle Direny: Okay, if your kids are going to be there and a half an hour. The doctor called into script. So let me ask you this. What time did the doctor.

240
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:57.300
Nicki Cummings: She says, you'll be ready by 330 but then the pharmacy said that they needed further

241
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.140
Nicki Cummings: They required clarification from Doctor

242
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.160
Richelle Direny: Okay, are you on any other medication.

243
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.670
Nicki Cummings: Yes.

244
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.770
Richelle Direny: What other medications do you take

245
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.390
Nicki Cummings: I take Adderall for narcolepsy.

246
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.840
Nicki Cummings: I take turn, Alex.

247
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:33.690
Nicki Cummings: I take to Mazza Pam to go to sleep. So I have narcolepsy. I've epilepsy, I have

248
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.530
Richelle Direny: Do you have a seizure disorder order, you have a sleep disorder.

249
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.240
Nicki Cummings: Yes.

250
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:50.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, do you have any, um, were you ever diagnosed with any kind of mental illness. I'm not in front of the computer to see what you're about. Do you have any

251
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.180
Nicki Cummings: Generalized anxiety.

252
00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:58.560
Nicki Cummings: And

253
00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.580
Richelle Direny: That's the only

254
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.320
Richelle Direny: diagnosis of mental illness that you were diagnosed with

255
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:19.800
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay, so now your anxiety. You just got really anxious because you don't know what to do, since you haven't seen the children in two weeks, and they're coming over and you don't know you're overwhelmed with the thought of them coming over and you

256
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:25.050
Nicki Cummings: Saw them coming over. I'm overwhelmed with not having medicine.

257
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.360
Nicki Cummings: And me getting rid jaws and throwing up and having diarrhea and everything else and then

258
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.620
Nicki Cummings: All the money was

259
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.270
Richelle Direny: Wrong and all

260
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.220
Richelle Direny: Of that is happening.

261
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:41.430
Nicki Cummings: What's happening today. No, no, it's not happening now, but it will if I don't get my medication.

262
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:59.850
Nicki Cummings: I know they said they caught it in, but the their stupid pharmacy is saying that they need clarification from the doctor when the doctor is the one caught it in. So why would they need clarification from the doctor if the doctor is the one that caught it in

263
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.680
Nicki Cummings: I'm sorry I'm not meaning to yell at you. I just

264
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:12.030
Nicki Cummings: I can't hear you. Good. So I'm thinking, you can't hear me. Good. I don't know.

265
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.330
Richelle Direny: I think I could hear you clear what time are the children supposed to be coming over.

266
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.020
Nicki Cummings: 20 minutes

267
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:30.570
Richelle Direny: Okay. Now let me ask you, Nicole. Do you think that it's the best decision for the kids to come over in the condition that you're in right now.

268
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.280
Nicki Cummings: I feel like feelings.

269
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.920
Richelle Direny: makes me upset and I understand that. But my question is it

270
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:50.700
Richelle Direny: drops the children off in the condition that you're in right now. Do you think that she is going to want to leave them there.

271
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:58.080
Nicki Cummings: I can say upstairs in my room. Wash your job. My kids off when I see my kids I am happier than ever.

272
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.110
Nicki Cummings: My kids are my whole life.

273
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:28.740
Nicki Cummings: When someone took my kids from me. They might as well just dug a hole and buried me in it because it was wrong. They certainly did it Ellen didn't take care of me, my brother, my other brother or my other brother I raised my three brothers. I did know our

274
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.610
Richelle Direny: Did you get an argument with Helen in the, in the last week or so.

275
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.200
No.

276
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.520
Richelle Direny: Okay, it seems like you're really going through bad withdrawals right now.

277
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.780
Richelle Direny: You're going through bad withdrawals right now. So hold on, let me see if I can reach out to

278
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.250
Richelle Direny: Okay.

279
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.950
Richelle Direny: Do you have a support around you.
