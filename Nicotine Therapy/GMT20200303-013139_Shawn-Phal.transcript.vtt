00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.210
Shawn Phalen: New

2
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.750
Randy McWilliams: Lol. I'm not much new. Sorry, I'm just parking here. Here we go. I'm not much new well I shouldn't say that.

3
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.730
Randy McWilliams: Things are kind of

4
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.220
Randy McWilliams: Pretty status quo with job and

5
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.070
Randy McWilliams: Meetings girlfriend.

6
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.670
Randy McWilliams: Therapy here through bright heart.

7
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.220
Randy McWilliams: All going really well.

8
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.410
Randy McWilliams: I

9
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.520
Randy McWilliams: I did get some really good news about field placement and it looks like. I'll be able to do something.

10
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:14.280
Randy McWilliams: That my agency that I work for is doing in conjunction with UC Berkeley at their sleep study Institute. So my clinical supervisor said that it's pretty much a sure deal so that's good.

11
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.600
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, I guess, you know, everything's going

12
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.790
Randy McWilliams: Really well. And considering where I was this time a year ago, which I've been thinking a lot about lately.

13
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.130
Randy McWilliams: It's almost like I don't deserve it, but I know I shouldn't say that, that's ridiculous to say, and it's like, totally selfish to think that

14
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.410
Randy McWilliams: But I

15
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.420
Think

16
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.640
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's all thinking it is, it is. I think it's just that I have

17
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.500
Randy McWilliams: So many reminders, you know, these smartphones.

18
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:06.240
Randy McWilliams: You know, have a tendency to pop up reminders. A, this has happened in a year ago me a mess. And you know, it's all triggering

19
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.160
Randy McWilliams: Everything going really well, you know, and I just need to remember. I

20
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.930
Randy McWilliams: You know, throughout my adult life have been able to

21
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:33.030
Randy McWilliams: You know, build things up and they talked about this, and a lot, you know, having the ability to build your life really well and then tear it down right and that's been kind of my history.

22
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:44.040
Randy McWilliams: Classic history of getting to a really good spot in my life. And then just ruining it right. Well, I have to be aware of that, you know,

23
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.810
Randy McWilliams: Just have to keep doing what I'm doing, going to meetings, I'm being reminded of

24
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.000
Randy McWilliams: You know,

25
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:09.420
Randy McWilliams: You know where I work and everything that you know I've been in the position and I was in the position last year to be almost a client there at the shelter so

26
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.100
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

27
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.450
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. And so I think once you start when you start thinking you don't deserve it. It's

28
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.140
Shawn Phalen: That means that you struck you have to

29
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.140
Shawn Phalen: The gratitude list and then all

30
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.090
Shawn Phalen: You know, writing down your accomplishments, because

31
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:44.880
Shawn Phalen: You know in our day to day stuff with work and everything else school. You know what you're dealing with. It's easy to forget. Yeah.

32
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:53.550
Randy McWilliams: You come and it's amazing when you can sit down and actually put it on paper, what you've done.

33
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.170
Shawn Phalen: In a year and look at how how quickly your life came back together.

34
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.010
Exactly. So, um,

35
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.910
Randy McWilliams: You know, it's always a really ugly. It's almost like doing it like every three months just looking back, yeah. Okay.

36
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.810
Shawn Phalen: Where was I a year ago.

37
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.520
Randy McWilliams: Right. Why

38
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.750
Shawn Phalen: Even where was my three months ago at this point.

39
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:48.120
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, I think it's I think it's a great point. And it's something that I don't do enough of, you know, I go to right. I never do. I never do, and I you know I go to meetings and I stay in, you know, kind of that that mode and I stay really busy and I'm doing a lot of stuff, but I don't

40
00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:04.140
Randy McWilliams: You know when I do self reflect. It's always like, oh my god, I was a mess. Last year, you know it's it's not wait a minute, I'm this is really great. And I'm doing this thing and that thing. And the other thing. It's funny you say that because I

41
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.490
Randy McWilliams: One of the things I had to do for you know this field placement has put together my resume, which I haven't done in over a year.

42
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.350
Randy McWilliams: And

43
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:24.630
Randy McWilliams: The letters of recommendation, the people that I asked said, well, why don't you just put something together, and I'll look it over and adjusted if I need to, and sign off on it because they're busy.

44
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:35.940
Randy McWilliams: And so it was a situation where I found myself writing out you know this letter as though I was writing it on behalf of me of my accomplishments

45
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.480
Randy McWilliams: And it felt. I'm really, really bad about doing that stuff. Yeah.

46
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.490
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's hard to be complimentary towards our

47
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:56.880
Randy McWilliams: Right, we're so used to being hard on or so and exactly, you know, not not looking at all the

48
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:10.650
Randy McWilliams: amazing qualities and all the amazing things that we're doing. And I think it's just reprogram that right. Yeah.

49
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.740
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, and I think also

50
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.710
Being in recovery to

51
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.740
It's it's working. True.

52
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.840
I've killed

53
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.170
And that shame that

54
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.940
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, I think, you know, as you get

55
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:43.500
As you continue to get more sobriety under your belt. Those days of self doubt and

56
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.050
Randy McWilliams: beating yourself up. Yeah.

57
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.210
It goes away.

58
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.440
Randy McWilliams: Yeah. Um, but it does take a little bit of time.

59
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.700
Randy McWilliams: I think so. I think it's gonna take a little. I think it'll take time. Maybe if it does it so

60
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.410
Randy McWilliams: You know, so, you know, there's nothing wrong.

61
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:20.040
Randy McWilliams: Right, because you're you're continuing to do the work, you know, right, you're continuing to go to those meetings and

62
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.960
Shawn Phalen: And you know, when you're in the meeting, you get to hear the newcomers coming in.

63
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.710
Randy McWilliams: here about how

64
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.290
Shawn Phalen: Awful. Now, their lives are at that point.

65
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.430
Randy McWilliams: Oh, yeah. And you get to see them coming in going out coming in and going out right

66
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:50.760
Randy McWilliams: And so, you know, it's also a way to be able to sit there and go, Okay, I was there, and I'm not

67
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.520
Randy McWilliams: Exactly.

68
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.760
Randy McWilliams: He right and my sponsor and they talk about this in meetings as

69
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:10.170
Randy McWilliams: You know, always talking about you know you need to be you're at the point now where you have time and you're back on track.

70
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.260
Randy McWilliams: That you need to be giving back right and then thinking about that. What you just said constantly thinking about

71
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:28.800
Randy McWilliams: The new people coming in and lending them a helping hand. And you know, I do a lot of that at work, but

72
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:47.940
Randy McWilliams: I go to a lot of meetings I work with a sponsor, but I haven't worked with a lot of newcomers. And that's something that was suggested that I do in my spare time just reach out to people by phone or stay at, you know, at the meeting just reach out to people and

73
00:08:49.260 --> 00:09:01.800
Randy McWilliams: And remember, you know, don't start thinking about, oh, I was a mess. Last year, man. I mean, take, you know, forget about that keep moving forward and take some time out for somebody else.

74
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:08.820
Shawn Phalen: You know, and, and, and that is huge and and you know we both know that picture each part of the program.

75
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:21.960
Randy McWilliams: To huge right every and, you know, even just going up to somebody having a bad day and right it will get better. You know, if you continue to come into the right it will get better.

76
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.100
Shawn Phalen: And you're living

77
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.170
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

78
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.040
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, you know, I, you know, as long as I continue to do it on building in them.

79
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:51.630
Randy McWilliams: And remember that like when I start thinking about, you know, reflecting back on bad times or something, you're, you're absolutely right that so it's old thinking it's my old brain trying to trap me into that mode of thinking and if I start thinking negatively

80
00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:05.400
Randy McWilliams: And start my day out with any sort of negative regret this, and that it turns into a case of efforts before I know it. So it's very dangerous thinking right

81
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:14.310
Randy McWilliams: So yeah, I just, I just have to continue doing what I'm doing and be active and with newcomers and

82
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.310
Randy McWilliams: And things, you know, you have time to sponsor someday.

83
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:29.700
Randy McWilliams: I, I definitely could and it's been that's been suggested that I reach out and start doing that with somebody who's brand new.

84
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.600
I wouldn't do that. I

85
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.970
Randy McWilliams: Really would because it's

86
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.560
Shawn Phalen: Giving back you know

87
00:10:40.590 --> 00:11:00.840
Randy McWilliams: Right, and it's even immersing yourself in the program even more. Exactly. Yeah. Because now you get to help somebody work through the steps and you get to guide somebody through right is that they feel like they can't get through, you know, and so

88
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:09.330
Randy McWilliams: It's like even putting your name on a on the call it today. Exactly right.

89
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.270
Shawn Phalen: Because I would imagine you're you speak at the meetings. Right.

90
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.880
Randy McWilliams: I do. Yeah, I share. Yeah.

91
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.530
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

92
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.630
And sometimes at the meeting today.

93
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:40.740
Randy McWilliams: people raise their hand are available to sponsor. Mm hmm. Yeah, they do. And that's what it was specifically that I do, to begin that process is raise my hand when they bring that up at the beginning.

94
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.830
Randy McWilliams: And show people that I'm available to be a temporary sponsor our sponsor.

95
00:11:47.880 --> 00:12:06.870
Randy McWilliams: Just sort of to immerse myself in that giving back mode, right, because that gets you out of here. Exactly. I don't, you don't have time to think about crap. When you're constantly busy helping people. It's, it's absolutely true.

96
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:20.970
Randy McWilliams: Right. And for this feels more than do you how do you convince you that to keep your job and then you do. Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a lean year

97
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.820
Randy McWilliams: Coming up, because I'll be doing. I think I have to do roughly 24 hours a week.

98
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.130
Randy McWilliams: For the field placement shadowing going practical stuff.

99
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:39.300
Randy McWilliams: Supervision, and then I'm going to continue to work 40 hours a week, you know, so

100
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:51.270
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it's gonna be it'll be a hectic time but I'm, I'm excited to get started with it, for obvious reasons, it's much closer to

101
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.080
Randy McWilliams: achieving my goal and

102
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:07.380
Randy McWilliams: You know, getting to be where I want to be there and hopefully move up board and within the agency into therapy role in some license, but um

103
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.700
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it's gonna be busy. It's gonna be a busy year yeah when you start that

104
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:30.240
Randy McWilliams: I'll be starting that they suggest in summer. So probably august 1 I'll get more details coming out. But yeah, probably around end of July, August 1 we'll start shadowing.

105
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.900
Randy McWilliams: Clinicians should be interesting.

106
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.240
Berkeley.

107
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.390
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, the placements at Berkeley, it's, it's crazy. I guess what one thing I didn't tell you as

108
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.750
Randy McWilliams: The clinical supervisor of my specific agency at the homeless shelter.

109
00:13:50.700 --> 00:14:02.070
Randy McWilliams: Is a guy who graduated from my program at St. Mary's and he's been doing this partnership with the school to do practical placements for years, but the school.

110
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:12.120
Randy McWilliams: This year is imposing taped super visions for all their students. So I might have mentioned that. So he

111
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:26.820
Randy McWilliams: They sent him that note, and he said, I'm not doing that. So just based on his own principles. He said, I'm not doing it. You're not going to dictate how I run my clinic so he broke the partnership flat out and

112
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:40.860
Randy McWilliams: So I was panicking and looking all over and and just last week he called me and said, Hey, great news that the agency is going to partner with UC Berkeley.

113
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:54.990
Randy McWilliams: To offer people to help run this sleep study and mood disorder program that they have going through UC Berkeley. And I thought, and he said, so it's a sure thing it's back on.

114
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.890
Randy McWilliams: Specifically with this program and

115
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:09.600
Randy McWilliams: I mean, that's so crazy. And, you know, like other opportunities that could arrive at Berkeley. Oh my god.

116
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.840
Randy McWilliams: Working through UC Berkeley is like

117
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.170
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you

118
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.250
Randy McWilliams: Know you

119
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.710
Randy McWilliams: jackpot. It's like the on my wild this

120
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:39.270
Randy McWilliams: You know, on my wildest dreams. You know, when I went back to school like three over three years ago, I thought had just, you know, want to get into get into this profession, be able to make some more money. It's certainly not about the money in this profession, but

121
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:53.400
Randy McWilliams: I just wanted to change things up by suck. Whatever comes my way has to be better than what I've been doing and blah, blah, blah. And it's just grown into this magnificent thing and

122
00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:17.880
Randy McWilliams: Yeah i at the end. It's with this. I can't remember the woman's name that runs this Golden Bear sleep and mood disorder clinic, but according to my guy. She's like, world renowned for me through it just, it's not all of the see how this stuff just starts piling on serendipitously

123
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.180
Shawn Phalen: And we were talking last time and you were kind of panic.

124
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:29.760
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, and work out. It's crazy. It's just, it's so over the top.

125
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:37.740
Randy McWilliams: For good fortune that I don't even know how to process it fully. I'm just when I was

126
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.200
Randy McWilliams: In Santa Barbara. When I was getting mine master. Yeah.

127
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:50.580
Randy McWilliams: My fieldwork, the people that work at UCSB and the counseling center there. Yeah.

128
00:16:52.170 --> 00:17:04.410
Randy McWilliams: And are now working still working there 10 plus years later. Right, exactly. That's what I think. That's what I'm saying. I couldn't a month could not imagine

129
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:16.680
Randy McWilliams: The doors. This could open it. Absolutely. And and Jonathan these schools are committed. Oh gosh. People don't mean, you know, like why

130
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:29.850
Randy McWilliams: You have a really good opportunity that's that's very exciting. It is. It's very exciting. And I'm very humbling to be able to do it and even more humbling is

131
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:43.530
Randy McWilliams: You know, the great feedback. I'm getting from, you know, my supervisors and this guy, this clinical supervisor who connected the two for this agency program and

132
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.330
Randy McWilliams: He's just
