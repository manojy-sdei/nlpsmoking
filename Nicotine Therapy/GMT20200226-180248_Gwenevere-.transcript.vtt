00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Tasks.

3
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that means we get to do different kinds interventions, because you're not stuck in a car.

4
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.010
Gabriel: I was at a I had an off. I had an office, but there's an adjacent office with events and I just didn't, you know, didn't get too comfortable in there.

5
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Okay.

6
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200
Gabriel: Excellent. So I thought I'd just drive you. Good.

7
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not waste any time. Let's make the most out of all of our minutes that we've got here.

8
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.350
Gabriel: Okay.

9
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you just think about, um, well I start to open up a note. You can be kind of thinking about whether your primary concerns in your life, have to do with

10
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: triggers that happen on a day to day basis, maybe with a girlfriend or maybe it has more to do with recalling things from the past that seem to haunt you right there intruding

11
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In in dreams or they keep coming up and you don't want to think about him, or maybe they're about the future don't want this to happen. I'm so worried. This will happen. So check and see if your primary concerns have to do is present day every day triggers.

12
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The past intruding into your life or worry about the future, just take some time while I open up a note and just give that some thought. Okay.

13
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Something question.

14
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.660
Gabriel: Yeah, we're ready for that one.

15
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.110
curveball.

16
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is your time. So just just have a nice slow rhythm of inquiry, where you decide the focus of today.

17
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you like to kind of start today.

18
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.360
Gabriel: Yeah, I'm an idea of

19
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.390
Gabriel: A few few things.

20
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.210
Gabriel: Come to mind.

21
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.220
Gabriel: Just, you know, a lot of things. I don't know if that that the

22
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.650
Gabriel: Triggers, but you know there are things that I think about almost on a daily basis.

23
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.360
Gabriel: Things with my relationship, obviously that's

24
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:47.730
Gabriel: A day to day thing I'm nursing school is another one that haunts me all the time you know that I didn't get a chance to finish.

25
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's history and then it's also projecting into the future. Do you go to what would happen if I don't finish. Is that what you do with it.

26
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:11.310
Gabriel: Well then, and I imagine you know going back or if I should go back because I don't have that much time with on finished. I have three semesters. That's

27
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.030
Gabriel: Very, very closed and Marty and like the core of my degree and I had to give it a break, because my son was born.

28
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.880
Gabriel: And then again, you know,

29
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.690
Gabriel: I wasn't 100% on that. But I don't know I dream about it all the time. Dreams down back in school and

30
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.950
Wow.

31
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.860
Gabriel: Like all the time because it's been a goal of mine for so long and I spent so much time working on it and I just don't want to let it go.

32
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.560
Gabriel: Yeah.

33
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.730
Gabriel: Especially when I don't have that much time to finish.

34
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.380
Gabriel: And then that ties in. So where do I see myself in the future and how

35
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.630
Gabriel: Stable, am I for what's to come.

36
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.390
Gabriel: You know you're tied into a lot of that.

37
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think in the future. The concepts of stability come up

38
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.150
Gabriel: Yeah.

39
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm currently dreaming about it all the time when it comes to nursing school you're wondering about the past. Did I make the right decision. I of course I did. But was this what I did I sign up for this. And what about the future. So that nursing school piece. That's a big one.

40
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all over the place. That's the past it's here you're dreaming about you literally dreaming about it and you put it out back into the future. Why don't I finish.

41
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to start there.

42
00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:01.620
Gabriel: Yeah, we can talk about that, but I try to talk to Ashley about it, but I feel like she doesn't get it or like maybe she just blows it off because she knows she had something to do with it.

43
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter.

44
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:17.010
Gabriel: No, no, no, I don't blame her. Because while during. It was just, it was difficult to do. We got to participate because she would accuse me of sleeping with my

45
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:43.500
Gabriel: Classmates and, you know, there'd be group activities and, you know, she would say, Oh, why do you have this first number read she actually she actually one time I got, I was I was assigned a project with a fellow classmates and she gave me her phone number and I don't, I'm not too sure but

46
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:57.390
Gabriel: I was. It was me the girl named Deseret another girl and another guy, and we were sitting doing our work at the hospital and one of the girls goes

47
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:09.240
Gabriel: Over the weekend, this girl. She's all she said over the weekend. Someone reached out to me and called me names and why am I giving my number out to guys and

48
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:18.060
Gabriel: That I'm such a whore. And is that when they're seeing school. It's for and then another girl in the class at. Oh, that's funny you say that because it happened to me too.

49
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:34.890
Gabriel: And I was like, really, although I was like, what did they say, and they were like, I don't remember exactly like what is new. It was actually because the way that I told her, was the same way that she presented a text. So I said, I actually did you say these people

50
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.850
Gabriel: And then she's like, No, no, I would never and then the it's funny because I talked to the girls and they're like,

51
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:55.650
Gabriel: And they're like, yeah, it's funny that that happened because the only person, the only guy that I gave my number out is you Gabriel and when we started this project. And I was like, hi. I was like, it has to be her Ashley and of course you will never admit it.

52
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:08.430
Gabriel: But you know, it's one thing and you know we'd get in arguments about enclose this isn't unlike my classmates, like I do, so that would always be an issue with her.

53
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You've told me this story before.

54
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.320
Gabriel: Okay, okay.

55
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But hold on to that.

56
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the invitation today is don't waste a minute.

63
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.590

64
00:08:50.820 --> 00:09:00.450
Gabriel: Yesterday I felt kind of strange. Well, just because sometimes I'm away from my family a lot, you know, like I'm with them so much that now that I'm awaiting them and

65
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.980
Making sure

66
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know. Weird. You have to tell me what we

67
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.920
Gabriel: feel sad. What did I miss them. Tell me.

68
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.030
Gabriel: More my son in

69
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.890
Gabriel: Law, my son, and

70
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I

71
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you miss about your son.

72
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.990
Gabriel: Um, it's holding him and

73
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.300
Gabriel: Him reaching out for me.

74
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

75
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.780
Gabriel: I feel like he needs me there.

76
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.720
Gabriel: But I know that I'll see him tomorrow.

77
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got some decisions to make.

78
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.820
Gabriel: Will only be able to

79
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.900
Attend

80
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And focus on on at least do a decent job of it. If we can pick one.

81
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just touch.

82
00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to what comes up for you see maybe your body in your gut, maybe your chest might kind of inform which which thing which topic to focus on. I'm going to say some things maybe turn turn the eyes, the islands close and not be paying attention to what's coming through the video.

83
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And just listen to the invitation and see which one

84
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is important enough to you as well as maybe urgent, see if there's an urgency.

85
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So the question is, would it be a waste of your time.

86
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: To do work and healing around

87
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Dropping out of nursing school

88
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to yourself tuning in Word.

89
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to what registered as your truth inside

90
00:10:50.040 --> 00:11:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's also consider, would it be a good investment of your time to work through continued accusations of your cheating.

91
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body. What registers important urgent.

92
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking in again on a third idea.

93
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: stability for the future.

94
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're missing your son missing holding him and seeing him reaching out for you.

95
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one needs attention today with me working together so that you can feel how you want to feel about that topic.

96
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.140
Gabriel: I think the the first one.

97
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nursing School

98
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do it.

99
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're dreaming about it all the time. Okay, it's all over. It's about the past. It's about the present the future. It's all connected, isn't it.

100
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's amazing. That's, that's cool. And I'm interested to

101
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now I want you to picture just going in the past, just spend some time lingering with those past choices that were made. Maybe you were in nursing school how it felt to be studying

102
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing a practical if you had gotten that far, whatever the wording is for it just sort of be present with it.

103
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything nursing school

104
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you smiling and not imagery. Were you excited interested feeling smart, all those things.

105
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be present with it.

106
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion you get when you summon up that imagery that nursing school time period.

107
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.250
Gabriel: When it comes to mind.

108
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.810
And emotion.

109
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.870
Gabriel: Um, I feel like I still get excited about it.

110
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, excited. Cool.

111
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And back then.

112
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're right, excited and kind of into it all that

113
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your belief about yourself. At that time, it might be hard to get to. But we're right here and we'll get there together.

114
00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think was making the decisions about how you prioritize and day what to do with your day. Well, I study. Will it go do this, you are operating from a belief about yourself at that time. Do you know what it was.

115
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll know it from an I am if you finish the sentence, I am

116
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.190
Gabriel: Like how I felt when while I was in nursing school

117
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be really careful about the word felt because in here. I use

118
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel for the body. And I use the word emotion for words like sad, angry, those are sort of that right. The amygdala response.

119
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: sad, angry joy longing that

120
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.660
Gabriel: Missing

121
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Missing Your son, those are emotions.

122
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm asking you is an emotion question when you just now visited those images. Right. And I got you said I got excited. That's an emotion.

123
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm asking you to go to thoughts. I'm asking you to go now to that imagery and visit what you believe to be true about yourself back then and finish the sentence, I am

124
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.270
Gabriel: Then

125
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Two months much

126
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: At all.

127
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.090
Gabriel: Because I don't feel the same way so

128
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do my job. You don't have to do my job.

129
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You let you get to just respond, just whatever comes up. Let me do all the analysis you paying me for Medicaid is or whoever is let me do that part for you. Okay.

130
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.150
Gabriel: You don't have to do intelligent

131
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.640
Gabriel: Intelligent confident. Yes.

132
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.450
Gabriel: Capable

133
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I am intelligent confident capable

134
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it true, then

135
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.880
Gabriel: I felt

136
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.110
Gabriel: Confident. Yep.

137
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.460
Now,

138
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is I am intelligent confident and capable from one to seven. How true is it

139
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.400
Gabriel: Okay.

140
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember the moment when you decided, I have to quit.

141
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

142
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you feel that in your body just now. As soon as you remembered it.

143
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And how distressing. Is it to sit with that that memory now from zero to 100 how distressed, are you

144
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.020
Gabriel: I'm doing I'm trying to do with breathing exercises. Yes.

145
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it together. I'll bring it down a little bit and then we can do some work with it. Okay.

146
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to put that aside, knowing that you're in good care will pick them back up. If the distress level comes down. If not, we'll move on to something else. Okay, so first we're gonna yes

147
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing that imagery of the lion.

148
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing that protected imagery and then we're going to all guide you with some breathing.

149
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling safe and calm. You can picture this lion.

150
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is perhaps in between, Mom.

151
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: As a nurse in a uniform

152
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then also your uncle ray in LA, he's white beard uncle to go

153
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So my eyes, he just, he just knows

154
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's mom.

155
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And between them. I believe is the lion.

156
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Or however your imagery works for you.

157
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Really be present with it. I want you to see where you then again to interact with those qualities, with the lion.

158
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.100
With mom.

159
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And the wisdom of Uncle Hugo

160
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be present with it, let it in. It's not just next to you or near you let it saturate

161
00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are a part of that quality you have that lion in you.

162
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You have that nurturing quality in you.

163
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that wisdom.

164
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In you

165
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it be true and let it land in your body.

166
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's any acceptance of that fact that you have those capabilities you have those qualities to

167
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you exhale let that be the last. Exhale, and then let's begin to breathe to live. Early in through the nose when you're ready.

168
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Filling the bottom without long, make sure as if you're filling it a balloon down there in your belly filling it right with that air. The bottom of along very nice let it out a nice comfortable one

169
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.050
Exhale, all of it out.

170
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out for maybe 321 let's inhale through the nose, creating that balloon in the belly.

171
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's hold it.

172
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: In exhale. When you're ready, exhale it all out.

173
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Make it out, inhale through the nose, this time.

174
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that belly gets nice and fall, fall because you're expanding along nice easy focusing very deliberately on that breathing.

175
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And holding in your imagery and imagination.

176
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your team.

177
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're ready,

178
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can come back to our discussion, but you do it on your terms.

179
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing,

180
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Anymore feel like it's dropped

181
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.010
Gabriel: Yeah, like a 30

182
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So 3035 that's actually a useful place to actually have some meaningful change around. It's still relevant. Right. So we're still talking about something important.

183
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not so activating that all the cortisol is rushing over the hippocampus and you won't remember anything new from it. We want it to be sort of in that mid range. So using the skills right that you already have. You were wise enough to know on your own to use that breathing.

184
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To bring that stress level down

185
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like to do

186
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:38.970
He really

187
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Does work it's science.

188
00:22:45.930 --> 00:23:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just this little chemical experiment. We are. We humans. So what I'd like to do is do some positive networking kind of pulling in that imagery. You just did, and also

189
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up that image that you that activated you to 70 but we're not going to put the negative thought which is going to do a positive one we're going to do those

190
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the protective the nurturing and the wise team. We're going to bring them in. Just curious. I'm going to see if it's changed at all. The last time you just did the imagery with those qualities. How did you picture interacting with them.

191
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.120
Gabriel: I didn't see them sitting there.

192
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.360
Gabriel: Looking at me.

193
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.790
Gabriel: Kind of like

194
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.130
Gabriel: Like

195
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.650
Gabriel: They're just standing side by side and we don't really interact

196
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:51.570
Gabriel: Okay.

197
00:23:52.800 --> 00:24:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm gonna do a little bit more with that then. So today's iteration. I'm going to be using the bilateral stimulation, but you're going to hear me probably talking while you're looking

198
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And feel free to

199
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Answer.

200
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine. It doesn't do any harm. We're just going to do it slightly different. Okay, so, and it's going to be right around this this thing. You just did, which is I saw them. They were just sitting there stationary. Okay.

201
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm going to invite you to do is you're on a laptop right

202
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.950
Gabriel: Um no I left my iPad in Albuquerque.

203
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.050
Gabriel: Okay, so we'll do our cell phone.

204
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go grab. If you've got a, like a shampoo bottles or something. Two of them beautiful right next to each other right on the outs on the outside of your phone.

205
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Good need to be about shoulder width apart. So take your shoulder width and move your hands forward and kind of drop them right in front of you. So they're right about there.

206
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when I watch your eyes. I don't want to cause I strain. So I'm going to point to one of those cups and you look at it, look at the cup. You're looking at me. There we go. Good. Look at the other cup.

207
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to look at me only the cup you'll kind of see the rhythm out of the corner periphery of your eye.

208
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So if there's a little

209
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Delay like just now. There was one, there was this little delay you keep with the same pace. It's very unlikely that during what I call an iteration. I'm going to change the tempo.

210
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just continue left or right. Okay, until you hear me say let's

211
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through the nose, and then exhale, it all out. And then I say,

212
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.500
What's coming up for you. OK.

213
00:25:47.730 --> 00:26:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, I'm interested in everything. I'm interested in your body. I'm interested in your thoughts, your beliefs that passed before you new images and emotions and try not to censor

214
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

215
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what's coming up. So it's going to inform what I do next. Okay, there's no no wrong way for you to do this wrong.

216
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all on me.

217
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

218
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Check in with your body. Real quick, make sure there's not a huge charge going on right now. Are you still in a relaxed body.

219
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.230
Gabriel: Yeah.

220
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but maybe there might be a little bit of residual apprehension, because I told you we're still going to visit that day that you decided, I have to say goodbye to this nursing school right and might be still some some emotion around that so well you know have to talk about it.

221
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to just see what comes up. So you're going to be doing two things right now.

222
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to pull up the WORST piece of it that worst image that you caught when you pull up that day that you had to make the decision.

223
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And at the same time, I want you to have your team at this point sitting there, just the way you had them.

224
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But if they change and they do other things I want to know about it. But right now, kind of do what you had just bring your awareness of the team worse picture.

225
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And being present with the team. OK. And now I want you to look at the different cups back and forth at the pace that I said okay so looking over here.

226
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold that. Worst Picture.

227
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And be present with your team.

228
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to think if there's someone you want to ask a question of

229
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's someone you want to ask a question of this sitting in one of those chairs.

230
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's inhale together. Inhale.

231
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, it all out, letting it all go

232
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gently.

233
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To what comes up for you right now.

234
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.710
Gabriel: A feeling good.

235
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.700
Gabriel: Is it

236
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A sad feeling

237
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so I'm feeling sad and what are you picturing right now.

238
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.430
Gabriel: It is like a picture, talking to my mom.

239
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.410
Gabriel: As, as I see you're standing in

240
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.780
Gabriel: A picture that

241
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.550
Gabriel: If she

242
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.180
Gabriel: If she thinks I'm a failure.

243
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what does she say to that.

244
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.970
Gabriel: But I still feel that

245
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel

246
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna go with that you're doing okay hang in there. All right.

247
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that imagery, this is, this is going to be okay. You're going to be okay.

248
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think of why you're

249
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.620
Protected figure

250
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I still think I am.

251
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm a failure.

252
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's shift gears.

253
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little different activity than that one. Okay, we're going to pull away from that one. I'm going to do something else. We're really lucky because you're in, you're in a room where we can do all kinds of different things. Okay.

254
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.960
Gabriel: Okay.

255
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is different to does take a little bit of logistics.

256
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.590
Gabriel: But

257
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're gonna like it.

258
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Afterwards,

259
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

260
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn, turn the phone down just a bit because I'm going to need to be able to see

261
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming there's a bed and a chair. I'm going to need to see both seating arrangements, because I'm going to be wanting to do this with you. I'm going to be wanting to have you sit here and you'll be facing the bed. I'm assuming you don't have another chair in there. If you do, then

262
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.600
Gabriel: Put the other chair in the mode. Yeah, there's another train

263
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The ideal is this, you have a chair here.

264
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to need to see you in both so right here on screen sit in the other one so I can see if I'll be able to see you.

265
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, nice. It's already set up. That's beautiful. Okay, now stand up from both of them stand back from them. And I want you to look at these two chairs.

266
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to decide.

267
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Who

268
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is sitting in the left chair, who is sitting in the right chair. Are you sitting

269
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: In one of them and his mom and the other is that the question is that the conversation we need to have today around. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. Yes. Still, thank you think I'm a failure. You want mom in the left chair or the right gym.

270
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then you sit in the right one.

271
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So this takes some visualization just sort of picturing her there on us.

272
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture her you know you had asked her, Do you, do you think I'm a failure.

273
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And try and picture her face.

274
00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.130
Right.

275
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is different. We've never had this before we get to have this experience. Now, I'd like you to tell her your own style your own way of talking, find your own words, Gabriel, not one of yours words I kind of still don't believe your mom. But you find your own words and tell her.

276
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.750
Gabriel: It's not that

277
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.950
Gabriel: I don't believe her no

278
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not gonna talk

279
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: She's right in the chair. This is a really different technique. Mom, it's not that I don't believe you.

280
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.830
Gabriel: I just feel like I am.

281
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.030
Gabriel: I know that you know one thing that I will failure.

282
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:51.750
Gabriel: I know that you know that I'm not a failure be successful and other thing that I still feel like I

283
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Switch chairs over there, you're going to be long for a second.

284
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at your son.

285
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: DO YOU SEE HIM HURTING.

286
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you, Mom, do you know what to do.

287
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:22.950
Gabriel: No.

288
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Does anyone know what to do to help your son.

289
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: With his inner critic. He's been really hard on himself.

290
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But he doesn't. We're in this is the reality, who scan the landscape of resources, Mom.

291
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows what to do to reassure your son.

292
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That he is capable confident and intelligent and he does not have to have a penny in his bank account. He could only have that shirt on his back.

293
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: remind him of that truth is not using

294
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.940
So,

295
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's switch back to me and you for a second. Go sit over there.

296
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to see your mom and she just was unable right to to really help you out of that moment really look at her maybe seeing her for the first time she simply did not know how to help

297
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel emotionally around your mom that she did not know how to help you out of that negative

298
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Inner Critic that you get yourself into. How do you feel around that.

299
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.130
Gabriel: I feel like she's right.

300
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.280
Gabriel: Like I should not feel like you're, you're right.

301
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.240
Gabriel: I do need to find the strength within myself.

302
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.080
Gabriel: Because I have all those qualities already. I just need to read surface.

303
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.430
Gabriel: smart I am confident. I am intelligent

304
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.050
Gabriel: I just kind of lost my way

305
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.860
Gabriel: When I failed at something I was

306
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.730
Gabriel: SO CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN

307
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Switch chairs.

308
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So mom when you heard your son say he failed at something. Do you understand what he's talking about sales.

309
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.520
Gabriel: Whoa wasn't, I wasn't

310
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.490
Gabriel: That you failed at something

311
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.020
Gabriel: It was you were unsuccessful at that time.

312
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.560
Gabriel: You know, just like

313
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:40.680
Gabriel: You know, many famous boxers in the in life. You know, it doesn't matter how many times they fall it's

314
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.610
Gabriel: How many times that you can get back up and continue the fight.

315
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Man Have you seen him before when he's been knocked down. Can you remind him all the time.

316
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To remind him.

317
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.190

Gabriel: Yeah yeah

319
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:06.870

320
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.110
Gabriel: He thought it was the end of the world.

321
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:26.550
Gabriel: Or when you were unsuccessful at nursing, for the first time, because you wanted to. You thought you were smart enough to have a full time job and go to nursing school full time at the same time you got further than even this time.

322
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:36.780
Gabriel: He got back up and then he went back in again and you know slowly get back to where you want to be.

323
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Switch.

Gabriel: Yeah, Mama. You're right. Yeah.

327
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.020
Gabriel: I guess these are things I've always known. I just need to remind myself.

328
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.940
Gabriel: What am I time

Gwenevere Abriel: And now when you look at your mom and she's had said to you earlier. You're not a failure.

331
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.830

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Perspective of expectation of

338
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell your mom about how excited you used to be when you're in school.

339
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:35.190
Gabriel: Yeah.

340
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.040
Gabriel: I was excited because my goal was to

341
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.090
Gabriel: Eventually, open up a little clinic.

342
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.060
Gabriel: And have a little practice somewhere.

343
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.540
Gabriel: That's what I wanted my life to go

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.510
Gabriel: And look at you like,

345
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.180

346
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's taking longer look at your mom's face. This is what I wanted to, I wanted to open a clinic and have my own little practice and it's taking longer than I thought it would look at her face. She

347
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she look like does she say that

348

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:43.320
Gabriel: Know,

353
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.470
Gabriel: Yeah.

354
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like to be with that kind of unconditional

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:55.890
Confidence.

356
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have anything left over a question or a statement to tell her a story to tell what's left in this conversation with mom.

357
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.900
Gabriel: Yep.

358
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, switch seats.

359
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Seal that did you share your son, after all that he has this to give. And indeed, he returns it to you.

360
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And says I love you.

361
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.530

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

364
00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not know how all the little steps, but you will be okay.

365
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

366
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.670

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go sit there on the other side as Gabriel and take in what you heard

368
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice of a part of the rails against it, or wants to reject it, or if it's, yeah. That's the truth.

369
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now moving into the mindset of future

370
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You to picture that this conversation.

371
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is something that maybe

372
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be about your future and nursing school and see what comes up for you.

373
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.000
Gabriel: Nursing School in the future.

374
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and your mom sitting there just play with it.

375
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

376
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: WE WERE DIPPING INTO THE PAST. Now we're dipping into this hypothetical future playing with the future now.

377
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: She's still sitting there this time you try on hypothetical

378
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up.

379
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.690
Gabriel: I'm

380
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.640
Gabriel: Just a lot of things about you don't want to continue going to nursing school if I want to pursue something else.

381
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's tell her and see what happens. We'll do a couple of back and forth on this and see what happens with it. So, just tell her I'm, I'm not sure. Let's just say

382
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.690
Gabriel: If I want to go to nursing school anymore. I just

383
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.810
Gabriel: Feel like it's something I have to finish.

384
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A switch

385
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to that mom.

386
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.760
Gabriel: The decision is yours, also for you either way.

387
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is yours all supports either way.

388
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.340
Gabriel: Yeah, thank you.

389
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.380
Gabriel: Know,

390
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell me more about, I have to finish.

391
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.990
Gabriel: I just feel like I've invested all this time.

392
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.600
Gabriel: And

393
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.440
Gabriel: I don't want it to have gone away.

394
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So since

395
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.230
Gabriel: That something you're gonna have to decide.

396
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.140
Gabriel: Maybe you give it another shot.

397
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.550
Gabriel: Maybe in one sentence, what

398
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:45.180
Gabriel: You can redo the past and you must let the past go

399
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:47.610
Gabriel: And move forward.

400
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.900
Gabriel: And remind yourself that you are strong.

401
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.590
Gabriel: Confident individual

402
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.260
Gabriel: No matter what

403
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Sets.

404
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.070
Gabriel: Think I needed to hear that today. Yeah.

405
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Really make sure it's completely

406
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Understood.

407
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but

408
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It will have been a waste of time.

409
00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And resources, make sure that's

410
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely addressed.

411
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to mom about this old belief of

412
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: How to finish what I start or have to think it's a waste.

413
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Real slow on this one.

414
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:19.020
This is hard. This

415
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not the only version.

416
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Of reality or is that, is there another way to look at time spent resource.

417
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: knows more about that her you

418
00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.530
Gabriel: time wasted.

419
00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you can't waste it. Does that come from that from you. Gabriel from mom from dad. Where's that come from. Do you know

420
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Scan uncle Hugo scan the lion, see if you can figure out where that doctrine right where that comes from. Once you start to finish. Otherwise, you have to think of it as a big ol wasting your time in finish it.

421
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.810
Gabriel: I think it's just something that I've always

422
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Asked him, do you recognize this from anywhere.

423
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we don't know till we get there.

424
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: trust the process.

425
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, one more, one more switch and see what happens.

426
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.700
Gabriel: Do you feel like you

427
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.530
Gabriel: Don't continue

428
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Shut up.

429
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.400
Gabriel: Makers.

430
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.940
Gabriel: You learned something while you were there.

431
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:49.710
Gabriel: And I know many people that have graduated and become nurses and go on to do other things.

432
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:56.850
Gabriel: Yeah, maybe you don't want to be a nurse anymore, you just feel like you have to do.

433
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want for your son, most of all,

434
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.170
Gabriel: To be happy.

435
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.810

442
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell him what you see, you see the changes. This is a good time to remind him and then we'll end with this you know what you've changed. I remember you liked these things you cared about these things and now just remind them how he's changed.

443
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:04.410
Gabriel: You know you've gotten wider at the older you have a family now.

Gabriel: airplanes and

451
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:39.750
Gabriel: rental cars.

452
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see

453
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see as priorities have changed.

454
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.820
Gabriel: Yeah yeah

455
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And what ways. Let's take care more about

456
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.010

457
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.980
Gabriel: making them happy.

458
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.430
Gabriel: And there's something to be proud of. Yeah.

459
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.850
Gabriel: And that takes intelligence and confidence and

460
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.450
Gabriel: Strength to be able to get there.

461
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.140
Gabriel: And they keep the family together, which is very difficult.

462
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.510
Gabriel: You sacrifice a lot

463
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's come back to this real world here and out of imagination.

464
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that weird that that could be

465
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.920
Gabriel: Field effect you also yeah

466
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, when you go haha

467
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life is before you

468
00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Were once, maybe there were some constraints to it.

469
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see that

470
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You have choice and it's both a privilege and a burden.

471
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're forced to do something, we may rail against it. But there's a part of us existentially that's grateful. We don't have to decide our future. It's one of those big existential right

472
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a God my questions freedom.

473
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:26.790
Is King

474
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have it nonetheless you do get to decide what you want to do. You're very fortunate that you get that. But it's hard.

475
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.810
Gabriel: I feel like I got a lot off my chest.

476
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: People call it an emotional pound of flesh.

477
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so, um, something came up while you were talking. I'm going to make a little note in your record, and we all invite you in the future to maybe revisit this concept that you brought up, which has to do with once I start something

478
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Once I invest in it. Once I sacrifice for it. I have to finish it. So I might want to revisit it again because it might show up in other places in your life.

479
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll, we'll maybe I'll see it's always up to you. I bring things up. You can swatted away as an interesting or not important but I might bring it up again in the future. So let's schedule. Our next appointment. I feel like two weeks is working, unless you want to change something

480
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.540
Gabriel: To it. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh cool, then I will see you in group.
