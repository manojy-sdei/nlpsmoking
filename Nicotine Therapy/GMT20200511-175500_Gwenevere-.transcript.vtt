55
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:46.710
Nadine Quintana: And you know, I just try to on showing them that I'm going to be there for him. It's no matter what he says, no matter what you

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.600
Nadine Quintana: Know,

57
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but let's

58
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get into a little bit about what

59
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What's upsetting. Let me hear a little bit about what this means to you that your son is is in a car treatment. What does it

60
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean to You.

61
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.260
Nadine Quintana: Well, I mean, to me, it's a good thing.

62
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.890
Nadine Quintana: I

63
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.710
Nadine Quintana: Think a part of me is like, glad that he's there, you know,

64
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.990
Nadine Quintana: But then there's a part of me that just

65
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.670
Nadine Quintana: Wanted to confirm

66
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It. That's a solution. So what's the other thought, I'm glad he's there and he's getting, is that right treatment.

67
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.450
Nadine Quintana: The treatment. Yes.

68
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.530

Nadine Quintana: We can remember

70
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the opposite thought of. I'm glad he's there was the opposite thought

71
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.500
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

72
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so your tears are saying something they have, they have a message that's the other side. I'm glad he's there at the tears, they, they have a message to

73
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did the teacher saying

74
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.380
Nadine Quintana: miss him and then

75
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.050

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

77
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

78
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now when you just take day talking with him every day. Do you get a sense that he is being honest with you.

79
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

80
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And in your imagination. What's the fear, how can he get sort of hurt. What are you scared will happen. What's the fear.

81
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.030
Nadine Quintana: I'm just, I'm

82
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.230
Nadine Quintana: Like okay, we're being alone. That's what I'm

83
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.500
Nadine Quintana: Worried about

84
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.210
Nadine Quintana: And then he's so far away from me that

85
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.630

Gwenevere Abriel: Observation never seen your son walk away onto a plane. You've never had this you've never been away from him like this is all new, new, new, new, new and it just got really intense.

112
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know these feelings will have and know they're going to pass, but this could be an opportunity for you to connect with your son.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're on the phone with him.

114
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it you want to check out an assumption about you have some stories in your head about worried about his anxiety and if he's scared if he's alone. Remember, you're putting yourself out there sort of in the imagination of what he's going through a new

115
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Study you

116
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:53.310

118
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:21.720
Nadine Quintana: I know he's not going to get her. I know if anything happens to him if he gets anxiety or he gets something I know that they're going to be there for him to to help him they cute, he won't be alone. You know, and

Nadine Quintana: I'm so excited when I can be

148
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.160
Nadine Quintana: Okay, the brain doesn't work.

149
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Very well. So we're going to get. We're going to get over to

150
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling better, we're going to get there, but I want to just make sure that all if there's any kind of irrational kind of thinking going on. I want to just just clean it. Okay, so if there's any said so just stick with that this whole thing has made me feel hurt.

151
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does he say back to that.

152
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.140
Nadine Quintana: You just saying, I know, Mom. I know he's handsome. He's sorry

153
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:11.430
Nadine Quintana: He just has me know that he misses mean that he loves me and he just want wishes he could be here with me.

154
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he truly what I know that you miss him and his literally not being near you is very distressing.

155
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: He knows

156
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.040
Nadine Quintana: Yes.

157
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So no matter what he knows he's missed

158
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's wanted. All right.

159
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And isn't that what you would want

160
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Also

161
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If something like

162
00:16:53.910 --> 00:17:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This, you would have a chance to work through something, and at the same time be wanted loved and missed

163
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Yep.

164
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, both

165
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you need to do to take care of yourself while he is taking care of himself. What do you need to be doing.

166
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're back. So what I'd asked you was what what you needed to do to take care of yourself in order

167
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of continue to write this

168
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.330
Nadine Quintana: Was gonna say like

169
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.180
Nadine Quintana: I need to take care of, like, my house. So I could be there for him.

170
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So who so

171
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This notion of disrupted sleep. I want to understand more about I worried. Notice I worry about his anxiety.

172
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know anything about all the races anxiety. What are you talking

173
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you worry about his anxiety anxiety knows how to take care of itself. What, what are you worried about

174
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.320
Nadine Quintana: Because he gets like I don't know. He gets a panicked and he

175
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:45.750
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. He just a cute puppy gets panicked and feels like he can't breathe it and he and I know actually I know that feeling that he makes it you know so

176
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.080
Nadine Quintana: And determine a normal day healthy. Okay, I know he will

177
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you teach him about some of the practices that you do that you've learned here about breathing and grounding yourself, did you teach them those things when he panics.

178
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.960
Nadine Quintana: Well, I just tell him like, you know, I just tell me breathe. Just breathe, you know,

179
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.610
Nadine Quintana: Calm down, like when he has had a panic attack in the past.

180
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:26.670
Nadine Quintana: You know, which is a which is Tom. They just read unless they, you know, do you know you're going to be okay. Or, you know, and just talk to him a girl calm and just try to get him to

181
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:39.180
Nadine Quintana: To, you know, come down and get his breathing, right, like I've never really taught him like you know anything about the box breathing or

182
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.540
Nadine Quintana: You know, try to get his mind focused on like

183
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.160
Nadine Quintana: What I told him I told him by faith to try to get his mind focused on something else like I've told him stuff without

184
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Work is he

185
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it

186
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.270
Nadine Quintana: Eventually, he, he, you know, he comes, you know, he starts to be okay and so

187
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what his panic thought is, do you know the thought that goes with the body's heart rate and short breath. Do you know what he's thinking about

188
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.460
Nadine Quintana: No.

189
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: he think he knows what his panic is over.

190
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.470
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

191
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.740
Nadine Quintana: To be honest with you when I I've never even thought to ask him.

192
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.080
Nadine Quintana: And I, and I should have, you know, for

193
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of more about the should maybe I think

194
00:20:52.860 --> 00:21:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's some still some areas. It's my impression. Anyway, that there's still some areas of your on psyche that you haven't asked yourself. And so if you can't ask yourself, how can you ask your son.

195
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.110
Nadine Quintana: So,

196
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be some things going on there that make it sort of just doesn't come to mind to say what's going on inside and

197
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think about that this thought maybe makes the heart race, but this one doesn't. Or maybe it's a memory or maybe

198
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he doesn't remember what it was. He doesn't have

199
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That trigger is what was the sight, smell sound and he doesn't even know

200
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And he can figure that out. Right. But some professional help. They can ask those questions.

201
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

202
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now just curious just sort of those big pieces.

203
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that it that he experiences.

204
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there a specific onset of that from an event that you remember like maybe after the break in or something. And there was a kind of a timeline, where it started.

205
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.820
Nadine Quintana: I think I kind of have like

206
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.560
Nadine Quintana: An idea and I and I let the doctors know I've been keeping in contact with them.

207
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:35.610
Nadine Quintana: But I noticed that on dressed like he was, he had a real good relationship with his dad.

208
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.630
Nadine Quintana: Thank you. Minutes that was really, really close and undress was like a whole different you know

209
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:54.270
Nadine Quintana: Kid, you know, and like his dad ended up going to prison, and then he was really close with my dad and then my dad passed away and then I'm

210
00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:05.040
Nadine Quintana: He's got close to my brother, but then my brother went to the state police academy and then he started his own life. And I don't know, I think part of

211
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.140
Nadine Quintana: Interest.

212
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

213
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:27.180
Nadine Quintana: Thank you. What's up this wall, and he he's angry because of maybe it's a case PROTECTING HIMSELF of, you know, getting abandoned or because he tells me things. I call you weren't there for me. You were never there for me. And I know he knows I was there for him but

214
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.860
Nadine Quintana: I think maybe that's

215
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.210
Nadine Quintana: A way of him.

216
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.070
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, protecting himself.

217
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that sounds right.

218
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're, you're that therapist. Right. You're the one that this, this, he's acting out with you what he can't say to a man a trusted man. He can't do it because they keep believing him.

219
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so he acts out his anger and resentment towards you.

220
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're right. Don't you think you're onto something.

221
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.680
Nadine Quintana: Here.

222
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:09.270
Nadine Quintana: I know you know I get the doctors to know that and I let them know all of that, you know, maybe they could them.

223
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.980
Nadine Quintana: Somehow, pull it out of him and see that's

224
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.620
Nadine Quintana: That's the reason

225
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.710
Nadine Quintana: But

226
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.940
Nadine Quintana: Another reason to I had wanted to talk to us because I don't

227
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.230
Nadine Quintana: I don't really feel like I'm

228
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.380
Nadine Quintana: saying anything in front of group right now.

229
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:43.200
Nadine Quintana: And then I was going to let you know that if the doctors call me because the doctors are supposed to call me today in that we know

230
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.280
Nadine Quintana: What's going on today in and stuck in

231
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:55.440
Nadine Quintana: You know, if I'm on group and then I just happen to leave. It's because they ended up calling me or something, you know,

232
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.130
Yeah.

233
00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:58.650
Nadine Quintana: And I mean I'm

234
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.990
Nadine Quintana: I'm just not ready to talk about it.

235
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.810
Nadine Quintana: In front of group right no

236
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, I understand.

237
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And all the above just just fine on if you decide to just sort of sit there and listen. That's fine. If you say, I'm just going to pass on this. I think the doc would understand

238
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll let her know that you get with me today.

239
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this is all good. I think you reached out for support. I think you have some awareness that the intensity

240
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is at least in part a small part due to lack of sleep, um,

241
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But while we're here,

242
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What about your own

243
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Abandonment though. What about your own. How does it parallel maybe what's your

244
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.040
Nadine Quintana: I know for

245
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:42.870
Nadine Quintana: I don't know for like a while they're like I felt abandoned and my husband and I held a lot of regret and

246
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.470
Nadine Quintana: hatred towards him.

247
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:57.990
Nadine Quintana: Because I felt like he liked me and the kids and I know if it wasn't his intentions to work.

248
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:07.530
Nadine Quintana: For a big for a long, long time. I felt like that too late and I just hated him.

249
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.410
Nadine Quintana: At that point,

250
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:23.460
Nadine Quintana: For the longest time I just, I couldn't be with him. I hated everything that she he had did I hated him for leaving us he did him for leaving me alone with the kids.

251
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.070
Nadine Quintana: And he was like, only you know person I felt like I really had in my life, and then

252
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.250
Nadine Quintana: The one person. I had my baby. I just left. You know, and it felt like he just

253
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.050
Nadine Quintana: Left me

254
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:59.940
Nadine Quintana: And for a long, long time. I was so mad with terminate needed him and I need to talk to me. I just wish that he would I wish all the time like I wish would just mess up. It was she would give me a reason to me, you know,

255
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:07.380
Nadine Quintana: And I was really angry and you know I had to learn how to just like forgive forgive them for

256
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:16.410
Nadine Quintana: For that, you know, when. Because if not, I was just always going to stay stuck in the past. I was always going to be angry and I was always going to be

257
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.960
Nadine Quintana: I was always going to have hate

258
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.100
Nadine Quintana: And

259
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.450
Nadine Quintana: Since I've done that. Like, I, I feel a lot better since

260
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.020
Nadine Quintana: You know with with my husband.

261
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:38.370
Nadine Quintana: I feel like now we have a better relationship we have a more open relationship. I'm able to talk to him about

262
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:46.440
Nadine Quintana: About things when when stuff are bothering me to talk to him about it and it feels like she really really good.

263
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.170
Nadine Quintana: But for a long time. I was angry and hurt.

264
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.180
Nadine Quintana: So I could get. I can see how

265
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.110
Nadine Quintana: See how you know

266
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about how you felt when your dad.

267
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Passed away.

268
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.010
Nadine Quintana: I just felt like it was

269
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.460
Nadine Quintana: Like fair. I felt

270
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:36.810
Nadine Quintana: First, I was like, really mad at first because I'm like, why are you here mic.

271
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.880
Nadine Quintana: I was just a

272
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.370
Nadine Quintana: You know, like my dad was my dad was a very, you know,

273
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.810
Nadine Quintana: How do I say it.

274
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.320
Nadine Quintana: He was a a main tab. But he was a girl, you know, you would just put in us and stuff but

275
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:19.290
Nadine Quintana: My dad was a really good god he was always there for us. And I just got like why him by quite a day why he had to go like for the longest time I thought like, why could it have been somebody else.

276
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:28.710
Nadine Quintana: You know, but then eventually I came to terms that you know my dad was really sick. And he was hurting, and he wasn't paying them.

277
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.600
Nadine Quintana: I would have rather you know

278
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:49.020
Nadine Quintana: This has happened to him and you know him going in his sleep in him going peacefully then to be in the pain that he was then having to go through dialysis and having to

279
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:58.500
Nadine Quintana: You know, just always been in pain. And so eventually I came to terms with that. But for a long time. I was just really upset.

280
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.240
Nadine Quintana: Because he had he had possibility.

281
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:15.480
Nadine Quintana: And to be honest with you when I don't even remember like how or when they came to terms with that and was okay with him. Passing away.

282
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.310
Nadine Quintana: I just knew one day, like I was just fighting. I was I was okay.

283
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And how am I

284
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Going

285
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:39.000
Nadine Quintana: And then I was gonna say. And then, at the time I had my husband. I was with my husband, so I knew I wasn't alone, you know,

286
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.340
Nadine Quintana: And but I think

287
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:52.590
Nadine Quintana: When my husband went to prison. I think everything just started hitting me at once. And I guess you could kind of say, I felt like how many be addressed girls now.

288
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.750
Nadine Quintana: Abandoned

289
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.990
Nadine Quintana: And I've been there so I could see

290
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.940
Nadine Quintana: Why, he gets angry and what he says the things I said

291
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.410
Nadine Quintana: It would see some like really really hurtful things to

292
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.740
Nadine Quintana: Even do I do mean them.

293
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.830

Nadine Quintana: Alright guys, so to me.

Nadine Quintana: I remember one time he he just bugged me and I told him. Oh, I hope you like choke on your food and die or I told him something

298
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.460
Nadine Quintana: And

299
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:49.380
Nadine Quintana: I noticed with contest. They came to me like I should just kill you. You know, like saying hurtful things like that, too.

300
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:50.820
Okay.

301
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.150
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

302
00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.190
Nadine Quintana: Oh, sorry. Good.

303
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So you enjoy. And as you can see, you both go to anger.

304
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't go to depression. You don't go to right you you both have this way of using anger to express

305
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This hardness and and right and this is unfair abandon both go to that.

306
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, back then, when your husband.

307
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And your father when they were no longer around and available to you. The way you needed them.

308
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, would have been nice if your mom had been available, maybe there would have been something you could have, let's say, said, what do you think you needed from your mom, while all of those things were going on with your husband and your dad.

309
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.460
Nadine Quintana: For just support like

310
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:58.260
Just

311
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.120
Nadine Quintana: Support mentally, you know, physically and then

312
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.950
Nadine Quintana: If that's even how I feel. Now, like ages.

313
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:11.370
Nadine Quintana: If I can even take your with her either

314
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.650
Nadine Quintana: Extreme.

315
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.740
Nadine Quintana: I think if I'm, if I do at least even have a little bit of support.

316
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.730
Nadine Quintana: You know, but I, I still have my husband, even though he can't be here physically. He has helped me

317
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:38.880
Nadine Quintana: You know this past, you know, two weeks, like really be there for me and I really, really, you know, meet up

318
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.720
Nadine Quintana: But like with my mom. It's like

319
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:45.780
Nadine Quintana: I, I wish for once she would just

320
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:53.850
Nadine Quintana: Be there for support, you know, no matter the circumstances, no matter how bad the situation is

321
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.540
Nadine Quintana: Like, just put her feelings aside, I wish she would just

322
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:09.930
Nadine Quintana: Put making it about her to the site for one to say, Okay, you know what I need to be there for them. I need to be there for my daughter so she could be there for her kids and

323
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to make sure this is all grounded in reality this is not made up, miss. Jeff, make believe stuff your mom literally cannot put aside her need to make a point in order to be emotionally available to you right now. She can't do it.

324
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's her battle cry. What's her message to you.

325
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That she has to have you understand

326
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.110
Nadine Quintana: For when all this happens.

327
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.700
Nadine Quintana: At once.

328
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you didn't want to tell our stress try out again.

329
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.780
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, why didn't want to stress her out either one.

330
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:12.960
Nadine Quintana: I didn't want her to be stressed out, you know, so I told my sister. My sister was with turn. I said, you know, talk to Mom, Mom, no. You know, like, the reason why I didn't tell her is because I don't want it to be stressed out, especially being that she's out of town. She's not here. I'm

331
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:27.390
Nadine Quintana: Will I don't know if my mom called like mad, I don't know, but she's not talking to me like yesterday I text her and I told her, you know, Happy Mother's Day. I love you. She text me back, you know,

332
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:40.380
Nadine Quintana: They had made dinner and her husband, and we did a group chat with me and her and said, you know, like, I'm going to make dinner for you guys combined. He and

333
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.060
Nadine Quintana: All she tells him is

334
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:55.470
Nadine Quintana: Oh, thank you, baby. But she didn't even respond to me. She didn't even tell me, like, yeah, you need you need to give the kids combined company because that's usually what she would totally combine. Come, come, bring the kids and he or come grab something to eat. If you don't want to stay

335
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.770
Nadine Quintana: And it was like she was just ignoring me, you know, and then I'm

336
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:12.270
Nadine Quintana: Like I took the kids to go take her her presence because I had bought her some stuff for Mother's Day, and I told the kids will take it to, you know, your gremlin

337
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:24.330
Nadine Quintana: Tell her, it's from all of us, and I'm not going to get down. I said, because I don't think she wants to talk to me right now but tower. The tower. There's that gift and she didn't come out or she didn't talk to me. She did signal.

338
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put a pin in that for just two seconds, let's back up to this other pieces didn't quite get answered, what do, what would it look like if your mom and you accepted it. But your mom actually was available to you right now. What

339
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Will she do

340
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.250
Nadine Quintana: If she could help make you ever surprised.

341
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What would she be doing

342
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.550
Nadine Quintana: You know, Tommy, like, and this is going to be fine. This is what he means.

343
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:02.880
Nadine Quintana: You know,

344
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.950
Nadine Quintana: Take care of yourself so you could take care of the other two kids.

345
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:18.030
Nadine Quintana: And we went on dress comes home, you're good. And you're you're. Wow. And you taking care of yourself. That's what I wish I would get from her.

346
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what's the message you're receiving from her in the absence of that one truth be told what he because you're still learning something from her behavior. What message is she sending you

347
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:38.910
Nadine Quintana: To me it's I'm getting my selfish kind of message.

348
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.300
Nadine Quintana: Like she's putting her

349
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.900
Nadine Quintana: Her feelings first

350
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.340
Nadine Quintana: That that's how I'm taking it.

351
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.850
Nadine Quintana: As she's mad because I didn't tell her. Right. I know.

352
00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.880
Nadine Quintana: That's what's going on. And she's

353
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.810
Nadine Quintana: She wants to hold on to. I didn't tell her, because

354
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:17.400
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. I didn't tell her so she's pissed with me excited to tell it, but it would have been a, like a lose, lose situation with her because even if I would have told her she said

355
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:29.340
Nadine Quintana: Oh, I have to deal with everything I have to deal with everybody's probably have to fix everything. And in our reality, she does it. You know, but she always seems to make it about her.

356
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So this phrase I she's gonna predictively say

357
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now I know what I don't want to tell my mom because she was stressed out people sign, she'll go oh now I have to deal with everything so

358
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you've tried to prevent

359
00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: With stress you like, I don't want to have her say that somehow this is all about her. But notice it doesn't matter what you do. She still found a way to make it all about her. So all that effort to try to control didn't work. True. A true right that sort of narcissistic wound

360
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Their exquisite you know don't mean to. But, um, no amount of your efforts is going to make a difference.

361
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

362
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning

363
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Adding layer upon layer upon layer of now. I won't walk in the gift. Now, you put kids in the middle, walking the gift in. Now I'm going to sing for her. There's another layer of control. It's another one to another piece.

364
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You are having to confront

365
00:40:53.910 --> 00:41:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Already a very difficult thing that's going on. There's nothing wrong with you. Just saying.

366
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, go, Mom. I bought these things here.

367
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see how you add another layer to it. There's nothing wrong with you just showing up and you doing you are saying, Hey, Mom.

368
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we have a pattern. You and I

369
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hear you saying it all falls in your lap.

370
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I trust that the folks that Missy are taking good care of him.

371
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to hear you say everything's going to be okay. You don't have to do that, everything. It's just that.

372
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sure 100% sure she couldn't give that to you.

373
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.380
Nadine Quintana: I don't think so.

374
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there some room that maybe if you said it in an honest kind of genuine way. This is how it helped would look like for me, Mom. Right. Like, I just want to hear. I know.

375
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You take on a lot

376
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Even things no one you'll offer help and and try and problem solve, even when no one asks, and I'm not asking for you to throw money or solutions. I already have the solution long I just

377
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Want reassurance that everything is going to be okay. I've never been away from on price like this and seeing him walking to the plane was next level staff.

378
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, have you ever seen that before. Felt like that before.

379
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You think your mom can be present for you.

380
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:14.070
Nadine Quintana: Are part of me has always been like kind of scared to tell her, like how I Philly. And my husband tells me all the time. I just tell her, just tell her how you feel. Even if she doesn't

381
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:23.190
Nadine Quintana: Even if she argues with you, even if she sees this of the you're late. JUST TELL HER TELL HER exactly how you feel. And I just

382
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.770
Nadine Quintana: I get stuck or I get scared or something.

383
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.210
Yeah.

384
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.490
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I've even tried to running

385
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.640
Nadine Quintana: Something to her and then I just shut down and I can get it.

386
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's hard to talk to someone

387
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're afraid that you won't be seen, you won't be heard and understood. It's a very scary sinful.

388
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

389
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not you're not the same as you were yesterday and you were a year ago, five years ago. You're just not. You're not the same.

390
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You just you know yourself more, you know, your truth more you settled in into who you are, confidence and independence.

391
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if you'll notice, if you do attempt again to talk with her telling her exactly what health would look like. Right. You know what mom.

392
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're trying to solve.

393
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Solve this but

394
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What I need what i'd like right now is just

395
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like a verbal hug and, like, just tell me, everything's gonna be okay for some reason I

396
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Really want

397
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear it from you.

398
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no no I just something about it would feel good mom. Have you ever had that kind of feeling like I left. And, you know, was the first time you've ever been away from your kids or something or something. We're really struck you for the first time.

399
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: ever changing now my life will never be the same.

400
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get that. Have you ever been through something like that mom.

401
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know where you can kind of get at her emotions, too, and see if she could really relate to what you're going through.

402
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:50.640
Nadine Quintana: I could

403
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.940
Nadine Quintana: I could try

404
00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:02.130
Nadine Quintana: I, I know that it won't be easy, and it might not happen today or tomorrow, but

405
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:12.240
Nadine Quintana: I mean, I, I just need to find that, like, I guess you could see courage to come out and tell her.

406
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But isn't more than more than tell her it's also asking her questions to

407
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's

408
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.280
Fear.

409
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a big conversation about

410
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanting to understand what this phenomenon of having everybody's problems what that's like for her.

411
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe then she could hold and hear

412
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want, which is reassurance you want really something for most parents, it's

413
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

414
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Common sense and it comes naturally.

415
00:46:53.430 --> 00:47:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To say, you may not know how it's going to be okay. But it's going to be and and that's where the scary part is we don't know how because we can't see into the future.

416
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's what this piece right here it is going to be okay. It's going to be okay because you're listening to your son on the phone and you

417
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Can voice. You told me he's telling you the truth, you would notice in his tone if he was in distress you would recognize it and you would take action. You might call them or whatever you do, what's your he's okay you can hear this voice.

418
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, yeah, it is. It's about you, making sure that you're taking your good advice that you're giving to Andreas, which is I need to make sure I'm sleeping.

419
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to make sure I'm not unraveling.

420
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm still a mother to my other children. I'm still a person that needs to stay healthy and sleep and eat and function.

421
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm more than just

422
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this this relationship between

423
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: son and mother.

424
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the good advice.

425
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's mechanized that and find out what you need to do today to make sure that you give yourself permission to sleep.

426
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To delegate to designate organize not do something, whatever that it's going to take for you to get stable again meaning, you've got to have sleep because once I sleep goes off, then we start to unravel.

427
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What what needs to be done. I know you need to be available in the next hour or so for a call from Missy about then what

428
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.650
Nadine Quintana: I need to

429
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:59.220
Nadine Quintana: I'm going to, I'm going to go get me my kids, even if I have to go buy something to eat.

430
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, food.

431
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:05.700
Nadine Quintana: Yes. And then I'm going to come home and I'm just gonna

432
00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:14.520
Nadine Quintana: I'm just gonna come to my room and lay down and relax and try to sleep and just try to

433
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:25.740
Nadine Quintana: To, you know, make sure the kids will be okay. I know my kids will be okay. And I just need. I just need speed needed

434
00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it sounds like it.

435
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.770
Nadine Quintana: Even if it's just a few hours, even if

436
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It needing. I don't know.

437
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Why the story has happened the way unfolded.

438
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it means that he's getting the kind of care that you didn't quite get

439
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, great.

440
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Love care support, we want to take in every bit of it that we can that's available to us. It's great.

441
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: If he's saying I'm trusting these people at this facility that he's that that's fantastic.

442
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We want everyone we love much love and support as they can possibly get. That's a good thing. That means that you can get back centered sleep do food thing.

443
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure your other kids are kind of doing all right, taking care of them. And you're going to be able to attend to them a lot better. Once you've slept. That's just a real thing. Right.

444
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, it is gonna be okay. But you know what, you get to see you get to see how

445
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Much crazy ass love there is between you and your son. There's so much love there.

446
00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just really beautiful.

447
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the pain of being human. We don't get to buy a house.

448
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: As they pull away from us.

449
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's scary. But that's the flip side of love. We don't get to skip over it. And so I'm not going to say to you that there's something wrong or broken about what you're feeling right now. I don't. That's the cost of loving deeply

450
00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.

451
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong. And it turns out you just love your son like a crazy person.

452
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

453
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.030
It's a good thing.

454
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.240
Nadine Quintana: Here.

455
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So what. Okay. Yes. The story was like, how did we get to here, we can look at that, when we have fresh minds and we've rested and there's time to reflect on that. There's no urgency here. There's no urgency, everything is okay. It's okay, he's safe.

456
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

457
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.150
Okay.

458
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe doing extra piece that feels extra nurturing for you and for your kids, something that feels good, maybe around food, maybe about just an extra little piece that really honors. This is not a regular day. This is a hard one. This is

459
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: An extra layer of niceness and kindness, whether it's a treat or something.

460
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is the time to kind of indulge a little bit, you know,

461
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:34.680
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

462
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And keeping in your heart and in your mind on price.

463
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You can close right there. They don't disappear, just because they're miles away. They stay

464
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: There if they stay right here.

465
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to

466
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell Dr brielle that you want to skip group or do you want to go and you welcome to. We weren't, we weren't doing too much. It's up to you.

467
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.010
Nadine Quintana: Dude. Would it be okay if I just get to the one

468
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just let her know

469
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:24.570
Nadine Quintana: So the only thing is, I don't know if I have to.

470
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.780
Nadine Quintana: Show up because I don't I'm gonna need man's because she just gives them to me every week.

471
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, you're here today. I'll just tell her all messaged her

472
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she I think she's probably in the room.

473
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She's already got a zoom room created. So I'll just go in and punch what you want me to tell her.

474
00:53:50.700 --> 00:54:01.350
Nadine Quintana: You know, just that I need. I'm going to need a script and that if it's, you know, I would like to just stay where I'm at, just for, you know,

475
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You need anything.

476
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

477
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need anything else like support medicine.

478
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.810
Nadine Quintana: No, I have I have enough for those. Okay.

479
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling

480
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.060
Nadine Quintana: I feel you make a lot better. I noticed when we

481
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.980
Nadine Quintana: First I talkie and I was holding my breath a lot

482
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:35.070
Nadine Quintana: And I I'm noticing that that's kind of going away like I'm still, I noticed I'm still kind of doing it, but I'm

483
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.970
Nadine Quintana: Remembering to breathe. Yeah.

484
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would it be like for you to do the belly breathing. Do the box breathing with fidelity.

485
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do a couple of those just real quick. Okay.

486
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.130
Okay.

487
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This one.

488
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this together.

489
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders back

490
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of allow gravity to to take hold, or maybe weren't attending to it before, just notice

491
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe let's his shoulders up and let them draw and just notice that gravity is pulling those shoulders down.

492
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pulling your seat bones to your seat.

493
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's keeping you connected to this earth.

494
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Not something we typically think about, but there it is consistently holding you to the center of this planet.

495
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The power powerful force.

496
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't notice that it wavers it's reliable and consistent

497
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that weight.

498
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As it pulls consistently.

499
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Smoothly

500
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself a nice exhale as we begin

501
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's have an inhale through the nose for four seconds 124 and let's hold it in that belly for 321 and exhale out the mouth.

502
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out for 321 an inhale as expanding a balloon in your belly. Get all the air at the bottom good and hold it there for 321 let it all out your mouth.

503
00:56:48.150 --> 00:57:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw saw saw saw flat tummy, tummy and let's deflate that balloon good and hold that air out from just another moment. And let's inhale through the nose, feel the air come in nice and cool expanding that lower long and hold it there.

506
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale out.

507
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What a southern skin feels under the rope as that. Tell me five. Good.

508
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: fat belly fat belly. Nothing there and let's inhale through the nose. Get that Buddha belly, Tommy, nice and round. Just like a little baby huh

509
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And then let's exhale it all out.

510
00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: slowest one yet. Nice and slow.

512
00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold, hold, when you re breathing in through the nose.

513
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Let's hold it there for 321 exhale. Last one, make this one last an eternity slowest breath exhale it all out slowly really extend that make it the longest exhale you've ever had, nice and slow really control deflating that balloon every bit of air ever so slowly.

514
00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And return to your natural breath just pay attention.

515
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To any change in sensation in the body.

516
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Any shifting

517
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And see how you're doing.

518
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.350
Nadine Quintana: I know this. I don't have like

519
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.260
Nadine Quintana: I'm not in my chest. I

520
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:52.380
Nadine Quintana: Built up feel even anymore.

521
00:58:53.880 --> 00:59:00.360
Nadine Quintana: Okay, feel. I don't know how you feel. See the best word that comes to mind as like empty.

522
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:02.280
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

523
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there's no heavy. There's no type

524
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and is your mind sort of open to this idea of just doing a very short list of things.

525
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be washing face there might be making okay I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna write down. I'm going to make a decision about where I'm going to get the food.

526
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe something special to really honor that something important is happening. Just a little icing on the cake of of this is an important event going on.

527
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean it's not an everyday thing.

528
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the kids feel it too. And it's the sort of not letting them go crazy. We can acknowledge that and say let's do this thing. Let's all have, you know, breakfast for dinner or whatever you guys decide to do

529
00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Something on intentional about it to honor that.

530
00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can make a little joke with Andre Slater and say, yeah, we did this thing and you know we kind of want to do

531
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It. So then we brought out you know your favorite shirt and we put it over the chair. I don't know what you want to do, but

532
01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: There can be

533
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be played. It's okay to play.

534
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.590
He's okay.

535
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And some new things I think are about to happen or in your family dynamic and I'm excited for you. It could be pretty cool.

536
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.350
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:53.340
