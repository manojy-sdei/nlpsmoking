Shawn Phalen: Really good.

9
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.600
Alex Mancini: Relationships have gotten better with people that I kind of lost touch with and

10
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.960
Alex Mancini: Yeah, that's the main one.

11
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.540
Alex Mancini: So you're feeling pretty solid in your sobriety. Yeah, very

12
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.000
Alex Mancini: Very

13
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.240
Alex Mancini: Account. Right. Yeah.

14
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:44.010
Alex Mancini: Yeah, I thought because last time when I because I did it without Suboxone the last time and the cravings were terrible. And it just like that mental kind of withdrawal never went away.

15
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.800
Alex Mancini: And not having that this time has been really, really nice. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah.

16
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:04.650
Alex Mancini: And then how are the groups going for you. Good, I switched from what I was doing the nine o'clock group and I switched to the 1130 group the nine o'clock group was all men.

17
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.890
Alex Mancini: And then the 1130 group was all woman. Women and I felt like I was able to like talk more when it wasn't men and

18
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:30.090
Alex Mancini: So I asked Dr. Moses, Moses, if I could switch. And he said, yeah, so I switched. And that's gotten a lot better and then trying to follow through on like action steps I've been trying to do that. Okay.

19
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.830
Shawn Phalen: Like what, what's an example.

20
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.910
Alex Mancini: Like, one of them is for me to find a sponsor.

21
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.950
Alex Mancini: And I've been kind of like talking to somebody about doing that.

22
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:54.090
Alex Mancini: One of my best friend's dad. He got sober like nine years ago and he's kind of like been like a second father to me type deal. So I was thinking about asking him to be a sponsor.

23
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.230
Shawn Phalen: And are you so are you going to a a or na

24
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.300
Shawn Phalen: Hey. Hey.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.040
Yeah. Okay. How many meetings are you going to a week.

26
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.480
Shawn Phalen: And is that, is it a your home group like a meeting that you go to consistently.

27
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.500
Yeah.

28
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.420
Alex Mancini: I think clover Dale.

29
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.530
Alex Mancini: Yeah, which is like 15 minutes north of me.

30
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.860
So you have

31
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.830
Shawn Phalen: How long have you been doing

32
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.770
Alex Mancini: That specific one. The first time I went to. It was last year.

33
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.070
Alex Mancini: But on a consistent basis for

34
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.040
Alex Mancini: About a month or so.

35
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.580
Shawn Phalen: So you're obviously comfortable there, right.

36
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.390
Yeah.

37
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:54.660
Alex Mancini: And are you able to speak and then meetings or do you just listen. Like, am I allowed to speak. Is that what you mean. Oh yeah, he's not really, I'm not really

38
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.830
Alex Mancini: I'm not a big talker.

39
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.960
Right.

40
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.790
Shawn Phalen: So when you're in the groups to share

41
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.200
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

42
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.490
Okay.

43
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.680
Alex Mancini: Okay, for the most part, I do. Yes.

44
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.210
Alex Mancini: Okay.

45
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.140
Shawn Phalen: So it might be something you want to consider working up to when you're in the meetings, there's something that happens.

46
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.580
Alex Mancini: Is trying to share. Yes, or something that

47
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.390
Shawn Phalen: When you start sharing, you start obviously telling you're

48
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.100
Alex Mancini: Right.

49
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.450
Shawn Phalen: You're putting it out there and you're

50
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.430
It's hard to just like I don't know how to really describe it, but it's

51
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.560
Shawn Phalen: When you start sharing like that you become a part of a

52
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.000
Alex Mancini: Group. Yeah. And that grit. Right. Okay. And so

53
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.940
Shawn Phalen: When you do that and you meet more people

54
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:15.330
Alex Mancini: You can be you know more small rice is you know you can. Okay, so I encourage you to start trouble. Okay.

55
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.880
Alex Mancini: So that's also another

56
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.110
Shawn Phalen: action step that you

57
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.290
Alex Mancini: Take and then obviously, the other one is, is finding the

58
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.530
Alex Mancini: Right.

59
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.540
Alex Mancini: See I had never. The first time I didn't really work the steps.

60
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.150
Alex Mancini: And then like I've done the first and second, this time.

61
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.150
Alex Mancini: So, yeah.

62
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.130
Alex Mancini: Okay, good.

63
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.710
Shawn Phalen: So you said your relationships.

64
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.790
Better

65
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:56.040
Alex Mancini: Yeah so well friends and family like I my niece is older than I am. She's 26 going to be 27

66
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:15.450
Alex Mancini: She and I are like brother and sister, and then we I kind of just like I disappeared on like a lot of people when I started to get clean, just because will towards the end of my use and then starting to get clean, just because I didn't want to like drag people down with me what I mean.

67
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.410
Alex Mancini: So I just kind of separated myself from a lot of people

68
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.980
Alex Mancini: And then over the last couple weeks I've been trying to

69
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.920
Alex Mancini: work my way back to life in general.

70
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.540
Shawn Phalen: Last time I spoke, you're not working right.

71
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.770
Alex Mancini: No, no, Mama.

72
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:51.090
Alex Mancini: Oh, you've had to quit your job, remember that. Right. Yes. Okay. And right now, you don't have any plans to go back to work. Right, not for the next couple months. Do you have something pending legally. Yeah.

73
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:05.820
Alex Mancini: I probably going to get like 30 days in jail. And then like I think 30 to 60 days and you know residential program.

74
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.480
Alex Mancini: I find out more tomorrow so

75
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.410
Alex Mancini: Tomorrow, no I meet with my attorney tomorrow. And then of course next Thursday.

76
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.980
Again, what was the charge

77
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.010
Alex Mancini: Or what it is, is my. So my dad and I have always been really close. He gave me money.

78
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.550
Alex Mancini: sold the house gave me the money for it didn't want my sisters to know one of my sisters has power of attorney.

79
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.380
Alex Mancini: She found out about it and said that I stole the money.

80
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.290
Alex Mancini: So, yeah.

81
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:58.620
Alex Mancini: Yeah I know, because my dad. My dad always like doesn't want that. But because she has power of attorney for everything.

82
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:06.180
Alex Mancini: She could because after like this was after he gave me the money he was declared

83
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.550
Alex Mancini: I think that he was declared mentally incompetent because he had a stroke in 2014

84
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.300
Alex Mancini: And I took care of them for three years after the fact.

85
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.820
Alex Mancini: Anyways, they were doing another legal thing. And she got complete power of attorney over everything.

86
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.440
Alex Mancini: So she can make those decisions.

87
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.290
Alex Mancini: I've never, I've never had like a good relationship with my sisters and my brothers.

88
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.470
Biological

89
00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:01.620
Alex Mancini: Dad 70 just turned 76 my mom just turned 50 53.4

90
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.370
Alex Mancini: So the age gap between my parents basically my age.

91
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.050
Shawn Phalen: Down.

92
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.440
Shawn Phalen: 76 know how is he. Oh.

93
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.640
Alex Mancini: I'm not that great.

94
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.000
Alex Mancini: We can't use like his left side at all.

95
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.960
Shawn Phalen: Yeah it sucks because you know your dad can't really come to your rescue then County. No.

96
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.330
Okay.

97
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.410
Alex Mancini: Folks situations but deal with it and move on.

98
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.020
Shawn Phalen: That a felony or can they be that

99
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.490
Alex Mancini: It'll be it'll be a felony. And then after like three years it will go away.

100
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.920
Alex Mancini: So it'll jump down to like a misdemeanor, it'll be gone. Wow.

101
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:03.690
Yeah.

102
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.860
Shawn Phalen: Okay. How are you feeling about all that. I mean, I know.

103
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.820
Alex Mancini: Exactly. You got to play with cards. You're dealt, most of what I was dealt so

104
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.970
Alex Mancini: Like 90 days total isn't very much time like I can get to 90 days go by like that, but

105
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.550
Shawn Phalen: So is the treatment program attached to this charge is it because you were under the influence.

106
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.460
Alex Mancini: No, no, I did, I did it separately.

107
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.100
Alex Mancini: And then, oh, you mean

108
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:48.090
Alex Mancini: Which one you mean the this program, or the one that I'm gonna have to do when you're gonna have to do is

109
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.330
Shawn Phalen: That

110
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.970
Alex Mancini: Attack. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.240
Shawn Phalen: Why, because they tested you or what happened.

112
00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:05.310
Alex Mancini: No, because I told them that one I've initially got arrested. I went to jail. Like for that night. And they're like, are you gonna go into withdrawals and I was like, yes.

113
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:19.590
Alex Mancini: So they offered like I think that, well, like I said, I'll find out more tomorrow, but that is part of the offer is that instead of more jail time. I would be able to do a residential program.

114
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.370
Shawn Phalen: You have anything on you know

115
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:25.890
Well,

116
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:45.750
Alex Mancini: Yes and no. We're waiting, waiting. So the compressed it. I was in the parking lot of work and I was using them. And I saw him walking up. I saw these random guys walking up. I kind of threw it on the floorboard and shut the door.

117
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.090
Alex Mancini: And

118
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.700
Alex Mancini: I thought that I didn't realize who they were. At first I thought they were looking like for the office or something.

119
00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:03.540
Alex Mancini: And then they said my name only got fuck So realize what was happening. But no, I didn't have anything when I got arrested as a founded on the scoreboard. No.

120
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.790
Alex Mancini: No found it.

121
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.240
Alex Mancini: Yeah.

122
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.140
Okay.

123
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.870
Shawn Phalen: Well, I mean, it seems like you're handling it. Well, I mean, I know you don't have a

124
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:28.200
Alex Mancini: Yeah exactly it. I can't get, like, obviously, it sucks, but just something you got to deal with. So

125
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.580
Alex Mancini: Is there any chance you get early release from the 30 days. I have no idea.

126
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.750
Alex Mancini: Like I said I would, I would know tomorrow. Yeah.

127
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.670
Shawn Phalen: Alright so what comes your meeting with your attorney.

128
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.760
Alex Mancini: 3pm tomorrow. I don't know where that's 3pm Pacific. Yeah.

129
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.070
Okay.

130
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.430
All right, well, you know,

131
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.810
Alex Mancini: What would we be able to meet like early next week.

132
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.330
Shawn Phalen: I can do on Monday, I can do seven o'clock.

133
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.900
Alex Mancini: Yeah, that's fine.

134
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.200
Alex Mancini: Just so that way. After I find out more tomorrow, I can kind of talk about that. Right.

135
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.950
Shawn Phalen: Now here's the other question that just came to me and

136
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.170
So, since you're on Suboxone

137
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.470
Alex Mancini: They don't like you can have Suboxone in jail. I don't know yet.

138
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:09.840
Alex Mancini: Yeah for Sonoma County it we I might be able to have it. If not, they have methadone in there. I don't really want to get on methadone, but

139
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.000
Alex Mancini: Having to do that for 30 days and then getting back on the Suboxone when I get out

140
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:33.090
Alex Mancini: It's a possibility. Well, okay. So here's the other thing now. Okay, so let's say they don't want this thing that you have a jail. Sorry. You might not know the answer to this.

141
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:44.280
Alex Mancini: Was the time period from the time you get released, they have to go into treatments. I don't know. Okay, that's another question because

142
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:58.470
Alex Mancini: I'm treatment programs will definitely let you have the Boston. Right. So the one I was talking to Azure acres today and I can be on Suboxone when I go in there.

143
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.250
Alex Mancini: So another thing I was going to talk to my attorney about tomorrow is seeing if I can do.

144
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.180
Alex Mancini: The residential first and then

145
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:23.580
Alex Mancini: Yeah. And then so that way if I do have to go to jail. I can like trying to get off of this box on through the residential program and then just go through the jail with out anything

146
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.450
Alex Mancini: And and get back on the Xbox. I want to get out.

147
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:39.300
Alex Mancini: That makes sense. It would be nice to. So when I am out, I would still have the spots on those like a crutch to getting back in a normal life.

148
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.160
Alex Mancini: Now,

149
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:41.820
I get it.

150
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.170
Alex Mancini: That you don't use when you're in jail. Exactly.

151
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.480
Alex Mancini: Reality is, there's a ton of time to drive. Oh yeah, right.

152
00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.440
Shawn Phalen: So that you know that you just have to make sure that you're feeling

153
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:15.660
Alex Mancini: Strong like yeah cuz i mean if I do feel like I am going to use them. I would ask to be put on the method. But even with the methadone, you can still get fucking high

154
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.200
Alex Mancini: Sucks.

155
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.020
Alex Mancini: General, it sucks.

156
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.340
Shawn Phalen: Have you talked to the doctor about this at all.

157
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:34.650
Alex Mancini: No, I haven't. I wanted to talk to him like one on one. So when I meet with them on Monday, I was going to see if I can meet with him one on one.

158
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.840
Shawn Phalen: So do you think tomorrow you'll be able to kind of formulate a plan after you

159
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.380
Yeah.

160
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:55.110
Alex Mancini: Okay, so that's the goal when you meet with him, obviously, to get these questions answered question to answer them as formulate like what's the best approach or jail or rehab or rehab or jail jail was

161
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.690
So, um,

162
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.980
Shawn Phalen: You know like what order you can do it in

163
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.780
Alex Mancini: Right, exactly.

164
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:27.990
Alex Mancini: So okay in Sonoma County. You cannot have the box me in jail, but you can have methadone. No, it's not snowing County. I think my attorney was saying that he's talking to the DEA about letting me stay on the spokes on and in the jail because it's kind of a toss up for Sonoma County.

165
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.790
Alex Mancini: Which is kind of ridiculous if they wouldn't. I mean, that's just dumb. Yeah, I know. It just depends.

166
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:53.670
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. Depends. Okay. All right, so you, you obviously have, you know, like your list of questions you meet. Ask your attorney and your peers. Yeah.

167
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.050
Alex Mancini: Yeah.

168
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:56.640
Okay.

169
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:14.700
Alex Mancini: Mom. Okay. So then, all right, we'll meet will meet on the 24th at seven o'clock, and then I'm hopefully you'll have, you know, some answers. Yeah. And then we can just, you know, talk about that and

170
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.640
Alex Mancini: Whatever formulate a plan or whatever, you know, right.

171
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:22.680

Alex Mancini: Yeah, cuz like

173
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:38.940
Alex Mancini: I was thinking like if they do say that I can't be on Xbox and in the jail's thing about having Dr. Moses, saying that I need to stay on the spot zone, it would be recommended to do the treatment program for

174
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.170
Alex Mancini: And just see what, like I said, Oh, no, no more tomorrow, so hopefully

175
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.490
Alex Mancini: I can figure some things out. How many are you on

176
00:19:51.720 --> 00:20:06.480
Alex Mancini: I take, I take 60 milligrams a day. How many times a day do you do that like two or three twice I do I take eight in the morning and then I take eight at night. Yeah. And then how much were you using for you went

177
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.270
Alex Mancini: Somewhere between seven and 1030 us

178
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:13.980
Alex Mancini: Today,
