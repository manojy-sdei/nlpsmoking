Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And also,

669
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, not yet. Another way to look at it is if you're empty right now. It's a perfect chance when you heal to start filling it with good stuff.

670
00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:16.890

772
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:09.270
Ken Olsen: Well, the experience I had earlier was fucking run around that drove me nuts.

773
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.960
Ken Olsen: I think about the zoom thing, put me over the edge.

774
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.370
Probably

775
01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.890

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.860
Ken Olsen: I must look pathetic.

781
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:46.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me about your fit.

782
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:50.310

01:05:52.260 --> 01:06:05.550
Ken Olsen: My grandson had my hat I snatched out of the 10 just fucking trying to get on zoom and everything else. I don't know. I shouldn't I shouldn't I shouldn't call her went over there, I thought maybe she can help me but

784
01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:08.310
Ken Olsen: Pages fucking dug deeper

785
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.450
Ken Olsen: And try not to say a fucking word

786
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:18.840
Ken Olsen: I just can't handle anymore.

787
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.770
Ken Olsen: This ain't good. This is not good.

788
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.710
Ken Olsen: This is bad.

789
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.010
Ken Olsen: This is bad.

790
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is tough.

791
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:47.730
Ken Olsen: I can take a lot of pain and ship it man. This is bad.

792
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:52.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take a lot of pain. A lot of physical pain, but I don't think that

793
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you are prepared to take all this emotional pain right now.

794
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:00.150
Ken Olsen: It's bad.

795
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.090
Ken Olsen: It's really bad.

796
01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Explain it to me.

797
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:19.530
Ken Olsen: isn't bad.

798
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:32.040
Ken Olsen: There's nowhere to talk to her. Do you think I want to talk to anybody.

799
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you want to do sit in your head.

800
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Look, you know as well as I do that. We don't have any control over anybody else.

801
01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. The only thing we have control over is us our risk our reactions, our responses. What we choose to engage in what we choose not to.

802
01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.380
You know,

803
01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.060
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

804
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't, it doesn't mean that it's you know that

805
01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not worth being here.

806
01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:21.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It means right now you're going through some tough stuff and you don't know how to deal with it.

807
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's okay.

808
01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes you human

809
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.510
Ken Olsen: There you go.

810
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it.

811
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.870
Ken Olsen: Human beings are terrible.

812
01:08:41.190 --> 01:08:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can't be but human beings also can be good people.

813
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.620
Ken Olsen: Maybe I'll come back as a plant.

814
01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you come back as a

815
01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:58.230

816
01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:03.630
Ken Olsen: Human beings. Take care plans.

817
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:14.970
Ken Olsen: This is fucking crazy.

818
01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.670
Ken Olsen: Down the bucket, I end up here. I know I ended up here.

819
01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:26.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you see the doctor and Greg today.

820
01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:30.000
Ken Olsen: No, I couldn't get in

821
01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.780
Ken Olsen: So I said, what about Rebecca. Rebecca

822
01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.590
Rebecca

823
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.560
Ken Olsen: I couldn't get into. Anybody else have you. I told them all. Let me talk to her.

824
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:42.750
Ken Olsen: To call

825
01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:46.530
Ken Olsen: And I took about half an hour.

826
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I was in

827
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.180
Ken Olsen: I understand.

828
01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.400
Ken Olsen: I was in a lane to the doctor, though I tell you that

829
01:09:59.220 --> 01:09:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

830
01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.530
Ken Olsen: Bobby. A good thing you didn't talk to me.

831
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.730
Ken Olsen: It probably is a good thing.

832
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.550
Ken Olsen: He talked to me, he died, they probably would have kicked me out.

833
01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when well you found this out right before

834
01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.330
Ken Olsen: The meeting.

835
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:19.590
Ah,

836
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:27.510
Ken Olsen: I knew I shouldn't have done it. I just I just I can't, I don't know. I don't know what to do.

837
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.770
Ken Olsen: I just thought maybe she could help me I don't know.

838
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.880
I know

839
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.030
Ken Olsen: That fucking

840
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.780
Ken Olsen: I didn't, I didn't lose my I just

841
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.360
Ken Olsen: I just bucket. I left where I

842
01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.250
Ken Olsen: Said, I don't know, I just, I don't really remember coming home.

843
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:02.820
Ken Olsen: I don't think I've ever done that before.

844
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:05.160
Ken Olsen: Silver

845
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you did it.

846
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.900
Ken Olsen: Like when she called me, and I told her, I'm having a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what to say. It's only thing I could come up with

847
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.510
Ken Olsen: I called her

848
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.480
Ken Olsen: She texted me and I called her

849
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.330
Ken Olsen: And I shouldn't I should have just

850
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.440
Ken Olsen: Got a baby to take care of. You don't need to worry about me.

851
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.590
Ken Olsen: Two babies actually or husband, you

852
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.950
Ken Olsen: Know he's a good guy. He just smoked a lot of wheat grains like me.

853
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just like you

854
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.760
Ken Olsen: Don't do that.

855
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

856
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.420
Ken Olsen: Don't want to be in this don't want to be here.

857
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:28.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anywhere.

858
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anywhere right at this moment and makes perfect sense. I got you. But that's not

859
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:38.010
Ken Olsen: I don't think I'm going to bounce back from this one.

860
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that if you give yourself time to heal that you can

861
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can can

862
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.730
Ken Olsen: Do anything, it really scares me is I do have the guts.

863
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:17.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I want you to pay attention to, you know, the other piece of this, where there's a piece that you don't want to. There's a piece that you do want somebody to support you through this because, you know, if not you wouldn't have, you know, called

864
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that you have support people you know that you can talk to people. And yes, this is a horrible situation.

865
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.910
Ken Olsen: People are the same, same, same, same.

866
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.280
Ken Olsen: Same, same, same.

867
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:32.340
Ken Olsen: Same same

868
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.460
Ken Olsen: This is, this is it.

869
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.590
Ken Olsen: This is it.

870
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:26.940
Ken Olsen: This

871
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:30.840
Ken Olsen: This is what we get.

872
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:36.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We get a feel. And it sucks.

873
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We get a heel.

874
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.160
Ken Olsen: Don't you don't have to

875
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't have to, but then we walk around as zombies and drones and we miss out on you know this big, huge piece of life and

876
01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:00.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know is sometimes feeling is the hardest thing to deal with, but it's also

877
01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One of the most rewarding things ever

878
01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:06.570
Ken Olsen: Been there.

879
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Two fisted you know it's two sided

880
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's two sided

881
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.500
Ken Olsen: I don't have the energy

882
01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:22.560
Ken Olsen: wore out the ship.

883
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:25.050
Ken Olsen: Ship and if only I could

884
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:32.640
Ken Olsen: Have it in me.

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:41.640
Ken Olsen: Every day.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.070
Ken Olsen: Too much

888
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.840
Ken Olsen: Too much

889
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.890
Ken Olsen: Everybody's drunk on drugs or something else, those people were

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not always.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: medications that are needed for certain things in your body. They're not you know you're not self medicating

897
01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:57.420
Ken Olsen: Or, you know,

898
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.180
Ken Olsen: I don't really need them.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.810
Ken Olsen: I don't want to take drugs.

901
01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:22.290

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you today.

928
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.850
Jacob Hall: Good, how are you

929
01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good.

930
01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this won't take us very long. It takes about 20 minutes or so to complete a bio psych just gonna ask you a bunch of questions. Okay.

931
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:10.680
Jacob Hall: Yep, they told me an hour and I figured they were wrong.

932
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm all right. Tell me, what brings you to bright heart.

933
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:32.940
Jacob Hall: Because the clinic here that I usually receive services stopped and they making everyone go to break, heart, so I've been on Suboxone for seven years.

934
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:35.610
Jacob Hall: So,

935
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We work with Dr Grubbs

936
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.570
Yes.

937
01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I see you in group. We've been a group together.

938
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:44.790
Jacob Hall: Oh, maybe

939
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:50.070
Jacob Hall: Okay. Yeah, a couple groups to do now.

940
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah, I usually work in a group with her. I think I've missed one group without her with her.

941
01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I thought you basic familiar

942
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:02.520
Jacob Hall: Yeah.

943
01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.550
Jacob Hall: Maybe you weren't yet.

944
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.340
Jacob Hall: It's hard to tell when there's more people

945
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, there really is. It is hard to tell.

946
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.920
Jacob Hall: All my phones small

947
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah. Gotcha. Okay.

948
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. The second question is, tell me a little bit about your use history. Kind of give me a rundown of age of first us. What was the substance that you used and how did it progress to when you got sober.

949
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.580
Jacob Hall: Um, well.

950
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.290
Jacob Hall: I guess you have to dial that pretty back when I was a kid.

951
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:41.310
Jacob Hall: My parents were pretty bad, you know,

952
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:45.150
Jacob Hall: That's what happens to a lot of people they got bad parents

953
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:51.660
Jacob Hall: So I watched them do it, you know. So I think I had my first drink of alcohol when I was 10

954
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:58.380
Jacob Hall: And then, you know, I just kind of tried things as I went along.

955
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:00.810
Jacob Hall: As I got older.

956
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.320
Jacob Hall: Because I would catch them doing things, you know, like

957
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:12.360
Jacob Hall: Methamphetamines and stuff I'd catch them all the time. So I guess it kind of sparked my interest as a young child, right.

958
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:14.340
Jacob Hall: Yeah yeah

959
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:24.690
Jacob Hall: I was always functioning is that, you know, so I was never one to really go out and steal and you know I always worked for my money.

960
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.940
And my substances.

961
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:31.980
Jacob Hall: I love that's better or worse.

962
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:34.320
Jacob Hall: You know,

963
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

964
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is what it is.

965
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:38.670
Jacob Hall: It is what

966
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you finally got on Suboxone. What was the substance that you were what turned out to be your primary substance.

967
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.040
Jacob Hall: Um,

968
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.770
Jacob Hall: At that time I was actually mostly using math.

969
01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:04.170
Jacob Hall: And I didn't do math. A whole lot in my life. I got wrapped up with a girl for that one. I'm

970
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:04.710
Jacob Hall: Kind of

971
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.750
Jacob Hall: Doing it yeah it's all the girls fault.

972
01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it girls well

973
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.650
Jacob Hall: But I didn't really do it that much during my life. So, but that was what I was doing that and

974
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

975
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.260
Jacob Hall: It just so happened that

976
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:24.090
Jacob Hall: We ended up splitting up and I got with my current wife who I'm married to now.

977
01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.520
Jacob Hall: And her mom.

978
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:34.440
Jacob Hall: Was doing the Suboxone clinic at the time with Dr gropes. She was a nurse there and so

979
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:39.330
Jacob Hall: I ended up getting stuck on Suboxone for, you know,

980
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.300
Jacob Hall: To I did it to get clean, you know,

981
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.470
Um,

982
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:54.510
Jacob Hall: And the medicine was there. So I ended up getting pretty much stuck on the medicine. I guess for for different

983
01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:02.070
Jacob Hall: Different drug right mostly I mean I guess I did use opiates, a little bit, but I wasn't, I wasn't a

984
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:09.870
Jacob Hall: Addicted to the point of withdrawal. Now, unfortunately, it probably withdrawal. If I ever stopped taking Suboxone

985
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why you

986
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

987
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:21.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would have to be taper down, you know, in a slow slow process that the doctor would work with you on. Definitely. You don't want to just stop it.

988
01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:22.920
Yeah.

989
01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:37.020
Jacob Hall: And I almost did it right before I went here but you know it's that fear because younger in my life. I used opiates.

990
01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:41.670
Jacob Hall: That fear of withdrawal just scares the crap out of me.

991
01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:45.990
Jacob Hall: Yeah, so I just keep on chugging on

992
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:49.050
Jacob Hall: Is it working. Yeah.

993
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:53.610
Jacob Hall: I'm stable so stable and happy.

994
01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it doesn't get any better than that.

995
01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Oh, stable and happy. That's exactly what is supposed to be.

996
01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:02.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, hey,

997
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.020
Jacob Hall: It's Suboxone I find a little annoying. Just because I have to.

998
01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:17.940
Jacob Hall: Have to take it every morning I kind of hide it. So, because I'm the director of a day program for adults with developmental disabilities.

999
01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:20.490
Jacob Hall: So no one can know you know

1000
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:27.120
Jacob Hall: And so I actually take it at five in the morning and then I go back to sleep. Kind of I lay my head up.

1001
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.280
Jacob Hall: It just, I get out of the way.

1002
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:30.900
Jacob Hall: You know, and go on with

1003
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.230
It.

1004
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:41.340
Jacob Hall: Yeah, so I'd like I guess I'm in a way, expressing that I would like to get it off it someday, but

1005
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:52.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely something to talk to the doctor about, you know, you guys can utilize a plan, you know that when you're ready, you guys can implement, you know. Yeah.

1006
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:53.340
Right.

1007
01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

1008
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm okay. Any pain issues.

1009
01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.680
Jacob Hall: I got a pretty bad back, but it doesn't

1010
01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:08.700
Jacob Hall: It doesn't bother me unless I cut wood.

1011
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:13.230
Jacob Hall: For them not not nothing, you know,

1012
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.620
Jacob Hall: Debilitating, I guess. Okay.

1013
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So no physical issues then

1014
01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.520
Jacob Hall: No, do you mean you mean like pain. Yeah.

1015
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any like diabetes, blood pressure, any physical medical

1016
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:35.790
Jacob Hall: I had high blood pressure for a while, but seems to have gone away.

1017
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

1018
01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's good.

1019
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.680
Jacob Hall: Through through exercise and

1020
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:49.530
Jacob Hall: You know lifestyle changes. Now I keep checking my blood pressure and it's too low and I'm like I do, I take my pill.

1021
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Money.

1022
01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:55.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Out of your active and things are good.

1023
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah.

1024
01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm okay. Any substance abuse treatment in the past.

1025
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:06.930
Jacob Hall: No, no.

1026
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:16.680
Jacob Hall: Well, I guess there was one little short time i checked myself into a rehab. This is probably right before Suboxone

1027
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:17.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

1028
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.010
Jacob Hall: Um, those a little rehab in town.

1029
01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

1030
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:30.480
Jacob Hall: And I checked myself in there but I only lasted about two weeks, just because I felt I was. And again, that was for math.

1031
01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:34.380
Jacob Hall: Mm hmm. After a couple days, you're like, I, what am I doing here.

1032
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.690
Jacob Hall: I don't even want to do this.

1033
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:40.620
Jacob Hall: I need to go get a job and get my shit together, excuse my language.

1034
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:41.370
Jacob Hall: Yes, I

1035
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:42.540
ended up leaving

1036
01:26:45.210 --> 01:26:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you got on this inbox and every gram

1037
01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.360
Jacob Hall: I relapsed so

1038
01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what I was gonna ask, did you okay um and you read off some math.

1039
01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:03.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Okay, and what about mental health treatment and impasse mental health treatment.

1040
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.980
Jacob Hall: A little bit.

1041
01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.140
Jacob Hall: I do take anxiety meds because I get anxiety pretty bad.

1042
01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.750
Jacob Hall: And so I do see a periodically. There's a person to the health center.

1043
01:27:19.410 --> 01:27:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

1044
01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:22.830
Jacob Hall: That I see and my primary deals with that.

1045
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.800
Jacob Hall: Yeah, so I get anxiety and some

1046
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:32.970
Jacob Hall: Don't really like talking about was too much.

1047
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:35.430
Jacob Hall: That's another thing that I hide.

1048
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:42.570
Jacob Hall: Is the once in a while if I get really stressed out groves knows this to

1049
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:48.690
Jacob Hall: What's it called, it's called applications of reference.

1050
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:51.420
Jacob Hall: And that's where

1051
01:27:52.470 --> 01:28:03.900
Jacob Hall: And that's where you're listening to the radio or reading something or watching TV or someone talks and you think that it all applies to you.

1052
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

1053
01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.560
Jacob Hall: You reference everything to do to yourself.

1054
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:23.640
Jacob Hall: And I guess part of that comes from low self esteem as a child, because I remember being young and going into like a crowded room and people would be laughing. I think they were laughing at me.

1055
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay. Got you.

1056
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:37.500
Jacob Hall: Um, but as I got older it progressed and with the math use. And that's what the doctor said that actually math useful caused that. And so it still happens to this day.

1057
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:49.260
Jacob Hall: Where I will be stressed out or something and then just randomly I'll hear something on TV or the radio and I'll literally think you know it's talking to me.

1058
01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:56.940
Jacob Hall: In that commercial was put there to talk to me and I'm able to, you know, deal with it and push it out there. Whoa, what do you do in there, man.

1059
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:03.150
Jacob Hall: But yeah, I mean, your brain goes there for a minute. It's weird. Yeah.

1060
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, makes sense though, you know, definitely. Um, any past suicide attempts, thoughts, no struggles with that.

1061
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good know

1062
01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any

1063
01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:21.840
Your life.

1064
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:27.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any self harm past so far.

1065
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:45.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Perfect. Um, the next part of it is wanting to know about your family dynamics, growing up. So can you tell me a little bit about the house that you grew up in where your pants to others rather live. Do they get divorce.

1066
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they have addiction problems.

1067
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.110
Jacob Hall: Interesting childhood.

1068
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:53.460
Jacob Hall: I live down to the mountains.

1069
01:29:54.810 --> 01:30:04.500
Jacob Hall: I didn't even get my first light switch or indoor plumbing until I'd say fourth grade. So we had no power live way out in the mountains.

1070
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:12.000
Jacob Hall: When I was young. My parents were to get together and write about fourth graders when they've split up to

1071
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:20.790
Jacob Hall: But there was definitely so. And that's what I attribute to all my addiction problems. I blame it on my parents.

1072
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:30.360
Jacob Hall: Because there was lots of stuff that I saw at that age that I can recall now that I shouldn't you shouldn't have seen

1073
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. What about. So we know that there was addiction in your parents, you know, with your parents mental health. Do you know if they struggled with mental

1074
01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:44.790
Jacob Hall: No, they didn't. They fought a lot

1075
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:48.390
Jacob Hall: They would they fought a lot and each other up.

1076
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.130
Jacob Hall: Drinks yeah

1077
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Domestic violence.

1078
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yes. Okay. And how many siblings do you have

1079
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:57.690
One.

1080
01:30:59.160 --> 01:30:59.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Older younger

1081
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Younger boy.

1082
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:07.620
Jacob Hall: She had, she poured herself into school

1083
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:17.430
Jacob Hall: And ended up instead of what I did you know you can go one way or the other. Yeah, and she put herself into school and did really good so

1084
01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.440
Jacob Hall: Awesome. Yeah.

1085
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:20.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome.

1086
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was speaking of school. What was school like for you.

1087
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.600
Jacob Hall: It was horrid, that was another thing.

1088
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:39.510
Jacob Hall: I went to this tiny little town kindergarten through eighth, eighth grade worn Brooke elementary. I don't know if you know where that is. It's up by why Rica.

1089
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:53.310
Jacob Hall: The entire school kindergarten through eighth grades was a really small school and I got picked on. I was really there was, you know, a lot of bullying. So, and that's where my self esteem issues come from.

1090
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:59.670
Jacob Hall: I got picked on people through the whole second grade through eight

1091
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.910
Jacob Hall: I'm

1092
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:03.750

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there anything that you would like to work on specifically while you're engaged with bright heart.

1137
01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.550
Jacob Hall: I'm you know I'm just kind of chugging along I don't feel like

1138
01:34:55.830 --> 01:35:05.430
Jacob Hall: I need anything but to anything other than what I can do myself next pick my own self in the butt to get off the meds, you know,

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, while you were going, Yeah, I thought so.

1144
01:35:31.230 --> 01:35:42.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this is just a piece of bright heart. You know, everybody that comes into bright heart whether you've had a done before, or not has to do a bio psychosocial and so that's why we're completing this you know there's a lot

1145
01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they came over, because of Dr groves, that doesn't have it done. And so it kind of tasked us with, you know, making sure that everybody gets this piece. It's just part of your medical chart you know with us.

1146
01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:06.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let's see, I think we've got everything I think I've touched base on all of the questions you have any questions for me.

1147
01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:13.830
Jacob Hall: No, I, I was a little worried that this would be a recurring thing because i don't i'm

1148
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:21.570
Jacob Hall: Someone said something about that they made them do this all the time from to get their meds, but

1149
01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.260
Jacob Hall: This is a one time thing. Is that what this is right.

1150
01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:33.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, unless you request services, unless request request to see a counselor, because, I mean, you have seven years and no

1151
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sober you know you've been through program after program you you're you're totally fine. This is just for your chart. Now, if there were reasons that came up through this process today that I was concerned about, I would ask you if it's something that you're interested in.

1152
01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, never

1153
01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This piece of it isn't a requirement, the group. Yeah, that's the check in.

1154
01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know media traffic grows, that is, but as far as I'm concerned, you know, the services there if you choose to accept it, but you you know don't need to totally fine.

1155
01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will just see you in group.

1156
01:37:13.650 --> 01:37:14.070
Jacob Hall: Awesome.

1157
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so

1158
01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, this is an option. Unless those issues that come up that you should probably be watched closely and I don't hear anything. I don't see anything there isn't any concerns on my radar. There's no concerns on Dr groves radar so

1159
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're good.

1160
01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.720
Jacob Hall: Appreciate that. I feel good.

1161
01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.530
Jacob Hall: Thank you very

1162
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:38.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Listen.

1163
01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're ready, just talk to Dr groves about tapering in a hurry up. And again, it's, it's not a process that happens in weeks.

1164
01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:50.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it is a process so

1165
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, just know that

1166
01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:56.250
Jacob Hall: Right. It's stupid. Anyways, I take so little, it probably wouldn't even matter.

1167
01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like, how much do you take

1168
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.830
Jacob Hall: four milligrams a day.

1169
01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, I think, you know, I have heard of them dropping one milligram, or even a half milligrams a day or a week or every two weeks, you know. However, they do it. They schedule it out so you can get adjusted adjusted, you know,

1170
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

1171
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, you know, if it's helping you at that level, great, you know,

1172
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, good stuff.

1173
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:28.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

1174
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:33.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anyways. Okay, so I will see you in group.
