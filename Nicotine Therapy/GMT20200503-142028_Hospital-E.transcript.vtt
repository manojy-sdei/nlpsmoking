10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.410

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.100

Dawn Abriel: Now,

19
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.390

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.100

22
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.690
Cherrie lamparelli: Hello.

23
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.460

24
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.630

Dawn Abriel: Wedding go in and

26
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.080
Dawn Abriel: Hello.

27
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.740
Dawn Abriel: Hi. Yeah. So are you using Wi Fi or data on your phone.

28
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:36.570
Cherrie lamparelli: It's both. I mean, I live in an Adobe house so I have to particularly stay in one area because there's no service anywhere.

29
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.230
Cherrie lamparelli: So that's why I was where I was. I'm sorry.

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:54.660
Dawn Abriel: Okay, well, that's okay. It's just that, you know, the only huge requirement in this program is that you'd be able to be on both video and audio for a full hour

31
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.470
So,

32
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.240
Dawn Abriel: That's, that's just we you know we call it telemedicine and if you don't have to tell apart. You're really not getting any of the medicine. It's a stupid.

33
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.870
Dawn Abriel: joke, but

34
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.480
Cherrie lamparelli: It's funny.

35
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.180
Dawn Abriel: Well, I'm glad you think so, what

36
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.630
Dawn Abriel: I say it's so much, it's like really not funny to me to hear myself repeated all the time.

37
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.240
Dawn Abriel: So let's start. I looked at your assessments.

38
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.440
Dawn Abriel: And it looked like the biggest thing was some anxiety and it's opioids that you're addicted to

39
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.340
Cherrie lamparelli: Uh, yeah. Well, I was. It's been a long time but I mean I had a couple fall off.

40
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.130
Cherrie lamparelli: The about three times. But now it's been a long time since I haven't

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so your situation is that you're you've been on Suboxone or buprenorphine for a long time.

42
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.800
Yes.

43
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.050
Dawn Abriel: And so your last dose was this morning.

44
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.660
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, a piece of it. Yeah.

45
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.610
Cherrie lamparelli: They were giving me to it to a day. And so I've stretched them out because I moved out here to Albuquerque from Boston, Massachusetts.

46
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:28.920
Cherrie lamparelli: So the doctor gave me enough a 45 days. But when I moved out here a covert 19 was already started. But as soon as I got here the stay at home. Water started so

47
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:47.010
Cherrie lamparelli: I applied to the insurance out here and it's just everything just took a while. So finally I found a doctor and they didn't have any openings for a while. So somebody referred me to you guys. So that's when that's how I am now to so

48
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.570
Cherrie lamparelli: Right. And I stretched out the last few doses. I've had by cutting them into like

49
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.560
Pieces.

50
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.360
Cherrie lamparelli: So that's

51
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.860
Cherrie lamparelli: Why I have anxiety.

52
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.360
Dawn Abriel: Ah,

53
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.950
Dawn Abriel: OK.

54
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.700
Dawn Abriel: And were you ever an IV drug user

55
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.440
Cherrie lamparelli: No, never.

56
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.870
Dawn Abriel: And you. So how old were you when you first started using any illicit drug even marijuana

57
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.430
Cherrie lamparelli: Never use that

58
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.440
Dawn Abriel: So,

59
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.630
Dawn Abriel: Any note, no illicit drugs just opioids.

60
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.730
Cherrie lamparelli: Yes. After I had a surgery.

61
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.070
Cherrie lamparelli: Was about nine know about seven years ago. Okay.

62
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.420
Dawn Abriel: So that would be

63
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.820
Cherrie lamparelli: 12 2012. I'm sorry. How many years that was

64
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.870
Okay.

65
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.140
Dawn Abriel: And

66
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.360
Dawn Abriel: Has your opioid use ever gotten in the way of relationships or work.

67
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.960
Cherrie lamparelli: Oh yeah, the garden and my way of relationship, which is why I looked for help.

68
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.840
Dawn Abriel: And is this the first program you've been in

69
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.390
Cherrie lamparelli: No, no, because I've been in a program how I was got to the other doctor

70
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.290
Great.

71
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.050
Dawn Abriel: So this is the second

72
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.330
Cherrie lamparelli: Yes. Okay.

73
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.850
Cherrie lamparelli: And it wasn't because I wanted to leave. The first one is because I moved out here.

74
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.770
Dawn Abriel: What worked for you with the first program.

75
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.040
Cherrie lamparelli: Um, I went well.

76
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.960
Cherrie lamparelli: A lot of hard work and a lot of self determination.

77
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.910
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so was there, group work and individual therapy.

78
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.950
Cherrie lamparelli: Individual therapy. It was every two weeks and then it just continued every two weeks.

79
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.220
Cherrie lamparelli: For the last three years, I've gone every two weeks.

80
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.280
Dawn Abriel: Well, you are way ahead of the game, man.

81
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.960
Dawn Abriel: Is sleeping issue for you.

82
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:28.050
Cherrie lamparelli: Um, I, you know, it has nothing to do with anything but my whole life that I just always had sleep issues.

83
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.080
Cherrie lamparelli: So that has nothing to do with with so

84
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:46.590
Dawn Abriel: It does, because if you had sleep issues before and then opioids. They mess with your sleep center. Awesome. So it's a double whammy. Yeah.

85
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:58.830
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, I've been sleeping. I mean, out here. It's been hard to sleep, just because of my allergies and the and the altitude out here is a lot. Yeah, yeah.

86
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.930
Dawn Abriel: How long, how long have you been here.

87
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.660
Cherrie lamparelli: Six weeks seven weeks.

88
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.370
Dawn Abriel: Week. So you're

89
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.510
Dawn Abriel: Almost seven. It takes 120 days.

90
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.620
Dawn Abriel: For your body to build up the number of red blood cells that you need to be at this altitude.

91
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.790
Dawn Abriel: So in a couple more weeks you'll start feeling better.

92
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.230
Cherrie lamparelli: I hope so. Thank you for telling me that because nobody's told me that

93
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.080
Cherrie lamparelli: Though I've been drinking a lot of water.

94
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.820
Dawn Abriel: That's important like

95
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:48.900
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, drinking water and really just not exerting yourself a whole lot because you you simply do not have enough red blood cells to carry the oxygen around to feed the muscles. So what you end up doing is creating a lot of

96
00:07:50.160 --> 00:08:07.230
Dawn Abriel: waste product that's a strain on your kidneys. So you drink the water you clear out your kidneys and you want the you want your blood to be as thin as it can be to get all the red blood cells where they need to be. So you're doing the right thing and

97
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:15.300
Cherrie lamparelli: I've been excited myself, though, because I've been working a lot here. I live in my sister's house, and I'm not working because

98
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:28.770
Cherrie lamparelli: It's really hard you not to find a job right now, but my sister said I didn't have to worry about it. Just get settled in for us and wait for this covert 19 and so I live on a farm. So it's exhausting sometimes but

99
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.500
Cherrie lamparelli: It's, yeah. That's the first I've heard of it. So thank you. No wonder why I've been getting tired a lot, especially with the heat is coming. It's like

100
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.420
Cherrie lamparelli: Oh my goodness. Is it hot out

101
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.970
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, and I smoke.

102
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.670
Dawn Abriel: Oh yeah, well,

103
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.670
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever tried to quit.

104
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.100
Cherrie lamparelli: I have a few times.

105
00:08:51.180 --> 00:09:11.190
Dawn Abriel: Well, let let us help you, we, we will do whatever we can to help you because of all the the toxins, you're putting in your body that is don't about 470,000 people a year die in this country from tobacco.

106
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.450
Cherrie lamparelli: Really

107
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:21.540
Dawn Abriel: How many to 70,000 every year digest. We don't think we think, oh, it's legal. I can go to the grocery store and buy it.

108
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:30.090
Dawn Abriel: If this product had come on the market it you know now, it would never be allowed. It's so toxic.

109
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.620
Cherrie lamparelli: Yes.

110
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.510
Cherrie lamparelli: I can down. I'm sorry.

111
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.950
Dawn Abriel: That's fine.

112
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.770
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so, um,

113
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.930
Dawn Abriel: So you've never had an overdose.

114
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.010
Never

115
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.340
Dawn Abriel: And no medical problems associated

116
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.310
Dawn Abriel: With it, and no legal issues. Nope. Great.

117
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.410
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever been hospitalized for a mental illness.

118
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.280
Cherrie lamparelli: No.

119
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.700
Dawn Abriel: And what would you say your stress level is right now.

120
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.010
Dawn Abriel: mild, moderate, or severe

121
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:31.500
Cherrie lamparelli: Non for a little while. Little I'm just worried about, you know, I've gotten off this medication once and and as a very awful feeling so I'm just cutting back I feel great. But nervous. You know that I don't have anymore because I've been on it for three years.

122
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.590
Dawn Abriel: So yeah, I'm surprised that the program, you were in didn't take her you down.

123
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.360
Cherrie lamparelli: Stay know the next day.

124
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:50.340
Cherrie lamparelli: I they had me on three a day. I didn't like that and and so they they put me to to a day.

125
00:10:50.910 --> 00:11:06.600
Cherrie lamparelli: So you know what's funny is they never asked me for my doctor's name or information throughout all the assessment and all the questions they asked me, they never asked me any of that because I figured that you guys would want to get my medical records or anything.

126
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.220
Dawn Abriel: Well,

127
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:15.780
Dawn Abriel: As an addiction. Dr. I will handle your addiction problem. If you end up in my group.

128
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.710
Dawn Abriel: But I don't do primary care. I won't handle, you know, blood pressure or thyroid or

129
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.030
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, no, it wasn't a

130
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.290
Cherrie lamparelli: Primary care.

131
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.800
Cherrie lamparelli: It was the doctor who's prescribed me the medicine.

132
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.410
Cherrie lamparelli: Right, it was a it was a group

133
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.610
Cherrie lamparelli: Doctor, like you. Yeah.

134
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:48.450
Dawn Abriel: Okay well and if if something should come up where I need to consult I'll have you go to the virtual clinic and sign a release of information and ROI.

135
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.120
Dawn Abriel: And you'll tell them that doctor's name.

136
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.960
Cherrie lamparelli: Just, I just thought it was curious. I figured that maybe you guys wanted to know or

137
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.510
Cherrie lamparelli: If they we don't usually all

138
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.890
Dawn Abriel: Unless there's something very unusual about the circumstances.

139
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.120
Cherrie lamparelli: Olga. Okay.

140
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.080

Cherrie lamparelli: Oh gosh, I don't know.

142
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.460
Cherrie lamparelli: It's not that great.

143
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.000
Dawn Abriel: But you you know that you're worthwhile human being and you deserve care and

144
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.950
Cherrie lamparelli: Oh, yeah.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.060
Okay.

Cherrie lamparelli: Do you know yeah is

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.140
No.

149
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:42.300
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'm going to read a really long list of medical problems, stop me if any of them are pertaining to you.

150
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.890

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:19.290
Cherrie lamparelli: They left the better of the two. But when I had to go back to the hospital. The new doctor had said he should have taken them both out but

194
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.910
Dawn Abriel: So well, different opinions. Right.

195
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.810
Cherrie lamparelli: That's right. Well, I ended up with a blood infection. I almost died. They kept me in the hospital for like 30 days.

196
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:42.960
Cherrie lamparelli: After because they found an abscess growing and then the abscess. They've got into my bloodstream. So then they put me when I was in a room, they were giving me delighted

197
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:55.650
Cherrie lamparelli: And nobody gave me any stool softener. So I ended up vomiting bowels, which then got into my bloodstream and I was like, definitely ill, so

198
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.900
Cherrie lamparelli: I didn't know what was going on. And then they

199
00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:06.720
Cherrie lamparelli: Want some nurse figured it out. And they gave me some IV antibiotics and stuff. And thank God.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.480

304
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:15.990
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, it's very hard to be perfect. You know, I mean to stop smoking cigarettes to stop drinking the soda. I mean, I'm trying my best to do

305
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:35.820
Cherrie lamparelli: You know everything right now so sick to talk about stop drinking soda and stop smoking cigarettes and no I mean, not the alcohol. No drugs, no alcohol. I mean it's, I'm trying to just move on with life right now so you talking about all these things give me very much into it.

Cherrie lamparelli: Okay.

317
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.440
Cherrie lamparelli: This has been hard.

318
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:36.120
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah and and I certainly am not a perfect person.

319
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.620
Dawn Abriel: Right, I don't

320
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:58.470
Dawn Abriel: I sorry that that is coming across that way because I am not insisting that you make these changes. I'm an educator and it just is important that I mentioned where the risks are, what, what should I do with the information is entirely up to you.

Cherrie lamparelli: I take it three times today.

395
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.880
Dawn Abriel: And

396
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.230
Cherrie lamparelli: I have to get up and get a tissue.

397
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:53.310
Okay.

398
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.070
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, sorry.

399
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.870
Dawn Abriel: So you've been taking two of the eight slash to milligram

400
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.080
Dawn Abriel: Films.

401
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.550
Cherrie lamparelli: I've been taken the two films one in the morning and one in

402
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.030
Cherrie lamparelli: About five six o'clock at night.

403
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.470
Dawn Abriel: So that's, that's not the correct way to take this

404
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.100
Medicine.

405
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.310
Cherrie lamparelli: Two films under the tongue daily

406
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.840
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's supposed to be done first thing in the morning. Both films.

407
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:42.990
Dawn Abriel: You don't want to forget them. Yeah, that this medicine was made for chronic pain and end of life patients in 2000 and its

408
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:55.050
Dawn Abriel: Last between 24 and 48 hours it there's no reason to divide it up, you need to take your dose. First thing in the morning, same time of the day.

409
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.070
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, I take it every morning when I wake up the exact same well about six o'clock in the morning.

410
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:07.650
Dawn Abriel: So all you have to do is stay you know take both take whatever you're going to take

411
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.360
Dawn Abriel: One time during the

412
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.190
Dawn Abriel: Day. Don't take it.

413
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.070
Dawn Abriel: don't divide it up. You don't need you.

414
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:30.090
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, so like see it okay and I cut them under the little piece so that I made them stretch. I think that's why I'm having issues that I've been having. But it doesn't let me put that back in there. So it says

415
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:42.780
Cherrie lamparelli: It just says desert. I don't know the cameras. It just says dissolve to under the tongue daily. It doesn't say he never told me when I never he just said, Take it in the morning and take it at night.

416
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:48.600
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Well, he, he was an educated about the medicine. That's all I can tell you

417
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.060
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, I'm not gonna argue, I'm just as funny that

418
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.740
Cherrie lamparelli: You're the first person to say that

419
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:09.090
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's, it's, I don't, I don't understand why it's common it. I would say 80% of new patients that I get from other doctors

420
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.250
Cherrie lamparelli: They don't know that so

421
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:17.340
Dawn Abriel: It's, I can't explain it, but it's

422
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.570
Dawn Abriel: Just a matter of they didn't get educated about the medicine.

423
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:22.560
Cherrie lamparelli: Because

424
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.640
In sometimes

425
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:39.240
Dawn Abriel: In some countries, they give this medicine. Every third day it last. Yeah, yeah. You won't you won't go into full withdrawal until you've been off the medicine, three, four days.

426
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:46.950
Cherrie lamparelli: Really yeah I think my anxiety overwhelms me with the thought of it. I had a friend.

427
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.350
Dawn Abriel: You're very powerful.

428
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.590
Cherrie lamparelli: Isn't it is awful. Sometimes

429
00:35:54.270 --> 00:36:06.720
Cherrie lamparelli: As my other friend that was on it and she she got GW I went and she got incarcerated and when she got out. She told me how she

430
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:20.100
Cherrie lamparelli: You know they don't give you them in there. So she withdrew and she's like, I was the worst thing that she'd ever gone through in her life. And so her story scared the crap out of me.

431
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.830
Dawn Abriel: Yep. So how many days. Have you been decreasing your dose.

432
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.550
Cherrie lamparelli: For so

433
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.060
Cherrie lamparelli: Let's see the 20th

434
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:41.490
Cherrie lamparelli: The, the week before the 20th. The week a couple days before the 20th of April.

435
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.770
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

436
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.970
Dawn Abriel: Oh my goodness.

437
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.280
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah, this is the thing.

438
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.500
Dawn Abriel: You you have now.

439
00:36:50.760 --> 00:37:01.410
Dawn Abriel: down regulated, you don't have as many receptors as you did before so I'm not going to give you 16 I'm really thinking that 12 milligrams is going to be enough for you.

440
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:07.050
Cherrie lamparelli: That's fine. I wouldn't, I would love my life without these

441
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.370
Cherrie lamparelli: To be honest, and

442
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.320
Dawn Abriel: Then let's do it. Look.

443
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:27.660
Dawn Abriel: Okay i i taper everyone down to a safe medical dose, which is one one milligram, but very, very slowly, very slowly. I don't do it quickly, but you can go to 12 milligrams now because you've done it to yourself.

444
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.980
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah yeah

445
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:41.280
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, so I'm, I'm happy because you know you're the first time that I've heard any doctor anybody say that they wanted to do that. And I honestly think the doctors at home.

446
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:51.840
Cherrie lamparelli: Are just legal drug dealers. You know what I mean, because they can, they never talked about getting you off of it or whatever, you know, to get you off this medication.

447
00:37:52.560 --> 00:38:09.330
Cherrie lamparelli: And I'm like what. So when will I be ready to get off of it because I've been on it for for for three almost three years and I've only fell off the wagon three or four times. And I'm very honest. I can't lie because I talk too much, but

448
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.910
Cherrie lamparelli: I was very honest about it but you take a drug test every, every two weeks to so

449
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.760
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so yes.

450
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.760
Dawn Abriel: I hear your concern that you, you want to come off and

451
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.230
Cherrie lamparelli: This eventually

452
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:34.500
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, the study showed that when people have been in therapy and they feel really comfortable and confident that

453
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:53.670
Dawn Abriel: An emotional issue isn't going to trigger them into using that's when you know you can come off. Now I would like I make, I strongly encourage I don't make people but I strongly encourage them to get down to a really safe dose because

454
00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:20.250
Dawn Abriel: If you need to have pain relief at 16 milligrams. Yeah, getting getting like one more strip will barely, barely do anything, getting two strips more will barely do anything for the pain relief, but if you're at one milligram, and you get one milligram more. It's a huge increase in pain relief.

455
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:21.750
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay.

456
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:42.090
Dawn Abriel: Go to one to two, it's, it's good pain relief. If you go to 16 to 24 there's hardly any. It's just the way the drug binds to the cell. The receptors. There just aren't any receptors left to be made to add for pain relief.

457
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.380
Cherrie lamparelli: So, so the pain that I have these actually help with it.

458
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.930
Dawn Abriel: Well, listen narcotic you're taking a long acting narcotic.

459
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.610
Cherrie lamparelli: I don't know that.

460
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.410
Oh my goodness.

461
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.000
Dawn Abriel: buprenorphine is a long acting narcotic.

462
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:01.710
Dawn Abriel: Really, that's why.

463
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.520
Cherrie lamparelli: I gotta watch

464
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.510
Dawn Abriel: Withdrawal

465
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.590
Cherrie lamparelli: I thought it was a nerve block or a blocker.

466
00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.020
Cherrie lamparelli: That's all I knew

467
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:20.250
Dawn Abriel: It does block some receptors that cause pain. So yes, you're taking a long narrow the narcotic.

468
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:33.570
Cherrie lamparelli: Because like the morning I wake up in my fingers in my, in my my my joints are just swirling in the morning from sleeping. But it goes away after like an hour waking up, but they always hurt.

469
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:42.270
Cherrie lamparelli: And so, but now I take motoring to get rid of the pain or just to help me, you know, with the with the whole

470
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:43.920
Cherrie lamparelli: Thing.

471
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:44.880
But write

472
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.640
Cherrie lamparelli: It for inflammation. That's the word

473
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.620
Dawn Abriel: Right, yeah. And

474
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.290
Dawn Abriel: The. It really is.

475
00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:01.800
Dawn Abriel: Now this is not a criticism don't hear criticism. Okay, just hear information.

476
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:02.820
Okay.

477
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:11.970
Dawn Abriel: Inflammation is caused from too much glucose, too much sugar. I

478
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:20.580
Cherrie lamparelli: Figured I knew I had a feeling that I knew that because it's funny when I drink coffee with some sugar in it.

479
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:31.920
Cherrie lamparelli: The day before, it seems like my hands and my feet are worse the next day. And if I don't, my hands on as bad if I don't drink the sugar, the day before.

480
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.570
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, I know.

481
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.840
Cherrie lamparelli: Me because I drink Coke all day but I

482
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.650
Cherrie lamparelli: can drink a coffee and make my hands worse the next day.

483
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.710
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, well, it's probably the combination

484
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.830
Dawn Abriel: One one like eight ounce coke.

485
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.690
Dawn Abriel: Has a teen grams of sugar in it.

486
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.460
Cherrie lamparelli: Thank God I don't know a grand

487
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.110
Dawn Abriel: Here's a cup.

488
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.750
Dawn Abriel: Then it would be about this much sugar.

489
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.300
Cherrie lamparelli: Oh, that's a lot of sugar.

490
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.670
Dawn Abriel: But it's, it's all dissolved. So you don't you don't know it, you don't

491
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:24.960
Dawn Abriel: I, I, I am a sugar addict. I, I will take it. I, it took many, many, many, many years to find things that I could substitute

492
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:42.000
Dawn Abriel: But just we know if I want to soothe myself I try my meditation I try lots of things and it but sugar is instance sugar just or the sweet. So now I do monk fruit.

493
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.210
Cherrie lamparelli: That's a monk, for never heard of it.

494
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:51.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's a, I do not taste an aftertaste.

495
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:57.390
Dawn Abriel: It's a from a fruit that's from the tropics and

496
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:15.660
Dawn Abriel: It doesn't have it doesn't cause the glucose to be increased and it looks just like they make it so it looks just like sugar and I buy I buy unsweetened things and then I put the monk fruit in it.

497
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:17.760
Dawn Abriel: So,

498
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:29.310
Cherrie lamparelli: I've been trying really hard to to replace like when I go to drink a Coke to drink something I was like I drink of water with some crystal. I put some Crystal Light iced tea makes sense.

499
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:29.790
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

500
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.170
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, I'm trying

501
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:44.010
Dawn Abriel: But you are. I can hear that and and and I commend you. I it's not easy. And we know we have these conditioned responses for

502
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:45.540
Dawn Abriel: What

503
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:55.440
Dawn Abriel: What soothes us what feels right. What seems good. And there's that just takes retraining and

504
00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:58.980
Dawn Abriel: A lot of retraining.

505
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.620
Dawn Abriel: Just, just how it is. Yeah.

506
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:11.430
Dawn Abriel: Let me talk. Just very briefly about the group you're going to be in the group. Are you a morning person.

507
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:18.810
Cherrie lamparelli: I'm kind of but I'm so busy in the morning with feeding all the animals.

508
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.960
Dawn Abriel: Ah, so a seven o'clock group on Tuesday morning. Would that not be

509
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.340
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, that's gonna that would be real hard. That's when it's the busiest

510
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.270
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

511
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.670
Cherrie lamparelli: It's like crazy around here at that time.

512
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.760
Dawn Abriel: Right. And how about a a noon or

513
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.720
Dawn Abriel: Let's see.

514
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.140
Cherrie lamparelli: Anytime after that is I guess it's fine.

515
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.370
Okay.

516
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.210

Cherrie lamparelli: I only have that piece that I was gonna

523
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.780
Cherrie lamparelli: I was waiting to talk to you. I haven't taken it.

524
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.100
Cherrie lamparelli: Yet this morning because

Cherrie lamparelli: gladly take it.

526
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:42.870
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, because the lady I talked to talk to you yesterday, she said. She goes, Well, if the meeting goes well then should prescribe you some. I said, What is so I might not have a chance of getting any and so I've been freaking out since yesterday and I haven't really

527
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.660
Dawn Abriel: I have to talk to them. I always give peace people medicine, always, always

528
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.440
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, she said she, it would depend on how the meeting went

529
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.160
Cherrie lamparelli: So I haven't taken it yet because I've been trying to hold out

530
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.780
Dawn Abriel: Oh goodness gracious.

531
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:58.650
Yeah.

532
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:07.080
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I will. I will tell her to reassure people. So you're going to take one and a half strips now.

533
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.380
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, well, we're going to take this piece right now.

534
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.720
Dawn Abriel: Go ahead and you'll know if one and a half is too much, you'll get sleepy.

535
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.680
Dawn Abriel: You'll just and then you'll back it down to one and see how you do. Okay.

536
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:30.330
Dawn Abriel: So I'm going to go ahead and just finished this part.

537
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.070
Cherrie lamparelli: Hate the taste of it never liked it.

538
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.770
Dawn Abriel: Now, nobody ever does

539
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:55.590
Dawn Abriel: Did you know that it's very, very important that you not smoke 20 to 30 minutes before you take your sub

540
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.390
Cherrie lamparelli: Before

541
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.820
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, because you know you're trying to absorb it, there's a

542
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.900
Dawn Abriel: A web of blood vessels under your tongue.

543
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:19.020
Dawn Abriel: And all smoking nicotine, whether you vapor or E cigarette or smoke or chew it contains nicotine and nicotine clamps down your blood vessels.

544
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:26.580
Dawn Abriel: So you if you clamp down your blood vessels under your tongue, you're not being able to absorb the medicine.

545
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.650
Dawn Abriel: So you want to make sure you get up in the morning, you know, take your sub let your let it absorb

546
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.230
Dawn Abriel: Before you smoke.

547
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.500
Dawn Abriel: Are you allergic to any medicines.

548
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:44.820

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.130
Dawn Abriel: What happens

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.850
Cherrie lamparelli: As an allergic reaction and morphine.

551
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.930
Dawn Abriel: So psychotic reaction to morphine.

552
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.110
Dawn Abriel: And

553
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.970
Dawn Abriel: doesn't let me do

554
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.140
Dawn Abriel: Just, just coding. That's weird.

555
00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.480
Dawn Abriel: Just want. There it is.

556
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:24.180
Dawn Abriel: And

557
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.370
Dawn Abriel: So tell me what happens. Tell me what what happens to your body.

558
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:37.560
Cherrie lamparelli: I just had an allergic reaction. I haven't had in a long time. So it just some, I know that I got the hives.

559
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.170

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:01.560
Cherrie lamparelli: Trying to talk with us and my mouse it that tastes just went all over the mouse. I'm sorry.

562
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.890
Dawn Abriel: I usually don't talk with it in my mouth.

563
00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:07.560
Dawn Abriel: Right.

564
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.370
Dawn Abriel: And so just coding and morphing

565
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.350
Cherrie lamparelli: Correct. All right.

566
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.010

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.010
Dawn Abriel: Now I want you to get your pulse.

Dawn Abriel: And so you can do it. You've got a muscle that runs down the side of your neck right in front of that muscle in front of it.

572

Cherrie lamparelli: My pen I was sitting on it.

632
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:53.190
Cherrie lamparelli: I had to use another one that had no okay

633
00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:00.720
Dawn Abriel: So Tuesday at 12 yeah and before every group meeting.

634
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.250
Cherrie lamparelli: You

635
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.330
Dawn Abriel: As I'm going to turn there.

636
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:04.770
Cherrie lamparelli: Hmm.

637
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.650
Dawn Abriel: And do you have any questions.

638
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.630
Cherrie lamparelli: No, so

639
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:20.190
Cherrie lamparelli: I want. Well, I do. Yes I do, but not not a big one. So when I first signed up and they asked me about all the medication. I was on

640
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:31.080
Cherrie lamparelli: So I told them the Adderall and this and that's what I need to find a doctor for and I swear, but don't I I'm not quite sure because

641
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:48.090
Cherrie lamparelli: There was just a lot of information and a lot of questions when i was i thought that they said that the doctors here would describe me all my medication, but then when I talked to the lady yesterday. She said, No, this is just for that one medication. So, um,

642
00:55:48.150 --> 00:56:02.610
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you're gonna have to find a psychiatrist, you're gonna end which is really, really, really hard to do in New Mexico. So start early start getting on the waiting list start calling places and and

643
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:06.870
Cherrie lamparelli: Well, that was what I was going to ask you, do you know anybody I could call

644
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:13.230
Dawn Abriel: I know one person in. Let me give you her name. Hold on a second, let me

645
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:36.060
Dawn Abriel: See if she's taking new patients. Her name is Lisa Elia say in the last name is F ee i ee R m a n

646
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:49.530
Dawn Abriel: And her phone number is 505-450-7626 she's in corral us so it might be a bit of a schlep but

647
00:56:53.490 --> 00:57:00.630
Dawn Abriel: I mean, you could see it because they're just as a shortage, there's a shortage of so many specialists here in New Mexico.

648
00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:03.810
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay, and the PCP can't write those

649
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:09.210
Dawn Abriel: Oh yeah PCP could, yeah, I got you really want to have a PCP.

650
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:16.500
Cherrie lamparelli: I just, I don't know. My sister is going to give me hers. So, because I don't know who to call. I mean, I

651
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:31.080
Cherrie lamparelli: I'm 46 years old and I've never lived out here. So at home, I would know all the doctors, you know, like who who's a good primary care doctor to have or or ob gyn but out here. I don't even know a doctor's name or street.

652
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.430
Dawn Abriel: So,

653
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.840
Cherrie lamparelli: This has been hard.

654
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:47.070
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you know, taking recommend is the hard thing is going to be. Are they taking new patients. So what I would say is look at your insurance and start with what your insurance recommends

655
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.910
Dawn Abriel: That. So the, you know, they're already taking your insurance.

656
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:54.990
Dawn Abriel: When go online, Google them and see how they're rated

657
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:56.160
Okay.

658
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:57.720
Cherrie lamparelli: Okay.

659
00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:04.230
Dawn Abriel: I'll tell you one of the best ways to find out the good Docs is to

660
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:12.780
Dawn Abriel: Find a nurse, a charge nurse in the hospital and say, Who do you go to

661
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.200
Dawn Abriel: A SISTER Hall, they've seen them all.

662
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.120
Cherrie lamparelli: Like this is a supervisor.

663
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:24.780
Dawn Abriel: Yep, that's the way you want. Whatever she recommends is much more likely to be a match a fit for you.

664
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:31.230
Cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, I just, you know, my family doesn't know about anything. So I try not to tell them about certain things.

665
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:41.070
Cherrie lamparelli: They've been out here for many years and I've been at home by myself with my kids. So I haven't said anything about this.

666
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.130
Cherrie lamparelli: As well. I have heard the word the medication.

667
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:49.110
Cherrie lamparelli: They know I need my medication, but they don't know what it is. Right.

668
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.610
Dawn Abriel: And one of the things that happens with addicts is they isolate

669
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:55.470
Cherrie lamparelli: And

670
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.060
Cherrie lamparelli: I that I do.

671
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.980
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and and

672
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.130
Dawn Abriel: That's that's hurting you.

673
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:06.480
Cherrie lamparelli: Haha, there's a lot of things that are hurting. Yeah.

674
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:17.400
Dawn Abriel: And that's why you're going to be in therapy and I will be surprised if you don't really, really, really, really like this therapist if you've been in therapy before

675
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:20.250
Dawn Abriel: You are going to see

676
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.790
Cherrie lamparelli: I didn't like my therapist before I

677
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:25.920
Dawn Abriel: Didn't oh

678
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:32.460
Dawn Abriel: Well, look, it's a very intimate relationship. And if you don't match this woman.

679
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:49.980
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you'll know after about three or four visits right you'll know if you click because there are other therapists, we've got like five different therapists in New Mexico. Now you can change. Don't hesitate. If you're not, if you're not clicking with this woman.

680
00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:55.200
Dawn Abriel: I'd be surprised, but

681
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.210
Cherrie lamparelli: I had this one therapist that I didn't

682
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:08.610
Cherrie lamparelli: I kept seeing or because of an event that happened in my life. And she was driving me crazy like it always that I wasn't

683
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:23.610
Cherrie lamparelli: I don't know how to explain it, but she said like, because I had anger issues. And she's like, take a broom and hit a mattress with it. And then it was, she was just very weird and it just made me feel very uncomfortable and I didn't want to talk while I was there.

684
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:25.320
Cherrie lamparelli: So,

685
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:26.490
Yeah.

686
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:38.070
Dawn Abriel: Well, some people do have that as a way of coping with anger, she must have been a little older.

687
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.230
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

688
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.780
Cherrie lamparelli: She worked for this US District Attorney's office.

689
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.470
Cherrie lamparelli: So,

690
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:51.960
Dawn Abriel: All right, well,

691
01:00:53.130 --> 01:01:03.450
Dawn Abriel: I'll finish up my chart with you and your medicines already ordered so be sure and call them in a few minutes and say, Did the order come through.

692
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.860
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and that you're going to pick it up and you're going to ask for them to count.

693
