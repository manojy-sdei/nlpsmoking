Magalie Marcellus: And he says, part of it is the renal disease.

158
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:16.800
Martin’s iPhone: That might have some to do with the, you know, but I've had the issue for probably about five, six years now that it's gotten worse just sore. I mean, anytime I work with power tools or anything.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:02.520
Martin’s iPhone: Good. She's still sleeping. She worked last night and thinks she's just catching up on asleep. She'll probably be up all night tonight that

Martin’s iPhone: She doesn't work.

178
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.940

190
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.490
Magalie Marcellus: The person that you're working with is things slow down or

191
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.350

196
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.980
Magalie Marcellus: Working on

197
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:35.760
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I'm almost done with the delights in there and then I'll go to the warehouse and start on those. There's probably about 40 lights in there.

198
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:45.840
Martin’s iPhone: And from there, we have to. They're going to be starting to do pressure washing and roof repairs, possibly a couple routes.

199
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:52.320
Martin’s iPhone: I'm going to recommend that he does a roof on one of the the rentals. It's getting pretty bad.

200
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.640
Martin’s iPhone: As long as I push them a little bit, let me make the call.

201
00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.460
Martin’s iPhone: So I have some good work coming up.

202
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.450
Magalie Marcellus: Does a roof inspection.

203
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.850
Martin’s iPhone: I do it all.

204
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.280
Magalie Marcellus: So you check to see where they need so that we need. So happened.

205
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:11.940
Yeah.

206
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:21.120
Martin’s iPhone: Because I've been pretty much intimate with these buildings for last often on last four or five years.

207
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.170
Magalie Marcellus: That I've done someone

208
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.960
Martin’s iPhone: I know a lot of the things that are going

209
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.010
Magalie Marcellus: On the issues.

210
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:26.610
That

211
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.980
Martin’s iPhone: If I recommend that that needs a new roof instead of sending me to repair it over and over here.

212
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.060
Magalie Marcellus: we're switching over here. I didn't know what you need. Yeah.

213
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:48.990
Martin’s iPhone: we're switching over from shingle roof thing to do in metal roofs on most of these. So I like shoveling better but metal is definitely has its advantages.

214
00:39:50.760 --> 00:40:00.120
Martin’s iPhone: If I have somebody to help me with the screws, because an average roof will put in five to 10,000 screws so I need to

215
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.030
Martin’s iPhone: You know, yeah.

216
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.380
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

217
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.450
Martin’s iPhone: Yes, a small roof is thousand screws.

218
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.220
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

219
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.660
Martin’s iPhone: It's just a lot of

220
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.080
Magalie Marcellus: People what happened there. So how long does this type of work would take

221
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.960
Magalie Marcellus: Weeks, months.

222
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:30.030
Martin’s iPhone: Well be busy all summer doing pressure washing and other things to probably have me doing some Mo and things like that, but

223
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.440
Martin’s iPhone: Most the

224
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.560
Martin’s iPhone: Most part is

225
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.040
Martin’s iPhone: Just random just depends.

226
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:40.920
Martin’s iPhone: But I mean,

227
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:42.810
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

228
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:51.300
Martin’s iPhone: If there's me as a sink that's leaking or how they need replaced or carpeting tour.

229
00:40:52.470 --> 00:41:01.710
Martin’s iPhone: Lot of times because they have 87 rentals right if they yeah they evict somebody I have to go in and do a lot of the cleanup and stone.

230
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.190
Magalie Marcellus: Right hand to paint into some I asked him into it.

231
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:12.480
Martin’s iPhone: Just depends a lot of times liner, the wife will do painting, but a

232
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:21.720
Martin’s iPhone: Lot of times I'm open to the task and doing it. They don't, they usually try to get somebody that that you don't have to charge as much as

233
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.490
Magalie Marcellus: Less expensive for them to get the unit ready for rental. Yeah.

234
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.260
Magalie Marcellus: And I keep you busy, I suppose. Yep.

235
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.210
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I mean for the roofing this year. I want to try to tell them hey

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.280
Martin’s iPhone: You know, and I can go at my own pace. I want at least 14 and our

237
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.340
Martin’s iPhone: I don't want to go any lower than that.

238
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.850
Martin’s iPhone: I'm just, it's a lot of hard work for that.

239
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:52.620
Martin’s iPhone: But

240
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.780
Magalie Marcellus: We have other people's working with true

241
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.460
Martin’s iPhone: Depends on how bigger group. I'm going to do and

242
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.360
Martin’s iPhone: Time's

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.580
Martin’s iPhone: Up a one person in as a helper.

244
00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.970
Martin’s iPhone: I can do them all on my own, but

245
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.380
Martin’s iPhone: It just depends on if it's a one story to story a big it is.

246
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.700
Martin’s iPhone: A lot of the stuff I just do on my own. Just take my time and do it.

247
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:23.160
Magalie Marcellus: So does that impact any type of pain and, especially, you said with your hand. So how does that, how do you work on

248
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.510
Martin’s iPhone: Your my hands when I have to tear off shingles and things like that. It's my hands, but

249
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.560
Martin’s iPhone: The roofing part mostly is on my back.

250
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:46.500
Martin’s iPhone: Back and knees, my knees aren't too bad, but on my back starting knows last couple years, and my back really can do as far as being, you know, hunched over like this and pounding on the shingles.

251
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.390
Martin’s iPhone: stuff starts through my lower backs and there's no real

252
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.350
Magalie Marcellus: One day to do

253
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.700
Magalie Marcellus: So we leave any kind of pain, discomfort. Why would you do those

254
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.480
Martin’s iPhone: Steps go through

255
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:12.450
Martin’s iPhone: Yes, why you should take Percocet, some bacon and all that, because that was the only thing that could really take it away. I mean, I've improved from a little bit you know that

256
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:21.390
Martin’s iPhone: Really just time time and rest is down thing I can do like if I get too far and I get to the point where I need to stop just stop, stop.

257
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:28.170
Magalie Marcellus: Playing. I don't know how much you can your body can handle. Then you take a break. Yeah.

258
00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.940
Magalie Marcellus: So we charge

259
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:37.080
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, the heat day doesn't really bother me. Sometimes it does, but I mean I'm just so used to it now.

260
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:44.100
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, because if it's if it's 90 degrees on the ground 120 or

261
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.210
Magalie Marcellus: 100 I can imagine. And they say, that doesn't bother you.

262
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.290
Martin’s iPhone: Know,

263
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.930
Magalie Marcellus: Not real at night, no healing session.

264
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.250
Martin’s iPhone: I've had it. Oh, yeah. I mean, if, if I'm not careful, get that for sure.

265
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.020
Magalie Marcellus: And a lot of

266
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.610
Magalie Marcellus: Hydrated drink I liquid water.

267
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:06.540
Martin’s iPhone: Yes, some days to go through a gallon of water. Easy.

268
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:12.810
Martin’s iPhone: And then a weird thing is, I'll go drink a gallon of water and not p at all. Once maybe

269
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.160
Magalie Marcellus: That's interesting.

270
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:16.800
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

271
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:27.900
Martin’s iPhone: Okay, in the morning. See, when I get home. I drink a lot more relaxed occurs in the morning I'll get up and go pee. But then once I get to work in and start working on time so I will be at all during the day.

272
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.140
Martin’s iPhone: And I can drink a guy or

273
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.640
Martin’s iPhone: You know,

274
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:38.070
Martin’s iPhone: That's just

275
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.850
Magalie Marcellus: Not

276
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.500
Magalie Marcellus: Good. That is my bladder, but

277
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:49.680
Martin’s iPhone: No, it creates really dark urine and stuff, but there's really no way around it. I mean, if I'm going to do this work, I have to

278
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.720
Martin’s iPhone: Just have to endure it

279
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:53.160
Magalie Marcellus: When you have

280
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.050
Magalie Marcellus: One, though, you have to take some breaks in between to make sure you take care of that.

281
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.120
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I mean,

282
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:06.930
Martin’s iPhone: It just depends on on what we're doing. I mean sometimes I can take a break. But it's, it's still that hard.

283
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.040
It's hard.

284
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.000
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes it's hard to find a job, you know,

285
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:23.700
Martin’s iPhone: I try to work it out where I'm working with the sun. So if I know that I've got, like, the harder part of the day, I'll try to end up on the side that's it shaded if there's a shaded area.

286
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.330
Gotcha.

287
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.290
Magalie Marcellus: Earlier before the sun gets oh

288
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.790
Yeah yeah

289
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.200
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah. A lot of times, US 36 o'clock in the morning, if I can.

290
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.280
Martin’s iPhone: And then like around noon have to stop because smearing the shingles with my team.

291
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.350
Martin’s iPhone: Mistake. They can only take so much to. I mean, it's so hot that they start

292
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.050
Martin’s iPhone: Like if you try to step on them in your room so

293
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.060
Martin’s iPhone: If I'm saying

294
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:59.070
Magalie Marcellus: Also, the last time we spoke about some of those safety concern that you had. So any issues since we last talked

295
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.620
Magalie Marcellus: We got in your older son.

296
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.750
Magalie Marcellus: No, I haven't had a chance to reach out at all. Nope.

297
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.380
Martin’s iPhone: Nope. It pretty much like

298
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.690
Martin’s iPhone: I'm pretty sure he knows that.

299
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:13.320
I know way.

300
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.060
