Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I mean, you're really only is trapped is what you make it sometimes unless

158
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.640
Martin’s iPhone: Unless you're in like Italy or somewhere where they are locked down

159
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.680
Martin’s iPhone: The street, you can't be out of the WiFi or something, you know, India, I think it is, does that. So we're lucky here we can

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.610
Martin’s iPhone: Go out and do

161
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:53.250
Martin’s iPhone: Pretty much. And if they thing indoors, it would still that would be really hard for a lot of people here, they

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.470
Magalie Marcellus: Hadn't been able to in the house at all.

Martin’s iPhone: Know, hopefully, by doing saying, and hopefully we can bring the spike way down and ended soon, you know, not draw it out for another six months.

165
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.260
Magalie Marcellus: Right, it means

166
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.520
Martin’s iPhone: Something different.

167
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:09.990
Magalie Marcellus: And something

168
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.560
Martin’s iPhone: Has a little bit more freedom than others, based on what's going on with it.

169
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.550
Magalie Marcellus: With us

170
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.220
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, even like Chicago, New York City.

171
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.350
Martin’s iPhone: I've been to Time Square. So I've seen how busy it is there.

172
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.070
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

173
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.090
Magalie Marcellus: I know when you see it in the on the news with barely

174
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:35.310
Magalie Marcellus: Any solo on there. It looks the scenes really eerie. Yeah. Yep. Yes. Yes. Any questions.

175
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.670
Magalie Marcellus: The sense that standstill right now.

176
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.530
Martin’s iPhone: Unfortunately, yeah. Yeah.

177
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:41.910
Okay.

178
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.350
Martin’s iPhone: The city can do that, you know, you wouldn't think city could slow down.

179
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.210
Magalie Marcellus: Especially, New York, right, everything goes through there, but

180
00:12:52.290 --> 00:13:05.040
Magalie Marcellus: You know things we cannot thank audible even conceive. Those things are happening right now. So it's actually take it a day at a time. I'm just looking at the

181
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:13.020
Magalie Marcellus: survey that was back in December, we might have discuss it, maybe we didn't, but I just want to make sure that it was

182
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:25.260
Magalie Marcellus: The customer service survey, one of the question. And again, sometimes people just for whatever reason, select the one

183
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:36.090
Magalie Marcellus: The box. So whichever number. So I just want to confirm if there's anything that we needed to address or to help you with one of the room.

184
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:55.590
Magalie Marcellus: The server question. It says a model of help if you weren't satisfied or how satisfied are you with the amount of help you, we see on the program you selected one which is like the lowest. So was there anything that the program can do to get it to a higher

185
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.770
Magalie Marcellus: Or was something going on, or was it a one.

186
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.250
Magalie Marcellus: Miss. Miss answer. Yeah.

187
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.800
Martin’s iPhone: It must have been a mistake answer. I don't think I had anything

188
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.220
Magalie Marcellus: I don't take I did balance back in its back in the summers. You know, it's a little while back.

189
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.440
Magalie Marcellus: Just cool

190
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.120
I know you guys go back

191
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:26.130
Martin’s iPhone: I must, I must admit it. I read it wrong or either just did market rate for some reason.

192
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:43.230
Magalie Marcellus: And I noticed a trend on law if it's something the widow survey in some created. But yeah, a lot of time that questions gets Miss answers. So just have to make sure it's done properly.

193
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.080
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, it could be a glitch in the system to could be

194
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.690
Martin’s iPhone: Saying no no yes or something, you know,

195
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.940
Magalie Marcellus: So why would have been the

196
00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:03.000
Magalie Marcellus: Actual lead in that should give that answer the hassle for someone so core

197
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.110
Martin’s iPhone: How helpful is is this to me. Stephanie how

198
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.090
Magalie Marcellus: How satisfied are you with the model that you've received

199
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.940
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I'm very happy with it. And you guys have always been on time with everything and

200
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:26.340
Martin’s iPhone: You know, had interest in not just seeing that also you know with the surveys with everything. So I give it a for

201
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:55.830
Magalie Marcellus: Again why care and medical expenses, the one we just want to make sure if there's something that we can assist with or anything that may be of concern that we know about it, you know, the, you know, the agency is able to address it.

202
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:13.350
Magalie Marcellus: Alright, so the last time we talked on there was any update with your son, your shoulders.

203
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.900

Know,

206
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.300
Martin’s iPhone: I haven't seen him since that time. So, so far, nothing really

207
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.360
Martin’s iPhone: To report on the

208
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.870
Martin’s iPhone: Internet quote

209
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.130
Magalie Marcellus: I you less concern right now with them trying to come back to do anything, or is it the same thing.

210
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.350
Magalie Marcellus: An incident happened.

211
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.890
Martin’s iPhone: I don't know if he would ever come back to try to do anything.

212
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.850
Magalie Marcellus: Because I'm not something that was the concerns there.

Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

214
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.530
Magalie Marcellus: I mean as a

215
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.620
Martin’s iPhone: Turn that something might go wrong. Right now, you know,

216
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.000
Martin’s iPhone: I don't feel like I'm

217
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.440
Martin’s iPhone: I guess as word as I was that day that I maybe I seem a lot more concerned that day by offering concerned.

218
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.670
Martin’s iPhone: People, the ability to come into the house and fill those safer. Now, there may be

219
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.380
Martin’s iPhone: Something that hopefully would protect us, you know,

220
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.260
Magalie Marcellus: In terms of the weapon.

221
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.130
Yeah.

222
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.020
Magalie Marcellus: I'm

223
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:41.670
Magalie Marcellus: Going back and see. So with the nightmares. I think the better the same or

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.610
Martin’s iPhone: This past week. I haven't had

225
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.490
Martin’s iPhone: As many that I can remember being bad. So I guess been a good week.

226
00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:00.030
Magalie Marcellus: And you're on a medication that was still kind on yours that happen bad for you.

227
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:08.550
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, just seemed to help spurs asleep goes and maybe I'm getting a little bit more sleep right now. So that's how

228
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.200
Magalie Marcellus: I still struggling with the averages, which are getting medication or

229
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.280
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah I did go to the here, nose and throat doctor and after the

230
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.680
Martin’s iPhone: Surgery I'm decided my nose and on the back of my throat I have

231
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.690
Martin’s iPhone: BAD SHAPE TO MY follicular so now i'm not

232
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.250
Martin’s iPhone: As part of the reason I'm not able to swallow food great things sometimes

233
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:55.170
Martin’s iPhone: We get that maybe get that taken care of course. And so it's not something that's detrimental right now so you know to be a while before I get surgery and the one for my nose is because the side of my cavities crushed and they're going to

234
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.910
Magalie Marcellus: An injury there.

235
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.310
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah but 10 years ago our guy broke my nose.

236
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.540
Magalie Marcellus: Your nose.

237
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.450
Magalie Marcellus: Is still one but they

238
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.710
Magalie Marcellus: Have to decide jury.

239
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.180
Martin’s iPhone: It probably needed some work done to it today happened and I didn't go

240
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.560
Martin’s iPhone: You know, get it taken care of.

241
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.700
Martin’s iPhone: Because that's just misshapen right here and

242
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.090
Martin’s iPhone: You can tell just by my nostrils. It's closed in on this side and

243
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:35.760
Martin’s iPhone: So when I tried to breathe in. So especially like with my nose with my mouth closed it messes my sleep up

244
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.340
Magalie Marcellus: Now did

245
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.240
Magalie Marcellus: Does it affect any smell anything like that and just

246
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:53.190
Martin’s iPhone: Be some breathing to makes it harder to breathe in, breathe out of both my nostrils and seem like it's sufficient amount of air.

247
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.390
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes you're just breathe, you know, huff and puff

248
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.880
Martin’s iPhone: Into try to hopefully you know with the sinuses to that. That'll probably help to just open it up.

249
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.100
Magalie Marcellus: Make me feel better. The medication.

250
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:21.630
Magalie Marcellus: And any updates with the because I know everything was kind of put a whole any update with the sleep the sleep study

251
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.380
Martin’s iPhone: Know it's funny to hear, nose and throat doctor said he didn't notice anything abnormal

252
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:28.980
But

253
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.420
Martin’s iPhone: I don't know, maybe it's not something that

254
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.070
Magalie Marcellus: MEGAN Oh.

255
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.160

So I have to get them faxed over to him and then we go from there, but it's another thing the you know the carpal tunnel surgeries. Not something I'll be able to get for a while, either.

269
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.920
Magalie Marcellus: But that's not affecting your, your work right now, anything

Martin’s iPhone: When I see people, you know, in the stores and things like that. They say, How are you doing, what are you doing, I see nothing. Just working every day and trying to stay clean and soon as you say that you know they pretty much steer away from you and it'll mess with this. Okay. Lucky

295
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:16.470

296
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.390
Magalie Marcellus: It could be just a friendly get together then lead. So something else.

297
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.190
