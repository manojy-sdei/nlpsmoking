Individual therapy twice a month.

10
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.970
Elijah Nelson: Okay, okay.

11
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.860
Shawn Phalen: So tell me, tell me what brought you to write her

12
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.650
Elijah Nelson: Well,

13
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.790
Elijah Nelson: I had to call it around. Okay, so I mean I can start from kind of in the beginning.

14
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.970
Elijah Nelson: I moved to Tennessee from California. I grew up in California.

15
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:20.790
Elijah Nelson: So I moved to Tennessee and I, I've always had back pain, but I was doing a job out in Kentucky and I hurt my back and it wasn't all the job. It was actually when I was at home.

16
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:38.730
Elijah Nelson: I twisted my back trying because I I stay in it. Whenever, wherever I moved to I own a home in Tennessee. But wherever, whenever I move around do jobs. So now, always take my RV with me. So I ended up hurting my back and I went to the doctor when I went home, I created like a

17
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.680
Elijah Nelson: How do you say

18
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.230
Elijah Nelson: My regular doctor

19
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.880
Elijah Nelson: Which I haven't done in a long time because I never go to the doctor.

20
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.530
Elijah Nelson: But

21
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.610
Elijah Nelson: I ended up getting a, you know,

22
00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:05.490
Elijah Nelson: A regular doctor and they did all these tests on me and they're like, Okay, well, you know, it looks like you have, you know, arthritis in your bag and you have a, you know,

23
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.260
Elijah Nelson: Something going on in the lower back area. You know, I forget what they call that

24
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:24.480
Elijah Nelson: And so they're like, okay, you know we can do one or two things we can you know really get into this and send you to a specialist and you know there's going to require surgery and, you know, all these things.

25
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.730
Elijah Nelson: Which you know just time and money right and

26
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:39.870
Elijah Nelson: He said, or we can send me to pay management and see if you can give your backup break you know take pills, if you need something

27
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:49.530
Elijah Nelson: And I was like, well, I'd rather go that route right was like, let's do that way because I don't want to make things worse. But I don't want to

28
00:14:51.780 --> 00:15:01.020
Elijah Nelson: make things even worse. I guess you would say I didn't know what to do at that point. Like, I don't want to take time off to do surgery or anything like that.

29
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.300
Shawn Phalen: And then for you prescribe pills.

30
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.160
Elijah Nelson: Yes. And so that's what ended up happening and

31
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.350
Elijah Nelson: They tried a couple things.

32
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:24.690
Elijah Nelson: You know, I did and I just made sure I didn't do anything that I knew my back. Couldn't handle. And that was my problem, like I have to look at when I'm doing stuff. I have to look and say, Hey. My back's not going to handle this. I can't do it.

33
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.550
Elijah Nelson: And, you know, I'm not no spring chicken, no more, you know,

34
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:36.960
Elijah Nelson: And so that's what I was what I did. And then I did take the pills, as they recommended

35
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.260
Elijah Nelson: And so, kind of just got out of here, you know, and

36
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.460
Elijah Nelson: I didn't know. I mean, you know, we

37
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:53.010
Elijah Nelson: Started off with the give me. I want to say, what is it wasn't, it wasn't even I don't even think it was an opiate. It was like a

38
00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:06.930
Elijah Nelson: New New new star new strain or something like that, but it was like a nice little yellow pill is nice and it really helped us kind of a muscle relaxer slash like

39
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.220
Elijah Nelson: I don't know, like aspirin or the cotton, you know, and then they gave me the hydrocodone as well.

40
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.730
Elijah Nelson: So I took the hydrocodone

41
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:34.740
Elijah Nelson: And I mean it was okay. You know, I really was like, Okay, this is great things are okay you know whenever I'd have that really bad back pain. I would take that and then it just kind of spiraled from there, you know, and

42
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.660
Elijah Nelson: I

43
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:46.980
Elijah Nelson: You know, I go there once a month, and sometimes I couldn't even get there to the pain management because they would only do it in Tennessee and I'd be over in Ohio or

44
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:56.250
Elijah Nelson: Up in Pennsylvania. You know, so I couldn't make it. And so I talked to them about that and and so they would give me, you know, extra prescription

45
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:05.550
Elijah Nelson: Is it okay we'll give you, you've been coming here for so long. We're going to give you, you know, we'll give you three months worth. Yeah. Yeah. And so

46
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.790
Elijah Nelson: In one and a half, two months out

47
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.190
Elijah Nelson: You know what I mean. And

48
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.820
Elijah Nelson: Just sitting there like, okay, I'm in pain. Hello, bad and

49
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.310
Elijah Nelson: It was just bad. You know, and I didn't

50
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:25.860
Elijah Nelson: I never met for it to get to that point, you know, as far as taking the pills and then they prescribed me the oxy codeine

51
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.850
Elijah Nelson: And that's when it was like, that's when I was like, No, that's enough, that's enough. I had a friend of mine who was like

52
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:44.070
Elijah Nelson: You know, you really don't want to go too far into this because there's other alternatives that you can do. Right. And he had been on Suboxone so he gives me he was giving me Suboxone say try this.

53
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.780
Elijah Nelson: I would take half a tab and be good for two days.

54
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.930
Elijah Nelson: Vice and taken all these pills every day. Right. And so I was on. I was on

55
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.660
Elijah Nelson: Suboxone for a year before they ever prescribed it to me. And so

56
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:09.270
Elijah Nelson: Here I am in California. You know how you're working and I didn't, he doesn't have any more right now. Like he would send it to me.

57
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.790
Elijah Nelson: And I just

58
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:22.230
Elijah Nelson: Was like, you know what, I got to a point where it's like, you know, I don't take very much. I don't think like, I'll take sometimes I won't take my six milligrams. I'll go like, I'll try to do one

59
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:29.760
Elijah Nelson: Or, you know, but she's telling me to take your six. So I'm like, I've been doing what she tells me because I'm like trying to stay on what she tells me to do.

60
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.370
Shawn Phalen: How many years were you taking the pill.

61
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.090
Elijah Nelson: That started about two years ago.

62
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.060
Elijah Nelson: Well, when I moved out like two, two and a half years ago. Okay, so then

63
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:49.350
Shawn Phalen: You're in California right now. Yeah. And how long are you going to be in California and

64
00:18:49.410 --> 00:19:04.410
Elijah Nelson: I'll be here for at least the rest of the year. Okay. And then it's your first time trying to get off pills like with like a outpatient program like said, I just didn't want to take any pills anymore. I've been off to I haven't taken a pill and over a year.

65
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.420
Shawn Phalen: Now I know that have you

66
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:07.890
Okay.

67
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:14.700
Shawn Phalen: So it is right heart. The first place they call them. Yes.

68
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.630
Elijah Nelson: Well, what happened and happened was I was like, I called my friend. We usually send me to Suboxone and

69
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.150
Elijah Nelson: I said, Hey, you know, I'm like, he's like, he used to be. He's live out here today and said,

139
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:55.830
Elijah Nelson: You know, I didn't have a prescription to take the Suboxone. So I'd have to really like start going through the withdrawals when you know to

184
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.420
Elijah Nelson: You don't need too many

185
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.420
Elijah Nelson: You know, you know, you don't need to make

186
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:16.080
Elijah Nelson: You take more people than that then, like, you're, you're wasting, you know, time making sure things are getting done more than you're actually getting things done.

187
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.320
Shawn Phalen: And we're looking in the tank with

188

193
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:52.350
Elijah Nelson: So I just, I'm not much I still go out and weld and do stuff like that but I mostly have to make sure like the material showing up and making sure you know everything's going on.

194
00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:04.650
Elijah Nelson: Because I have to, you know, there's a lot to it more than just making sure your porta potties are clean and you know the welding rod and everything. So it means a lot of safety to so

195
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.020
Elijah Nelson: Oh, yeah.

196
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:18.720
Elijah Nelson: Especially in the refinery yeah crazy because there's a lot of just regular storage facilities are like are right next door that you know they have. They make a lot of money just on storage.

197
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:24.570

Elijah Nelson: Yeah, well then, once I start taking that was like let me take a half of this film, you know, because my friend, he was giving me the eight milligram to boxing's

202
00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:03.660
Elijah Nelson: So he'd give me those and I would take half of one, you know, and I'd be good for two or three days, you know, but I was pushing it you know after the second day

203
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:12.870

Elijah Nelson: And I literally just twisted the wrong way and it just, I couldn't get up. I was like, I cannot. I can't get up right now. You know it hurts so bad, just twisted the wrong way. You know, it's not all about just lifting and doing that stuff about like your body movement to, you know,
