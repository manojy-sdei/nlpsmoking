00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.230
Yes.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can see and hear you just fine. We got a good connection and your phone is charged

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.120
Nick Graham: Is charged. Yes.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned in your texts that you're kind of going through a wave of something negative, and then

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.140
Nick Graham: Kind of handled it make it in

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, with some outdoor activity. I'm not sure what what you do.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.400
Nick Graham: Yeah, I don't know. It was like weird and you always talk to you and stuff like that happens. And I basically

11
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.450
Nick Graham: I don't know. It was like a response to something that happened and

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.170
Nick Graham: I was like really like

13
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.540
Nick Graham: Angry like like

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.950
Nick Graham: Ridiculously angry and like

15
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.990
Nick Graham: And it turned into like

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.140
Nick Graham: Terrible despair and then

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.920
Nick Graham: Hopelessness and then like bad thinking and then I like

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:26.910
Nick Graham: It like went away after I like went to the gym for like three or four hours to like just force it to go away to where I had no energy and I had to do like sleep.

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.830
Nick Graham: So that worked.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the bad thinking it. God is bad as what were you thinking of wanting to hurt yourself.

21
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.920
Nick Graham: I was thinking like, you know, I like my mind like normally goes to, like,

22
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.410
Nick Graham: Why am I here kind of thing. I didn't like plan.

23
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.350
Nick Graham: Thing but I definitely like

24
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.040
Nick Graham: Felt like tremendously hopeless and

25
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.590
Nick Graham: As like paying attention to, you know, like

26
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.740
Nick Graham: Body stuff, you know, like that's the thing that I think I've learned from all of this is like

27
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.530
Nick Graham: I have this really distinct like

28
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:19.980
Nick Graham: Chest feeling when that stuff's happening. So I was trying to breathe through it, but I was like ragingly angry and I like said like some really messed up shit to like

29
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.890
Nick Graham: This person who's like, I don't know, trying to figure that part out.

30
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you go into the story. Once you go into content with me.

31
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.850
Yeah.

32
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.560
Nick Graham: I was like, talking like my my ex is like, I don't know, I feel like she's probably been like stringing me along a little bit

33
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:51.510
Nick Graham: And I like found out that she was in California with a boyfriend, you know, and like Bristol. Yeah, married into like talks to me all the time and felt dimension that so I was like

34
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.040
Nick Graham: Really like upset about. And I would probably say, understandably,

35
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.450
Nick Graham: But I just went straight into like

36
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.000
Nick Graham: Let me just go off on you and

37
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.350
Nick Graham: ruin your life as best I can mode.

38
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And besides words, how else did you try to ruin your life.

39
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.020
Nick Graham: Well, I just like I did.

40
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.080
Nick Graham: Like I'm like close to their cousin.

41
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.260
Nick Graham: And I like told her cousins and stuff like

42
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.880
Nick Graham: That she had done. And, you know, bad things because I wanted to like

43
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.800
Nick Graham: Make her time and on her trip as bad as I possibly could, like I was, I guess my thinking.

44
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.860
Nick Graham: Because I felt really hurt by it. So,

45
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.410
Nick Graham: All I know is like

46
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.970
Nick Graham: Outrageous anger, like I don't even

47
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.590
Nick Graham: It was like another person like doing all those things. It was strange.

48
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.410
Nick Graham: And then once reality hit. I went straight to, like, oh,

49
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.990
Nick Graham: I'm actually really sad.

50
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.810
Nick Graham: Like really, really, really sad.

51
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're you're seeing that you were still hoping that this relationship was going to stay in marriage, there was still this maybe weren't really

52
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.680
Nick Graham: Yeah, I didn't think I didn't like ever think that until this like I maybe it was like an unconscious thought or something.

53
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:41.250
Nick Graham: You know, going on in the background that I didn't like register necessarily like maybe the thought arose.

54
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

55
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were in that rage.

56
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you go kind of unconscious. Is that what I'm hearing a

57
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.300
Nick Graham: Weird thing is I, I just, like, had this numbness like

58
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:20.850
Nick Graham: I was like I know what I'm doing is like like angry, like it is like just an outward expressions of anger. Like, I know that it's not the right thing to do.

59
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.610
Nick Graham: I don't care. And it was like

60
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.300
Nick Graham: It was like, oh, you know, I guess the way I would think about it is

61
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.530
Nick Graham: The way then like in the Navy, the way they they like when your body starts operating on

62
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.240
Nick Graham: Essentially autopilot when you're in a really stressful situation.

63
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.040
Nick Graham: Um,

64
00:05:47.130 --> 00:06:01.710
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's, that's basically what happened and I was just going like I knew like my my brain was there, but it was. And I was like, watching it and I knew what was happening and I was controlling it, but it was like almost taken over by this

65
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.030
Nick Graham: Other background.

66
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.310
Nick Graham: Thing that was just like running the scene right running the show at that time.

67
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. So you find out that she's doing this and this was

68
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Like Monday when was it

69
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.070
Nick Graham: I think that was, um, maybe Tuesday. Tuesday.

70
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.270
Look in her

71
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: notes here. Maybe it'll be helpful. So let's see, yesterday was a Wednesday away.

72
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you sent me something. Yeah, yesterday.

73
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: At about 1246 my time so

74
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you travel and you stayed up

75
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I

76
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Knew it was the wrong thing to do.

77
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't care.

78
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

79
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And

80
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It almost sounded like this lasted in order to call the cousin that had to last into the next day. Is that right,

81
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:49.740
Nick Graham: Or no same night. Yeah. It happened in our episode was like roughly an hour.

82
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.780
Nick Graham: 15 hour 30

83
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Was was once the anger disappeared was the realization

84
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're helpless to change how she feels

85
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.420
Nick Graham: It was more like

86
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.150
Nick Graham: I guess they went straight to like

87
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.860
Nick Graham: Me think

88
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just try it now. Do you feel like you can change how she feels about you.

89
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.720
Nick Graham: No, no, no, no, no. I think it was like

90
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.320
Nick Graham: I was like, I don't know if there's any like true married to this Stages of Grief thing and I was like looking into that.

91
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.450
Nick Graham: And it's like,

92
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.620
Nick Graham: I feel like I'm pretty well at the

93
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.050
Nick Graham: At the point where I'm like, I don't

94
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.840
Nick Graham: That was that

95
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.160
Nick Graham: In like I can wash my hands of it at this point.

96
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So it had a cathartic experience for you somehow you just charged

97
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Your feelings for her. Is that what you're trying to tell me

98
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:19.380
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think so. I think I mean I've like I'm really thought much about her since then.

99
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.490
Nick Graham: I think like, I think what I was doing was trying to make it

100
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:41.760
Nick Graham: Like so bad between us. I always wind up finding excuses to talk to her. She or something like that. So I think it was I wanted to make things so like terrible between us that there's no shot.

101
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:51.420
Nick Graham: Of even being friends or anything, because that's like the thing that is the worst thing for me. So, and then after that, and I've really been

102
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.090
Nick Graham: Okay, like

103
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a bit

104
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Seems a bit self destructive feels a bit sabotaging

105
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess, is we would find elements of that in other domains of your life where that sit with the ambivalence of something and

106
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just annihilate the possibility and then you don't have to face the ambivalence of it.

107
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

108
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.220
Nick Graham: Okay.

109
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay. But right now I'm

110
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Last 24 hours you how much sleep. Have you had last night.

111
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.680
Nick Graham: I got a pretty well. I think

112
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.550
Nick Graham: Maybe like six hours. Five and a half hours last night.

113
00:10:51.270 --> 00:11:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying you're not ruminating over. Hey, I did this, she did that, how could it have been different. You didn't spend a lot of time thinking about, I

114
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.990
Nick Graham: Really didn't I think I've done all that in the past several months.

115
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.480
Nick Graham: A lot. Yeah.

116
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe this last piece was you're you're facing whatever piece of denial about expectation, I

117
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.810
Nick Graham: Maybe you did have a

118
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.770
Vacation.

119
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And that just you just made sure that wasn't there anymore.

120
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.330
Nick Graham: Yeah, I believe so. But it's like it's like just alarming like the way I went about it.

121
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.550
Nick Graham: And like I could tell it the whole time I was like, all right, this is the same thing, I feel, and I'm

122
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.940
Nick Graham: You know, and I was like trying to breathe and it's like, just not working just now.

123
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.630
Hmm.

124
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you found it sounds like you found another another way to what would be kind of discharge.

125
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Went to the

126
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And what what kind of exercises were you doing over there for those three hours.

127
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:20.370
Nick Graham: And then like running and then lifting in that run again and then I would like climb the little stare things and then

128
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:32.430
Nick Graham: Run again and then the like just whatever just back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and until I was like so tired that I went home and passed out basically in it worked for me.

129
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And prior to

130
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday, let's say what was maybe Monday, Tuesday, what was last weekend like for you.

131
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:50.670
Nick Graham: Um,

132
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.980
Nick Graham: Yeah, when I got to

133
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.820
Nick Graham: Space called the healer, which is like down the southwest part of the state and

134
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.990
Nick Graham: went out and did some like really cool stuff. I saw like

135
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.370
Nick Graham: When I'm like a little trip like for the weekend.

136
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.620
Nick Graham: And

137
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.200
Nick Graham: It was nice, relaxing.

138
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.610
Nick Graham: Monday and Tuesday, we're fine. I like started, I started like really really working out really hard.

139
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.400
Nick Graham: So I'm trying to figure out a way to not have the light shine.

140
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.450
Nick Graham: In your eyes so

141
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.120
Nick Graham: Yeah, it was kind of a lot of that.

142
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:34.860
Nick Graham: It's been pretty

143
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.720
Nick Graham: Like a lot of like I would probably use the term self care, like a lot of that going

144
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.930
Very nice.

145
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just do a little temperature check and see. So if, if I'm your ex. What's the summary, what do you say to me.

146
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.790
Nick Graham: I would not have a thing to say to you.

147
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.650
I wouldn't

148
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.710
Nick Graham: Have this person blocked and

149
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.870
Nick Graham: I really

150
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:16.380
Nick Graham: Don't know what the stages, but I have not one word. I would say I think I've said everything in the past several months that I could ever have said too many things.

151
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

152
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But zero is also an extreme. So that's what I'm testing. I'm checking

153
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: In so it's a movement from all to now nothing, and I don't have any judgment about it. But my point is

154
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There can't be an absolute zero. I don't know for how long, because whether this right and there's there's still a marriage, there's still this

155
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing that exists right there. So right now it's nothing.

156
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's my point is sitting with a bit of that.

157
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Ambivalence right

158
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:02.580
Nick Graham: Yeah.

159
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.680
Nick Graham: Definitely like that.

160
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.460
Nick Graham: So yeah, I think that like

161
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.010
Nick Graham: That

162
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.230
Nick Graham: Kind of makes sense like

163
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.500
Nick Graham: I think it probably comes from

164
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.760
Nick Graham: Maybe like

165
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.340
Nick Graham: Guilt in like

166
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:36.120
Nick Graham: Like maybe all this extreme stuff because like when we were together like it was like really good for a while, but I like sort of like using drugs and getting really stressed out and I wasn't like treating her like well at all.

167
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.570
Nick Graham: And so I think I don't know like

168
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.400
Nick Graham: I think that there would be probably some time in my life that I would acknowledge

169
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:55.950
Nick Graham: Without any intentions behind it, like, hey, like I definitely pond your mac book and I feel bad about it.

170
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.480
Nick Graham: And

171
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.890
Nick Graham: I would be like, weirdly select like at a time like

172
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:13.050
Nick Graham: I was like selective on like who she would talk to you, like, yeah, I would ever like certain people in your life that would like

173
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:23.130
Nick Graham: Be saying weird things to her and I would be like, Oh, like you can't like talk to them, you know, and so I guess I'd probably like maybe expressed some kind of like

174
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.340
Nick Graham: remorse for like

175
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.920
Nick Graham: Being that person because I've never wanted to be that person, but

176
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So boring your active addiction. So maybe the piece of making amends is saying listen

177
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's helping me to come to terms and to not go to shame, but rather to just take ownership for what I did take responsibility.

178
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Upon your Mac Book I was

179
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A bit sort of

180
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it meets that sort of leverage of power and control trying to control you.

181
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I'm sorry and and I wasn't myself I was in active addiction and

182
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.350
Nick Graham: I'm hoping not to do that.

183
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Again. So, okay, well, right, because the earlier question was,

184
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: After that catharsis what's left. So I think what I'm hearing you say is what's left is you there might be some space down the line where you want to apologize for something sounds like

185
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.850
I think so. Okay.

186
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that it's

187
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: White

188
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: quite the same.

189
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like that's more about your recovery, whereas this thing that you did with her the other day or last night or whenever it was his big things big event was more about

190
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your identity. Something about

191
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but I think they're a little separate

192
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

193
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.960
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean,

194
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.000
Nick Graham: Yeah, if you have the ability to expand on that I would like to

195
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

196
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's just talk about

197
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepting what is right now accepting that if, if the operating assumption.

198
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: For the hypothesis is true, right now, that what you're doing is you're doing the nothing part of an all or nothing approach if that's what's happening.

199
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's giving you a little bit of psychological space you have a calm, you're not as distressed. So there's a real upside to it.

200
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:55.800
Nick Graham: Yeah.

201
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And if that's the case, it's a difficult thing to sustain for very long before the all comes in.

202
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's so extreme. So the ideal in general is to be able to have access to all aspects of the self.

203
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to sit with

204
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I still had a fleeting hope that you still wanted me

205
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And when I heard you were with this person. I had to really face it.

206
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.090
Nick Graham: And

207
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe then I had to also look at my part how I may have done some things that damage the relationship and I didn't, I just, I didn't want to and

208
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to sit with having feelings for you and and the rejection. I don't want to sit with them. And so I

209
00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sabotage any hope of us being friends. Now, that's me, right, I have access to this because it's not personal for me it's not happening to me. I can name it. I can talk about all the different moving parts.

210
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just want you to know that that is another option. Besides, you know, zero to 60

211
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.030
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

212
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And that that comes with just moderation and we can we can do some some work on that and just sort of dipping into it feeling a little bit of desensitization to it.

213
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up, replacing it with with some positive cognition. So doing some of that em Dr work can be affected around that to like picturing. Okay, I'm going to see her. All right. Oh, goodness. Then what and what's the belief about the self and so if the goal is

214
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's no

215
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no parts of you that you can't you can't visit

216
00:20:48.990 --> 00:21:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's freedom there when you're a whole person, you're not cut off and you're not going to have that a reaction that huge over the top stuff that that you end up. I think you feel bad about what had happened.

217
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:03.960
Yeah.

218
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's less likely that it's going to be that strong. You probably handle moments we all get like offended and we get insulted, but we can get to our breath and we can go, geez. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's my deal here.

219
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I can name that again. What's happening for me.

220
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling rejected I do feel abandoned. But I don't know how ready, you are to sit with those kind of big feelings like

221
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are big.

222
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel, I feel abandoned like those like tell me as I'm saying it. How true is that for you.

223
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.320
Nick Graham: Oh yeah, like even hearing it is like, you know,

224
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.860
Nick Graham: Kind of like affecting me so like, yeah.

225
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.880
Nick Graham: I didn't know that there could ever be a world where

226
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.440
Nick Graham: Like it's possible to sit with that.

227
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it is. Oh, it's so powerful and powerful for you.

228
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it takes all the, all that you can picture all that intensity that that was that anger. Right. You're harnessing it in a different way. When you can sit with the raw of your truth, including the hurt. And I mean,

229
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: No one can ever take

230
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That from you. Once you harness it yourself. Once you can say, I know what's happening right now i can i can label this I'm in shock. I really, I can see it right now.

231
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I almost want to like kill you know like

232
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To to kill the feeling. It's so awful.

233
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But when we can name it when we can say this is this is what's happening. And we're not stuck in our pride having to pop up and say no.

234
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm too good for that. Who would want to reject me. We all get rejected, we just do not because we're inherently bad but

235
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: They want something else or who knows why.

236
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We're

237
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're the same we're still good and lovable.

238
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, tell me more about what comes up for you. Was it the word abandonment rejection, which one's done more.

239
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.330
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think I'm

240
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.590
Nick Graham: Probably abandonment, because it's like like resonates with you know

241
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.160
Nick Graham: The past things that, you know,

242
00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.730
Nick Graham: Probably

243
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.200
Nick Graham: And so, yeah, that one's a big one.

244
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.710
Nick Graham: I mean, naturally, I think rejection, just like a

245
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.590
Nick Graham: Bad thing to

246
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:24.540
Nick Graham: Like, I think the abandonment like kind of strikes me over my record like I definitely can see like the way forward and like when I was angry, like it's the first time I ever stopped and said, hey, like

247
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:34.590
Nick Graham: I feel this I register these emotions, but I couldn't put it together. So like I see that is like massive progress.

248
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you didn't register.

249
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone was saying you're angry you at least could see that, like, this is, this isn't matching the, the actual danger to life, like she doesn't have a nice she has never done like

250
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:50.250
Nick Graham: Right.

251
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not appropriate. It's almost a mismatch amount of intensity, you could see it.

252
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, helpless to shift it

253
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:07.800
Nick Graham: The alarming thing is there was another voice and said I don't fucking care you know like what that was. I don't know who that was.

254
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.460
Nick Graham: In there, but someone

255
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so here's the deal.

256
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The guy that cares is sad.

257
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.270
Nick Graham: Yeah.

258
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want that. So right what happens, we get in touch with the callous cold hearted because that's the aspect that doesn't have to feel destroyed annihilated hopeless vulnerable.

259
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.770
Nick Graham: It's a lot easier to

260
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Say Fuck you, fuck it all.

261
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus what I was introducing earlier, which is actually

262
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:49.980
Nick Graham: Ending

263
00:25:52.500 --> 00:26:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being I know it does. So the differences, it's not, you know, screw her what you ended up doing on fortunately was you actually abandoned yourself because in the end you do care you care about yourself. You keep coming to therapy. I can hear you have this consciousness about you.

264
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there, and you're not you're not a sociopath. You're not someone who doesn't care about your planet about the people on it. I think you do. It's just, it's a heavy burden you feel it.

265
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Intensely and so it is it's convenient to be a screw you guys just like you know because then you don't have to hurt.

266
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.260
Nick Graham: Right.

267
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.300
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I think there's a lot of truth to that.

268
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's universal. I mean, on one hand it's it's a pretty handy thing to muster that up. Sometimes it's needed.

269
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be certain situations when tapping sensitivity, like I could picture a meeting when you're around, you know, people that

270
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: In, you know, they're just listing off some things and it's a constructive criticism meeting and you decide to tap into getting hurt you might get so distracted by it. Whereas going to will deal with, you know, the, the hurt ego later.

271
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get into sort of tell me more about that, you know, and getting right into capitalizing harnessing sort of that that

272
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.550
Nick Graham: Anger.

273
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it does serve a purpose. I, I never want to tell you that that anger isn't just a great emotion. I think it is. But it almost seems like it was taking over.

274
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Other parts of you. So not a real balanced approach. But like you said you saw you saw it a bit happening you tried to do some breathing and then it was

275
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. It's up to you what you want to do here today.

276
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to meet that vulnerability in you that

277
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Base of abandoned. Do you want to have a different relationship with that, that somehow, whether it's conscious or unconscious. Do you want to feel less than negative intensity to that abandonment.

278
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:34.890
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean, I think that's the goal of what I'm doing, because my response is always horribly messed up as a result of feeling those feelings or avoiding feeling them. So yeah, I mean that that's the end goal.

279
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So how I know you're you're in your car, how likely is it that we can do any of the bilateral work today.

280
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.610
Nick Graham: I think i think i think it was last time you have

281
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: soda can, or a cup in there. You could put on each side.

282
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.910
Nick Graham: I got a I got some things

283
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's nice when people keep a messy car because then blessings floating around, right.

284
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.350
Honestly,

285
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.920
Nick Graham: Like to it's like full of all my possessions. You know, like I haven't been back to them.

286
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:11.880
Yeah.

287
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.560
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's another yeah

288
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a lot of symbolism in there.

289
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.570
Nick Graham: Yeah, let's see. I think I have

290
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just see how how your eye moves. And once you get them set up, you know, you want your eyes to be moving about a foot and a half, maybe

291
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.100
1516 inches on

292
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.970
Nick Graham: See

293
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are sitting at a

294
00:29:51.870 --> 00:30:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Laptop maybe, you know, not, not like a full big screen monitor, but some a little smaller. So it seemed like let me watch your eyes move each side maybe switch back just a bit, you might be working a little hard for that might strain your eyes.

295
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.820
Nick Graham: Can you notice that

296
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, does it hurt when when the

297
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: One side of the

298
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Heart okay okay so

299
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If it does, you can, I think, I don't know if you can scoot your seat back. I don't know if you've got stuff back there. Is it, are you jammed up.

300
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.380
Nick Graham: I'm good.

301
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. Then, because I just rely on your, your feedback on the comfort. Sure. So, um, we, we might do some tight ration down. But let's let's just see where we go with this. Okay.

302
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That that insight you had about abandonment, um,

303
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is that, do you have a sense

304
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.650
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think.

305
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.890
Nick Graham: It's literally his oldest

306
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.260
Nick Graham: almost as old as me. It's

307
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:02.130
Nick Graham: Age.

308
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.310
Nick Graham: Four.

309
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And who abandoned you

310
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.090
Nick Graham: As my dad allegedly

311
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And I've got a little note right above it. We did some work around that last time.

312
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was my dad allegedly because yeah

313
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's about age four. That's pretty young people typically can remember about age five, but you have a sense of it even younger like for

314
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.440
Nick Graham: Yeah. Yeah, but I have I have that I had the memory of the

315
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:45.660
Nick Graham: Divorce paperwork and everything on the page like three and a half. It was like one of my first memories to seeing like a manila envelope.

316
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a young, young

317
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.130
Nick Graham: Young

318
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And just now as you're picturing that manila envelope.

319
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.450
Um,

320
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Where does that get tight or zap you in the body. Where does that land.

321
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.380
Nick Graham: I'm trying to like

322
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:27.540
Nick Graham: Activate it, but it was at such an early age that I don't think that they were any there was nothing related to

323
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:35.160
Nick Graham: Any emotions that I feel right now. Like it was so distant and different and

324
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:36.780
Nick Graham: So,

325
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you're telling me I'm going to make note of that. That's so distant and different not aware of any somatic my body is registering that

326
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.940
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely like

327
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:56.490
Nick Graham: Like, I guess the thought of it is like it probably is stressful, thought I.

328
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought

329
00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.460
Nick Graham: Like in today's terms so

330
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief about yourself. Let's go into that one. I believe about myself what so and I am

331
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.200
Nick Graham: Currently,

332
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's fine.

333
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.410
Nick Graham: Know, I mean, in that case, I almost feeling

334
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.630
Nick Graham: Almost that I am like

335
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.800
Nick Graham: numb to that emotion or to that like specific scenario I go

336
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.690
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's really all I have. Okay.

337
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, um, go back up to the triggering event. Why don't we just assume that this interaction with your ex was the triggering event and now sort of bring that recollection

338
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a again we're operating on my, my hypothesis here, but there was a perceived threat.

339
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

340
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: rose up in rage to protect yourself.

341
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder

342
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what your belief about yourself is around. Yeah.

343
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.910
Nick Graham: I would say I'm

344
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.720
Nick Graham: Probably I am inadequate or I am like

345
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.230
Nick Graham: Not as good as that guy.

346
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

347
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where, where did you feel that as soon as you said, not as good as that guy. Where did you feel that

348
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:45.720
Nick Graham: Kind of like

349
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.290
Nick Graham: Chest throat about him of the third kind of area. Yeah.

350
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion, you're feeling right now. Let's give it a name.

351
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.110
Nick Graham: Probably

352
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.570
Nick Graham: Definitely some some like pain surrounding it. I got it. I don't know if it's an emotion I probably say

353
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.600
Nick Graham: It was should be more concise than just saying

354
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.850
Nick Graham: This

355
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Sadness. That is one sad is one

356
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, pain and sadness. I think that will already use both of those.

357
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And what level of distress. Are you in right now. Zero to 100 where yet.

358
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:08.700
Nick Graham: Maybe like a

359
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:19.980
40

360
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.760
Know, fix for now.

361
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How long can you tolerate thinking I'm inadequate about how long and not last. Can it last a day.

362
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you're going to want to escape out of that. How long can you tolerate

363
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: An hour a minute how long

364
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.250
Nick Graham: And definitely

365
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.580
Nick Graham: It's kind of like

366
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.760
Nick Graham: Like, I don't know, maybe something's off. But, I mean, that's kind of like the

367
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.500
Nick Graham: Like the operating state.

368
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.390
Nick Graham: I would say

369
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in it all the time. Is your perception.

370
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.370
Nick Graham: Yeah, like in every sense like

371
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.410
Nick Graham: Whether it's like

372
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.550
Nick Graham: You know, like body dysmorphia or

373
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:59.550
Nick Graham: Maybe in some cases that work like always thinking like, it's not good enough. It's not good enough.

374
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.600
Nick Graham: In terms of like

375
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.940
Nick Graham: Where I am versus like other 28 year olds.

376
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.720
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's pretty well like everywhere.

377
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all over. And so, yeah, I think the way you put it, it's the underlying operating system. You can see it in your opinion.

378
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.080
you're assessing

379
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The body of your performance and it sounds like you're doing, you're doing a lot of comparing to the outside. This is a standard you set somehow and it doesn't match you assessed.

380
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:50.400
Nick Graham: Yeah, I would say so. Like, I think I like try to try to act like I'm not like one of those comparison. People were like, I think deep down, yeah.

381
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

382
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Not good enough.

383
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm inadequate.

384
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one seems more true you froze for a second. So I'll wait till we're back.

385
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.300
Together.

386
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Frozen.

387
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Frozen.

388
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You there.

389
00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear you yet.

390
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I see your name.

391
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: can't quite hear you, or see you. Maybe it's coming online.

392
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So your videos off and I cannot hear you. I don't know what's going on, maybe

393
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe this will

394
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Switch back to the way it was because I was hearing you just a little bit ago

395
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.990
Walk the other one.

396
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of there and

397
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it should be just you.

398
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to all right let me hear you. Next, so I can test the audio.

399
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Say something.

400
00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there like anything nearby like a Starbucks or fast food restaurants. You could tap into their Wi Fi just thought it asked. I can't hear you right now. I'm kind of hoping you can hear me.

401
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's a stinker.

402
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: COULD TRY AGAIN log out come back I'll stay if you can hear me talk to you.

403
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.490
Nick Graham: Are we here.

404
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We are

405
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.300
Nick Graham: All right.

406
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't take

407
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. We gotta appreciate even a good connection, we can't take anything for granted.

408
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:09.420
Nick Graham: Yeah, I'm wondering, like the weird thing is, once I turned my vent off. I don't know. I don't know if it was in my end or you're in, but I don't know if my phone overheated or something weird like that. I don't know.

409
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.890
Nick Graham: Who knows.

410
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.350
Nick Graham: Seven minutes on every good

411
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see.

412
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So my next question tends to be on time but okay so let's just get, let's get to it. Let me ask you something.

413
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative side right that she had. Is it more is it more closely landing with the I'm inadequate or I'm not good enough.

414
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.460
Nick Graham: I would say I'm inadequate.

415
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That's the one.

416
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now, picture, picture sort of being being

417
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.910
Find a note. What's her name in it on it.

418
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.040
Maybe I can

419
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I've got Christiana, and Josh. Those are the people that you use as a resource.

420
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what's your name again.

421
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your, your wife's name.

422
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right connections, getting a little stinky again.

423
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sydney Sydney yeah I got it.

424
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so picture being with her right that that moment and

425
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not great, you sound. I'll imitate you, it sounds like this.

426
00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.130
Can

427
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You hear me so you

428
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

429
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Nick, what this may do is sort of motivate, making sure that these sessions occur in a really good

430
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection area so you don't miss out.

431
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I probably be more inconvenient, but

432
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.460
I can't hear you right now if you're talking

433
00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: stinker.

434
00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

435
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think it's me because

436
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm using internet

437
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's blue skies and I had a session this morning six o'clock. I don't think it's me. I, my guess is something's happening over there on your side.

438
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if this if you can hear me.

439
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe use texting to to set up another appointment for us.

440
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I did keep aside eight in the morning. On February 20 for you. I don't know if you can hear me. But I kept that one.

441
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, shoot my next clients here too. So what to do, what to do.

442
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: All I can think is

443
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To log back out one more time.

444
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can hear me try one more time long and all the way out.

445
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.090
You put it in a Word doc.

446
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.430
I'll text you

447
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I see you there.

448
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:21.960
Nick Graham: Hey, can you hear me though.

449
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We are so

450
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: In case I lose you. Again, I do have you scribbled in for eight in the morning, February 20

451
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I would recommend, I guess, trying to find more of a more solid place just kind of brainstorm it as you're moving throughout, you know, the city and kind of like, where could I go or obviously because I think we'd see a little better.

452
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Outcome. All right, so before we go, let's at least get in your mind.

453
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive cognition, the one that it would be nice that you would have access to. So if you're in that space of I'm inadequate and here you're hearing about Sydney being WITH someone else and it really stings. It is painful right you register it is pain.

454
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's sad underneath.

455
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be the ideal.

456
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: belief about yourself.

457
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:55.440
Nick Graham: Probably just that.

458
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.540
Nick Graham: I'm not like

459
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.320
Nick Graham: An adequate or bad or anything. I would just the ideal belief would be

460
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.500
Nick Graham: That it's just a difference of opinion in lifestyle and nothing more. Okay.

461
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're almost there. You can tell what it's not. I know I wouldn't be saying I'm inadequate to myself, and I'd be able to see this person has a different opinion.

462
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe so and so has another job a day like this. They like that. It's a different of preference and opinion. You can see it. And so now take that you can see, oh, this is I recognize this. I have a different opinion than someone outside of me.

463
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe myself to be

464
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:47.970
Nick Graham: Moment.

465
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I am so if you can find it. I am

466
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.790
Nick Graham: I think I am just fine.

467
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Just fine. Yeah. Okay, yeah, fine. And is it possible that fine is

468
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Much closer to adequate.

469
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.050
Nick Graham: I would say so.

470
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like I'm adequate I'm

471
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting close and

472
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.420
Nick Graham: I think we're getting close. I'm

473
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:38.370
Nick Graham: Trying to describe it in terms of

474
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.620
Nick Graham: Something that's not a negative, like, you know, not a negative so

475
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah it right, it's a lot easier to identify the, the, the, the negative versus the affirmative, and I'm work very hard to get people to state it in the I Am not I am not it works. Ooh, so much better.

476
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And he you've been able to find it.

477
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and they're scanning some notes below where you've been able to touch on it.

478
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're able to sort of say, it's gonna be okay, right, you're able to say things like, it's, I'm just fine.

479
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But being able to identify a new belief about yourself. Seems a little bit

480
00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get to. It's all good.

481
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be anything. I want to be.

482
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's fine. I'm tracking a couple of things you said, but it is hard for you to definitively shift out of the I'm inadequate to

483
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving yourself even right now and hypothetical what you'd rather the thought be you won't even sort of

484
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Wishing to do that.

485
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.590
Nick Graham: Yeah, so I don't

486
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.040
Nick Graham: Yeah, I don't really know.

487
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:19.470
Nick Graham: How to get

488
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How you are getting there, but I want it to really come from you, not from me so

489
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

490
00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This will stop it. I'm just fine. That would certainly you would recognize that

491
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: distinguished from the pain that you felt that anguish and therefore intolerable and then you went to rage anger acting out

492
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And retaliation and, you know, making the other person feel as you feel right. That's may have been what was going on the other day.

493
00:58:54.570 --> 00:59:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I think you'd recognize. Oh, hey, look at this. I'm fine. I think you'd recognize it as a very big distinction

494
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you're fine. Well, then

495
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no perceived danger. There's no perceived threat. I definitely think you you experience that day. Those 24 hours quite differently than the way you you did with the I'm inadequate belief about yourself. I think you

496
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Very different chain of events happen.

497
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.020
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think that the just fine means like

498
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:37.860
Nick Graham: I'm good. The way I am.

499
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.480
Nick Graham: I don't

500
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:41.190
Nick Graham: Think

501
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good.

502
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm good. That's nice.

503
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Whereas the other one.

504
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is closer to my bad.

505
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This one I'm good. It's simple.

506
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And I could have a very different whole

507
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know novel of pictures and images and evidence of that of I'm good.

508
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:13.530
Yeah.

509
01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you get to feel fine.

510
01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

511
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

512
01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess my my invitation this this week is going to be

513
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:33.810
To

514
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it. I know you're living with some housemates but maybe finding a way to put it in.

515
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:44.670
Nick Graham: Your

516
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: screensaver on your phone, putting it on your mirror putting it by your bed, putting little sticky notes places so that you get in the habit.

517
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Of remembering that phrase. It's don't think it's going to come terribly automatic

518
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is that's been what you think is going to motivate you toward positive change. Well, if you chastise yourself if you have this negative appraisal and a lot of people do they think, well, if I let myself off the hook. Well, then I'll all amount to nothing.

519
01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All sit on my laurels. I'll be lazy. I've got a

520
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't

521
01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't really work.

522
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: People feel crappy defeated and it's not a motivator. I think the carrot works better. I think self acceptance and compassion, they end up motivating a lot more because you have so much more access to creativity.

523
01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Than with the the negative appraisal. So play with that and I know it may seem arbitrary, but believe it or not, we're very much learners through our eyes we we we really do learn a lot and get a lot of

524
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Reinforcement through eyes. The more you have that around.

525
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.910
Nick Graham: Versus just forgetting it

526
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: After today is going to help reinforce it. When we come back and we we visit this space again it'll be done much easier to integrate it into that.

527
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.170
Nick Graham: Yeah. And speaking of that,

528
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.270
Nick Graham: I definitely

529
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:23.880
Nick Graham: Do feel like

530
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.670
Nick Graham: For the first time, like probably ever like making like progress right now.

531
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:30.690
Yeah.

532
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:40.470
Nick Graham: I'm wondering, like, if I can afford to do something like slightly more frequent not like like extremely free like is that a thing that people do.

533
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I sometimes you see people, three times a week. It's completely up to you and our times.

534
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:57.090
Nick Graham: Figure out if I can afford that. But I think like, it's probably not like a price on mental health, like, well, I mean there is like, by definition, but

535
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a good investment, I promise. It's not a waste of money. Feeling good is good.

536
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:09.900
Nick Graham: Because like last week after that that thing. Like I could describe like

537
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.800
Nick Graham: Good things. I think they're on the

538
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:18.150
Nick Graham: On the horizon. So I do want to try to try to get there.

539
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll add to it. Before we go, because I can see my Dells waiting on me.

540
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I have been seeing people recently on the weekend. Right now I have someone scheduled for eight in the morning. This Saturday and no one around that. So if you can budget, it

541
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You having a solid hour we already have all of the target mapping figured out, we could spend the whole time loosening up this negative network.

542
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.300
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, I'll do Saturday I have to work at 945 I think

543
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.000
Nick Graham: Sagan.

544
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What I mean it's seven your time them.

545
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.650
Nick Graham: Yeah, I can do seven Saturday.

546
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we'll do. So it's nine o'clock, my time and then I have someone right after that.

547
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.230
Nick Graham: Oh, yeah.

548
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so proud of you. You're glad to see that. But you can see that good investment and if you have to rationalize it. Think about how much money you were spending on pills and then you can work.

549
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Around it

550
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what, no matter what. Be good to you, please, and put those things around you so that you can kind of remember them easier and easier and i'll see you this Saturday at seven.

551
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.720
Nick Graham: All right, thank you. See you then have a good

552
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.

553
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.450
Bye.

554
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

555
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

556
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there was a real challenge with this last the internet for this, this person was so

557
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:00.180
Filled

558
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it felt inclined to talk a little right at the end when we got the connection back

559
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm

560
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: clueless and thinking about you and your, your grief and wondering if you're filling filling the blue still or fifth starting to improve any

561
01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:23.880
Starting yeah

562
01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Something

563
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, that wasn't you. That wasn't the right, whether you did you send me messages now.

564
01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.470
Know,

565
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That was somebody. Okay, let's go over to you note. All right, now what do you have set up in your car. Let's do a little em, Dr. If we can you got your, your tape or little things that you can have about shoulder width apart and have that phone sort of in between kind of workout that

566
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been doing this in cars all week.

567
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:14.010
Victoria reed: My cousin's kid the

568
01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.040
Victoria reed: One other thing that I created.

569
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:19.680
Victoria reed: The

570
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:24.600
Victoria reed: It's nowhere around. No, that's crazy.

571
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.270
Victoria reed: About that.

572
01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You know they don't they just, they just don't think

573
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the next little entertainment.

574
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have a little cup soda can, in the car, sometimes we can put that in between.

575
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:46.020
Victoria reed: Yeah, so

576
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're doing that. Take your time up, pull up a note here. Oh.

577
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.290
Victoria reed: Sorry.

578
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.210

Started

582
01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:40.050
Victoria reed: This work.

583
01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Long as you can see my hand doing this.

584
01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: During your eyes, going left and right that's what you're going to want to get out of the corner of your eye.

585
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All I'm doing is really setting the tempo and then what you're looking at, are those objects that you have placed about shoulder width apart, on the left and right side of your phone.

586
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.830
Victoria reed: Hopefully it stays

587
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be like raw drop

588
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:31.230
Victoria reed: Oh my gosh, I

589
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.900
Victoria reed: I looked everywhere.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:54.330
Victoria reed: Respect and not getting to it. I know kids, you know, the kids.

593
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:03.390
Victoria reed: Okay, let's see how that works. It's kind of lopsided but

594
01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let's take a look. So let me see. I want to blow your picture a little bit here so I can see your eyes and I want to see them moving. If I'm setting up pace like this and you're looking

595
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:18.810
Victoria reed: So what objects. You know what you

596
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:23.280
Victoria reed: Want okay this side would have to be the

597
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.560
Victoria reed: Window.

598
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm watching. It's too hard on your eyes, you're going to end up hurting yourself and I don't want that. So this is want them to go. So you're doing this. See how they're going all the way over.

599
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah strain. Um, so all I want you to do is this. Watch mine.

600
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.790
Victoria reed: You see, okay, yeah.

601
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on your dash. It's okay right on your dash. If you have a little, a little cup.

602
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.510
Victoria reed: Yeah.

603
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have little objects that can sit right on your dash and then you can look back and forth your we're almost there.

604
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And if they can be the same level that would be super sauce.

605
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all we need a really, if you think about it a little paper cups or something.

606
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.250
Victoria reed: Yeah.

607
01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It stay there.

608
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.380
In the car.

609
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:19.620
Victoria reed: Yeah.

610
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a Starbucks cup and a Coke can last time. So kicky

611
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:26.970
Victoria reed: Okay.

612
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.760
Victoria reed: Okay.

613
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what do you see

614
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: How many watch your eyes go from the top. They need to be at the top of those two objects.

615
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:41.790
Victoria reed: Okay.

616
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm setting the pace. I see. Okay, you're looking down, we got to keep working at it. So on your dad. Almost there. Hang in there for it.

617
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're worth it. Hang in there, you don't have to apologize. You're not doing anything wrong.

618
01:11:55.950 --> 01:12:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: With it. Now think about what's in your car that it can be something like this. It could even be something slushy. That's fine. It's going to sit on the dashboard, but it needs to be up here. Let me show you why. Look at my eyes. It needs to be easy. I'm left and right and what you were doing.

619
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:14.280
Victoria reed: Looking down. Yeah.

620
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to have to do that. I wanted to be a nice easy comfortable left right hemisphere motion and and your gaze is just looking straight across.

621
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you have on the dashboard that you could put up there.

622
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.760
Victoria reed: Okay, there's like a little flower. I have right here.

623
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.670
Victoria reed: And then

624
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:43.020
Victoria reed: As I'm looking, I'm looking right at it, it's a little flower. Okay, and then

625
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and you if you're on if your phone is here. So here's your phone, right.

626
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and is the flower about what is that six inches away.

627
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.210
Victoria reed: Yes, it's right here. Yeah, I don't have to look

628
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.570
Victoria reed: Much down or yeah okay I'll show you.

629
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and then over on the right is what are your

630
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:10.620
Victoria reed: Left.

631
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.320
Victoria reed: I have a little bottle of hand sanitizer. It's a tiny little thing. Yeah.

632
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me see you moving between those two objects.

633
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.840
Let me see your eyes.

634
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't stop at me. Just go left and right, left and right, left, and just back and forth. So now I want you to notice. Out of the corner of your eyes. Can you see the pace that I'm setting.

635
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you're good. So I'm setting it. I won't change it in the middle.

636
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a sense that you're kind of following my direction, but really out of the peripheral vision. You're not actually having to look at me.

637
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna give it a try.

638
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Victoria. When you go, or I recommend you go to the dollar store.

639
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Get something that can sit up higher on your dashboard you

640
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:14.700
Didn't

641
01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're fine. It's just if you end up what you could do is maybe do that taping and it could go to your dash your windshield and and the

642
01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Dashboard, then it can sit here right out up in front of you and then you have these two things here and then there and then you can see me in the middle. And you'll see me moving

643
01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My finger left and right. Just keep that in mind when you're out out in the community. If you happen to swing by one and it registers and head in there. All right, let's give this a shot today. All right, now let's make it relevant for you and you and I touched a little bit on

644
01:14:53.730 --> 01:15:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, what did you talk about last time I have the dates of them, but we have age nine, we talked about it. So it's about in distress level. If I think

645
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.490
30

646
01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad and taken off. You were left alone. You were struggling, you notice that your stomach was upset.

647
01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:11.640
Victoria reed: There was a

648
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: He may not come back or he's not going to ever come back and oh you blamed yourself.

649
01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, I thought I wasn't good enough wasn't being a good daughter. Yikes.

650
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh.

651
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And on top of that your mom said it out loud. It's your fault.

652
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:39.480
Yes.

653
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not a great thing to do from

654
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:45.630
Victoria reed: No.

655
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even I can't even pretend

656
01:15:49.260 --> 01:16:00.750
Victoria reed: Like that one. Yes. And you know me, I knew that wasn't right. You know, I would never tell my kids, anything like that. Yeah, that's

657
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

658
01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:04.230
Bad

659
01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:07.950
Man.

660
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:09.810
Okay.

661
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's scan your current life. Let's find something currently that you're noticing you're having what I would call some stinking thinking some negative thoughts that are coming in.

662
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When was kind of a vulnerable time for you this week where you had a negative appraisal about yourself something kind of went sideways. It didn't work out the way you wanted it to.

663
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:37.770
Victoria reed: And

664
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.980
Victoria reed: That would have to be

665
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.330
Victoria reed: When I had my flourish when my sciatica, and

666
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.220
Victoria reed: I'm, um,

667
01:16:51.720 --> 01:17:05.250
Victoria reed: I took 800 milligrams of ibuprofen and then I took 1000 milligrams of acetaminophen yet like every

668
01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:12.240
Victoria reed: Six hours, I would have to take the talent world acetaminophen.

669
01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:21.720
Victoria reed: And I had to use some rub and everything. Nothing was really helping it so

670
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:25.530
Victoria reed: I just did the best I could. You

671
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a bath or anything. Like, have you ever done the opposite of what

672
01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel like doing my guess is you feel like not moving, right. You want to lay down and not both.

673
01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:46.590
Victoria reed: I actually, I put the heating pad like a massage or heating pad thing.

674
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:52.110
Victoria reed: Yeah, on the chair and I set against that after I used some

675
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.670
Victoria reed: What is it asked for cream. Yeah, some of that stuff.

676
01:17:57.990 --> 01:18:14.430
Victoria reed: And then after a little while, I used a lighting lighter cane patch prescribed ones that I had from a while back, and they're not expired. So I, you know, use that and that seemed to work after a little while,

677
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, this may seem really odd.

678
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But have you ever actually moved when you have a flare up and what do your doctor say about that.

679
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.440
Victoria reed: I'm

680
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.760
Sarah advice.

681
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:35.640
Victoria reed: See

682
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:46.470
Victoria reed: If I laid. I know I can't lay down and when I'm having that because, oh my gosh, I won't be able to get up at all. Yeah, and that's just

683
01:18:47.340 --> 01:19:07.410
Victoria reed: Horrible. So I have to find myself like I stack pills or whatever I can find, you know, so, because if I sit down on a chair one I'm having that and it's like lower you know the chair is like lower and it's hard for me to get up.

684
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:20.970
Victoria reed: So I have to put like pills and sit on those, you know, and it's easier and they gave me a walker, a while back. So in all use that to get up if I need it.

685
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And did your doctor say that movement is ill advised

686
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:31.050
Victoria reed: I'm

687
01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.790
Victoria reed: They told me to get wrist.

688
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:40.920
Victoria reed: And put like heat on it and then cold and

689
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.470
Victoria reed: Before so

690
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:44.340
Okay.

691
01:19:46.110 --> 01:20:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can't, I can't go outside of my scope of training and tell you to move right but what I'm going to do is tell you anecdotally, you're not the only one going through that kind of pain. Right. And what I'm hearing is

692
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Specifically, the story is

693
01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What I wanted to do was not wanted to

694
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.480
Take a pain home.

695
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And what this individual did instead was got up and walked

696
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And was very surprised that the relationship with her pain started to change. She was surprised she walked for 20 minutes

697
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And because everything in her history was, you know, don't move. Take something

698
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what she found out was the pain got better. And she was moving so

699
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We changed her approach. So, all I'm saying is

700
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know your body

701
01:20:48.300 --> 01:21:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if movement isn't the cause of the pain and we're made to be in motion were made to we're not supposed to be sedentary. We're not supposed to be staying seated and and length.

702
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

703
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to consider a little bit of movement, whether it's video doing all those things that you did the 800,000 the heating pad and and you may want to consider.

704
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A stretching video i mean it's it's it's something. What have you done it. Let's find out first. Have you done something like that.

705
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:31.350
Victoria reed: The stretching. Yes, I have.

706
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're getting a flare up

707
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.460
Victoria reed: Yes, um,

708
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:52.290
Victoria reed: When I didn't leave down or nothing. I noticed after when I was doing the rubs and everything. And I would get up and I just didn't lay down. Then I noticed it started to go quicker than, you know,

709
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I guess what I've

710
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.400
Learned to relieve

711
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What it does is gets blood flow in there.

712
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.680
Victoria reed: If you

713
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep it in motion.

714
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

715
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:14.340
Victoria reed: Where is some stretches. Yeah, that they tell you to do with the sciatica. I looked on YouTube.

716
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.970
Victoria reed: Yeah, and I seen what they do further flareups

717
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.570
Victoria reed: Knows pretty good seemed to help because

718
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:34.650
Victoria reed: I'm doing good. Now, not, not usually. Oh, last for quite a while oil all about a whole week.

719
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So normally, it lasts a week.

720
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:37.920
Victoria reed: Yes.

721
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes flare up

722
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.530
Victoria reed: It was short.

723
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Short. And what you notice you did differently, was what

724
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:58.380
Victoria reed: The stretches and the not laying down because oh my gosh, I will not be able to get up. If I lay down and then I'll

725
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:04.800
Victoria reed: I that time I they down like they told me to. And

726
01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.060
Victoria reed: I almost had an accident, you know,

727
01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.340
Victoria reed: My bladder.

728
01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like what we're talking about, which is the body doesn't want

729
01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To lay down if it doesn't rest.

730
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting in motion and doing very light gentle stretching

731
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:27.360
Yeah.

732
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What is indicated, it sounds like you know just what to do. And so the stretching

733
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.520
Yes.

734
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.710
Victoria reed: It's not here. No more. I'm good. Now,

735
01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This originated with hearing about something that kind of is current something that had gone on recently. And so let's go into the cognitive part of it. Let's go into what you're thinking was, when this was all going on. What were some of the thoughts going through your head.

736
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:01.320
Victoria reed: Um,

737
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:10.380
Victoria reed: I wasn't able to get much sleep you know I have a issue with sleep a lot

738
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:12.180
Victoria reed: Um,

739
01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:13.950
Victoria reed: And I was just

740
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:19.320
Victoria reed: Thinking, I was tired, you know, like, really worn out.

741
01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:24.180
Victoria reed: Cuz I would, I was cleaning up and

742
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:26.010
Just

743
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm worn out.

744
01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:30.060
Victoria reed: Yeah, worn out and

745
01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:31.800
Victoria reed: I think

746
01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:35.790
Victoria reed: flared up. Yeah.

747
01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you been doing, how, how many minutes or hours have you been cleaning and what would you cleaning

748
01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:49.110
Victoria reed: I'm dusting because I yeah the dust around ain't no good.

749
01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:55.110
Victoria reed: Start to have asthma attacks everything

750
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.840
Victoria reed: Is dust around

751
01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:07.980
Victoria reed: I wanted it. And just to like throw stuff away that I didn't need or we didn't need notice clear stuff out.

752
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To you remember running across something that had any significance to you.

753
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.170
Victoria reed: I do remember having a dream. Okay.

754
01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear about that.

755
01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.760
Victoria reed: Right before that I had a dream of a Black Widow

756
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:25.410
Victoria reed: And it

757
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:27.360
Victoria reed: attacked me

758
01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.860
Victoria reed: Yeah, that's weird. Yeah.

759
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it like the that morning.

760
01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:44.070
Victoria reed: Yes, it was actually, um, it was a real like a female Black Widow

761
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:51.750
Victoria reed: Because they are real big around and ahead an hourglass on it.

762
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No, read our glass on the on the belly or

763
01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:57.600
Yes.

764
01:25:59.190 --> 01:25:59.550
Yeah.

765
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And

766
01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:08.730
Victoria reed: And did you wait us. Yes, I did. And I thought that there was really one on me.

767
01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.880
Victoria reed: That freaked me out.

768
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:17.730
Victoria reed: Yeah, I was wondering what the heck that man.

769
01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.120
Victoria reed: Like am I gonna get bit or, you know,

770
01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we might I wrote that down and I want to do some dream analysis with you.

771
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's see if we can stay on course with with this setup that you just did right in front of

772
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You and Dr. But I wrote it down. And so just curious just now. So you're talking about had the sciatic pain earlier in the day, um, you know, I was walking to this, this, you know, Black Widow dream.

773
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, and then you had the thought, I'm worn out.

774
01:26:59.010 --> 01:26:59.520
Victoria reed: Yes.

775
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing from zero to 100 is this that we're talking about right now.

776
01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:11.220
Victoria reed: Oh nice dressing or tranquil

777
01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: At well okay so if I use the word stress people themselves into that experience. But if I say subjective unit of distress. If I say how distressing is that distress can encapsulate all of those emotions and then you're not stuck with having to force it into the word stress.

778
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For you right now. Victoria.

779
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to that imagery that Sciatic pain, having to solve it through ibuprofen acetaminophen heating pad.

780
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you remembered I got a little lost in the story of the stretching. But that's, I think, a part of it, either before after or during and. And the thought was

781
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm worn out.

782
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:03.420
Victoria reed: Yes, how

783
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressing is that from zero to 100 let's give it a number. And you might register the distress in the body, not sure, but let's give it a number

784
01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.670
Victoria reed: The 665

785
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.470
Okay.

786
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I didn't ask you what the emotion was holding that memory in your in your consciousness and your working memory, what do you label the emotion that went with this story. You just told me

787
01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:46.260
Victoria reed: Anxiety.

788
01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.080
Victoria reed: Worry

789
01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought is, I'm worn out.

790
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:00.210
Yeah.

791
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If I ever get it wrong, you can always clarify.

792
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Say no, that's not it. It's this. Okay.

793
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture that in your mind's eye just sort of hold it there. A little bit longer.

794
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Being aware of that, pulling in the imagery of it.

795
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And the negative cognition and negative thought the word cognition and solder the same thing. So the negative cognition is I am more now. Now, for a moment, I want you

796
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To think for a moment what you would rather be thinking

797
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: About yourself.

798
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus I'm more now.

799
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive belief about yourself, would be what

800
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

801
01:29:56.910 --> 01:30:00.060
Victoria reed: What I'm strong. Relax.

802
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

803
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong and relaxed.

804
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: With you today is I think we'll do a little bit of the desensitization part and then we're going to

805
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: shift gears.

806
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll pull in

807
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the imagery. You know those positive nurturing protective and wise figures and will pull in this positive cognition with it. Okay.

808
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got something stuck in my throat.

809
01:30:53.040 --> 01:31:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we're going to doing this bilateral stimulation here in a second.

810
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is basically how it's going to go. I'm going to ask you to pull up into your awareness and image, the worst picture of it. I'm going to

811
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask you to hold that negative cognition and then you're going to be looking at those two objects and I'll be setting the tempo here in front of you with my finger.

812
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to see it go a little faster on the first part of this, and then later on when we do the positive cognition, so I'll be slowing down a little bit.

813
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not going to be a lot of talking in between, you'll just hear me say, Okay, and let's have a nice inhale and then exhale, and then I'm going to say what's coming up for you. And when I say that.

814
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a very open ended question, but we want to catches.

815
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What you felt could be in your body could be an emotion could be a new thought. Try not to edit it.

816
01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.010
Victoria reed: I wanted him.

817
01:31:59.610 --> 01:32:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: may only be a brief statement and then we may do what's called another iteration I made will breathe. When I say, so what's coming up for you.

818
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll tell me nice short sentence and we'll do it again. So it's not a lot of back and forth talking, it's, it's going to be more that structure. I just described, it's not going to be okay.

819
01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. So let's begin.

820
01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull that image up, you're in this physical pain and pull up the worst part. The worst image that comes to mind you shared a story about a Black Widow and you were experiencing Sciatic pain. The worst element.

821
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That memory.

822
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in your awareness and then I want you to be thinking about. I'm worn out.

823
01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to open your eyes.

824
01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And watch you look at the two objects. As I pointed them back and forth.

825
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's have a nice nourishing inhale together, inhale through the nose and then

826
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go, let it all go

827
01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And gently. Notice what comes up for you.

828
01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.250
Victoria reed: Come

829
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling calm. Okay.

830
01:33:52.410 --> 01:33:52.740
Yeah.

831
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.860
Victoria reed: Really

832
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So what level of distress, are you at right now.

833
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:09.810
Victoria reed: Have to be mad at

834
01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.690
Victoria reed: 2020

835
01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it again hold that pitch.

836
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm worn out and kind of go with calm and relief and we're going to do this again it'll stay at that kind of pace. We were at before. When you're ready, open your eyes and hold it in your working awareness stay conscious of it.

837
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together.

838
01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling letting it all.

839
01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see what you notice

840
01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice any thoughts or emotions anything passed by the mind.

841
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:41.310
Victoria reed: No.

842
01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Nothing passed through and how

843
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: From zero to 100 how much distress. Are you in right now.

844
01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:53.040
Victoria reed: No, no.

845
01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go with that. So, work hard to pull up that negative them. The worst part of that. Okay. Picture it, and this negative

846
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Cognition, I'm more now.

847
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm more relaxed and let's go with that. Okay, try to hold your awareness and looking left to my

848
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Together nice nourishing breath.

849
01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

850
01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:11.460
Go.

851
01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:22.650
Are you experiencing.

852
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:26.430
Victoria reed: Relief

853
01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Relief and free

854
01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:31.680
Yeah.

855
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your level of your son at this time.

856
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

857
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you know

858
01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If it could get to zero or is do you think you know what it is that keeps it from going to zero or could it go to zero.

859
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.310
Victoria reed: It could go to zero.

860
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if it does, we'll do another iteration, I should say. So again, this is the desensitization part pull up that worst image got to really think about it, hold it there.

861
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that negative cognition worn out.

862
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And go with I feel relief and free

863
01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's open your eyes. When you're ready, and hold it in your awareness.

864
01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, letting it all go

865
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you observe about the South.

866
01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.400
Victoria reed: No worries.

867
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: closer to zero.

868
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:55.710
Victoria reed: Yes.

869
01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so net 00 okay

870
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And just so you know sometimes people are tempted to want to please the therapist.

871
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so be you got to really pay the only you'll know that so you got to pay real close attention.

872
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because

873
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only do my job if you're

874
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.500
Being honest zone.

875
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So be real careful because it won't do you any good.

876
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:29.640
Victoria reed: Yeah.

877
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm saying. So I it's really risky for me to ask that question about the zero because we could go another direction depending on what you said and that's okay to just

878
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to manage that part. Alright, so we got down to zero. And now what I'd like to do is I want you to think about your, your team.

879
01:40:53.520 --> 01:41:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about your team of protector which what we got in here. We've got wolf.

880
01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Wolf, so go deeply into it and you can close your eyes and we're going to do some much slower iterations integrating this positive team we've got wolf.

881
01:41:17.970 --> 01:41:19.110
As a protector.

882
01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And be near it a part of it. Let

883
01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.020
Victoria reed: It go great with you as your

884
01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandmother and cat as a nurturing quality is also a part of this imagery

885
01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, including the wisdom quality, the wise figure of your aunt, Peggy.

886
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And have the whole team interacting with you give yourself permission to have it.

887
01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Go in your own way, whatever happens without imagery is just time

888
01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be present with it, see what it does.

889
01:42:17.370 --> 01:42:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Seem like you're very present with those those qualities

890
01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:22.650
Yeah.

891
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's have you open your eyes.

892
01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to do it nice and slow. Okay. Still going to look at the two objects holding the awareness of that imagery protected figure nurturing quality.

893
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise figure, hold it in your awareness.

894
01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

895
01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhaling now.

896
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn to yourself.

897
01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know how it feels to to be present with those qualities

898
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.900

901
01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

902
01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

903
01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong. Because I'm strong your positive cognition.

904
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Was strong and relaxed.

905
01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This is on a different scale, right now I want you to picture from one to seven totally different kind of number reference. How true is it right now try and catch it.

906
01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: For one to seven seven being absolutely true. I'm strong and relaxed seven being absolutely true. One is not true.

907
01:44:54.570 --> 01:45:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's take that positive of cognition. I want you to hold it, hold it in your awareness.

908
01:45:01.050 --> 01:45:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's summon up that WORST piece all that negative imagery. You were you had earlier, pull it into your awareness and this time I want you to be thinking. I am strong and relaxed.

Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it go

912
01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:00.720
Let it all go
