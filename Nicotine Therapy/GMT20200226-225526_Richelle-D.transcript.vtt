Richelle Direny: Unless of course I'll tell you in advance if I'm not going to be at a group and I also

37
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:39.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, just two groups in the for their individual therapy, you'll be meeting with me. Um, you know, we always ask, especially with the group six. That's the main one, especially with the groups because of the fact that you have other people that join in the groups that you would have

38
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.730
Richelle Direny: I had said.

39
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.450
Rhianna: Yes.

40
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.150
Richelle Direny: But just so because of other people be in the room.

41
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.070
Just for the purpose of confidentiality.

42
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.840
Richelle Direny: Is going to be

43
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.940
Richelle Direny: Where we log in.

44
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:59.940
Richelle Direny: To meet with each other. So we just always asking, and I know things happen, kind of, you know, sometimes there's mishaps where you the Wi Fi connection.

45
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:07.650
Richelle Direny: I mean you can never really guarantee that it's always going to be tippy top but you know we always ask that you're in an area where you get the Wi Fi.

46
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:16.740
Rhianna: I have like three or four that so we can go through and put my eight year old you know even do that. A big

47
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:25.350
Richelle Direny: Okay. And then, so just just going over the house rules in, you know, just

48
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:36.180
Richelle Direny: When it's all said and done, if you ever state or share so I suggest that you know you're at your risk of hurting yourself or you feel really, you know, overwhelmed and

49
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:46.770
Richelle Direny: Just feeling hopeless and you know worthless, whatever it is, and you feel like hurting yourself or anyone else, you know, at that point, you know, confidential kind of goes out the door and we, I am a mandated reporter

50
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.850
Richelle Direny: So I would ask for it. And, um, you know, but

51
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.000
Rhianna: I hope

52
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.320
Rhianna: I could say my life, I would hope so.

53
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.630
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, it's all about saving your own

54
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.680
Richelle Direny: But outside of that you know it. Everything is confidential because you'll always see me in a room with a closed door.

55
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:17.430
Richelle Direny: You know, to, to meet with you, um, of course, the setting on the group days or sometimes it's going to be a little bit different but

56
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.210
Outside of that,

57
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.540
Rhianna: Well, that's fine. It's just like

58
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:35.280
Rhianna: The last like the last place I was that an hour that's out there for a very, very, very long time. But we didn't really do group settings as much as one on one.

59
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:52.770
Rhianna: But the one on ones were so at the time I was so turned out about meeting counselor counselor counselor at that point I was just like, read my file read my file, but might be that you're going to be, and I'm sure you'll be here for a while.

60
00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:02.700
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah, no, no, we don't. And you're talking about it when you're in a treatment program. Yes, it's a little bit different in a treatment program because you are bouncing around. And people are leaving. And it's a

61
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.540
Rhianna: War.

Richelle Direny: But this session. It's just information me gathering getting to know you kind of getting to know your background, your history, what brought you to pray.

71
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:04.800

77
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.130
Rhianna: I'm actually watching a commercial late of the YouTube one night and

78
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.080
Rhianna: It kind of

79
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:55.860
Rhianna: Came across the screen and I didn't even I didn't believe it was just like, no way. There's no way and

80
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:06.870
Rhianna: I know another girl that just joined not too long ago for my meeting because we have meetings hear you now. Na and

81
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:21.480
Rhianna: She was telling me about it and she joined around the time I did and she has been she is backed by the way. You guys are so very low. Give it a shot like the guy was being up in Columbus, Ohio.

82
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:30.720
Rhianna: I was thinking for seven years and it was it was wonderful. But the one on one counselor, kind of, I don't know what happened.

83
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:39.600
Rhianna: Either be written, take the drug and alcohol courses versus he was really a lifestyle.

84
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.170
Rhianna: I that's what the doctor told my best.

85
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:57.810
Rhianna: And it got really connected really really expensive. It was like, they went from 200 250 to 75 and then by the end of it. It was 325 what

86
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.060
Rhianna: Do I mean

87
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.500
Richelle Direny: How much what that's per hour to meet with him or

88
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:10.350
Rhianna: For the visit alone just for the doctor visit alone and then

89
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:19.470
Rhianna: I would talk to him. I talked to the counselor I TOUCH CENTER. Get my butter all that guy and urinalysis

90
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.390
Rhianna: Then

91
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:36.600
Rhianna: The best part of my day was talking to your account. So, though. I mean, I have to say dance moves. Anything we made my day and for three years at that time back at that time, I really needed on that. If you can actually because

92
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.580
Rhianna: My oldest I had lost and a person who's Taiwan.

93
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.620
Rhianna: And then my middle one was kind of just

94
00:20:47.790 --> 00:21:01.050
Rhianna: Out there and the same car wreck as my turn one year old, my brother, which is six months or than my one. My son has he survived. You survived. There's a lot going on. Once I have an eight year old.

95
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:12.360
Rhianna: Now, so I really needed I needed something or I was going to balls to the wall. Relax. I'm not gonna say. I mean, you know, and

96
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:24.330
Rhianna: So, and they did extensive I call me any day or night come up there. He has to. Because from where I'm at, to argue that it's about an hour and 20 minutes away.

97
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:35.520
Rhianna: But you can use personal cell phone number, which is kind of really personal so and we we chitchat it like this and he got me through a lot, a lot, a lot of things.

98
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.100
Richelle Direny: Okay, you said that you know you got to do the console, you got his number you were able to meet with him.

99
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:50.910
Rhianna: Oh, yeah, yeah. Like, like that like we're doing, he would, he would come from like this. Also, when I got there we have our session.

100
00:21:53.160 --> 00:22:05.220
Rhianna: For me, made me made my day and then so when he loved us three and a half years later, and it was just like that. You can say goodbye and have a year so abrupt saying

101
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:13.380
Rhianna: That I asked him about the data to like what happened. Please tell me what happened because it's convenient to like a shut down, you know,

102
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:22.740
Rhianna: But come to find out. I guess he was a life counselors versus a drug and alcohol counselor to maybe that's why he worked so well as he

103
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:32.490
Rhianna: Did that and on top of that I was doing grief counseling, you know, because when my sister passed the year before that my guys, though I did everything. Fine.

104
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.720
Rhianna: You know, I mean, so I figured I tried different with my son, and it'll be five years.

105
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.210
Rhianna: In October, now this year so

106
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.040
And

107
00:22:48.300 --> 00:23:02.700
Rhianna: Time to grow up. I mean, I'm 42 years old I usually people didn't addiction. Usually when they're young in their life now and I waited until my 30s working job great in their second year, I decided

108
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.870
Rhianna: I'm fine. I had a boyfriend, which is thinking about 11 years we had a baby.

109
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:12.480
Rhianna: But

110
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.130
Richelle Direny: Father.

111
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.510
Rhianna: Welcome

112
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.790

113
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.340
Rhianna: Warm warm, um,

114
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.050
Rhianna: Anyway,

115
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.760
Rhianna: And then I think any purpose that

116
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:34.740
Rhianna: Gave me more energy to work early and then it kind of made me feel like, oh, superhuman

117
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.250
Rhianna: Though

118
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.520
Richelle Direny: You said that you said that

119
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.910
Richelle Direny: Perfectly purpose that made you

120
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.460
Richelle Direny: Gave you a lot of energy.

121
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.720
Rhianna: One. Like, don't, don't get me wrong with when

122
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.030
Rhianna: I thought my accident, a good job.

123
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.620
Rhianna: But

124
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:14.910
Rhianna: Was like after the paint on it was like, well, I was taking a payment batches and didn't come back. It's kind of see me around and I'd be at work and I was their server and a bartender and then if I wasn't doing that I was

125
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:31.590
Rhianna: Achieved which is finalized come with a fake name of your university and I just made me feel like by visually Jackie, do anything. I mean, I would get everything done the housework homework. We're now. It was just

126
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:42.630
Rhianna: Amazing. And then all of a sudden, it wasn't, it was more like I need. I have to, I have to have and I have to have it or I can function.

127
00:24:43.470 --> 00:25:00.570
Rhianna: And then I broke a few different places. So then the fact that was terrified because I was already on Saturday, and you're like, I am terrified. And I'm like, listen, whatever. Give me here when I leave here. I won't touch it. Yeah, my word, I don't want to run my life.

128
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.420

132
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:34.260
Rhianna: I threw up to try to study tech. They didn't want to because they were terrified that I could relax. But then I got pregnant and after. So I was on for quite some time. So after

Richelle Direny: Okay, but, um, what, what about the alcohol use.

Rhianna: Anyways, so, um,

207
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:10.050
Rhianna: It's a car accident. I just kept kind of buying them here and there and get now and then go on to work and then and, you know, it's crazy. I'm just gonna be honest with you were never knew again. It was crazy. I mean, it got out of control.

208
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:11.880
Richelle Direny: You said

209
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.550
Rhianna: Huh.

210
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.710
Richelle Direny: What did you say repeat what you just said.

211
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:24.000
Rhianna: I said, you know, it was crazy that work didn't even realize that I was just

212
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.420
Rhianna: Wasn't me, you know, it wasn't me.

213
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.390
Richelle Direny: So you said that they didn't notice it.

214
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.180
Rhianna: No, I don't believe they did.

215
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:51.960
Rhianna: At least if they did, and never told me, and I worked there long enough to where I mean I reserved for eight years. So I known the same people for eight years and merged with him every day, you know, at least one person be like, Get your shit together. You know what I mean.

216
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.850
Richelle Direny: What kind of work did you do

217
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.760
Rhianna: I was a server and a bartender.

218
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:14.820
Rhianna: And then if I didn't do that part time they had me do a key which is similar to like a fake manager. I only have a card like a card that would discount meals for different servers and

219
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.730
Rhianna: I was mad.

220
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.810
Rhianna: I was there forever. And then I got into

221
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:30.690
Rhianna: Christmas Kelly agency. This is a place where this is kind of cool like it. It looked up and down like

222
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:47.100
Rhianna: One day I could come in dress to the hill and be any insurance office where I would take it because he was an insurance guy. So I'm talking house insurance boat insurance car insurance, whatever. So I take the money for that or then

223
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:56.850
Rhianna: One week he could give me a list of houses or apartments that needed cleaned or paint or whatever. And I can do that.

224
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:06.630
Rhianna: So, it kept me busy and again it was something different because I've been in the food service I'm having food service all my life.

225
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.030
Rhianna: So,

226
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.950
Rhianna: You know,

227
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.730
Rhianna: I mean, don't get me wrong, I love me, it's just

228
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.250
Rhianna: I'm getting a little older.

229
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:30.690
Richelle Direny: I hear that. Now I'm so you said that an 11 years ago you said you're 42 so 11 years ago, you're talking about maybe in your early 30s, is when you started using drugs.

230
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

231
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:42.330
Rhianna: And I said, not like a normal person where they try experiment when they're teenagers or young 20s. Yeah, no I wait till I'm 30 some and like an idiot.

232
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.830
Richelle Direny: And and the car accident is what triggered it.

233
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.750
Rhianna: Yes, yes, my neck was really bad and

234
00:35:53.130 --> 00:36:04.530
Rhianna: It was my neck. I couldn't bend it a certain way and then it was almost like I had a limp. But there's nothing wrong like several X rays, and I did it. I did chiropractor and

235
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:14.580
Rhianna: All that. But there's nothing really wrong to the point where I shouldn't have needed that then meds and that was probably back when they were given out way too many meds.

236
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.230
Richelle Direny: Now do you were you ever diagnosed with a mental illness.

237
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.550
No.

238
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.960
Richelle Direny: Never been treated by card for certainly for mental illness.

239
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:29.580
Rhianna: Now,

240
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.590
Richelle Direny: Is there any family history of substance abuse.

241
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.990
Rhianna: I'm

242
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:48.780
Rhianna: Well, my, I call it. Remember earlier I was talking about my sister that died. She was my actual she was my blood cousin. She odd.

243
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.220
Rhianna: So yeah, and then my

244
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.780
Rhianna: Uncle on my mom's side us out all

245
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.020
Rhianna: He's gone now. Other than that, my dad.

246
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.470
Richelle Direny: And she already just a few years ago, right.

247
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.910
Rhianna: Do I hi

248
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.700
Richelle Direny: If she OD, just a few years ago.

249
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.920
Rhianna: She odd year after my son. So it's been six years for her.

250
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.130
Okay.

251
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:28.980
Richelle Direny: So, um, and a year after your son, your son passed away a year ago and she passed away, six years ago.

252
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:48.990
Rhianna: No, no. Hi, my son passed away, um, October 18 2015 she passed away, January 7 2014 she her birthday was on January 1 and she seven days later, God

253
00:37:52.440 --> 00:38:01.740
Richelle Direny: And what about um so you were never diagnosed with any mental illness just or the thing was just the addiction to the opiates.

254
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.780
Rhianna: And so forth, right. And, well, I guess you would say I taking antidepressant anxiety and

255
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.380
Rhianna: Depression, because I do is I was a little depressed, I guess.

256
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.340
Richelle Direny: After your

257
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.040
Rhianna: Idea. I do get panic attacks so

258
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.710
Rhianna: That's for my family physician.

259
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.730
Richelle Direny: So your family physician is one that prescribes the medication.

260
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.170
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. Okay, so, anxiety and

261
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.140
Richelle Direny: depression. Depression.

262
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.430
Yes.

263
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.930
Rhianna: And also water pill. I hold water like a darn water hose.

264
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.270
Richelle Direny: And

265
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.450
Richelle Direny: And all of that started after you

266
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:59.610
Rhianna: Yeah, I would say so. Or at least, I would say it happen, I noticed it. After that, just to be on maybe I paid more attention to it. Like, I WAS WITH MY SON'S FATHER.

267
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:11.940
Rhianna: Kingston's Dad, I was with him for 11 and a half years. And then I didn't realize how much non attention. I wasn't giving him until

268
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:17.130
Rhianna: Until I did. You know what I mean. So it was chilly and

269
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.200
Richelle Direny: You weren't married to him.

270
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.470
Rhianna: Now, girl. Come on. You wish a me thinking me up the rock net

271
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.200
Rhianna: And get the diamond it

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.420
Richelle Direny: You wouldn't get the do you couldn't get the diamond out of him.

273
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:43.440
Rhianna: Now that makes me so mad I you know what it's like was Christopher dad, which is my oldest son now since I've lost my oldest one so I call him my oldest son.

274
00:39:43.890 --> 00:40:02.490
Rhianna: His dad is was for like almost 10 like eight and a half years. He gave me a ring, but never asked me and it was never know like nice beautiful room. It's just like a little rain and with Ryanair Kingston's bad he got me all kinds of diamonds. Don't get me wrong but

275
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:22.020
Rhianna: He never, never still to this day. He's like 39 I am older than him. But he we split up initially because I got pregnant after 11 years I got pregnant and then he got some now I'm 35 yes some 22 year old girl from a galleon

276
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.820
Rhianna: Pregnant

277
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:31.560
Rhianna: And I was so over it by then I was like, Oh my God, you got to begin after 11 years of this bullcrap forget it.

278
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:38.220
Rhianna: And, you know, and she still didn't get a ring, either in your area. Still, I'd marry, he just

279
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.910
Rhianna: Whatever, I don't have time for it.

280
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.950
Rhianna: I know if I see you, if you're married a hallelujah girl.

281
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:56.280
Richelle Direny: Is there any of any kind of addiction on your mother's side or your father side.

282
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.050
Richelle Direny: Out. Now your cousin was was on your mother's side or your father's side.

283
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.440
Rhianna: That was on my mom's side.

Rhianna: It's his dad's fault.

426
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.940
Richelle Direny: You said you

427
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.810
Rhianna: Yeah, all that baked macaroni and cheese. And you know, that's no good for you, but damn it. Good god.

428
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.880
Rhianna: And I've tried to not get

429
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:56.400
Rhianna: Like stray away from it and I will your will. Your chewing on a carrot stick and you're looking over like God. That looks delicious. I'm just gonna put it down and eat it.

430
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.720
Rhianna: I have no self control over food.

431
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.410
Richelle Direny: Well,

432
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.810
Rhianna: No wonder I my son's looking at me like, mom.

433
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:08.970
Rhianna: Well, why you do it. So,

434
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.470
Richelle Direny: Of course, chewing on a carrot is not appealing in

435
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.440
Rhianna: Now, well, I mean that's what I'll just be eaten.

436
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:25.290
Rhianna: can chop cares be in these cut up salads and, you know, I mean, don't get me wrong, there is good salad but

437
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.630
Rhianna: Every time

438
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:42.480
Rhianna: Gosh. Yeah. I mean, he even told me to. As far as to go yeah okay go to port, but you shouldn't eat the pork with the bone in it. Well, there's the flavor. That's the flavor. Do you see

439
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:45.630
Rhianna: I'm just being honest.

440
00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.600
Rhianna: What is wrong with this guy.

441
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:50.760
Richelle Direny: Oh,

442
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.180
Rhianna: Sorry, I don't mean to make you laugh.

443
00:56:54.510 --> 00:57:04.770
Rhianna: I'm just being honest, you know, I mean, gosh, take the flavor out everything and then don't don't stare saying, Mrs. Dash my way. I mean, I might just fall over.

444
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:15.690
Richelle Direny: But listen, I wholeheartedly agree. You gotta, you gotta suck the moment like what is eating a piece of you can't get out of the bone.

445
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.520
Rhianna: Do what, honey.

446
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.660
Richelle Direny: I said, What is the purpose of eating the meat. If you can't really suck all that juice.

447
00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.370
Rhianna: Inflamed oh crap.

448
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.990

Rhianna: Oh my gosh, and you should see my son go at it. I mean, he loves it.

450
00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:39.870
Rhianna: And he is a skinny way to, you see. And maybe you can see him. Next time running around the background. He is so darn skinny.

451
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:57.360
Rhianna: He's a boy. I mean, he's he's he'll be eight. So I always say, but he is so tall and skinny, so he looks like he's at he doesn't mean anything. But he does. He just likes what he lives. That's why we're at this kind of an agreement.

452
00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:06.930
Rhianna: It can't be all fun for me while I'm sucking my fingers and he's you know he didn't care sticks. It just can't we just can't.

481
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.430
Tammy Flannery: Hello.

482
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:41.580
Richelle Direny: Hello.

483
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.770
Richelle Direny: Hi, how are you

484
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.040
Tammy Flannery: I'm doing better, how are you

485
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.350
Richelle Direny: I'm good. I thought for a second.

486
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.740
Tammy Flannery: Yeah, I didn't I, I'm getting so confused with the all the

487
01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:04.620
Tammy Flannery: Email stuff. So I thought I had to go into my email and then enter a survey or something first to get to you, but

488
01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.800
Tammy Flannery: Like I'm not very computer savvy.

489
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:09.840
Tammy Flannery: I just

490
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.180
Richelle Direny: I'll go over everything with you.

491
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.050
Richelle Direny: Well, not about

492
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.780
Richelle Direny: The server because I have to go learn that myself on how about

493
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:26.730
Richelle Direny: Having know that they recommend that you um you check in through the virtual clinic first so they can go over every anything that needs to that you need to get done with

494
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.080
Richelle Direny: Me, but um I sent you a text them.

495
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.440
Tammy Flannery: Yeah.

496
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:35.670
Okay.

497
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:46.770
Richelle Direny: So, um, you know, usually when I send a text like if you just because whenever I don't get confirmation. Like I'm unsure as to whether or not you're going to come

498
01:01:47.430 --> 01:02:02.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, yeah. So like, um, well, we'll talk more about that in the end about better i thought i find it to be better to just send the text out. I'm in comparison to email because I feel like the text, it's more readily available because it's your

499
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:03.270
Home.

500
01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.760
Richelle Direny: And you can respond to that.

501
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.180
Tammy Flannery: Used to the text.

502
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

503
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.650
Richelle Direny: And if you're not computer savvy. I don't know how much you use your email.

504
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.000
Tammy Flannery: I'm learning here lately.

505
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.880
Richelle Direny: By the time you're finished with this, you're going to be a proactive.

506
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:35.880
Tammy Flannery: Right, exactly. You know, the quick learner. I really do learn vast I just never really got into the computer seen yet. So I guess it's just

507
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.260
Richelle Direny: There. Don't worry, you

508
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.910

01:02:49.590 --> 01:03:00.990
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. So, tomorrow, you're going to do the same thing where you're going to log into the virtual clinic and they're going to give you the my zoom room number. It's not going to be the same as the one tonight.

512
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:12.150
Richelle Direny: That's only when we meet individually, where they're going to give you my zoom number and that is what you're going to use to meet for group at one o'clock, and that's every Thursday at 1pm

513
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.170
Okay.

514
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.140
Richelle Direny: All right, I'm

515
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.050
Tammy Flannery: The one that I have for you now that

516
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.210
Tammy Flannery: You know, I find is that

517
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:24.960
Tammy Flannery: What they

518
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.060
Richelle Direny: Every time we meet for a

519
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:32.970
Richelle Direny: Minute.

520
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:37.680
But then

521
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.070
Richelle Direny: I think is

522
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.000
Tammy Flannery: I don't know if you're

523
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.860
Richelle Direny: gonna hear a lot of feedback.

524
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.990
Tammy Flannery: I think it's this phone right now.

525
01:03:55.290 --> 01:04:02.430
Tammy Flannery: So I didn't use it. I don't have to fix now apps. But he's lost the lifeline something else.

526
01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.020
Tammy Flannery: Yeah.

527
01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:10.230
Richelle Direny: I'm still here to go back to where it was because I think it was your reception was better that way it was before.

544
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:21.750
Richelle Direny: You know, you're just somewhere where you you're able to meet and it is in a private area, especially when you're meeting for the groups that they're always in a private area.

545
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.760
Richelle Direny: Um, because with the

546
01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:31.710
Richelle Direny: Other people are sharing. I'm so if you're going to be somewhere around where other people are, you know, you just always have a headset.

547
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:33.540
Tammy Flannery: So that people don't. The

548
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:39.270
Richelle Direny: Ground, you will hear what the other people on the zoom are on this platform is saying.

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.910
Richelle Direny: I always always asked every time that we meet

551
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:56.220
Richelle Direny: You know, again, life happens things happen there last minute and that's the reason why I like, I like to share. So you can send me a text message or send you a text message. If you're not going to be able to so

552
01:05:56.610 --> 01:06:05.130
Richelle Direny: Let's say you're on your way. We're going to meet and something occurred and but going emergency happy now. You can't meet just shoot me a text and say, hey, we're shown

553
01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:12.210
Richelle Direny: I know we have a session today, but I just had an emergency. I'm not going to be able to meet and I'll be like, Okay, no problem.

554
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:20.370
Richelle Direny: We'll just reschedule because I know things happen if this eliminates me from sitting here waiting for you to pop up on my

555
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:21.900
Tammy Flannery: Screen that's

556
01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:25.020
Richelle Direny: From not doing that.

557
01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:35.880
Richelle Direny: Um, and the other thing is that it is not everything that you're saying is it's going to be health confidential, even though you do have with your

558
01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:50.970
Richelle Direny: Physician that you meet with myself and what have you. You know, from we work as a team. So as as it's related to the team. They're all aware of what's going on. It is a recorded session now where confidentiality.

559
01:06:52.320 --> 01:07:01.920
Richelle Direny: Where confidentiality kind of goes out the door is if you suggest that you want to hurt yourself. You make a statement to say that you are threatening self harm.

560
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.410
Richelle Direny: harm to others.

561
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:06.240
Richelle Direny: And then that's when you know

562
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:20.190
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I'll try to stack, um, you know, this is just kind of US building our initial relationship or report and just kind of beginning our working relationship. Okay.

563
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.510
Tammy Flannery: All right, great.

564
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:24.420
Richelle Direny: All right then. So you have any questions so far.

565
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.840
Tammy Flannery: No so far. I don't think so. I may here in a little bit.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:41.490
Richelle Direny: Tell me, tell me a little bit about, you know, how'd you hear about bright heart. What got you worked hard.

568
01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:48.510
Tammy Flannery: And I actually saw a commercial on TV for a different place.

569
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.520
Tammy Flannery: They were called bright

570
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:59.880
Tammy Flannery: Bright something else. And I don't know. Have you heard of them or not. But there's a different place. But when I was looking it up on the computer.

571
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:10.350
Tammy Flannery: You have an a pop up to like a little phone number or something in the corner. So I decided to call it just to see what happens. And I was completely shocked at all of the

572
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:20.070
Tammy Flannery: The services that you provide online because I i believe i told you i had open heart surgery.

573
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:31.440
Tammy Flannery: I had four lung surgery, a piece of my lung left lung removed and 2015 for pneumonia and literacy and then I had

574
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.420
Tammy Flannery: An infection run through my body from my teeth. And so I had

575
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:47.040
Tammy Flannery: To have a breast surgery on what this was all in one year in 2015 was a long 2018 2018 was the

576
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:58.680
Tammy Flannery: Breast and then I had a bell obstruction. Two months later, and then I had open heart surgery. Two months later, two months after that when I almost died because I was losing blood

577
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:02.400
Tammy Flannery: And then just a hysterectomy.

578
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:04.560
Tammy Flannery: March of last year.

579
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:07.740
Tammy Flannery: I went through the wringer there for a minute.

580
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.570
Richelle Direny: A lot of medical issues.

581
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.400
Tammy Flannery: I'm getting better than now I'm starting to move towards

582
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:25.500
Tammy Flannery: You know, moving the right direction of getting healthier starting to gain my way back slowly but surely that was really healthy. I felt before. But

583
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.950
Tammy Flannery: So,

584
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:36.630
Richelle Direny: So then you found with with finding bright heart and to kind of work through your, you know, your pack addiction.

585
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.240
Tammy Flannery: Addiction this

586
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:48.750
Richelle Direny: Is what finding this program through this platform being that you get to be Apple and you know you have to do is log on. It just works really well.

587
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:57.360
Tammy Flannery: Because you know I have appointments up a lot of other places. I can barely get to sometimes because I don't have a vehicle yet. I haven't been able to drive.

588
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.880
Tammy Flannery: Completely running around, it seems like non stop.

589
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:20.100
Tammy Flannery: If I want to get all the, I guess I have to. But then it was so convenient that you guys do it online and I and all of your programs are online for the I mean other than going and picking up medication. I can do all of my everything else here.

590
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:26.370
Richelle Direny: I think you when you do your labs, I believe either the military, you go to a lab.

591
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.830
Tammy Flannery: Yeah, they said.

592
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.610
Tammy Flannery: I don't know exactly how should that words do you, do you know how that works. Like you go to the lab, the first time.

593
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.750
Richelle Direny: I believe you go to the lab, the first time, but I think the

594
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:47.010
Richelle Direny: I think the medical provider, they're the ones that tell you, I don't know. I honestly don't know how that works.

595
01:10:48.750 --> 01:11:00.690
Richelle Direny: For them, and other people they actually have to go to a lot to get it done. So I don't know if it's based on the insurance that the insurance determines how it's done. I don't know if that plays a big part in it.

596
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.450
Tammy Flannery: Okay. All right.

597
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:04.260
Now,

598
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:12.360
Richelle Direny: Now we've got an established pretty much like what brought you to bright heart. Could you give me just a little bit of background into

599
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:23.940
Richelle Direny: Your history as it's related to your addiction, like one day to get started. HOW OLD WERE YOU WERE YOU was young. I kind of what was surrounding the beginning

600
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.480
Tammy Flannery: I was young when I was young, I

601
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.580
Tammy Flannery: did start. I started drinking in smoking marijuana

602
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.380
Tammy Flannery: As

603
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:42.060
Tammy Flannery: A teenager, you know, here and there that progressed a little bit well progressed a lot into my

604
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:54.450
Tammy Flannery: Late teens and then I finally decided enough was enough. You know, and I quit. And I started thinking about school again and I got my GED. And when I

605
01:11:55.530 --> 01:12:00.720
Tammy Flannery: Started taking criminal justice but I ended up in surgery, of all places to work.

606
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:02.490
Tammy Flannery: But

607
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:14.790
Tammy Flannery: I really liked it. At that time, but for some reason I was able to like I felt like I was maintaining at that time, you know, I could maintain

608
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:16.410
Tammy Flannery: Yeah.

609
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:23.310
Tammy Flannery: I worked in surgery for seven years as a surgical technician.

610
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:29.310
Tammy Flannery: Instrument, which was a nice job. I loved it. It was a learning experience every day but

611
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:37.200
Tammy Flannery: Let's see what let me go back when I started having my surgeries. I'd had a

612
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:54.210
Tammy Flannery: My leftover removed in 2007 which would have been a few, you know, some years later after I kind of stopped smoking weed and I drank a little bit here and there, but like, you know, maybe twice a year, or

613
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.220
Tammy Flannery: Something like that.

614
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:08.520
Tammy Flannery: Let's see how to okay and then I have my surgery on my left over. And they had a system on it. That was too, but they couldn't get it out and it wouldn't last or whatever. So

615
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:22.560
Tammy Flannery: They removed it. I had on the pain bills and I just fell in love with the euphoria effect that they gave me and I felt like I could do anything. You know what I mean by that. I'd already been working in surgeries. I kind of screwed.

616
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.300
Tammy Flannery: I went down now pretty quick.

617
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:48.690
Tammy Flannery: I love that sick, my mother in law that saved my husband, he doesn't. I guess they passed away because my mother, my mom.

618
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.460
Tammy Flannery: And me and my sister in law passed away.

619
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:03.900
Tammy Flannery: My brother in law. My mom passed away. First she got brain cancer.

620
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:15.510
Tammy Flannery: My mother in law. A year later, passed away. I'm sorry.

621
01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:18.030
Tammy Flannery: I keep it together, but one

622
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:26.700
Tammy Flannery: Day. My sister law overdose, which was pretty

623
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:39.570
Tammy Flannery: painstaking it away. My husband was distraught beat him. We're having problems. He hasn't do drugs. I do. Do you know at the time I was doing drugs so

624
01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:43.350
Tammy Flannery: It was just a tug of war and

625
01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.660
Tammy Flannery: When my sister in law died.

626
01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:59.910
Tammy Flannery: It was really, you know, that was a pretty bad time. But then a year later, my nephew his nephew died and that was

627
01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.620
Tammy Flannery: A lot of time with again and

628
01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:08.010
Tammy Flannery: Yeah, it was really awful. So when we ended up splitting that I mean he

629
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:15.420
Tammy Flannery: Ended up get physical with me emotionally abusive and stuff. And so we've been split up for a

630
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:24.510
Tammy Flannery: While that I got sick. I got really sick with the lungs and the infection in harmony. I don't think he believed it at first.

631
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:41.700
Tammy Flannery: Or he wanted to believe that I wasn't so that he what he was doing wasn't so bad on him. I don't know what it was, but he didn't want to think that I was sick because I was a pretty you know pretty strong. I feel emotionally, mentally, but

632
01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:51.750
Tammy Flannery: He started getting physical and it just became too much and I can, I knew I would live if I stuck around so

633
01:15:53.130 --> 01:16:03.780
Tammy Flannery: Anyone that would all be bad. So we've been separated for a while now and I'm working on a divorce with him, but everything I like things are getting better. Honestly, they're

634
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:10.290
Tammy Flannery: moving in the right direction, as I always say that we're saying, I've already don't know that what roles so

635
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:22.200
Tammy Flannery: I I do tend to say that I'll never taking back within. I don't know. You know what the future holds. To be honest, I don't think I would, but I may do those

636
01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:29.160
Tammy Flannery: Working on me right now though because that's who I need to focus on again myself together.

Tammy Flannery: Between us

644
01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.920
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah. Um, so now you said that it was after

645
01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.750
Richelle Direny: The surgery. That's when you got addicted to opiates.

646
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:14.520
Tammy Flannery: In 2007 yeah

647
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.180
Tammy Flannery: I HAD LEFTOVER

648
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.410

649
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:35.190
Tammy Flannery: All of those call on. I got it. I worked in surgery surgeon just gave up freely to me at the time.

650
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:40.560
Tammy Flannery: Which didn't do me any favors that I didn't

651

709
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:41.850
Tammy Flannery: Couldn't figure out anything a lot of thought I was seeking, I think. So they would just turn around, because that's a, there's a lot of that going on here. And even though it was like a level was completely zero. I didn't have any base so that I wouldn't be seen

710
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:54.840
Tammy Flannery: Right be run a fever hundred 200 for at night, they didn't. It was hard for them to believe. But finally, I had to go to hospitals, back to back, take my blood.

711
01:22:55.530 --> 01:23:15.540
Tammy Flannery: And the second, the second night when they took my blood before they said that I'd missed or I was busy a pint of blood, you know that had just been two months for too much part of that I had an emergency surgery way that we can start my bow got four inches of it. He had

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:22.650
Tammy Flannery: PTSD.

739
01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.340
Tammy Flannery: Is that what it's called. You know what I'm talking about, where

740
01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:29.760
Richelle Direny: You have PTSD. Yes. Okay.

741
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:39.000

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.670
Richelle Direny: What about your mom when

743
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.970
Tammy Flannery: I'm

744
01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:55.200

745
01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:02.850
Tammy Flannery: But, and as far as being diagnosed with anything though, I kind of thought she might have to have a slight touch of autism.

746
01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:17.220
Tammy Flannery: But that was just my opinion. You don't need me, like, looking back now because my grandson has autism. So looking back out by love. I think she may have had some a little bit, but she raised us and everything so

747
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:20.130

888
01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:41.070

892
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:06.930

893
01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:22.410
Tammy Flannery: I gave up. I do plan on going back on and working on that again because we have a couple of shelters around our area that could really use some help. Now they've got some lovely animals that could really use love and walk in and whatever.

894
01:37:23.610 --> 01:37:26.520
Tammy Flannery: Even if it's just taken out of the cage for a couple hours, let them play
