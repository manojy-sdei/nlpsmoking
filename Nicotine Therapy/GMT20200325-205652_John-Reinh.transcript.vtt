Marcus Ma: No, I mean, I guess that's I guess that's what this is. They said that I need to have that within my first 30 days so that's that's very kisses.

18
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:15.840
John Reinhart: Well, why don't we do that, we'll talk about that. And we could talk about that other stuff at another time. Alright, so this or we could talk about it, you know, let me just go ahead and I'll run these questions by. All right.

John Reinhart: Or

23
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.310
Yeah.

John Reinhart: I'm good looks like from your car there you got nice sunshine sunshiny day. Yeah.

25
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.040
Marcus Ma: I mean it's it's a little cloudy, but it's a nice day.

26
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.640
John Reinhart: Yeah. How are you, how are you handling the shelter in place thing.

27
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.430
Marcus Ma: I'm doing okay.

28
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.170
Marcus Ma: My daughter's my daughter's home from school. She's a senior in high school and she's doing online school right now trying to graduate and

29
00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:03.810
Marcus Ma: I'm still I'm still going to work. So I am I work on swimming pools. So we're considered an essential service by the county, because we do water, sanitation, so

30
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:13.050
John Reinhart: Nice. Yeah. When one client yesterday. He does like air quality, you know, driving around the Bay Area check in the air out and stuff and I

31
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:28.140
John Reinhart: And he says, Just, just since they had a shelter in place, you know, the their qualities improved almost 50% I've seen pictures over in China, where it's like, you know, was always great and it's now nice blue skies over there, but

32
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.250
John Reinhart: Anyhow, let me run the questions by you and this is a bio psychosocial that I'm doing with

33
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.620
John Reinhart: With Marcus.

34
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.010
John Reinhart: Let me pronounce your last name Marlena. This is that the proper Marcus and

35
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.640
Marcus Ma: That's good.

36
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.900
John Reinhart: Okay, great.

37
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.430
John Reinhart: And Marcus. First of all, what brings you into treatment and why now.

38
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.730
Marcus Ma: Um, well, I

39
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.140
Marcus Ma: I got involved with bright heart about a month ago.

40
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.410
Marcus Ma: Because I've been struggling with addiction to methamphetamine, and also sex sexually compulsive behaviors.

41
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.150
Marcus Ma: attached with the methamphetamine use

42
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.170
Marcus Ma: Those are, those are my main things I was I was dealing with

43
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.420
Marcus Ma: Some depression, but I haven't, haven't really been suffering with depression lately so

44
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:39.900
John Reinhart: How's it going, your first 30 days with the locks and thinking, clear and some of the cravings and triggers are subsiding hopefully a little bit

45
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.210
Marcus Ma: Yeah, I mean I, my first, my first couple of weeks on the Naltrexone I it was pretty phenomenal.

46
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:59.130
Marcus Ma: As far as like my cravings diminished significantly and I had a lot of clarity and a lot more motivation to

47
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.360
Marcus Ma: Get involved. I've been getting involved with some some groups 12 step groups and

48
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.620
Marcus Ma: finding people to talk to. I've been trying to find a sponsor.

49
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:23.070
Marcus Ma: And the last, the last couple weeks I switched I switched to 50 milligram dose, I'd started out at 25 I switched a 50 million milligram dose and for some reason.

50
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.850
Marcus Ma: It seemed like my cravings increased when I increased the dosage and so

51
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.370
Marcus Ma: Been struggling last couple weeks and then also it's been hard. I haven't been able to go to my meetings so

52
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.280
Marcus Ma: I haven't been able to go to my meetings. So I've been trying to find phone meetings I did an online meeting last night and

53
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:58.200
Marcus Ma: And so, I mean, for the most part, the last month has been really good for me. It's been really productive. I'VE BEEN SOBER completely sober from

54
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.500
Marcus Ma: The math and

55
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.190
Marcus Ma: That's been over 30 days and. And also, I've been completely solid bit

56
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:21.420
Marcus Ma: As far as like sex, sexual acting out and but still I've still been struggling with with like online, you know, pornography and

57
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.930
Marcus Ma: chat rooms and that kind of stuff, which I'm I've been addressing

58
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.560
Marcus Ma: In my groups and trying to find a sponsor to work, work through the steps.

59
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.930
Marcus Ma: My goal is tab, complete, complete sexual sobriety.

60
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.780
Marcus Ma: And so that's that's what I'm working on, but the the last three days had been really good otherwise.

61
00:06:49.950 --> 00:07:02.190
John Reinhart: Man, that is huge major props to you, you're, you're on a good road right now and it's a day to time. So thanks for that. Let me go to tell me your story with substances.

62
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.310
John Reinhart: Substance abuse.

63
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:15.150
Marcus Ma: Well i mean i i started drinking when I was like 15 and

64
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.370
Marcus Ma: Then I

65
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.050
Marcus Ma: Didn't really have too many problems with the drinking

66
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:43.620
Marcus Ma: And then my early adult life. When I was about 20 I was introduced to Crystal Meth by a friend and then that that completely changed the landscape for me I as soon as I I was never I had tried marijuana before and I never really liked it and then

67
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.460
Marcus Ma: When I first time I tried crystal meth, I was in love and

68
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.700
Marcus Ma: It made me feel the way that I always wanted to feel and

69
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.250
Marcus Ma: I just always felt very, very comfortable in my own skin.

70
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:18.480
Marcus Ma: When I was high and so for the last since then. So the last 25 years or so I've been kind of struggling off and on. I go through phases where I've never been, I've never been a daily user

71
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:27.060
Marcus Ma: But I go through phases where all us for a while and then it just, it gets to the point where it's unbearable. And then I stopped.

72
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.860
Marcus Ma: And I would say the last 10 years

73
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.890
Marcus Ma: And it's been a struggle for me.

74
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.800
Marcus Ma: And

75
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:50.730
Marcus Ma: You know, I, I've been raising raising my daughter as a single parent pretty much her whole life. Her mom is also an active addict and

76
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.860
Marcus Ma: And

77
00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:03.630
Marcus Ma: It's got to the point where she's, she's no longer in my daughter's life. So for the most part. And so I've been raising her pretty much my whole life. And so that's kind of kept me

78
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:11.670
Marcus Ma: Sober. A lot of the time but but there are times when I've kind of checked out for a while for the weekend or something like that and

79
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.630
Marcus Ma: And so just it got to the point where

80
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:43.530
Marcus Ma: A few years ago I I finally took the recommendation of friends and a sponsor and I checked into inpatient rehab. I did a year, a year at the Salvation Army and Oakland. And after that I was I was sober for over two years, but still struggling with the sexual behaviors which

81
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.950
Marcus Ma: have progressed into

82
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.830
Marcus Ma: Prostitution

83
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.790
Marcus Ma: You know trolling for

84
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:01.920
Marcus Ma: For an awesome. You know, like just anonymous sex hookups and that bars chat rooms.

85
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.570
Marcus Ma: Date, you know, dating sites that kind of thing.

86
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.940
Marcus Ma: And

87
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:25.530
Marcus Ma: And it's kind of the myth, the Matthews and and the sexual behaviors have kind of become coupled to where you know I was sober for a couple years on the math, but I was I was still acting out sexually there regularly.

88
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.120
Marcus Ma: And

89
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:35.610
Marcus Ma: And then eventually it just, you know, a got to the point where it's just not, it's not as

90
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.230
Marcus Ma: It's not as enjoyable without the math. So

91
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.740
Marcus Ma: Last year, November I finally finally relapsed with the math.

92
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.540
Marcus Ma: And then

93
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.520
Marcus Ma: I kept trying to get get back on track. Working with working with a sponsor.

94
00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:06.180
Marcus Ma: And I ended up from November to February I had three relapses which were all pretty bad. And the last one lasted about a week and

95
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.890
Marcus Ma: And I had

96
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:19.140
Marcus Ma: family members and friends from church ended up inner intervening and were able to kind of help me to

97
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:39.150
Marcus Ma: To kind of break out of the cycle and and to follow through with getting some getting some some new help. And that's why I was able to find the bright heart and I started on the medications. First time I've taken medication.

98
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:48.240
Marcus Ma: And so the the progress for me has been good. The last month and I know there's still a lot for me to do.

99
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:57.060
John Reinhart: Yeah, if I could just kind of rephrase what you're saying is that this has been ongoing for quite some time and

100
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:11.070
John Reinhart: And it's been a pure battle for over 20 years and and and really got intensified the past six months or so then you had a personal intervention and

101
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:30.540
John Reinhart: You've gone through programs. So the one in Oakland and everything like that for the substance abuse and that was okay but it's kind of a correlation with the the the crystal meth and the sex addiction and it just kind of multiplies on top of one another. And may it makes it really

102
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.750
John Reinhart: To where it's all encompassing and and it's it's it's obsessive

103
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:45.690
John Reinhart: It's on your mind all the time or whatever are fixated and you're chasing just like chasing the drug chasing the sex and everything.

104
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:53.670
John Reinhart: So you know what the church. It sounds to me like with the church, you're, you're familiar with the Christian base.

105
00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:13.320
John Reinhart: There's a conquer series by pure desire ministry. I don't know if you're familiar with them. But that's one that people that the church that I go to have had real good success with guys that have been battling pornography for a long time. I've been

106
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:30.810
John Reinhart: You know, accountability and all that type of stuff. It's, it's really, it's, it's been really fruitful forum talked to a buddy about that last night, I said the DVD series is me, like, it was like 300 bucks. It's a little spending, but he says it was worth it.

107
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.140
John Reinhart: And then also, I was thinking of

108
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:45.180
John Reinhart: The in the rooms. Now that you don't you know the can't go out, you know, the social isolating and everything, which probably is pretty good thing for

109
00:13:45.840 --> 00:14:02.250
John Reinhart: For you and and and and and for a lot of people I don't mind it man. I'm good. When you get older, sometimes you don't mind isolated, you know it's it's perfectly okay but but the in the rooms app. Are you familiar with that.

110
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:03.960
John Reinhart: Marcus.

111
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.600
Marcus Ma: I'm not know

112
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.860
John Reinhart: Okay, what that what that app is all about. It's, it's

113
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.050
John Reinhart: It has

114
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.200
John Reinhart: Just like what we're doing here. It's

115
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:30.990
John Reinhart: Tella conferencing for a in a depression, bipolar Gamblers Anonymous sex addict addiction. It has all those type of things there. So,

116
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:43.530
John Reinhart: That might be a resource you want to check out and then maybe find yourself a sponsor there somebody that you know that you, you know, can really relate to and free up

117
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:54.420
John Reinhart: With and and have somebody that can hold you accountable and you, you know, and, you know, the whole thing about 12 steps. It's all about accountability and one day at a time and and all that.

118
00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:01.320
John Reinhart: So just some suggestions right there. So check out that in the rooms and

119
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:14.220
John Reinhart: I know na has you can go to the NAIA national hotline number two, and they have they'll they can they can help you find a sponsor. If you're having trouble doing that.

120
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.730
John Reinhart: So that might be something you want to look into.

121
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.910
John Reinhart: All right, let me ask you some more questions.

122
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:32.880
John Reinhart: You kind of covered some is where you're kind of going along their markets, but when were you first exposed. I guess when you said your start drinking around 15 years old are

123
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.750
Marcus Ma: You. I started drinking. I was, I was like 15

124
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.160
Marcus Ma: Okay.

125
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.390
All right.

126
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:47.310
John Reinhart: How did you kind of mentioned how progressed and everything. How went from the drinking to when you got

127
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:54.360
John Reinhart: Smoking pot. I'm with you on that one. I've never been a big, you know, for the pot thing but but

128
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.060
John Reinhart: From what I understand the math is

129
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:09.690
John Reinhart: Is really the most hideous of all because it just, it just takes takes over, you know, and I'm so glad to hear that this medication you're taking helping you out.

130
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.560
John Reinhart: When was that the worst for you.

131
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.720
John Reinhart: Do you have any specific time, you could think what it was really the worst.

132
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.680
Marcus Ma: Um, well, I mean,

133
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.830
Marcus Ma: I would say the two times the two times that I can think of.

134
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.270
Marcus Ma: A month ago that last week.

135
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:47.700
Marcus Ma: I really, I really felt I I I recognized how enthralled I was to to the drugs and and the compulsion.

136
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.570
Marcus Ma: It was it was scary because I could see that I was out of control and each day.

137
00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:04.770
Marcus Ma: I kept trying to like break free and it was like I was. It was like being in quicksand. It was like the harder I tried to break free. I think the deeper right sank.

138
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:14.130
Marcus Ma: Into it and I was afraid that I was going to wake up one day and I just wasn't going to care anymore and I wasn't even going to try

139
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:38.310
Marcus Ma: I think you know through this through these decades of struggles that I've had, I've, I've always tried to overcome. And I think that last week there. I could really see myself kind of slipping away my sanity and my desire to to fulfill my you know my responsibilities as a parent and

140
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:51.360
Marcus Ma: You know, to my employer and and to myself and just, you know, the people that they care about me that I have relationships with I was really, I was really check it out and

141
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.210
Marcus Ma: I would say that that was probably one of the worst times and and

142
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:07.110
Marcus Ma: And it was different. It was different than the other worst time that I can think of really bad time. I can think of was right before I got into rehab.

143
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:24.750
Marcus Ma: Because I was I was suffering a lot from like paranoid paranoid schizophrenia delusions, I would have a lot of times for many years from the drug use. And when I would be coming down and trying to detox.

144
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:35.430
Marcus Ma: You know, my, my sanity would really, really crack and and i was scary to continue to go through that.

145
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.220
Marcus Ma: scenario of paranoia.

146
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.280
Marcus Ma: For some reason this last after being sober for a couple years. And then when I relapsed I didn't have that same experience anymore.

147
00:18:47.850 --> 00:19:08.730
Marcus Ma: And that, that in and of itself was scary because it almost made it easier to the following relapses that I had after that first one they. It was almost like they came easier because I wasn't afraid of the consequences so much and and I think that's why this last time.

148
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.030
Marcus Ma: That I relapse. It was really scary because I can really feel my

149
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.060
Marcus Ma: Sense of like self control just totally just totally disintegrating.

150
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:37.650
John Reinhart: Well, yeah, it's, it's, but, you know, just to have that awareness of it and not just be totally lost like a lot of people we see out there. You know, I've had one client in my last group that she's in a tent.

151
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:45.660
John Reinhart: And we were doing a gratitude. At the end of the group. And she said she lost nine people this past week, friends of hers on the street.

152
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:56.160
John Reinhart: That have passed away that totally given up hope. And just, you know, or and she's. Fortunately, she's just gotten into the program but or circumstances is where she is right now.

153
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:05.850
John Reinhart: She just keeps you know trying to keep yourself protected, but thank goodness you you have a job you've been able to to be able to cope and manage and work.

154
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:13.680
John Reinhart: You know what I mean. Through through the addictions and everything that you've dealt with so so that's huge, but

155
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:21.030
John Reinhart: Just to be aware of that to have that self conscious to know where you were and where you're at right now and where you want to go.

156
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:31.980
John Reinhart: And and that's where I think a really good therapist is going to be super helpful for you once you know get that all figured out. And what's going to be just right for you. You know, Marcus.

157
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.790
John Reinhart: Let's see. Let me ask you a few more questions here.

158
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:46.470
John Reinhart: You don't suffer from any chronic pain right. Do you have any issues with chronic pain. Okay, now growing up. What was your family life like

159
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:57.300
Marcus Ma: Um, I mean there was there was a lot of tension. I can, I can see now after you know working through

160
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.100
Marcus Ma: The recovery process for so many years and doing a lot of inventories and, you know, I've worked with therapist before and

161
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:20.700
Marcus Ma: So my my conclusion of my family life. I think my, my mother, I think, was was very depressed, all the time. I had a father that that definitely had an anger management issue.

162
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.660
Marcus Ma: There was a lot of toxic toxic rage.

163
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.690
Marcus Ma: From him on a regular basis.

164
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:38.820
Marcus Ma: And you know I had very high expectations were put on me and I never felt like I could I could live up to those so I

165
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.100
Marcus Ma: I suffered from a lot of insecurity and

166
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:54.810
Marcus Ma: Lack of self, self worth. And, you know, and all that. All that also was and it was kind of counterbalanced

167
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.100
Marcus Ma: With with moments of

168
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.890
Marcus Ma: Of love. I guess my mom, although

169
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:13.650
Marcus Ma: You know she was suffering from a lot of things I don't even think she was aware of she she expressed a lot of love to me.

170
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:22.980
Marcus Ma: And so, yeah, it's, it's kind of a mixed bag for me. I was, I was pretty miserable. Most of the time.

171
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:38.790
Marcus Ma: Mm hmm. But there are there are some aspects of of my family life growing up that that I do cherish you know my mom. My mom passed away several years ago unexpectedly and

172
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:52.950
Marcus Ma: Her and I didn't have the greatest relationship, the last few years of her life. And she had a hard time dealing with dealing with my challenges and never really quite knew how how to help me.

173
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.520
Marcus Ma: But, you know, I've kind of

174
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:05.010
Marcus Ma: I've come to grips with with all that stuff. And I've experienced a lot of, you know, forgiveness.

175
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.670
Marcus Ma: Imperfections and others and

176
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:20.730
Marcus Ma: forgiveness for myself to for just, you know, making my way as best I can, through life and trying to figure things out and doing it in perfectly

177
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.430
Marcus Ma: You know,

178
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:36.570
John Reinhart: That's a huge step Marcus i i think forgiveness is the key to kind of move on in life and stuff people, you know, they'll take that ownership of failure and and screwing up and everything and

179
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:50.310
John Reinhart: And just to realize that you're forgiven you know that you can forgive other people that have hurt you and and vice versa. And you know that close your work in the steps and stuff but

180
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:57.960
John Reinhart: Thank you. It sounds like your folks were together though, you're like in the house. Do you have any siblings.

181
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:04.530
Marcus Ma: Yeah, I have. I have an older brother and a younger brother and a younger sister. Okay.

182
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.820
All right.

183
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.240
John Reinhart: Did any anyone in your home life struggle with mental health, substance abuse or food issues.

184
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.160

186
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:35.190
Marcus Ma: Yeah i i think i think my mother was definitely suffering from depression, she was. She struggled with with her weight and eating issues her whole life health issues, diabetes, she struggled with.

187
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:48.780
Marcus Ma: Being like a compulsive shopper overspending and you know a great deal of debt monetary debt.

188
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:51.810
Marcus Ma: And

189
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.220
Marcus Ma: Yeah, like I said, you know, my dad, he, he definitely had an anger. Anger management issue.

190
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.400
Marcus Ma: He has he has epilepsy and he's on a medication that I know kind of affects

191
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.810

192
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:20.040

Marcus Ma: Actually live with him right

197
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.200
Marcus Ma: And he's he's been helping me for many years, kind of get on my feet.

198
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.250
Awesome.

199
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.260
Marcus Ma: And yeah, I mean we we still have conflicts but over we're

200
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.170
Marcus Ma: All ears up. We all got our issues, man. You know what I mean.

201
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.190
Marcus Ma: Yeah.

202
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.830
John Reinhart: You guys are working through it, you know.

203
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:59.910
Marcus Ma: Yeah, we, we, you know, over the last few years, I've just kind of learned to let stuff go, I've learned it to let him be be who he is and I don't

204
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.670
Marcus Ma: I don't, I don't get into it with him. Like, I can see the conflict starting to kind of

205
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.450
Marcus Ma: Kind of rear rear its ugly head I

206
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.570
Marcus Ma: Kind of take a step back, usually sometimes all sometimes I'll get into it with him, but

207
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:24.360
Marcus Ma: You know and i think i think he's he's progressed a great deal over the last many years to so

208
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:37.260
John Reinhart: Awesome. Well, that's that's key. I mean, a lot of people. His in my age, are you know if they're using they've heard that thing where the

209
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:46.410
John Reinhart: The, you know, your brain never really matures is trying to get stunted, like you say you start drinking at 15 and you keep drinking and that's been your whole life.

210
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:59.100
John Reinhart: Well, your, your cognitive thinking is kind of stuck as a 15 year old, no matter if you're 45 or 85, you know, and I mean it's just like you have your routines. You have your things and

211
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:08.490
John Reinhart: And it's not for me to say who's right or wrong. I mean, if the works if people are functional and stuff. And that's the way they want to live. It's not for me but

212
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:23.760
John Reinhart: To say that that's wrong, but at the same time I'm say life can be a lot better man when you know you you get the help that you need and you could grow and mature and stuff like that at some of that brain science that I learned, going back to school.

213
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.620
John Reinhart: Let's see.

218
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.200

219
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.050
Marcus Ma: We used to shop list magazines. When we were teenagers.

220
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.400

Marcus Ma: We got into it. Around the same time, I was about 12 and

227
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.220
John Reinhart: Powerful

228
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.590
John Reinhart: Process. It's a process addiction, you know, I mean, and I think just the substance abuse just

229
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.750
John Reinhart: Just compounds, it

230
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.700
Marcus Ma: Yeah, my two cents worth

231
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.030
John Reinhart: Let's see, this is a what was school like for you.

232
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.940

234
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:08.130

235
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.620
Marcus Ma: I did well in school, up until about high school and then I

236
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.380
Marcus Ma: I was, I was a stellar underachiever.

237
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:38.850
Marcus Ma: In high school, and even though I was in, I was putting honors classes and AP classes and stuff like that. I just did the bare minimum to get by. I could have. I could have been really, really successful but i i didn't tap into it. And yeah, I was just, I was I was

238
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.610
Marcus Ma: cripplingly

239
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.240
Marcus Ma: shy and

240
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.300
Marcus Ma: But I had friends.

241
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:57.570
Marcus Ma: And now my first girlfriend. So I was a senior in high school. And that's because she she pursued me and

242
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.420
Marcus Ma: Yeah, I was. I was generally just just pretty miserable and never felt

243
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.560
Marcus Ma: Never felt satisfied with my performance on any level.

244
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:09.450
Well,

245
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:11.790
John Reinhart: That's

246
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.460
John Reinhart: Just to have that awareness and everything is is something else. How

247
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.310
John Reinhart: How far did you complete in your education. How many what grade. Where did you complete

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.090
Marcus Ma: That the junior college level.

251
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:55.860
John Reinhart: Yeah. You know, I think once you find what your passion. I was an agribusiness for over 30 years after I got out of the military.

252
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:13.770
John Reinhart: Use my GI bill and went to San Diego State myself and partied pretty much the whole time, you know, for business degree but I went back to school after I retired from the flower business. I know this is about you, but I got to share a little bit about nice

253
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:19.680
John Reinhart: Yeah I you know I had a passion to help people out that because I had a lot of buddies.

254
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:31.380
John Reinhart: You know, big time with addiction problems and and you know I back in the day. I love to drink you know i i had my issues with drinking alcohol and stuff so I pursued and got a

255
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:40.500
John Reinhart: California certificate to be a counselor. So, you know, it's never too late to go back to school, as you know, you know, and it's once you find

256
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:52.710
John Reinhart: Your passion Marcus. If that's your desire to do that or if it's to clean pools or work on poles or whatever. That's cool. But yeah i mean it's it's cool that I'm able to do this, you know,

257
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.580
Marcus Ma: Absolutely yeah pools pools are definitely not my passion.

258
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:11.790
Marcus Ma: No, I, I've actually I've actually been wanting to go back to school and and get a degree in counseling. I'd like to, I'd like to become an addiction counselor, but it'd

259
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.720
Marcus Ma: Be fantastic

260
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.790
Marcus Ma: I have to, I have to, I have to take care of myself first though.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.370
Marcus Ma: Is one of my professors to help anybody else.

262
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:27.540
John Reinhart: side of the street, clean, you know. Yeah. To clean yourself up first before you know take your own self care and help

263
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:37.320
John Reinhart: That I know that I know that you'll be a great counselor, I would suggest the addictive disorder studies courses at your junior college

264
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:51.390
John Reinhart: Get your fast. I'm sure you're familiar with that federal aid package you take like 12 units you get around five when I took it. I got I think 50 $200 a semester and

265
00:32:52.740 --> 00:33:04.500
John Reinhart: And that would get kind of get you into step in the you know the right direction and everything. And there's a high demand for counselors with people with issues like you know a lot of people are struggling out there so

266
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.910
John Reinhart: Okay, just a couple of questions left here.

267
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.380
John Reinhart: Do you struggle with any learning disabilities.

268
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.710
Marcus Ma: Now, well, I mean,

269
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.730
Marcus Ma: I don't, I

270
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:24.030
Marcus Ma: I think, I think I have a thick, thick skull. I don't know if that's an official learning disability but

271
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:31.830
Marcus Ma: That's, I have to, I have to do something the wrong way 1000 times before I before I learned better

272
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:43.230
John Reinhart: Yeah, I hear you on that. Were there any events that stood out to you, growing up either in your neighborhood family or friends.

273
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:55.590
John Reinhart: I think that question right right there is more of like a trauma type of thing, you know, PTSD. Was there something that really kind of shook us a youngster that you can think of right now, kind of going way back

274
00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:03.660
Marcus Ma: Um, nothing, nothing specific that I can think of. I mean, I can definitely think of things traumatic, but I don't think anything really.

275
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.050
Marcus Ma: really affected me in a profound way.

276
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:13.560
John Reinhart: Right. Okay, let's see a couple more left here, did you serve in the military.

277
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:15.900
Marcus Ma: No, I did. Okay.

278
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:21.150
John Reinhart: Did You Do you have any financial or legal issues you're concerned about

279
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.380
Marcus Ma: Well, who does not

280
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.830
Marcus Ma: not not not not specifically. I mean, I

281
00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:35.370
Marcus Ma: I've been doing pretty good. The last month before that I was I was blowing all my all my money.

282
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.600
Marcus Ma: But, uh, I've kind of got that all under control now.

283
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:44.520
John Reinhart: Excellent, excellent. Are you in a relationship right now.

284
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.530
Marcus Ma: Um, I, I think I'm trying to be

285
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.410
Marcus Ma: Yeah, I have.

286
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.390
John Reinhart: A you're on a good wavelength with them.

287
00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:04.260
Marcus Ma: Well, I, yeah, I mean, I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes we are, and sometimes we really aren't so I she's, she's stuck with me the last couple years.

288
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:05.790
John Reinhart: Wow.

289
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:15.180
Marcus Ma: Even through my struggles and we were we were just trying to be friends for a while, and she was one of the main people that showed up for me, a month ago.

290
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:28.530
Marcus Ma: And she knew that I really needed help. And she kind of she kind of Marshall, the troops and got people involved. And so last month. We've been we've been trying to work out.

291
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.920
Marcus Ma: The relationship, but she's, she's

292
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.660
Marcus Ma: As I've as I've kind of learned recently in some of my studies.

293
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.100
Marcus Ma: She's, she's definitely a co addict and

294
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:52.080
Marcus Ma: Dealing with codependency and she has her own trauma issues from her childhood and so they tend, we tend to kind of be like the perfect storm when things aren't

295
00:35:53.130 --> 00:36:00.360
Marcus Ma: When things aren't working. She can kind of push me off push me off the edge. And if I let her and

296
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.430
Marcus Ma: And and then sometimes I feel like

297
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.570
Marcus Ma: She's kind of like a stabilizing factor in my life. But I don't know.

298
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.370
Marcus Ma: I don't know if

299
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:19.050
John Reinhart: I think the reality of just being able to understand those those tendencies that we all have in everything. And that we're all as

300
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:32.190
John Reinhart: Professor said that we all are idiosyncratic, you know, we all have our quirks and things about us that can rub people raw or or whatever and but but just to learn

301
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:43.410
John Reinhart: Learn those type of things in and I tell you what it sounds to me, even though you know she has her things are sticking with us, is she, she says.

302
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:52.290
John Reinhart: Sounds like a pretty awesome woman, you know, to me, even with all those, but we're all got flawed character flaws. We've got to work on or, you know,

303
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.660
John Reinhart: That's just my two cents worth

304
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:54.990
There.

305
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.850

316
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:45.210
John Reinhart: And this again is this is a Christian based thing but it's you might have heard it. It's called

317
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.670
