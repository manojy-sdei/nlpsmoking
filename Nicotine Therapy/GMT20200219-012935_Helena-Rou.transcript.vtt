Brian Riley: Either a few weeks ago.

19
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.060
Brian Riley: About two weeks ago, I started to do. I just, I, I'm kind of glad I caught myself.

20
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.280
Brian Riley: I've since committed to a 1990 and have

21
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.530
Brian Riley: Geez. I didn't know

22
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.530
Brian Riley: That was

23
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.910
Brian Riley: On the 29th.

24
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.790
Brian Riley: So, yeah.

25
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.400
Brian Riley: Yeah, yeah. So that's what about

26
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.900
Brian Riley: Tonight.

27
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.040
Brian Riley: Me.

28
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.340
Brian Riley: And I've been good good is like, I'm really, you know, being very strict with myself about it.

29
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.460
Brian Riley: There was one I missed. And then I did to the next day, kind of thing and

30
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.480
Brian Riley: I've stepped up the call and the sponsor every morning is one of my morning, you know, things are calling before noon.

31
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.970
Brian Riley: And I really had to find meetings that are like, you know, so I switched up

32
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.280
Brian Riley: The meetings and sought out. I was just starting to, you know, that'll that'll stop.

33
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.460
Brian Riley: Getting resentments and

34
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:25.080
Brian Riley: And it was just not. It wasn't Groovy anymore. You know, I was really struck me as or behavior and childish bullshit.

35
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.550
Brian Riley: And

36
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.300
Brian Riley: I, you know,

37
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.240
Brian Riley: I was, you know, down to like going to to to or then

38
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:48.300
Brian Riley: You know, one a week. And if I missed that one. And I was, I was replacing meetings with with these therapies and saying, well, this counts and

39
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.570
Brian Riley: And I can do that. So I've

40
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.070
Brian Riley: Kind of stepped everything up and and i think

41
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.680
Brian Riley: It's definitely had a you know a positive

42
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:03.690
Brian Riley: Impact

43
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.200
Brian Riley: And also because we got this new client right around the same time I'm

44
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.910
Brian Riley: Very high maintenance three dogs very well off people she's a

45
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.360
Brian Riley: She's the head of staff for

49
00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:07.770
Brian Riley: They have like you know the fucking Porsche and a big silver Batman, you know, SUV and three dogs that are not referring to in any way as dogs.

50
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.530
Helena Rouhe: There, people are

51
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.900
Brian Riley: Not did they go so

52
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.450
Helena Rouhe: Far as to call them people or do they just say their

53
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.770
Helena Rouhe: By their name kinda

54
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.760
Brian Riley: They are often referred to as

55
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.920
Brian Riley: Evening.

56
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.540
Brian Riley: Never, never, dogs, though.

57
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.340
Brian Riley: And it's, you know, who poops where when

58
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.490
Brian Riley: You know, the, the food is like this three part

59
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:50.580
Brian Riley: Thing with this powder and the fucking, you know, based on what the stool is if there's if rice powder goes in it and

60
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:57.570
Brian Riley: They were we had agreed to disclose this big thing with us or an eye.

61
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.550
Brian Riley: Because she thought that we would become sort of their, you know, sort of slaves to them.

62
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.120
Brian Riley: It was started, we agreed initially to three visits a day, which is a

63
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:27.120
Brian Riley: Thorough about eight minutes away. And then before beginning they started to shift a thing where now it was for visits fucking and be there all the time, you know, and then

64
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.160
Brian Riley: We negotiated it, they were they were going to pay money was an issue.

65
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.750
Brian Riley: So now we're at three visits a day morning, afternoon, and night and Esther and I split it.

66
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.350
Brian Riley: But it's changed.

67
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:54.990
Brian Riley: My income my weekly beyond boarding with just walks, it's doubled it you know like overnight.

68
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.540
Brian Riley: And but schedule wise it's packed.

69
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.700
Brian Riley: And

70
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:16.170
Brian Riley: I was I was getting very resentful. And there was a stretch of like rain cold awfulness, you know, and I was just giving the shitty place.

71
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.060
Brian Riley: And

72
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.210
Brian Riley: And I had never hit that place before with this job, you know,

73
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.170
Brian Riley: And it felt like a job if you know i was i was getting pissed off and

74
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.120
Brian Riley: So I just had to make some changes like that and

75
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.520
Brian Riley: It was good because I guess I saw the red flags, you know,

76
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.230
Brian Riley: And

77
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.040
Brian Riley: Everything is like really good and I was able to

78
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.670
Brian Riley: Everything is very tightly scheduled

79
00:09:52.830 --> 00:10:02.550
Brian Riley: In the morning. This is kind of a new thing over the past two weeks. The first thing I do like my first time slot is my ship. So, all right.

80
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.140
Brian Riley: Yes.

81
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.460
Brian Riley: And then during the walks out I'll work on the poems

82
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.860
Brian Riley: And then when my work day is done, I'm done. I got I'm not writing or drawing or or anything.

83
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.340
Brian Riley: And I, this is all correlated to tomorrow I turned 50 I think I'm realizing that it's

84
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.950
Brian Riley: all connected.

85
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.450
Brian Riley: You know,

86
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.360
Helena Rouhe: So in the past. You've made a big deal about your birthday. Do you feel like you're kind of

87
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.430
Helena Rouhe: Reflection. And all of that is pulling all this together. Is that how this is

88
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.780
Brian Riley: Connected or what it

89
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.000
Helena Rouhe: When you say is connected. What do you mean

90
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.260
Brian Riley: Yeah, I think, I think. So Paul, I think. Yeah. Like, um,

91
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.580
Brian Riley: I I have felt for some time for some years. And especially, probably the past year, in particular.

92
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.610
Brian Riley: That 50

93
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:16.650
Brian Riley: Because, I mean, I think the most telling is that, you know, my goal is to have a publishing deal by my 55th birthday. So I've always felt

94
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:25.590
Brian Riley: Not always, but like I said past couple years. That was a landmark sort of

95
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.600
Brian Riley: You know, with everything that's fallen into place, you know, between you guys and

96
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.290
Brian Riley: My program and sobriety and

97
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.040
Brian Riley: The career and the House and the

98
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.050
Brian Riley: Mate, and just everything having fallen in a place, it seems like now.

99
00:11:47.580 --> 00:12:01.350
Brian Riley: I'm really looking to have it all kind of come together in the way that it was intended to be which is a fucking happy life not enough. You know, you know, I'm, you know, not happy. But like

100
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.870
Brian Riley: Let's, let's do it all together. Now, you know, and so this is where we got this is and this is it and and

101
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.780
Brian Riley: I've been very grateful.

102
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.420
Brian Riley: And

103
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:17.820
Brian Riley: It's

104
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.560
Brian Riley: It's

105
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:32.910
Brian Riley: In looking at it all. I saw that all I needed to do was let it all happen as I've been setting it all up. Now let's just

106
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.640
Brian Riley: Let it go into motion.

107
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.940
Brian Riley: And it feels like it has without much

108
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:49.650
Brian Riley: Struggle or effort if I just, if I just let it be and let it go as and I've been meditating.

109
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:59.880
Brian Riley: For fucking four minutes and four seconds increase by day, almost every day.

110
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:11.340
Brian Riley: And usually, at the end of the dogs, I'm able to sit and whatever meditating is going to be. It's going to be whatever it is and just looking for you. Like you taught me.

111
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.030
Brian Riley: For four minutes with my eyes closed and

112
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.920
Brian Riley: Visualize

113
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.740
Brian Riley: And that for now is meditating and it's works.

114
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.880
Brian Riley: And shifts for it's going to turn

115
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.960
Helena Rouhe: That fantastic what

116
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:51.360
Helena Rouhe: Just kind of going back to when you were sharing about that you would have sessions and count that as meetings and then realized that that wasn't really working for you. What do you think were the indicators to kind of help you have a different

117
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:59.490
Helena Rouhe: Thought process about your behavior so that you could shift gears and do things to you know

118
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.560
Helena Rouhe: engage in activities that allows you to support and recovery differently.

119
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.730
Brian Riley: When wait said so.

120
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:20.640
Helena Rouhe: So it's not as if you were doing anything wrong by having therapy sessions. Angela group session and then counting that as a meeting, but

121
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:29.490
Helena Rouhe: There was something going on for you. Were you had an awareness than that, hey, I'm kind of saying one thing and this isn't really working for me.

122
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:35.610
Helena Rouhe: I'm you know I'm you didn't say this, but something along the lines of, I'm going to call bullshit.

123
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:48.630
Helena Rouhe: And I need to be doing more meetings or I need to be doing. So I'm just kind of curious what what kind of awareness. Did you have there, because again, nothing wrong with doing therapy. But I agree with you that it's not

124
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:59.070
Helena Rouhe: A one to one. So just to kind of understand your thought process process and do a little learning from Monday night quarterbacking Oh, can you hear me.

125
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.590
Brian Riley: Yep. Yeah.

126
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:10.230
Helena Rouhe: So I'm just doing a little Monday night quarterbacking with you just to get a sense of, kind of, because I think that that was the right choice. And so I'm just curious because there was a

127
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.490
Brian Riley: Time period where you were.

128
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:21.630
Helena Rouhe: Like, oh no, it's fine. My can do this and I didn't want to be argumentative because I think that it will again. You weren't doing anything wrong, but maybe splitting hairs thing, you know.

129
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.010
Yeah.

130
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:34.680
Brian Riley: I think that these, you know, when I was looking at it was like, okay, there's a couples counseling. Then there's group therapy and then there's one on one with you and then

131
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.910
Brian Riley: It was

132
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.260
Brian Riley: That, you know, though they were healthy, healthy

133
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.340
Brian Riley: It just seemed yet again.

134
00:15:51.420 --> 00:16:04.530
Brian Riley: I was making. I was rationalizing and making exceptions for what I know to be true is that when I stopped fucking going to meetings and when I stopped talking to my sponsor and when I

135
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:17.730
Brian Riley: Because talking to you guys is not talking to my sponsor and if it's not a commitment. It's those three things. And I'm like, how many will have to learn this, you know, before and it's like, I can't. I can't.

136
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:29.370
Brian Riley: I so it just, it was like, you know, if you're and that's why it was like, because that 90 and 90 thing exists that seemed to be

137
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.640
Brian Riley: Clean the answer to it right

138
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.720
Brian Riley: It wasn't like

139
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:46.920
Brian Riley: Because I, you know, I used to do that with fucking drinking. So it's like it's all just drink on weekends and then Friday is a weekend and then Thursday because Friday and all that bullshit is like I could do that with anything and

140
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:58.200
Brian Riley: And then I wasn't even been doing therapy that much. And so I didn't even have that as an excuse. And so, and then looking back, as I was that fucking one meetings week

141
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:08.700
Brian Riley: How why because of because of the dogs ran late and because of this man because he's not a meeting at this time and all this bullshit. It's like just stopped. You know, it's like

142
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.650
Brian Riley: So,

143
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.960
Helena Rouhe: And now when you start

144
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.400
Brian Riley: rationalizing yeah

145
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.840
Brian Riley: Yeah.

146
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:24.060
Helena Rouhe: When you start rationalizing and making exceptions. So those are kind of your warning signs, if you will, because I think

147
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:34.320
Helena Rouhe: It's important for us to understand right and that's how we understand we learn by doing. And we go through and so now you're starting to identify that when you start to rationalize and or

148
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:45.960
Helena Rouhe: Start kind of making exceptions to your, to your understanding of how you want to live your life through. Then you're going to get yourself in trouble. At some point,

149
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:57.450
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. And the sooner you have awareness, the sooner you can do something about it. And I think the more you develop the repertoire of what are you going to do, so it's not always going to be 90 meetings in 90 days it's

150
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.420
Helena Rouhe: Going to be did I meditate today. Did I

151
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.440
Helena Rouhe: You know,

152
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:09.630
Helena Rouhe: Balance. How is my schedule balance. What kind of things that I not balanced or what kind of things did I kind of cut corners on

153
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:20.760
Helena Rouhe: So that now at this point for the last two days three days a week, or even just the last five hours. I'm feeling shortchanged and and hurried and scattered and whatever. So

154
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:30.300
Helena Rouhe: I mean, life is an ongoing pursuit of balance. So it's not like you're going to get this figured out, and then live life. You're going to do this for the rest of your life.

155
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.620
Brian Riley: But now you've developed a

156
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:42.090
Helena Rouhe: Better understanding of what it means to do this and have a more balanced life. And I think those are really great great indicators of things to watch for because, to your point about this.

157
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:53.100
Helena Rouhe: The dog thing and how you're spending time with it. You have mentioned in the past. Not that it became a job, but that you became kind of worried

158
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:05.310
Helena Rouhe: Testers maybe even is the word you use, but certainly kind of fixated on the money that you were making a making it a productive money maker for you because it was successful. It is something that is

159
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:15.510
Helena Rouhe: Kind of your own. And so there was some time when you were really kind of focusing on that and then distracted by other things prioritizing that over other stuff so

160
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:26.100
Helena Rouhe: This is now sounding like another version of that. And so maybe I'm being aware of. Are you making any exceptions to the rule.

161
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:36.720
Helena Rouhe: And are you rationalizing and maybe those are the things that then tell you. Yeah, it's really good money, but at the same time, at what cost, you know,

162
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.940
Helena Rouhe: So you can look at and we're just going to use that as an example. It sounds like you've already kind of come to

163
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:55.620
Helena Rouhe: Terms about it but you know just even any new client or anything where things were an element of anger, frustration starts to come into life looking at right away. Did I make any exceptions to the rule.

164
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.640
Helena Rouhe: Did I

165
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:10.950
Helena Rouhe: Start to kind of rationalize something so that you can be start back into a good place to start. And it's like, Okay, what I did was instead of meditating for five minutes I meditated for three or Wow, that really has an effect on x, y AMP z.

166
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:22.320
Helena Rouhe: So there are going to be some things where you can be like, yeah, today I did that, not the end of the world. But I don't want to develop that pattern, whereas there may be other things that wow I can't afford to not do.

167
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.720
Helena Rouhe: And here's the minimum I

168
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.800
Helena Rouhe: Need to do in order for me to have a balance day. Otherwise, if I don't do these things. It's really going to be a problem. And sometimes, life is

169
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:46.290
Helena Rouhe: Completely chaos and you don't have a choice but to just roll with that, but then you have to get right back on to let's let's let's not stay in chaos, you know, I'm out of the crisis. So now I gotta get back on track. Stay on my schedule, you know,

170
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.720
Brian Riley: And and what it all, and this has been for the past

171
00:20:53.850 --> 00:21:08.040
Brian Riley: Year, really, that every day. And then it was like every fucking day like all but it was discipline. It was the discipline thing is every day because I write down this prayer thing or whatever, you know,

172
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:14.880
Brian Riley: And every day. It was it came down to discipline and focus

173
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.810
Brian Riley: Because I'm very undisciplined

174
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.440
Brian Riley: You know, and it really started to to strike me like what felt walk by guide.

175
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.190
Brian Riley: The Joker movie.

176
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.530
Brian Riley: Hmm, I can't remember the last time I went three times. That is a brilliant

177
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.700
Helena Rouhe: Oh, you thought three times.

178
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.320
Brian Riley: Okay, paid for three times. Okay. I've never

179
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:54.060
Brian Riley: But I really love that movie. But I really had to look at exactly, you know, it was beyond performance and directing what exactly was it that I was connecting with and it was a chaos.

180
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:56.970
Brian Riley: Was

181
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.420
Brian Riley: Really, you know, like, like

182
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.940
Brian Riley: That like that you hear these drugs. Hey. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Hey,

183
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.310
Helena Rouhe: Don't, don't worry about it on my end like I i live in dog K

184
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.480
Helena Rouhe: Right now.

185
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.280
Brian Riley: Well, okay. All right.

186
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.950
Brian Riley: Hey,

187
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.320
Brian Riley: Hey rocky outside

188
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.260
Brian Riley: Outside. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

189
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.420
Brian Riley: Okay.

190
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:53.640
Brian Riley: Like everything that you're saying in terms of the three minutes to two minutes and 43 and it's

191
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.740
Brian Riley: You know, I had to acknowledge, I think, also, because the

192
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.840
Brian Riley: Fucking turning 50

193
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.520
Brian Riley: You know, I've really

194
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.260
Brian Riley: Always talking talked about this before and I think I've been working on this.

195
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.660
Brian Riley: I just had to learn all that, you know, like all the

196
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.850
Brian Riley: Rebel

197
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.700
Brian Riley: Bullshit. You know, so, and they're not that I'm

198
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.280
Brian Riley: Conforming but

199
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:36.780
Brian Riley: There was a string of. It's been a while since we've talked about string of between mistaken identity.

200
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.610
Brian Riley: And speeding tickets

201
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.460
Brian Riley: Security guards.

202
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.010
Brian Riley: And it was it came down to the way I looked

203
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.110
Brian Riley: A lot of times

204
00:23:53.250 --> 00:24:04.680
Brian Riley: Cops, I would turn around at 711 I turn around. There's fucking to cop standing near ready to arrest me and it was a mistake and I didn't think they thought it looked like this fucking guy Richard or something.

205
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.730
Brian Riley: And we were wearing the same thing, he said.

206
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.870
Brian Riley: So whoever this Richard person was

207
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.310
Brian Riley: I got the impression that he was maybe a homeless dude.

208
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:18.990
Brian Riley: And

209
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:27.960
Brian Riley: And an ester said, you know, a lot of times there's not much difference between you and like the guy on the corner.

210
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:39.150
Brian Riley: And that's not saying that, you know, a fuck. I'm a bomb. But, you know, enough with the tattered pants around the cuffs. And so I went out and

211
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:50.610
Brian Riley: Nutrients and stuff like that. Like, because I'm I live kind of weird if I'm going to go around the around with the metal pieces of shit like that on the ground.

212
00:24:51.930 --> 00:25:06.900
Brian Riley: You know, good thing I'm walking a dog, but sometimes not, if I'm walking his fucking people and I'm looking on the ground for metal pieces and I'm building this like, you know, Link. This fucking trinket staff. I'm a crazy person. You know, so it's like

213
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.760
Brian Riley: If I had to dress better really

214
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.160
Brian Riley: So that I'm more just centric rather than, you know, a fucking

215
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.790
Brian Riley: Mental person, you know, like, stuff like that.

216
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.010
Brian Riley: If I'm going to do certain things with my life.

217
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.980
Brian Riley: There's no reason why

218
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.550
Brian Riley: I shouldn't be.

219
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.520
Brian Riley: Respected and considered

220
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:44.910
Brian Riley: A part of the same society as all of these other people you know I

221
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.340
Brian Riley: Why do I have to look

222
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.470
Brian Riley: Like

223
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.210
Brian Riley: A panhandler didn't make sense.

224
00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:07.320
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, I'm just kind of blown away a little bit that you are getting to a point where you're able to reconcile this and not be rebellious and pissed off that this is something you need to do.

225
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.080
Helena Rouhe: That you're not staying in the

226
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.300
Helena Rouhe: Right.

227
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.250
Brian Riley: Yeah.

228
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:33.870
Helena Rouhe: I, I can appreciate the artist side of you wanting to just be the artist and let that be whatever it is, but unfortunately human nature is going to judge first and ask questions later. And I also think that it's not just how you dress but it's how we act and it's the energy you

229
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.440
Helena Rouhe: Put out

230
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:53.190
Helena Rouhe: Right. So, to your point, you can be eccentric and have the other things kind of pulled in are managed in a way where someone doesn't have to just then take one plus one plus one and make it three but can just go, Oh, interesting. And then leave it.

231
00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:03.000
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and and that can be annoying because you're needing to make those choices, but they are choices so

232
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.470
Brian Riley: That's the one thing to

233
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.970
Helena Rouhe: Focus on that you get to make that choice. Thankfully, so that you don't

234
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:22.080
Helena Rouhe: Have to just do one plus one plus one, because it has to be three, you can make a choice that you can be eccentric and you can enjoy that. And you can also present in a way that that doesn't mean that you're a homeless person or a troublemaker.

235
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.790
Brian Riley: That needs to be picked up every

236
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.740
Helena Rouhe: Time someone sneezes in your direction.

237
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:34.620
Helena Rouhe: Right now, and then he has to work through that whole process and and i think that no one can tell you that I mean

238
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:44.010
Helena Rouhe: People can give you that feedback. But until you have the opportunity to have that experience and work through that process and realize that this is what's going to happen.

239
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.110
Helena Rouhe: Then you have a choice to make.

240
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.690
Helena Rouhe: Do you want to keep allowing that to happen or

241
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.460
Helena Rouhe: Hey,

242
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.890
Brian Riley: Here's my deal with my gut instincts. Six months ago.

243
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:04.680
Brian Riley: And I think I started doing it was going in the other direction. I'll fucking show you. Yeah, I'll get this tattoo.

244
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.660
Brian Riley: And then I'm going to get this pierced.

245
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:12.540
Brian Riley: Event bullshit. You know, and I'm not fucking than that point. Is it, you know, it's like, That's, yeah.

246
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:12.900
Little

247
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:19.170
Brian Riley: My whole life. But that's how I felt. And I said, it's so self destruct, you know,

248
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.270
Brian Riley: She's gonna leave losing

249
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.470
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, but who are you really rebelling against right you're

250
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.180
Helena Rouhe: rebelling against your folks and you're

251
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:27.600
Brian Riley: Working

252
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:36.510
Helena Rouhe: Through that you know you're working against the system. But again, it doesn't matter if I give you all that insight or anybody else gives you that insight you have to be the one to

253
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.410
Brian Riley: Kind of go through the

254
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:47.190
Helena Rouhe: process a little bit and then see it and then go what WTF, and then kind of without being judgmental and beat yourself up and

255
00:28:47.190 --> 00:29:02.760
Helena Rouhe: Go to the cat of nine tails and now you're a terrible human thankfully didn't go there. That's good. And now it's like okay, I mean, how do I want to live my life. How do I want to be viewed all those things are, are, you know, a part of it.

256
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:20.910
Brian Riley: And and as it's something came to mind, which is something that I believe, and I've been living kind of grown with in a, you know, oftentimes it will come down to do I want to be right or do I want to be happy.

257
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.790
Brian Riley: You know with kind of with arguments and conversations and other people and all this stuff is like

258
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.550
Brian Riley: You know, I just want to be happy. You know, I don't care. I'll be right in. The argument.

259
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:32.820
Yeah.

260
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.150
Brian Riley: And is like, why the fuck

261
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:49.590
Brian Riley: Am I being considered or looked at or treated as a fucking shoplifter in Barnes and Noble

262
00:29:51.480 --> 00:30:04.200
Brian Riley: Me and I had a look at that. Like, why, why, what the fuck right and I had to look at what I was wearing, you know, and as I don't even know. Yeah, of course, you know, with me.

263
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.300
Brian Riley: So yeah, so

264
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:27.300
Helena Rouhe: Okay, this is where I go back to that threshold in my book about respect and Burger King. You know, so I'm out with my old family friend and she puts on the scarf and wants to make herself presentable. And I'm like, we're going to Burger King for lunch. It's not for anybody else for you.

265
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:34.110
Helena Rouhe: Because she respects the fact that we were having lunch together. She wanted to be. She wanted to be presentable.

266
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:46.380
Helena Rouhe: And I had no word for that because that was completely dumbfounded, and it will resonate with me for the rest of my life. So it's not about being respectful to anybody else. It's about respecting yourself and respecting

267
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.130
Helena Rouhe: Your situation.

268
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:58.560
Helena Rouhe: You want to be in Barnes and Noble and enjoy it. And so you're going to present yourself in a way that you don't need to worry about somebody thinking at your shoplifter you also don't need to look like you just rolled in from

269
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.020
Helena Rouhe: You know, whatever.

270
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:11.340
Helena Rouhe: Like there's a way to do that that maintain your ability to be you, but also allows you to negotiate the world in a way that works for the world.

271
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.380
Brian Riley: Yeah.

272
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.540
Brian Riley: Yeah.

273
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.220
Helena Rouhe: Well, good. I

274
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:25.140
Brian Riley: Think we're going to talk about this, but for and I haven't really put it all together like this, but now it all makes sense.

275
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.970
Brian Riley: Which is why you know I enjoy

276
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.160
Brian Riley: Speaking with you.

277
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.820
Brian Riley: So there's a couple other things I want to talk about

278
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.230
Brian Riley: Them is very heavy

279
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:44.940
Brian Riley: But this one is Surprise, surprise, I was talking to George earlier we talked a lot

280
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.530
Brian Riley: Okay. Um, he fucking told tells me

281
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.690
Brian Riley: The news.

282
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.190
Brian Riley: But Dr. Waters.

283
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.120
Uh huh.

284
00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.760
Brian Riley: Which I don't know.

285
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:09.450
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, she's not dying, but sometimes people decide that programs are good fits and other times it's like you know maybe she wants to be retired. I don't know.

286
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.070
Brian Riley: But you know, it's all good.

287
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.900
Helena Rouhe: Relieving on a good note.

288
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.760
Brian Riley: Okay, I'm not concerned about now shall we shouldn't

289
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.160
Brian Riley: Make sure that himself into my

290
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:29.490
Brian Riley: Physiology and my medications and the intense operation G is running here is

291
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:32.550
Brian Riley: Going to do

292
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:44.580
Helena Rouhe: She's going to do a great job with transitions, who's going to make sure everybody has plenty of medicine refills for all the things that they need. You're on. You know, the list of people who are doing well and it says doing well for a long time.

293
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:51.240
Helena Rouhe: So, you are welcome to be concerned and certainly I would expect for you to have kind of a transition

294
00:32:51.840 --> 00:33:06.690
Helena Rouhe: Process, and I'm sure at some point, she's planning to talk to you about it, she's talking to everybody individually. She didn't make a big statement about it in group because we have new people who are coming in and she didn't want them to hear you. Hi. Come to group and now on leaving

295
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.580
Helena Rouhe: You know, because then that just means you know and so and I completely agree with that. So,

296
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:19.560
Helena Rouhe: You know she's rolling it out as she needs to roll it out and we're I'm wanting to make sure that whoever you know on our end fix

297
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:28.650
Helena Rouhe: That. So there's different groups. Right. So there's, there are people who've been in program for a long time, who have different needs than people who are brand new to program so

298
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:41.850
Helena Rouhe: I'm working with her and our medical director to make sure that whoever picks up the various aspects of her caseload are going to be able to do that easily enough and be feeling like a good fit for you and all that good stuff. So

299
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.220
Brian Riley: All right.

300
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.140
Brian Riley: So,

301
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.750
Brian Riley: We're just not that I needed yet. But let me get my organizer.

302
00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.160
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

303
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.380
Brian Riley: Alright, so it actually works out.

304
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.380
Brian Riley: med wise. I'm going to go to group next week.

305
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.300
Brian Riley: Which

306
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:25.350
Helena Rouhe: Just so happened yet. She will be there. She's gonna run group. I'm going to be in a conference. So she's running group without me next week, but

307
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.220
Brian Riley: Be there.

308
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.810
Brian Riley: Because I would go tomorrow. But as far as planning.

309
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.820
Brian Riley: And, you know,

310
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.590
Brian Riley: And you have an admin.

311
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.630
Helena Rouhe: To get you through to next week, you're good there.

312
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.890
Brian Riley: Yeah, I'm assuming. Yeah. And I, yeah, I have a referral on the Suboxone and then the

313
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.990
Brian Riley: soapland isn't due until the following week anyway okay. I'm okay.

314
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.610
Brian Riley: All right, now this one is a doozy.

315
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.690
Brian Riley: And I have not discussed this with I haven't discussed this.

316
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.220
Brian Riley: At all.

317
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.020
Brian Riley: But it's

318
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.930
Brian Riley: Not a problem that is

319
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.290
Brian Riley: It's just a

320
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:18.240
Brian Riley: It comes up now and again and I realize it in the long term. It's affecting

321
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.030
Brian Riley: More than it is Esther.

322
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.900
Brian Riley: And

323
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.350
Brian Riley: I didn't present it to you.

324
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.250
Brian Riley: Because it's

325
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.010
Brian Riley: Awful and it

326
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.070
Brian Riley: Wide open for judgment.

327
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.150
Brian Riley: But, and I

328
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.350
Brian Riley: You know, I'm sorry. It has come with a disclaimer, but it does. I think you know me.

329
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:06.660
Brian Riley: well enough to know what the truth that I that I know and asked her nose in my heart I give my heart of hearts.

330
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.780
Brian Riley: And during the in July.

331
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.630
Brian Riley: When I was on

332
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.230
Brian Riley: banjos and out of my mind. And we know that there's

333
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.220
Brian Riley: Gaps that I authentically

334
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.650
Brian Riley: Have no recollection of

335
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:37.650
Brian Riley: And there are conversations that have taken place and like text threads that I'm terrified to read

336
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.410
Brian Riley: And this goes back to some years ago when

337
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.110
Brian Riley: There's another personality.

338
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:47.850
Brian Riley: That

339
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.050
Brian Riley: presents itself.

340
00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:01.920
Brian Riley: And it really has. I'm just continually baffled. And I'm, I'm wondering

341
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.870
Brian Riley: You know, ultimately what you're what you're educated

342
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.260
Brian Riley: Opinion is on

343
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.590
Brian Riley: blackouts, as well as

344
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.040
Brian Riley: That sort of insane behavior.

345
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.540
Brian Riley: Because

346
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.370
Brian Riley: And I hope you believe me right when I want to say that

347
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.060
Brian Riley: Let's go back, like all the way back to when

348
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:45.750
Brian Riley: You know, some years ago when I was in a relationship with Esther and I was going to be moving in and her daughter.

349
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:56.880
Brian Riley: Was growing up and now she was like 1617 and she beautiful girl right and

350
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.650
Brian Riley: At no time.

351
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.470
Brian Riley: Even as what I understand, even in my subconscious.

352
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.780
Brian Riley: Would I

353
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.410
Brian Riley: Entertain

354
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.580
Brian Riley: Any sort of sexual feelings at all.

355
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:26.700
Brian Riley: Um, and, and I realized, too, and thinking about a dead, not even in my fantasy life.

356
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:33.450
Brian Riley: Through my teens onward. Has there ever been any sort of

357
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:46.800
Brian Riley: incest fantasies, or it's usually involves strangers usually not even people that I know.

358
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.350
Brian Riley: And

359
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:56.070
Brian Riley: When I it was a concern of mine prior to moving in, like, oh my god.

360
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:11.400
Brian Riley: I, you know, I've never had a daughter before and there's going to be the strange girl, and there were there were fears of like attraction. And what if, what if, and the relief when I was able to come here and

361
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:18.570
Brian Riley: There was nothing of that sort. So I love cat, as I do my son, Ian.

362
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.310
Brian Riley: Um,

363
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.700
Brian Riley: And never a

364
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.600
Brian Riley: Just hit so not me. Right.

365
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.790
Brian Riley: Apparently,

366
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:37.800
Brian Riley: I had

367
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.020
Brian Riley: spoken of.

368
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.390
Brian Riley: Cat.

369
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.680
Brian Riley: In a very sexual man to Esther.

370
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.740
Brian Riley: About cats sex life with her boyfriend.

371
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.350
Brian Riley: And even

372
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.420
Brian Riley: Me having sex with cap.

373
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.390
Helena Rouhe: Like as a fantasy or isn't something that actually happened.

374
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.460
Helena Rouhe: Like in the

375
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.770
Helena Rouhe: Conversation.

376
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:19.260
Brian Riley: It was kind of situation. Apparently we were in bed and now I have zero

377
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:27.480
Brian Riley: Idea and I cannot even fucking believe that I would ever say anything.

378
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.960
Brian Riley: And it was like

379
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.300
Brian Riley: I guess I had gone from

380
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.030
Brian Riley: wondering out loud. If cat had the same

381
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:58.800
Brian Riley: sexual desires and drive that Esther had and if you hand out with her boyfriend and Esther was never really clear on what were went to, but it was about

382
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:14.100
Brian Riley: Me somehow being sexually involved with cat before so I just pulled the plug on the whole thing and like left the conversation and and I guess I just gradually passed out.

383
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.970
Helena Rouhe: So did Esther ever notice anything

384
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:28.560
Helena Rouhe: Different in your demeanor or in the tone of your voice or in the way you interacted with her in these moments that you don't remember.

385
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:41.850
Helena Rouhe: Like when she was physically around you to see ever did. She has she ever made know to you about you physically kind of shifting a little bit or their tone changing or your

386
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.200
Brian Riley: She knows

387
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.980
Brian Riley: She is. She knows and that's

388
00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.960
Brian Riley: What often I'm very thankful. She knows when

389
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:58.830
Helena Rouhe: This other thing is going on. And is there just one or is there two or three or

390
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.290
Brian Riley: I don't know that I don't know. I would think I'd say

391
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.060
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

392
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.720
Brian Riley: And this this is to the level of like demonic possession

393
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.440
Brian Riley: Now this is where I've gone with it and I don't know.

394
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.620
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so you're, you're in luck.

395
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.970
Brian Riley: I happen to have

396
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.590
Brian Riley: an affinity for people who

397
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:25.350
Helena Rouhe: Struggle with this. I don't have any formal training, but I have had the opportunity to work with people who have

398
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.100
Helena Rouhe: So I was so when you initially said and saying, I kind of rolled my eyes and I think you had a physical reactions. It's

399
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.030
Helena Rouhe: Not insane.

400
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:45.690
Helena Rouhe: It's a defense mechanism. So people split off when they don't know how to handle life.

401
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.940
Helena Rouhe: Often it's from severe trauma.

402
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:55.590
Helena Rouhe: So it doesn't have to be severe trauma, but often severe trauma can create a split

403
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:06.240
Helena Rouhe: And so then there is the main persona and then there's often a split and it's rare that it. Do you need to plug in power.

404
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.960
Yeah.

405
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.310
Brian Riley: Okay.

406
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:08.820
Helena Rouhe: Take a minute.

407
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.780
Brian Riley: Okay, good.

408
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:27.570
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so most of the time when a split occurs. Often there are multiple fractures that will occur. So oftentimes it ends up being that multiple personalities.

409
00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:36.930
Helena Rouhe: Are created as a result of those various fractures, but it can be that only one or two are creative and that they only come out under

410
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.670
Helena Rouhe: duress or substance or, you know, certain circumstances that kind of trigger the shift.

411
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:56.100
Helena Rouhe: And that they often go with blackout. And so it can be and has been viewed in the past, especially without education that this was a demonic possession

412
00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:12.930
Helena Rouhe: Or some sort of like alter ego that because the person who is the main persona does not remember has no sense of it. It does feel like your licensing kind of destiny, especially if you were to come to in a situation that you don't know how you got there.

413
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.470
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

414
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:28.290
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so, um, you know, I think that there's various great treatment for that it ultimately boils down to, organizing, the house.

415
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:44.490
Helena Rouhe: So when a person has multiple personalities, you have to identify who the primary is and then the primaries in charge of everybody else and everybody else needs to fall in line and instead of the house being chaotic with a bunch of

416
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:57.210
Helena Rouhe: Things running around. Everybody has their room and they're only invited into the main part of the house when the main personality wants that, and it is a joy, the experience. It's not a taking over so

417
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:06.540
Helena Rouhe: It is doable and it is manageable and it's just like any other credit recovery process. It's a lifelong endeavor.

418
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:18.810
Helena Rouhe: And they're going to be times when you know that it's not appropriate for you to go out because you're struggling to maintain now and then they're going to be other times where you've got it together and you know who's in charge, and it's going to be okay.

419
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:26.520
Helena Rouhe: Certain people, you know, can't have alcohol or can have drugs because that's when other personalities take

420
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:26.820
Over

421
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:28.950
Brian Riley: That's

422
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:39.810
Helena Rouhe: So, but maybe this come from, I mean, that can be considered a, it could be considered psychotic break

423
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.270
Helena Rouhe: I mean, it's something that I think you

424
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.310
Helena Rouhe: Would benefit from talking to

425
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:51.120
Helena Rouhe: I don't know if you want to go there with Dr. Waters and mean I psychiatry. Right. I mean, she's the one who's going to tell you

426
00:45:51.510 --> 00:46:00.330
Helena Rouhe: And I've never had the opportunity to work with Dr. Waters when it comes to working with people who potentially have dissociative identity disorder which is the new term for it.

427
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.070
Helena Rouhe: And

428
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:11.610
Helena Rouhe: It's not, it's not unheard of. And it's much more kind of spoken about and acknowledged as not just someone who

429
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.420
Helena Rouhe: Doesn't want to take responsibility for bad behavior.

430
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:16.980
Brian Riley: But

431
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.460
Brian Riley: So now, now I

432
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.830
Brian Riley: I hope you believe me and saying that

433
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.150
Brian Riley: I would ever

434
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.900
Brian Riley: And then never even imagined such thing.

435
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:36.270
Brian Riley: Never

436
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.740
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

437
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.330
Brian Riley: Now I'm gonna be talking

438
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.070
Brian Riley: About this stuff and like

439
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.960
Brian Riley: an alter ego.

440
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.460
Helena Rouhe: It's another personality.

441
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:54.120
Helena Rouhe: And it can be that it can be. It is a, it's a different kind of thing. I mean, if you, you know you love comics. If you saw split

442
00:46:54.750 --> 00:47:02.790
Helena Rouhe: That's that's the person with multiple personality, you know, and it is that different. And sometimes the more fractured

443
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:14.130
Helena Rouhe: Than the personalities tend to know each other because there's a lot going on and things are very see through and transparent and it's everyone's kind of watching everyone else where it says if there's only one or two.

444
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:22.380
Helena Rouhe: Then it can be very rigid and it can be very scary because you don't have any sense of what's happening when you're being when you're not

445
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.580
Brian Riley: Willing to do

446
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:25.590
Helena Rouhe: So,

447
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.070
Brian Riley: It is

448
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.990
Helena Rouhe: Possible to create the construct to be able to keep everybody in line, but

449
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:41.910
Helena Rouhe: You know, I think it's worth it for you to have conversation with Dr. Waters and recognizing that she's on her way out. I don't know how that's gonna work.

450
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:42.570
Helena Rouhe: Out, you know,

451
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:52.350
Helena Rouhe: That feels like a good fit to do it, but we do have other people who potentially could meet with you instead of maybe you maybe you

452
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:53.190
Differently.

453
00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:04.410
Brian Riley: We understand that it's, it seems to me as long as I don't use fucking Dennis those

454
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.630
Helena Rouhe: Another reason to stay sober.

455
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:07.590
Brian Riley: Exactly.

456
00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.490
Helena Rouhe: And Don't. And Don't use yeah I mean there's, there's a lot of truth to that.

457
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:22.290
Helena Rouhe: But even across even across clinicians. Some people are more open to this idea than others. I've seen people

458
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.900
Helena Rouhe: Who have switched right in front of me.

459
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:41.370
Helena Rouhe: That I was working with for a while and you know, things got out of control, very quickly and it felt very scary in the room and I think it was working with a clinician who was accessible nearby who knew what to do to help organize it. So I thought first camp. I saw what can happen so

460
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:51.450
Helena Rouhe: I know that it exists. I know that other people like to bring it up as a kind of excuse for bad behavior and they know that they're doing it and they're just kind of making up this BS.

461
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.050
Brian Riley: I don't

462
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:59.550
Helena Rouhe: Think it's your. I don't think it's your situation. I think based on what I know about you what you're saying to me doesn't surprise me.

463
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:13.200
Helena Rouhe: Because the blackout thing and you not knowing what has happened has always been a concern for me, you know, either you weren't being truthful, which it didn't feel like that, maybe, in the beginning, there was a lot of defensiveness the worrying and all of that. So,

464
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.280
Brian Riley: Now it was time

465
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:21.630
Helena Rouhe: It's going to come clear, but over time. There never was clarity on these things. So, what was that all about, you know, where you just that.

466
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:31.320
Helena Rouhe: blacked out or what was going on during that time period. And it's this is why I say it's a defense mechanism. And so it can come up for all sorts of reasons, but

467
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:39.150
Helena Rouhe: Typically, the way to manage it is to make sure that the primary which is you Brian is in charge, and that this other

468
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:54.510
Helena Rouhe: Entity is identified for what it is and it doesn't mean, although some people really believe that. And it's okay if you were to want to kind of, you know, look into what it meant to get an exorcism or

469
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.900
Brian Riley: Something

470
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.730
Helena Rouhe: Look into it.

471
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:58.170
Brian Riley: That it's

472
00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:58.620
Grown

473
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.490
Helena Rouhe: I wouldn't, I wouldn't necessarily add

474
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.770
Brian Riley: Yeah.

475
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.160
Because

476
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.440
Brian Riley: That's where I was at. I mean,

477
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:16.230
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think that that's necessarily unheard of either, but I'm much more open about things like this, and a lot of other people and so

478
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:28.800
Helena Rouhe: I'm not going to tell you what you can and can't do you need to explore those things for yourself. But I think that what you're describing does sound like an ultra personality and it comes off. It's not unusual for people to have

479
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:37.380
Helena Rouhe: It's even a diagnosable event psychotic features are psychotic event to to use. And so for you. This is that manifestation

480
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:44.790
Helena Rouhe: And it just allows you to have real clarity about what you can and can't allow in your life because you're not gonna

481
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:55.590
Helena Rouhe: allow that to happen. Now, it doesn't mean that that's a hard and fast rule and that you're good to go. As long as that doesn't happen. But it does mean that that's a clear will right so you know

482
00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:57.570
Helena Rouhe: When

483
00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.730
Helena Rouhe: It's like any other kind of energy. If you give something energy, it gets power.

484
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:17.520
Helena Rouhe: So if you if that entity has had enough energy and then it has the power to potentially break through. Other times, if you start to feel or Esther starts to feel like things are being more in that direction. And maybe this is your point about

485
00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:22.920
Helena Rouhe: You know the slippery slope of if you're making exceptions and you're starting to

486
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.880
Helena Rouhe: Rationalize maybe that's also you giving it a little bit so that I don't know.

487
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:37.200
Helena Rouhe: But those are things to pay attention to. And, you know, just like your dress and maybe all of this kind of goes together right that you want to present Brian

488
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:54.240
Helena Rouhe: And what that means to you now. And that means that you are a person who is creative and loving and cares about what you're doing and you want to make sure that people around you are congruent with who you are not all this other stuff just because it's wild and crazy

489
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:02.010
Helena Rouhe: Maybe it allows for that alternative to be a little too close to home, and maybe by separating

490
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:06.750
Helena Rouhe: Things out being a little more congruent. That kind of makes it clear, who's in charge.

491
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.330
Brian Riley: And

492
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.580
Brian Riley: And I think it's important, perhaps, to say

493
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.150
Brian Riley: That

494
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:33.720
Brian Riley: The way we were able, not the way we worked it out. But the way that we were authentically honestly able to move past that and

495
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:40.920
Brian Riley: Be because like I said my heart of hearts and Esther.

496
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.170
Brian Riley: In her heart.

497
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:52.650
Brian Riley: Knew there was no value to it that when the three of us are in a room or when I am with cat.

498
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.570
Brian Riley: It doesn't think that does not did help. No, wait.

499
00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.530
Brian Riley: Do you know what I mean.

500
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:20.610
Brian Riley: She and she made it clear to me that she would never continual relations relationship with a man who has spoken of such things, and if there was even a fucking sliver of possibility I would be gone and I fully agree right

501
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:27.840
Brian Riley: Because there's just nothing, and I don't even understand that and that's a fact about like

502
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:39.060
Brian Riley: What, what, what, like a fucking it's so insane. It's so

503
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.790
Brian Riley: Like if legit feels like I was fucking set up.

504
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.970
Brian Riley: By me and it's like a bit and it's it's it's it's it's it's like

505
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:59.700
Brian Riley: So maybe talk to that two winners and she was just like

506
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.800
Brian Riley: Yeah, when I would talk to her.

507
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:13.080
Helena Rouhe: We do have another psychiatry as to who you can see if she feels like it's something that needs to be continued.

508
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:27.000
Helena Rouhe: And we have a psych we have a psychiatrist and we have a psychiatric nurse. So we do have a couple of other options. So she feels like that's a, that's a big thing to manage and maybe now is not the time given that she's transitioning out of the

509
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.120
Helena Rouhe: Cases, just know that you have some options and then she says, actually, I don't want to get into that with you.

510
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.650
Brian Riley: It doesn't mean that she's

511
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.580
Helena Rouhe: Abandoning you

512
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.750
Brian Riley: It means that she

513
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.110
Helena Rouhe: Wants to respect the fact. Well, I just want to say it out loud.

514
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:53.700
Helena Rouhe: When we're in transition as the clinician and something like this comes up. It's like on a small level, the same example as we're ending session and you say, oh, by the way, I'm having suicidal thoughts, but I'll be

515
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.930
Brian Riley: Fine. See you next week.

516
00:54:55.410 --> 00:55:07.260
Helena Rouhe: And, you know, close the session as well. What, what do you mean, see you next week. Are you okay, like we have a safety plan. So it's a big deal, what you're talking about. And she may

517
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:22.860
Helena Rouhe: Identify that she wants you to do the work of that but that she's not going to be able to do that with you. So instead of getting into it. Let's make sure you have somebody who can see it through. So if she gives you feedback next week, or when you interact with her. Hey,

518
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:29.850
Helena Rouhe: I don't think that it's going to be a good idea for to work on this. I would like you to hear for me first. It's not a rejection of you.

519
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:38.640
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And so if at some point you feel a little cuz that would be completely rational and understandable to feel that way.

520
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:38.910
Brian Riley: Yeah.

521
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:50.550
Helena Rouhe: She's doing it because she wants to make sure that you're well cared for and that you have somebody who can see that through whatever that looks like. And that if she's not going to be able to do that. She doesn't want to just shut that down.

522
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:52.020
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

523
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:52.890
Brian Riley: Okay.

524
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.860
Brian Riley: All right, so how would I now.

525
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:05.070
Brian Riley: Make because then I would do this anyway, make it make a one on one appointment with her prior to

526
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.420
Brian Riley: I mean basically just enroll into virtual clinic and

527
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:09.900
Helena Rouhe: Just say

528
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.310
Brian Riley: Like to be able to meet with Darko

529
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.260
Helena Rouhe: Waters and you can do that even tonight.

530
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.760
Helena Rouhe: After session and just requested.

531
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.020
Brian Riley: Me already our

532
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.670
Helena Rouhe: List to follow up with you anyway.

533
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.200
And then you guys can

534
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.200
Brian Riley: Can go that route. Okay.

535
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:23.820
Helena Rouhe: Maybe I should be something

536
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.660
Other than group.

537
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.610
Brian Riley: Yo, yeah.

538
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:27.540
Helena Rouhe: Sure that you have enough

539
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:28.650
Brian Riley: Time to talk about it or

540
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:29.430
Helena Rouhe: Whatever. Yeah.

541
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:29.910
Yeah.

542
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.460
Brian Riley: Okay, good. Yeah, good.

543
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.190
Brian Riley: Yes.

544
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.570
Brian Riley: Good, good, good. Your reaction was

545
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.940
Helena Rouhe: Not screaming and pulling out my fancy here.

546
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.800
Brian Riley: I knew, I knew it would. But you know, it's good. That's a tough one to like

547
00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.190
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

548
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.710
Brian Riley: You know, I could talk to you about that and

549
00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:06.240
Brian Riley: It did the more of a question that remained the moral is interfering with my like my like who am I, what is this

550
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:22.560
Helena Rouhe: What is there's a lot. There's a lot more stuff out there. And I think what you're talking about is not truly dissociative disorders so much. It's something that happens as a result of us. And this is how it manifests itself. So it's a little bit different but

551
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.900
Helena Rouhe: Again, it's out of my scope of

552
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.350
Brian Riley: Practice.

553
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.900
Helena Rouhe: So this is more out of having observed some things and have some opportunities to work with people that we can have

554
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:47.100
Helena Rouhe: A casual conversation, if you will. But I do think that it would be appropriate for you to follow up with either dark waters and one of our other site professional so that you can have that discussion and feel like you've at least seen it through in that level.

555
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.890
Brian Riley: Okay, okay.

556
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:55.020
Brian Riley: All right, so you want to schedule something with us there.

557
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.840
Helena Rouhe: Yep, I'm pulling up my calendar now.

558
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:11.760
Helena Rouhe: So next week, you're going to go to group and then and I'm, I'm only gone for like the end of that week that I'm not there. So then the following week, I'm back in town. So you tell me when would you like to kind of do this again.

559
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.310
Brian Riley: I will only right with something known as part of an incident.

560
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.840
Brian Riley: Like complicated touches my favorite

561
00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:29.490
Helena Rouhe: Dish

562
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.430
Brian Riley: Yeah, the best. I was at a, you know, I had

563
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.160
Brian Riley: Somebody need to follow the pattern, you know, and

564
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:42.600
Helena Rouhe: I'm sure they were

565
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.650
Brian Riley: Happening. Yeah. How do you make it in

566
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:55.200
Helena Rouhe: Actually, how do you make it and

567
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.330
Brian Riley: That's a good way to talk to them to talk about them.

568
00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:57.930
Yeah.

569
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.600
Brian Riley: Alright, so what do you think

570
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.420
Brian Riley: Tuesday. The third

571
00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:07.140
Helena Rouhe: March 3

572
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:14.430
Brian Riley: Two weeks. So that's two weeks. That's Do ya know. So how about the 10th, the 10th.

573
