00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.140
Good morning.

3
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.190
Jessica Freeman: My little boy into Nana's car so

4
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

5
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do know 100%. I know. Yes.

6
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.190
Jessica Freeman: So, yeah.

7
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.700
Jessica Freeman: Homework from last week.

8
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yay.

9
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.050
Jessica Freeman: Okay, I haven't accepted and I continually accept that this is what it is. And it's gonna be a long time. It's okay.

10
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.740
Jessica Freeman: Um, I took a bath. It was awesome.

11
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, hey,

12
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:25.320
Jessica Freeman: I wrote my bosses. I spent some time on it. I went through a few drafts, but I let them know you know the difficulties that I'm having working from home and I propose a solution.

13
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.730
Jessica Freeman: My parents, you know, kind of stepped up to the plate and said, We'll watch him for like full days at our house. So, two and a half days.

14
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.550
Jessica Freeman: It's not really working out.

15
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.530
Jessica Freeman: My son, he doesn't want to be gone all day like he's

16
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:59.790
Jessica Freeman: He's just the behavior piece is a problem because he's not happy with being gone for full days. So I'm going to have to propose another solution. I don't know, maybe reduce my hours. I don't know.

17
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:11.040
Jessica Freeman: But it's not working. But I did. I mean, I, they were cool about it and everything has been good, but this week. I mean, maybe I should give it another week, I don't know, but He just, he's not

18
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.840
Jessica Freeman: He's not having it.

19
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.580
Jessica Freeman: Um,

20
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:28.230
Jessica Freeman: I've been okay so I kind of fell down on the job with like organizing my schedule like structuring things, it's still not happening. But I've been thinking about it a lot.

21
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's the first

22
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.280
Jessica Freeman: And I've been doing, you know, online meetings so

23
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good. How is that going

24
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.080
Jessica Freeman: Okay, you know, bunch of strangers.

25
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:55.650
Jessica Freeman: There's, like, you know, 200 some odd people in the room. I did actually like I've been, you know, joining with my video and raising my hand and trying to participate. Like, you told me to.

26
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:09.330
Jessica Freeman: And I did make a friend through that because you know I was honest about where I was. And then this girl sent me her number. And so I texted her, and now we kind of text back and forth a little bit. And that's been good.

27
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome.

28
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is really good.

29
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.580
Jessica Freeman: Am I allowed to vapor

30
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you're not supposed to do.

31
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I know. Like in group and stuff because it triggers other people, but I just go off camera for a second. It's been a stressful morning

32
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you do

33
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.970
Jessica Freeman: What you do off camera. I can't. I have no control over.

34
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:57.870
Jessica Freeman: Thank you. My dog has been needy like I've had to take him outside like 50 bazillion times and I switched his diet because he was having diarrhea, and now he's better

35
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.890
Jessica Freeman: Having all these healthy poops that I'm totally jealous of

36
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:18.540
Jessica Freeman: But, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm okay. Like last week around this time it was really rough like I was having a very rough time but you know I'm not great but I'm not bad, right in the middle.

37
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's good.

38
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.800
Definitely

39
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gearing towards greatness.

40
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.690
Jessica Freeman: I don't think there's going to be any greatness until all this stuff is over.

41
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

42
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is rough nicely.

43
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.490
Jessica Freeman: Into my radio show this morning and they were talking to people like having people call in about

44
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:51.510
Jessica Freeman: Like, what's the first thing you're going to do when when all this is over and life goes back to normal. And all I can think of is I'm going to take my kids to school and I'm going to drop them off there for the whole day that's

45
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.540
Jessica Freeman: What else happens but like he

46
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.800
Jessica Freeman: Three. He's gone.

47
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:08.520
Jessica Freeman: I love them. I do. I love him. But it's, I mean I love him so much and I'm doing well. I'm keeping my like temper is not a thing with him because it doesn't work, you can't get mad at this, you can't raise your voice.

48
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:22.140
Jessica Freeman: You can't, you know, really discipline much all you can do is reward positive behavior and either ignore bad behavior and not give them the attention. He's looking for or, you know, just like wait it out.

49
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, nobody's going to know best, but you on how to work with him. You know what I mean, you're his best advocate.

50
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

51
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.390
Jessica Freeman: Man, the other day when I went to pick him up. Bob was telling me that

52
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:55.650
Jessica Freeman: He took the he took the iPad away for 15 minutes and like key and just like bald and bald and through a major fit. And I was like, You didn't give it back to him to do like he has to calm down, but you can't give it back to him because of a fit.

53
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.480
Jessica Freeman: But you gotta wait it out.

54
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:09.960
Jessica Freeman: Otherwise you have just taught him that it's okay for him to throw a fit and then he's going to get what he wants. And it's going to be that much worse. Next time, so you're gonna have to train him like no you don't get it back until you're calm.

55
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.460
Jessica Freeman: Until you off doing something else and attention to something else calm as a Hindu cow, that's when you can have it back.

56
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.230
Jessica Freeman: But now,

57
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.540
Jessica Freeman: Encouraging all this bad behavior.

58
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.220
Jessica Freeman: Is

59
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.840
Jessica Freeman: My house not

60
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.890
Jessica Freeman: Not with Mom No.

61
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.030
Jessica Freeman: Not doing a mistake, first by letting them act like that.

62
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, but you know, remember that their, their grandparents.

63
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

64
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kids, you know, with grandparents, they get treated differently they get away with a lot more. You know what

65
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a whole different realm.

66
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.200
Jessica Freeman: I agree.

67
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.090
Jessica Freeman: I just don't want to see them.

68
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.930
Jessica Freeman: set themselves up for that. No, it's like I'm

69
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.200
Jessica Freeman: You get it.

70
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:11.130
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's like they're just letting He'll. He'll take advantage of it, he'll run away with it, and he'll throw a horrendous fit that lasts forever because that's what you know that's what works. Yeah.

71
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it. Yeah, totally get it next time it'll be twice as bad and twice as long, and. And the hope is, is that you know he's he'll learn his lesson and do something different, next time.

72
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.730
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, well the next few times. It's going to be really bad.

73
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.990
Jessica Freeman: It's just going to, but you have to, you have to hold the line.

74
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you do. Definitely.

75
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.760
Jessica Freeman: It's done it.

76
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.560
Jessica Freeman: He's done it. He does it here, but, you know, not going to give in.

77
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.350
Jessica Freeman: Because I know what that looks like.

78
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.890
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I see parents who are ruled by their children.

79
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially because it's with

80
00:07:52.050 --> 00:08:02.400
Jessica Freeman: Autism, like where the kid with autism dominates everything in the house. And you know what key in his sweet and loving in his heart and in

81
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:18.300
Jessica Freeman: The way I see it is if I help him with his behavior than he gets to be the real him. I think I'm doing him a favor and sparing myself. But anyway, enough about that. Let's talk about me.

82
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You mean. So Jessica outside of can

83
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.050
Jessica Freeman: Not

84
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.820
Jessica Freeman: Really, yeah.

85
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.010
Jessica Freeman: So,

86
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the tough part I think the part of one of the toughest parts about this whole thing of being, you know, at home with the kids all the time. Having a homeschool um

87
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:56.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they're not being a reprieve there's nothing that they can do. There's no place that they can really go is the fact that there is very minimal mama time, you know, I'm and I'm hearing it all across

88
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.360
Jessica Freeman: Oh, yeah.

89
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.280
Jessica Freeman: I know my problems are not

90
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.000
Unique

91
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definite definitely what's unique about it though is the fact that your son is autistic. So you your challenges, a little bit different than, you know, people with

92
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know people that don't have. Yeah.

93
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the struggle is real. I mean, I see it and you're not the only

94
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Person that I know that has, you know, a child that's autistic and they're going through the same exact thing right now, you know,

95
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing. Definitely. So you got to find those little bit of reprieves where you can, you know, within a day, you know, at some point, you gotta have Jessica time

96
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.760
Jessica Freeman: Well, let me show you my masterpieces.

97
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:45.780
Okay.

98
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:54.120
Jessica Freeman: They're still. I mean, I've been doing a lot of puzzles but this one is hardcore, and this one.

99
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.310
Jessica Freeman: Oh, wow. Yeah.

100
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So many

101
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and I've done several puzzles but this one. This one's really hard. I'm not gonna lie.

102
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:17.760
Jessica Freeman: But I enjoyed that. And here is my other one which I know I've shown you before you know

103
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.820
Jessica Freeman: It's a work in progress.

104
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.650
Oh, yeah.

105
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.840
Jessica Freeman: Awesome.

106
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.460
Jessica Freeman: That's my mommy time

107
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:39.630
Jessica Freeman: Back when I first came into the rooms and started like having to do recovery, because I was at a recovery house and I had to do it.

108
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:52.800
Jessica Freeman: You know, because there was no way I was going to do it on my own. I had to do it. I could barely sit still, like, I could hardly sit through a meeting like so I I started doing adult coloring and

109
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.500
Jessica Freeman: People would stare at me and you know I didn't care, though, because I was like, This is what I need.

110
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:15.540
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and it helped a lot. And when I have swansea's which I haven't had a sponsor since I moved here because I'm still trying to get the lay of the land like she's different here. Um, but yeah, I would have them do that when they came in because it's hard.

111
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.000
Jessica Freeman: It's hard to sit there and listen to these people and sit in a chair for an hour.

112
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, and grasp the concept of what the heck is going on. And they're talking about. Yeah.

113
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:40.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what is this all about I yeah I still remember. I remember my very first my very first meeting and I was like, whoa. Who are these people. Why do they want to get away from me. What it should

114
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be that was

115
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know you, your personal space too many

116
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.150
Jessica Freeman: Like, you know, and I don't trust you, like, who the fuck are you, you know, yeah, I remember

117
00:11:51.780 --> 00:12:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I used to and all the little things you know that that you learn did make one bit of sense to me at all, but through time. I got it. Yeah, each one you know started, it was like they came to life in my head. Oh, that makes perfect sense.

118
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So simple.

119
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:19.800
Jessica Freeman: People talk. Yeah, I mean I have a lot of examples of that, like, people would talk about surrender, you know, and then I'd have my idea of what that meant.

120
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:31.980
Jessica Freeman: And then somebody would tell a story that would or, you know, say something that would just kind of give it new light. And then over time I started to experience it for myself. So yeah, it's good stuff.

121
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

122
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. You've been online meetings, you made a friend. So you've done these things you're reaching out, you know, which is really, really good.

123
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and work is is working with you as far as

124
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Timing and

125
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you could

126
00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you got to know just get that you can only do what you can do. You know, I know that they probably know that you know you have a son that does, you know, have you know autism and he needs that extra support. He needs you there, you know, and I'm sure they get it.

127
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially right now, you know,

128
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:25.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah I if everything were normal. You know, if I could go to the office and doing just work like normal young. I know that they would be really happy with me.

129
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.130
Jessica Freeman: But this situation is

130
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.530
Jessica Freeman: Really challenging

131
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: not normal.

132
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.740
Jessica Freeman: It's really not. I almost feel bad. I mean, I do. I feel bad, like

133
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.820
I'm shortchanging

134
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, I think that employers are, you know, making the best of a bad situation, the best they can and you know it. It would be a lot harder for them if they didn't have people that were at least trying, you know, to put an effort in, you know, to the work while they're stuck at home.

135
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So imagine if they had nobody

136
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.800
Jessica Freeman: You know yeah so

137
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.790
Jessica Freeman: I just, you know, I don't

138
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:13.770
Jessica Freeman: I never even got to go in and do even a little bit of training like this is all been from home since day one.

139
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.760
Jessica Freeman: And that's particularly challenging

140
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I bet it is no training whatsoever.

141
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh, yeah.

142
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get that.

143
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be tough one.

144
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:35.820
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so, you know, learning the software they use and what it is they actually want like it's just a shot in the dark man.

145
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you're doing it.

146
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.890
Jessica Freeman: You're doing my best.

147
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they're happy with it.

148
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:50.790
Jessica Freeman: I hope I mean they were cool about the email but I'm like I'm gonna have to have another conversation with them.

149
00:14:51.330 --> 00:15:07.260
Jessica Freeman: And maybe I should just be like, Hey, you know, these were the struggles. This week I'm going to try it again next week and see if he adjusts better to spending full days at Nana's house, but if it doesn't then you know you have to change something

150
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.220
Yeah.

151
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. I just think that that they'll be workable, you know, at this present point right now. You know, they have to be you're at home with kids and they every single one of their employers them themselves is doing the same thing. You know, if they have kids. Yeah.

152
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.040
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's just that's the thing, though, like people with typical kids don't quite

153
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:56.880
Jessica Freeman: Understand what it, what it is to be home with your child has severe autism all day, every day, just like the mental and emotional and even physical strain like he requires so much and I tried to kind of like, give them an idea in my email. Last week I said you know Keon is

154
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:07.800
Jessica Freeman: He's nonverbal a home. He is cognitively between the ages of seven and 22 months but with the strength

155
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.580
Jessica Freeman: And weight of a five and a half year old.

156
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:13.740
Jessica Freeman: You know,

157
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.580
Jessica Freeman: I hope that gives a little bit of perspective, my

158
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:24.600
Jessica Freeman: God yeah what it's like it's like having a two year old that weighs 40 pounds.

159
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.290
Yeah.

160
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:42.270
Jessica Freeman: Who has extreme sensory needs like need sensory input at all times. Like constantly he'll come sit with me. And in order for him to sit still have to like tickle his feet, a whole time, just for him to come

161
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

162
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.570
Jessica Freeman: He needs sensory input. He sensory seeking not sensory sensitive

163
00:16:53.250 --> 00:17:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now he's not getting services. They've been put on hold, which makes him, you know, we're so everything is on your shoulders. When it comes to him. Yeah.

164
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.350
Jessica Freeman: And we're having some regression

165
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:21.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mentioned that like he's behaviorally regressing he's not getting any services. So this is what's happening. Did you know that he is only eaten French vanilla yogurt for every meal for about nine days. Now, you won't eat anything else.

166
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wonder what that's about. Because somebody else's

167
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've heard that from somebody else what this past week. Yeah.

168
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.920
Jessica Freeman: Well, he's probably just trying to control what he can

169
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:52.770
Jessica Freeman: Because this is an out of control type of thing like he's not, he's not getting the things that he needs. He's not getting the things that he that he wants, as far as like going to school and going to the playground and you know I did, I got him a water table.

170
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.630
Jessica Freeman: Okay, and he loves water. He loves it so much. And plus, we can do a lot with that table like

171
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:04.770
Jessica Freeman: You know, sensory stuff like pinto beans sound and the texture and water beads

172
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.460
Jessica Freeman: Yes, the first time I brought it out. He made mud just wonderful.

173
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.200
Jessica Freeman: Make the mass. I gotta let him make the mess.

174
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:16.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

175
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.210
Jessica Freeman: I gotta clean it up is what it is. Come here. Keno Jesus

176
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just know that

177
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably most kids are making big message right

178
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

179
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just a piece of this whole home thing. And yeah, you're not alone at

180
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That area, you know,

181
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

182
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me a little bit about the friend that you made in a

183
00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:07.050
Jessica Freeman: Oh, her name is Gabrielle she I she lives in eastern time zone. It's all I know she may have told me, but I don't remember. Um, she was a victim of sex trafficking.

184
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:17.070
Jessica Freeman: And she's been sober for a year, but she has been kind of in and out before. Mmm.

185
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.260
Jessica Freeman: Hmm, that's about all I got. Wow.

186
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You guys hit it off pretty well.

187
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:34.410
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I would say, although I don't know, like just between you and me her story about the whole sex trafficking thing, it didn't quite add up for me.

188
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.790
Jessica Freeman: But

189
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.910
Jessica Freeman: You know, what am I going to do like it.

190
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

191
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:45.510
Jessica Freeman: It is what it is I'm just going to meet her where she is. And if that's her story. That's our story, and I'm just

192
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:56.160
Jessica Freeman: Supporting that's cool. I don't have to believe it. I don't have to believe everything I can just love her. I mean, we're addicts and alcoholics. We lie through our teeth.

193
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.530
Jessica Freeman: We that's our default setting.

194
00:19:59.460 --> 00:19:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

195
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.280
Jessica Freeman: So why wouldn't I expect you know alcoholic addict behavior from an alcoholic addict.

196
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.270
Right.

197
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:15.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. That's a good way to look at it. You know what I mean, and more will be revealed, the more you get to know her.

198
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. Did you see her on video chat.

199
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.600
Jessica Freeman: No, she had her video off.

200
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.430
Jessica Freeman: That I heard her. I heard her voice.

201
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.530
Jessica Freeman: And then we've been texting, I can you blame her though.

202
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:38.280
Jessica Freeman: If she really has been a victim of sex trafficking, she probably wants to remain anonymous.

203
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

204
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.230
Jessica Freeman: can't really blame her.

205
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.160
No.

206
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nope. Not at all, not in any way, shape, or form.

207
00:20:47.730 --> 00:21:01.410
Jessica Freeman: You know, I've been kind of hesitant to put my video out there but you know you told me to do it. So I did it. And it's been fine. Like, it's fine. But, you know, just because people are so fucking creepy. There's so many assholes and weirdos in the world. Yeah.

208
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.540
Jessica Freeman: There's hackers are they gonna, you know,

209
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.110
Jessica Freeman: hunt down my IP address. I don't know. But let's just, you know, you

210
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.160
would hope that

211
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The whole format that set up for those meetings are

212
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Extra secure is what I'm I think what I'm looking for, but that they have things in place to keep people's identity private I would hope that, you know, that is the format that they use, you know,

213
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.830
Jessica Freeman: They've all been zoom meetings.

214
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, then it's HIPAA compliant.

215
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:44.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, the other one FaceTime is not neither. There's one other one. One other app that is not

216
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.590
Jessica Freeman: Skype Skype.

217
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is not HIPAA compliant.

218
00:21:49.710 --> 00:22:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why everybody goes to has been coming to zoom and that's why zoom has been. I mean, zoom has been acting really weird lately. Like, this is the best stable, you know, video that I've had a week because I think they're just overloaded, you know, they're over

219
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody's

220
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On it. Yeah, everyone's on the internet and everyone's using zoom for schools, you know, they're using zoom meetings are using zoom you know therapies you everybody's using

221
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.030
Jessica Freeman: You know them. So my friends are happy.

222
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:27.780
Jessica Freeman: I bet my brother lives in Portugal and he's been setting up like family meetings.

223
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:34.140
Jessica Freeman: Like I have a cousin that lives in Hawaii. And then I live in New Mexico. And then most of my family lives in Indiana.

224
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.910
Jessica Freeman: With some exceptions like my dad lives in South Carolina. But anyway, so he set up a couple of

225
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:50.940
Jessica Freeman: Zoom meetings just to catch up with the family, which I went to the one he had last week, but it's actually happening right now. I'm like,

226
00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:06.450
Jessica Freeman: I can't make it on Thursdays at nine mountain time but he's like he said you should host one of your own. And I said, when it comes to my, my family. I said, I don't deal well with rejection. So it's probably not going to happen.

227
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.950
Jessica Freeman: You know,

228
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:20.130
Jessica Freeman: You know, it was. I mean, everybody wants to talk to Adam because he lives in Portugal, but you know what if I set up a zoom meeting and nobody comes. I'm just, I'm going to feel bad.

229
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.700
Jessica Freeman: I'm not going to send me out for that. But I'll join

230
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.070
Jessica Freeman: If anybody has one I'll be there.

231
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:32.550
Jessica Freeman: I think that's fair. That's me, setting a boundary. I don't feel like getting rejected.

232
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.010
Jessica Freeman: From my family, you know, or by my family.

233
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.870
Jessica Freeman: Don't feel like it.

234
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, just keep yourself secure in that, then you know

235
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.210
Yeah.

236
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:53.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, I think you're already stepping outside your comfort zone in so many areas that you know you can be a bit reserved in this one. You know what I mean.

237
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.800
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mean experience or

238
00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.380
Jessica Freeman: Maybe I should tread lightly.

239
00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.370
Yeah.

240
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I gotcha with family stuff, that's for sure.

241
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.730
Jessica Freeman: It's always complicated

242
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:19.200
Jessica Freeman: You know, I don't even talk to my mom's side of the family at all like once my Grandma and Grandpa passed away. I don't have anything to do with any of them.

243
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.700
Oh, wow.

244
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were you ever worried. I mean, we were they ever in your life and

245
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was there ever a closeness.

246
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.640
Jessica Freeman: Closeness

247
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.300
Jessica Freeman: Yeah mom side of the family. How should I described them.

248
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:34.710
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

249
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:36.870
Jessica Freeman: The have

250
00:24:38.400 --> 00:25:00.720
Jessica Freeman: Very, very high standards. Okay, everybody is, you know, high achieving my grandpa set this set the bar on that, like he was a two star general in the Air Force. He had two college degrees before he was 22 i think i mean he just he owned his own law practice. He was very successful very driven

251
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.070
Jessica Freeman: Not open not affectionate

252
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:20.160
Jessica Freeman: And grudge holders, they will hold a grudge until the day you die, they are not forgiving. There is no compassion, you know, you're up here or you're out.

253
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.090
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, so I've always had trouble with that.

254
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.560
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

255
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.410
Jessica Freeman: I just, I was falling on the wrong side of the line for them.

256
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:44.850
Jessica Freeman: So, you know, I was close with my grandma She passed away when I was pregnant with key in and then my grandpa died shortly thereafter. I went to the funeral, and that's it. I don't have anything else for anybody. None of my cousins aunts, uncles, none of them.

257
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.570
Wow.

258
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

259
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, a lot of families are that way, you know, very distant

260
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We didn't put about your dad very

261
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.060
Well,

262
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm sorry, Dad saying, What about your dad side.

263
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.870
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, yeah. The Freeman's

264
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:11.910
Jessica Freeman: Lots of love lots of compassion big personalities, you know, there's a freeman on a stage with a microphone somewhere in the world right now.

265
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:22.380
Jessica Freeman: They're great. But my dad's generation, like they're the great ones. I'm really close with my aunts and uncles.

266
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:39.000
Jessica Freeman: And I mean, I kind of have like a like a distantly friendly relationship with the majority of my cousins. And then, there have been some that I think closer to over the years and kind of then in and out, you know,

267
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:53.400
Jessica Freeman: But everybody's like, yay gesture sober, you know, they're very supportive. But I mean I wouldn't say that I have, like, really close, personal relationships with any of my cousins right now.

268
00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:06.750
Jessica Freeman: And they've kind of like most of my generation has strayed from, you know, our, our parents generation and there and what they hold to be

269
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.090
Jessica Freeman: You know, whatever.

270
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.090
Jessica Freeman: The words are failing me right now, but they're just

271
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:33.870
Jessica Freeman: They're a bunch of selfish assholes. You know, they're doing their own thing and they don't care. Like my dad's my dad has five siblings and, you know, they're all really good people, not one of those men, there's two women and four men. Okay.

272
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.300
Jessica Freeman: None of the men. Have you ever cheated on their spouses ever

273
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like, oh wow

274
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:47.130
Jessica Freeman: They are devoted husbands who care for their families and they got who they are.

275
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.210
Jessica Freeman: You know the my generation. We are a bunch of selfish assholes. We care.

276
00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:14.160
Jessica Freeman: About you know i mean half of half of them are alcoholics and drug addicts, but they're just they haven't had issues about it, you know, they're just normalized alcohol and drug use in their lives. And that's fine, but I couldn't fit in in that, you know,

277
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.890
Jessica Freeman: I always I always took it too far.

278
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:28.500
Jessica Freeman: You know, I always created a problem. So now I'm sober and people are like, that's great. You can stay over there, though. And I'm like, I feel the same about you.

279
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:30.810
Jessica Freeman: Know,

280
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:31.980
That's

281
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.440
Jessica Freeman: What I'm close with

282
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, sometimes.

283
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

284
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. I think that family's important is is really important, as long as it's healthy. You know,

285
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes we can get into.

286
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:59.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or have dysfunctional families and not realize, you know what a toxic relationship they are you know

287
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah. So we've really got to be careful and all relationships in that

288
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.810
Jessica Freeman: Earlier. I've had to work.

289
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.720
Jessica Freeman: Through a lot with my parents like individually.

290
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.460
Jessica Freeman: I've worked through a lot with them a lot.

291
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

292
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:28.260
Jessica Freeman: It is, I love my parents and I have a great relationship with them today. It's taken a lot of work and forgiveness on on all sides like

293
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:35.130
Jessica Freeman: A lot of forgiveness that I know they love me. I know they did their best. They did a lot right

294
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.530
Jessica Freeman: We did a lot wrong so

295
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.180
Jessica Freeman: There's no perfect parent

296
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.370
And

297
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.540
Jessica Freeman: I know I

298
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.950
Jessica Freeman: You know,

299
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.530
Jessica Freeman: I really fucked up with my older one

300
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's things going with him. Speaking of

301
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.980
Jessica Freeman: Well, he just had his 17th birthday.

302
00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:06.420
Jessica Freeman: I tried to be the first one you know to say happy birthday real early because he did that for me on my birthday.

303
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:18.480
Jessica Freeman: And I told her, like, I can't really send you any money or you know if there's anything else that I can do let me know and it's you know it's done. I just don't really have any. I just can't release any money.

304
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right now.

305
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.870
Jessica Freeman: But you know, I posted a little montage on Facebook with his pictures and

306
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:39.990
Jessica Freeman: I think it was good. We had a good exchange. And since I got back from Indy I've been in a lot more frequent contact with him like at least two or three times a week. We text back and forth which before

307
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.200
Jessica Freeman: You know, it would go weeks where we talk so

308
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.670
Jessica Freeman: It's better

309
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good.

310
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It says connections that are important. You know, he needs that from you, just as much as you need that from him, you know,

311
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah yeah

312
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.940
Jessica Freeman: Well, I'm trying

313
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Rough age.

314
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.960
Jessica Freeman: And he's going through a lot right now.

315
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:12.750
Jessica Freeman: All of his robotics stuff is cancelled. He's moving to Texas and he's going to have his senior year in Texas. So he's never going to be in school with any of his friends again.

316
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.660
Jessica Freeman: Like yeah, he's going through a lot

317
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:24.810
Jessica Freeman: And he's, he's a tough kid, but I know he's got he's super sensitive in his heart, you know, and his dad doesn't recognize that, because he's so

318
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:37.140
Jessica Freeman: bull in a china shop kind of guy. He's just, he's just like that. And he's never seen the you know the machine inside of Brendan's heart.

319
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:45.120
Jessica Freeman: And I see that. And I know that, but he puts up this tough exterior, you know, and I know what's going on, because I know my kid.

320
00:31:45.870 --> 00:32:02.340
Jessica Freeman: And so I just, I try to respect that that that wall that he's put up, you know, and not try to push him and, you know, poke and prod, but at the same time I say things that I know mean something to him like

321
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:07.320
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I let him know how proud of him. I am and that

322
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.730
Jessica Freeman: I'm not going to cry. I'm not

323
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.730
Jessica Freeman: I hate crying. By the way, I hate it.

324
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:36.900
Jessica Freeman: And I'm an ugly cry or two, but I just tried to say things that are encouraging to him and let him know what I see, you know, I see that you are a loving, caring, young man, and you've got the whole world in front of you. I know you're going through a hard time right now. We all are.

325
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:52.410
Jessica Freeman: Because I don't want him to fall into that like self pity, like when you isolate yourself and you think that your problems are bigger than everybody else's like I don't want him to fall into that. So yeah, I just tried to be gentle.

326
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.000
Jessica Freeman: Stupid tears.

327
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good.

328
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it. You know what I mean.

329
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want the best for him, and it is going to be tough for him to move to Texas and have to be with new people, you know,

330
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you know, as well, moving to New Mexico. You know how how challenging it can be to get adjusted, you know, and to me.

331
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.250
Jessica Freeman: And I actually switched schools, my junior year in high school, and it was how like it had a profound impact on my life.

332
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:51.870
Jessica Freeman: I was headed this direction and then, you know, it's like that scene and Back to the Future where Doc Brown draws the timeline and then veers off to this alternate 1985 yeah that's what happened for me and I don't let that for him. Yeah.

333
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, on a lighter note, he's going to be closer to you.

334
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.050
Jessica Freeman: So it's an hour drive, but a much cheaper, faster flight.

335
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That is good.

336
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:12.060
Jessica Freeman: And I told him, like if you can't make it here will come to you like we are going to see you like

337
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:26.430
Jessica Freeman: The stupid travel shit means to lift. I'm so glad we got to India before all this stuff started like, what if we had waited and then who knows how long it would be. I'm so grateful that we were able to go

338
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's kind of amazing. Huh.

339
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.870
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, like God. It's God shot like God worked that out, it was

340
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.810
Jessica Freeman: And I was, I mean, he had a rough time man like his robotic stuff. His team.

341
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:51.930
Jessica Freeman: Just didn't do well on that last day and and he was so upset, you know, and I'm so glad I was able to be there for him.

342
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:52.950
Yeah.

343
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: GOOD TRIP.

344
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:56.970
Yeah.

345
00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:08.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely and him being an hour away. You're, you're going to be able to be more engaged in, in, you know what I mean his life in his events, you know,

346
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:10.620
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

347
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is going to be awesome.

348
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:28.050
Jessica Freeman: Yeah definitely like once he gets going, and in school and robotics and he has stuff like we will be there. We will be there. He misses his brother and I don't blame them like they're so close.

349
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your baby in him.

350
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

351
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gotta be yeah for for for him to, you know, to be able to stay connected to his brother.

352
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.760
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, they love each other.

353
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.670
Jessica Freeman: Brendan's a really good big brother.

354
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about him being able to come and stay with you in the summer.

355
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.030
You know,

356
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:06.090
Jessica Freeman: He's, he's not 18 yet. And then when he does turn 18 and he goes to college, you know, he wants to go to Purdue. So I don't know. He might be going to school in Indiana.

357
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:21.480
Jessica Freeman: But he's going to continue to need his dad for like financial support through college. And so, Brendan is going to remain under his dad's thumb for many more years to come. So

358
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.200
Jessica Freeman: Bring the sucks but

359
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.710
Jessica Freeman: Brendan doesn't want to set his dad off by

360
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.590
Jessica Freeman: Getting all close to me.

361
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:47.310
Jessica Freeman: Because his dad hates me so much, and his dad will be irrational and overreact and punish Brendan for trying to be close to me.

362
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

363
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's got some issues.

364
00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:08.700
Jessica Freeman: No, yeah, Britain is just trying to play it safe right now he's trying to not rock the boat with his dad I don't blame him so I understand that this means that the majority of the effort is going to have to come from me and

365
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:17.040
Jessica Freeman: I'm okay with that. There were years that I put in no effort and I'll put in all the effort that I have

366
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:23.790
Jessica Freeman: Everything that I can possibly do. Like, whatever it is. I don't care. This is my time to show Brendan

367
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:34.950
Jessica Freeman: I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I love you. I want to stay involved with you yeah I'm committed to you. You're my son.

368
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:47.550
Jessica Freeman: This is the time that I can, I can really do that. And it's, it's an opportunity, you know, I'm not going to sit here and be all poor me my kid hates me. He's not going to come see me.

369
00:37:47.970 --> 00:38:00.480
Jessica Freeman: I recognize where he is. I recognize what he has to deal with and then that's a heavy burden Scott west is a heavy fucking burden. Let me tell you, because I know

370
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.050
Jessica Freeman: So he's got to do what he's got to do.

371
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:14.670
Jessica Freeman: And I'll put in the effort, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be good. It's gonna make us closer in the long run might take a while, but that's okay.

372
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I did.

373
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.400
Jessica Freeman: Before I can be now.

374
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For how long

375
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:47.580
Jessica Freeman: Well, when he was four. I took him to live with his dad and I moved to Las Vegas, and I was gone for about two years and then I came back and expected things to go a lot differently. But Scott wasn't going to allow any of that. So,

376
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.760
Jessica Freeman: I thought and I lost

377
00:38:51.810 --> 00:39:14.940
Jessica Freeman: And then I fell into, you know, a drug induced alcohol induced stupor for years on end and then I fought again and I lost again and then I did it again and then I just gave up and I had key in and I focused everything on key and and

378
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.520
Jessica Freeman: Then I got sober and I realized the damage that I had done.

379
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:30.150
Jessica Freeman: And I've made my amends to him. Like, we're good. You know, I feel like it doesn't let me off the hook and I told him that

380
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:40.980
Jessica Freeman: I was like, because I'm sitting here and I'm accepting responsibility for my mistakes and I'm, I'm trying, I'm making my immense you. That doesn't mean that like I'm absolved

381
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:55.200
Jessica Freeman: And forgiven. You know, like I'm not off the hook. I will never be off the hook for that. But all I can do is what I can do in the present, you know, and the future that we build i can't i can't erase that.

382
00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.190
But right

383
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:03.420
Jessica Freeman: And you know, it's been consistent since then. I mean, I've been. I've been consistent for the last

384
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.200
Jessica Freeman: Three and a half years. Yeah.

385
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really, really good.

386
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.470
Jessica Freeman: You know he's, he sees that

387
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:27.240
Jessica Freeman: And it, it has changed the dynamic of our relationship considerably and I'm blessed to have the opening to have the opportunity, you know,

388
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.400
Jessica Freeman: To can do to make things better.

389
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. And I think we talked about this before, but, you know, even in that time, you probably

390
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You probably did him.

391
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Justice. You know, I think we did talk about this with him.

392
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, letting him be with his dad then being going to Vegas and, you know, because you don't know where he would be right now.

393
00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that he probably had structure and he had stability and, you know, that is exactly, you know, you know what, I can't need. So, you know, there's that piece, too.

394
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

395
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.070
Jessica Freeman: And that has brought me comfort ever since we talked about it.

396
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.150
Thank you.

397
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much. Very much so.

398
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that from experience.

399
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that sometimes we want to believe that we're the best thing, you know, but depending on our state of mind and our state of our own life. We really have to you know put the kid first and it's hard. Oh my gosh.

400
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:51.450
Jessica Freeman: I was in no condition to put my son first for a long, long time. And you know he has memories of stuff that I don't remember because I was, you know, fucked up.

401
00:41:53.580 --> 00:42:09.720
Jessica Freeman: He has I hurt him terribly when I was, you know, I told them, like, Hey, let's go to the zoo. But then I was really just trying to get her into the car so I could take him to the Speedway and get drunk with my friends.

402
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.380
Jessica Freeman: You know, he remembers that I don't remember that.

403
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they have different memories.

404
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:19.950
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

405
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:27.630
Jessica Freeman: I mean I have like a vague, but you know when he told me that I was like oh my god so

406
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:35.040
Jessica Freeman: If he had if he had been with me full time how much damage. Would I have inflicted that i i couldn't even recall

407
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.150
Yeah.

408
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you did the best thing you know that you could possibly do. And, you know, knowing that it still doesn't

409
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lift

410
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:56.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The feeling, you know, but it definitely provides a little bit of comfort knowing that

411
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's exactly what it was about. It's like you put him first without realizing, that's what you were doing, you know,

412
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.990
Jessica Freeman: God was definitely involved. I can tell you that

413
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:20.490
Jessica Freeman: He was doing things that I didn't understand and couldn't do for myself and will only understand in in like, retro function if that's a word.

414
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:21.990
Reflection

415
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.840
Good word

416
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really good word.

417
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

418
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.620
Jessica Freeman: Now, that's, that's good. But yeah, it does provide some some relief to look at it.

419
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:45.300
Jessica Freeman: Through that perspective and I don't want to, like, I'm not going to be like, oh, Brandon, you know, column FBI bottom line therapy today not gonna do that.

420
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:57.750
Jessica Freeman: Negative that I'm going to wait until the future and there might be a moment that presented itself where we can talk about that, you know, I don't, I don't need to call them up.

421
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:11.370
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I just let that happen naturally. If it happens at all. You know, maybe eventually will come around to that and I can kind of share that perspective with him. Maybe it'll provide him some comfort.

422
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:13.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

423
00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you guys ever talk about what you went through when you were when you moved away.

424
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.700
Jessica Freeman: I've said some things like I told him.

425
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:35.700
Jessica Freeman: You know, I was in the 95th percentile of my class and I had been taking all the advanced classes and I was college bound, and then when I switched schools.

426
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:56.190
Jessica Freeman: I was so thrown off with like social stuff and you know then that pastor came into the situation into my life because I was, you know, really emotionally struggling and then and then my grades dropped and then I couldn't get in to college like

427
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.330
Jessica Freeman: I mean, it just

428
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:06.030
Jessica Freeman: It just ruined everything. Like emotionally and like my whole future everything that I was supposed to be just just

429
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.560
Jessica Freeman: veered off into the alternate 1985

430
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:11.940
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

431
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:23.100
Jessica Freeman: I've tried to explain it, but he's also like will not you will, you know, and that he's not, he's not me. He'll probably handle things a whole lot better than I ever could have

432
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.360
Jessica Freeman: And he wasn't raised, like I was raised.

433
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.640
Jessica Freeman: So it makes a difference. Oh, yeah.

434
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.860
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I know like his dad has taught him to be really tough.

435
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.150
Jessica Freeman: And I was never like that like I was

436
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:48.150
Jessica Freeman: All over the place with my emotions and whatever I was feeling at the time dictated everything that I did.

437
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:50.970
Jessica Freeman: And I had to learn

438
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.820
Jessica Freeman: in adulthood, not to do that.

439
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

440
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.310
Jessica Freeman: But he's he's learned how to compartmentalize and

441
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.080
Jessica Freeman: Be tough.

442
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.720
Jessica Freeman: Good for him, man.

443
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And guys, have the ability to do that. You know what I mean to compartmentalize where, you know,

444
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Women, you know, everything is interconnected in the brain, you know,

445
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.490
Yeah.

446
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so that makes a difference to you and how he responds to things, you know,

447
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.650
Jessica Freeman: He's not me. He's going to handle things

448
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:40.890
Jessica Freeman: A totally different way that I probably would couldn't even imagine. But he's very wise for his years he's responsible and grounded.

449
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:51.420
Jessica Freeman: And he's also highly intelligent, the way that his mind works like with math and science and stuff run circles around my head.

450
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:58.110
Jessica Freeman: So he's going to be fine. You know, I know it's going to be fine. I just need to be there support him.

451
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:00.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you're right.

495
00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People don't drink, you know, water, and they don't understand how important it is to emotions and to your brain function and you know your physical, you know, they just

496
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just don't. And so, you know, I always harp on are you drinking enough water are you sleeping enough. What are you putting in your body as far as food goes, it has to be good regulate the job. You know what I mean. And I probably sound like a broken record, but I know that to be 100% true

511
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.770

512
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.530

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.390
Jessica Freeman: Right, yes dancer.

519
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Apps absolutely love that. And I know my gosh I never thought that that could be a way of relieving stress of getting exercise of getting you in that happy place. And so I started saying that to people.

520
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can always act it out.

521
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.450

528
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I think as long as you communicate with them to tell them you know what's going on. And you know that given the circumstances. Definitely. And the fact that you're so new, you know that they're going to work with you in any way they can. I just have a feeling that they will

529
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.520
I hope so.

530
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm hoping that you meet more people

531
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:40.380

Jessica Freeman: He's single he has a 12 year old son, and we're just casually talking sometimes as I stopped by so I don't know. I'm going to keep an open mind about that and I'm not in any rush for anything. And obviously we're isolating so not getting close to anyone.

535
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:12.960
Yeah.

536
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:14.400

540
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:27.450
Jessica Freeman: And yeah, once all this is over. Maybe we can get to know each other better. Maybe not.

541
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Hmm. I like that don't attach yourself to the outcome.

542
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I like that.

543
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.050

544
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:37.650
Yeah.

545
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very I'm not like

546
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:42.960
Jessica Freeman: Having us married in my head. You know that's not happening.

547
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the near future. Anyways, right.

548
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:54.570
Jessica Freeman: Let's leave that open just leave it open. Who knows what's gonna happen.

549
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.180
Jessica Freeman: I am responsible for the effort.

550
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right. And you definitely we think that we're in charge. And then we find out the hard way that we're, we're actually not a jar versus kind of like a revelation. When we realized that

551
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.090
Jessica Freeman: I know the universe and

552
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's something else that's driving this force in our life because we

553
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.420
Jessica Freeman: Might as well surrender to it right

554
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a big eye opener for sure.

555
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.590
