Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, to be you know your judges. Like, you know, you do the time you do the crime here and Rock Canyon can go into the keys. You know, I use a lot of joking around and play. Oh, this guy is not feeling it right but I didn't know feeling nothing at that point. But so he does.

12
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Not feel

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I just have to mention it next month when you go to court.

17
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.310
Yeah, I'm not feeling I feel

18
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.110
Daniel Guerrero: Like, I don't know.

19
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.980
Daniel Guerrero: What

20
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not

21
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I had to talk to other clients and other people to understand what is this man saying to me.

22
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I use it every day all day, you feel me

23
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.900
Young

24
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and what I learned from from this program is a snap. I snap to it.

25
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I snapped to it. You use that one.

26
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Mo, I understand it. I, it occurred to me.

27
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember I snapped to it. I was like, Oh, I love that phrase, too. I love that one. I snap to it.

28
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.750
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, that's tough to you over here.

29
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, yeah. There's the lingo is two different, two different worlds.

30
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.360
Daniel Guerrero: That country to this country is two different worlds.

31
00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But I like it. I love language. I like like the stuff I bring I like you know what psychology brings a free some fancy words and I just like I like just want to use them all.

32
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.050
Daniel Guerrero: Right, I get that.

33
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.100
It's fun.

34
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's always shocking for people that will say something, because I don't look like I would say it, but

35
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.710
How are you doing over there, you

36
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.150
Daniel Guerrero: Know, just, uh,

37
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just taking it day by day in here so far so

38
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.500
Daniel Guerrero: I've been doing okay you know just struggling

39
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.300
Daniel Guerrero: With just home employment thing, you know.

40
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.530
Daniel Guerrero: I kind of feel like I'm back in the corner, you know, because

41
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:55.140
Daniel Guerrero: I have I have so many responsibilities and I live paycheck to paycheck and these responsibilities rely on that paycheck to paycheck, you know,

42
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to you about this, remember I was telling you about your PL calling the PO and saying, do you have a list.

43
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.180
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah, I called them. And we're like, well, you can come into the office. They know there's some

44
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:21.450
Daniel Guerrero: On the wall know we have some okay no resources that you can look for, you know, some employment. But other than that, we don't have anything here. You know, like

45
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the list that's on the wall.

46
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this legit, or are they just blowing smoke up, you know what, like is there really a list there.

47
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.920
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. You know, I think there's like a list, you know, if you know work like it to Goodwill. You know, there's a goodwill number and website you can get on there.

48
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.600
Daniel Guerrero: And there's

49
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.720
Daniel Guerrero: Of course you know all the local brands, you know, Taco Bell McDonald's, Burger King.

50
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard something else to

51
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I can't remember it verbatim, but it was something like this. I

52
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it was

53
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: mobile home construction. It was this organization was hiring.

54
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: felons with their record older than seven years.

55
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember.

56
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.180
Yours was

57
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:28.260
Daniel Guerrero: Mine, mine was a it's well I caught the charge in 2010 may of 2010 but I didn't get initially charged until August 13

58
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.060
Daniel Guerrero: So that makes the felony just under seven years old.

59
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:45.720
Daniel Guerrero: Well, when I got when I caught the felony. It's been over 10 years but because I didn't get sentence that year. It kind of kind of puts her. That's another thing. Yeah, well,

60
00:05:45.780 --> 00:06:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking about you when I heard this person say it because I'm constantly listening. It's not my place to take information that's not offered and share it with another if someone does offer it though I'll certainly pass it along to you.

61
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.000
Or not.

62
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But just even hearing that I'm passing it along to you because like some of the people that are under some sort of supervision status. Their POS yeah goodwill is one of them. And I'm pretty sure

63
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The race. I can camera friend who was told dollars an hour or not.

64
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Was between 10 and $12 I can't remember how much it was and it was it was good. Well,

65
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But this one, this one, this mobile home construction. I think it was mobile home construction. I was like, I was thinking about you.

66
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:39.690
Daniel Guerrero: I appreciate that.

67
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh gosh, she's moving and grooving um

68
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.130
Daniel Guerrero: That's something that's something that I like to do, you know, I like, I like to work outside. You know, like to work hard, you know, so

69
00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:02.550
Daniel Guerrero: Especially this time, you know, it's starting, you know, summer times come in, you know, we're in the middle of the spring right now and everything's just starting to come out and you know works going to start picking up but

70
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:10.920
Daniel Guerrero: You know the downfall of that is that you know come wintertime that that outside work and how that it slows down.

71
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:22.680
Daniel Guerrero: And so that's where I put myself in a position to where do I want where I can work all the time, or do I want to go get something seasonal and then have to worry about the winner, you know, and so

72
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.680
Daniel Guerrero: For me, it's kind of hard. You know, like yesterday for an example. You know, I had, I had a job interview at another place.

73
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:48.030
Daniel Guerrero: But the place that was going to be interviewing me. You know, they were they were only offering me 30 to 35 hours a week, you know, they wanted to bring me and, you know, just like a team member of Coke, whatever you want to call it. Yeah, and

74
00:07:50.400 --> 00:08:00.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know, right now, I just, I just can't afford to lose that dollar and I can't afford to lose you know there's 20 hours it dollar 20 hours is a lot for me, you know, it's a lot to lose.

75
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.940
Daniel Guerrero: When considering you know I'm I have seven kids in my house, you know, and

76
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:13.170
Daniel Guerrero: You know, my wife and I know we're doing the damnedest that we can do to stay above water and we're doing it, you know.

77
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are like working magic without money, I'm serious. Yeah.

78
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.120
Daniel Guerrero: And we're doing it.

79
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.690
And

80
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:28.230
Daniel Guerrero: So, you know, I just answer the grace of God that we're able to do this and but i just i just want more, you know, I want

81
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:38.370
Daniel Guerrero: It. I don't, I'm not trying to, like, not in a green sense, but in the sense, I just want to be comfortable to that, you know, not having a live paycheck to paycheck anymore where I can be like

82
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:45.510
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I got a couple extra hundred bucks in case I need it, you know, in a position that in the position that I am in

83
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:56.310
Daniel Guerrero: If one example. If my car breaks down or something, then I'm not paying one of my bills. I'm fixing my car because it's the way we go back and forth to work. Yep.

84
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:12.930
Daniel Guerrero: Instead of instead of us instead of it being. Oh, that's okay, because I have this extra three or $400 put up and I can use that and, you know, still pay my bills and just read, you know, add back into that money because what I want I initially wanted to do was

85
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.640
Daniel Guerrero: Well, for my my income tax. I wanted to

86
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.120
Daniel Guerrero: Like put $500 into a savings and then every time I check was deposited. I wanted to put

87
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.960
Daniel Guerrero: Five 5% of what my check was deposited into that account.

88
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.880
Daniel Guerrero: Well, but

89
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.060
Daniel Guerrero: I behind on

90
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.990
Daniel Guerrero: On tell us support because I went to prison. So, child support to my home complex. I mean, he took every bit of it.

91
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.250
Daniel Guerrero: And so that kind of ruined things for me and

92
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:56.970
Daniel Guerrero: But I just didn't get it because I'm on time right now as I speak as we speak. I have not missed to help a child support payment.

93
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.530
Daniel Guerrero: For almost a year now it's been since June of last year that

94
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:14.130
Daniel Guerrero: I've been paying child support, and they just continue to add on to adding on all these fields there that they can do and probably better than most people out there that are on child support.

95
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.190
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm not saying that I am, but I think that I'm doing a pretty good job of, you know, staying current with them.

96
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:27.960
Daniel Guerrero: And like I said, it's doing my job again because it's being garnished down to my check. So I depend on

97
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.050
Daniel Guerrero: Those responsibilities so much and this

98
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.590
Daniel Guerrero: Is like I said, I just feel like I'm you know I'm backed up in a corner swinging and I'm not winner.

99
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is an opportunity for you to talk about what feeling backed up in the corner is because these are the moments.

100
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.100
That test.

101
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.960
Your recovery.

102
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.270
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

103
00:10:51.690 --> 00:11:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you don't want to share that with your wife, maybe you don't want to kind of share your fear around what it's like to be backed in this corner where you're feeling like you've only got a couple of options.

104
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you tell me how it's getting well

105
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:08.970
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

106
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.870
Daniel Guerrero: It's not really that bad.

107
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.380
Daniel Guerrero: Because like I said, you know,

108
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.680
Daniel Guerrero: We might be in deep water, but we're staying up we're staying above the water so

109
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:33.240
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, at this point, the only thing that can get worse is, you know, not having a job because you know I'm doing okay.

110
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.120
Daniel Guerrero: It's just the whole point that being backed up in this corner that I'm talking about is that

111
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.960
Daniel Guerrero: No, I just, I just want more for for my kids. I just want to be able to do more, you know, for them.

112
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.930
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I have a daughter, she's going to be. I have one daughter.

113
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:59.220
Daniel Guerrero: just graduated, she was. She should have graduated. This year, you know, but I thank God that she got a full scholarship

114
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:07.260
Daniel Guerrero: To Abilene Christian University, you know, she got a full. A full scholarship to, you know, go to school there for nursing

115
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:19.140
Daniel Guerrero: So that, so that was really good, you know, she's got really good grades and stuff, you know, but you know how. And then my next daughter, it's coming up, you know, she's, she's going to be a junior that she's going to be a senior

116
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:34.320
Daniel Guerrero: And then she's going to be going to college and I, I want to, I want to be able to provide for her why she goes to college and, you know, get an education. And then, you know, prepare for her future. I just don't feel like I can do it where I'm at, you know, because I'm asking myself.

117
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:49.410
Daniel Guerrero: Where am I going to be at in five years with this company right you know and and it's something I asked my boss, you know, like, where do you see me in five years working at this company, you know, and it's just like

118
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.200
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I see, I see.

119
00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get another perspective, because I think you're feeling the corner the traps nervous. Okay. I think you're feeling all of that. Let's bring us back to the stuff that was getting you feeling optimistic. Let's go back to them. Okay.

120
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was this let me let me remind you of some of the things you've said.

121
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get my GED and education.

122
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I will call CCC and Clovis and see if they have daytime classes. Want to know the cost and schedule and if they're flexible. I want to be my own boss.

123
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had gotten the CCC placement testing was going to be some time on

124
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.980
Daniel Guerrero: I think it was actually

125
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.820
Daniel Guerrero: It was actually supposed to be on the 31st. It was supposed to have been Tuesday or whenever the 31st was Monday, whatever 30

126
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the 30th. But what happened.

127
00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:02.010
Daniel Guerrero: Well, they called me and they rescheduled I get I guess this this whole coronavirus is

128
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.770
Daniel Guerrero: Just completely shut down.

129
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:11.190
Daniel Guerrero: A lot of Clovis, you know, for an example like goodwill is not open

130
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.980
Daniel Guerrero: Some banks are not open. There are some establishment.

131
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.300
Daniel Guerrero: That are dying in only establishment. They're not open

132
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.430
Daniel Guerrero: And so

133
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.310
Daniel Guerrero: And closed Community College is one of those establishment. So it's not open or business.

134

136
00:14:49.140 --> 00:15:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: under construction. Do you know what I'm trying to say like they might be everybody schools. My kids are up in the house, going to school too because they can't go anywhere. So maybe they're shifting gears my college students are online.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So when was the last time you checked to see if they're if they're in the works. Trying to get that placement testing. So you don't have to lock in on for in person.

138
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.910
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven't

139
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.390
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

140
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:27.150
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I wanted to be honest man like I felt like it's just another closed door. You know, like, I know that because and because it feels that way.

141
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:34.770
Daniel Guerrero: I'm like, Damn, you know, I was going to try to do something positive. And, you know, closed door, you know,

142
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.080
Daniel Guerrero: But I try not to let it. I try not to stay there. Yummy. I

143
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what it although you're the one feeling the impact of that closed door you know 300 people also felt that close to our

144
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not personal. It's not about you. This whole planet.

145
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't about you. This is an opportunity for you to change the meaning of that closed door and say, well,

146
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And this. This is the hard stuff. This is where you The Testament of where is my conviction in this corner where I feel trapped, will I stay here. Keep feeding that negative appraisal like

147
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: My life is always going to be like this. I'm stuck with this and keep feeding it feeding feeding it or do you shift and go back to

148
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I did some dope shit.

149
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I've heard people I broke the law.

150
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: On paying for it, not just because of this felony that's sitting on me.

151
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Karma has stacked up and you don't go to shame. This is it. This is the hard part. We don't go to shame you just say

152
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know who setting this up. I don't know how they proportion out the punishment or whatever in this universe. But, uh,

153
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's what this is. I'm not God. I'm not the one delving this stuff out. I'm not dishing it out. But you know what

154
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe this is part of the balancing don't know. So I'm going to have to wait it out and I either self sabotage and throw my hands up in the air and say forget about college with these kids. I don't want. Think about it, or you stay in the fight.

155
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you look at it and say it's three years for the Sony drops off right

156
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, three years, dude, I've been a bright heart. It'll be three years in June. And when somebody asked me, how long you been working with them. I'm like one. Oh, wait, wait a minute, I gotta go look it up, it feels that fast.

157
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:51.780
Daniel Guerrero: Right, okay. And it's just like, and I'm glad you bring that up because it's like I already been home for almost a year. We're in April.

Daniel Guerrero: And from where I came from, you know, in this past year.

162
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:19.380
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I went I went from first walking then riding a bike to now I have a vehicle, you know, yes, you know, and so, and not only just one vehicle have to, you know, and

163
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:33.000
Daniel Guerrero: And then we moved into this different house because when my wife was on her own, you know, she was struggling, you know, so she could, she was only into what she was able to afford because of my absence.

164
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.670
Daniel Guerrero: But today is, you know,

165
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:50.670
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, I just, I just think we're such a good team because, you know, we, you know, we're able to put our differences aside, you know, to decide what works better, you know, and it's

166
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing. You're so fortunate

167
00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I just tell you how few people have that alongside having to deal with being you know in this sort of shelter status at home can't work car just broke down their kid has has his second needs to be taken to the hospital. They don't want to go. I mean, back to back to back.

168
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we really the recovery, the commitment to the recovery really gets tested and you happen to have someone that joins you in this journey and problem solves with you. You are very fortunate we really

169
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:41.340
Daniel Guerrero: I really appreciate that. And you know, we, and I mean don't get it twisted. You know what I mean, like, we do have, you know, we have some heated moments, you know. But who does not

170
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:53.310
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, it's like, as I was telling my wife yesterday, I was like, man, I said, we're just like every American out there except we live paycheck to paycheck with debt, you know, and as

171
00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:07.410
Daniel Guerrero: Well, because like I'm looking at my bank account right and I'm like damn were $225 overdrawn, you know, she's like, it's okay. You know, it's okay because there's Americans out there that are millions of dollars overdrawn

172
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.280
That's right.

173
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And and and by the way he Middle America right middle class are living paycheck to paycheck to. It's just that.

174
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Their check is more their mortgages more their car payment camp College, they're still living paycheck to paycheck the feeling

175
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of it, this could all fall apart. This can all dissolve next month, you're not alone. It just happens to be right that income brackets lower but if they're still feeling that same thing, right.

176
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we have a standard of living that meets our income, we just keep Oh wow, I can afford this. And then there. We all went no money in the bank again.

177
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:56.850

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.440
Right.

262
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:17.970
Daniel Guerrero: And then

263
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's not messing with with your work.

264
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.790
Daniel Guerrero: So that's a really good idea. You know I never really thought you know too much into all that

265
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.620
Daniel Guerrero: But it was me up different outlook on you know some goals to set

266
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:40.140
Daniel Guerrero: Because at the end of the day, you know, my goals are to you know make sure I provide for my family and just be well off, and I'm

267
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:51.090
Daniel Guerrero: Not always told my life, you know, I think, a pretty pretty good mechanic. If I can just, you know, put myself to it you know just how funny that that we're looking at this and all this pops up so

268
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.130
Daniel Guerrero: That obviously the lottery is not helping you know

269
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

270
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

271
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, we're just a bunch of worker bees. You know, we got to work right.

272
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How bad is it getting. Are you having cravings. I kind of need to check in on the severity of the negative thinking

273
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.020
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just like

274
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:40.170
Daniel Guerrero: You don't think I don't think I'm I don't know if it's if it's cravings, but I just like sometimes I feel myself, you know, taken just an extra piece, you know, I don't know if it's like just covering the crave or not.

275
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:45.600
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm not talking to a full strip before film, I'm talking like maybe another half

276
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.790
Daniel Guerrero: You know I get myself going in the daytime. You know, you know, feeling good feeling energetic

277
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.280
Daniel Guerrero: Know, getting focused

278
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.630
Daniel Guerrero: And there towards the end of the day, I'm just like,

279
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:07.020
Daniel Guerrero: It's not. Not too bad. Like, I'm thinking that maybe I should go know do something different. I just

280
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:12.480
Daniel Guerrero: Guys just take another another piece of that stripped and it's just like

281
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.040
Daniel Guerrero: No, I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's cravings. I don't know if it's if it's

282
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel after you take it out in a second. How do you feel after you take another piece of that struck

283
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:32.460
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just just you know right back in, you know, just right back in it. You know, I don't know if I'm just a bit become independent, you know,

284
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about in it. I don't know. This is where you know I love to play with words. But right now I'm going to be

285
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.670
Daniel Guerrero: One of those picky.

286
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: People I need to know what you mean by I feel like I'm right back in it. What are you back in right then.

287
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.360

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.260
Daniel Guerrero: I'm starting to get this down here.

291
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Stay right there. This is important stuff down shift is a metaphor I want to know how your body feels. Let's start with that. Tell me what you feel.

Okay.

293
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.780

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.000
Daniel Guerrero: Like bad or anything.

295
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.700
Daniel Guerrero: I just

296
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:38.460
Daniel Guerrero: More like a like a downshift I'm just like, I'm gonna, I don't know if I'm just like coming down off of it or

297
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's kind of this differently. So notice you're still trying to globally describe it. Good day, bad day down shift up shift. But that aside.

298
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know. Let's we'll do a scan.

Gwenevere Abriel: At about seven o'clock at night. Is there anything going on in your head in your up in this part of your body.

300
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.360
Daniel Guerrero: Yes. Okay. How about

301
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.340

Gwenevere Abriel: Skin

306
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:26.550
Daniel Guerrero: Or you know there for a while was getting real dry skin, but nothing like crazy. But what I'm saying. But what I'm, what I'm trying to say is, is

307
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.690
Daniel Guerrero: I get I guess it's like because

308
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:44.430
Daniel Guerrero: Because the way I'm using it is in the morning, like, you know, Dr embryos, you know, told me the way to take it whenever I first started talking to her.

Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, let me give you some props.

333
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: For even entertaining the idea right you're looking at it. You're it's you're hesitant to say it, but you're you're dipping your toe into I'm wonder if this is the same old, same old addictive behavior.

334
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're dipping your toe you dancing a little bit around it, but

335
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we're talking about it. You're, you're initiating the conversation. And that's very brave of you.

336
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just sit with that for a second. You could have omitted, which means not tell me what you're brave.

337
00:37:48.060 --> 00:38:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only all of this distress going on income feeling trapped in the corner kind of this stuff going on with with the you know the governor's orders to, you know, all the nonsense with the virus.

338
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're working at recovery program while this is all going on.

339
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and that's only naming a couple of your challenges you have

340
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot on your plate. Almost every domain of your life, you have a challenge.

341
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And on top of all of that you come to me and you say, I'm keeping myself in check. I'm telling someone I'm telling my therapist, I might be

342
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Using my subs.

343
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way, I use short acting opiate and

344
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:48.150
Daniel Guerrero: And yeah, and I agree with that 100%, you know, because I mean that's how I was when I was taking pills, man. I just, you know, a couple pills, you know, or you know oxy

345
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.080
Daniel Guerrero: oxy and a half know to get going.

347
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.660
Daniel Guerrero: Two in the morning. No three at lunch.

348
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.690
Daniel Guerrero: No in the afternoon, another one and a half know just to finish out the night

349
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:15.660
Daniel Guerrero: Sometimes, you know, and if I couldn't find odysseys. I was taking Percocet, or I was taking hydrocodone and they're not as strong. So I'm taking 10 and 12

350
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:21.750
Daniel Guerrero: Of those a day instead of, you know, two or three or four

351
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:23.430
Daniel Guerrero: And

352
00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.560
Daniel Guerrero: I know it's just the addictive personality. I'm seeing it, you know, and

353
00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to stay right there for a minute. What are you hearing me give you praise You smell.

354
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: He's letting that in

355
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now, because you do know you can be slick and not tell me right

356
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.530
There's no

357
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You like you didn't have to tell me

358
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.830
Daniel Guerrero: What you

359
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: There's must be some part of you.

360
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That wants to heal wants to really recover from this chemical dependence.

361
00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There must be some part of you that thinks I can live without this stuff. I can find myself again. I'm guessing there's

362
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some parking lots that

363
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.580

365
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.840
Daniel Guerrero: Because, you know, when I was a kid, you know, it's just like I was I was still responsible, you know, I'm starting to see them.

366
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:32.280
Daniel Guerrero: Traits come back, you know, as you know, as, like I said, I've been home for a year, almost. And in that year. You know, I've, you know, I've become

367
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:47.700
Daniel Guerrero: more responsible than I ever have been I i've never been out. I've never been out for a year and not gone back to Joe like on a probation violation or have not gone back to jail on driving on revocation or not going back to Jill on just something

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.080
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

369
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.040
Daniel Guerrero: For the call.

370
00:40:50.310 --> 00:41:00.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know, for the past for the past 12 years I've been in and out of jail at least twice, three or four times a year or even prison.

371
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.480
Daniel Guerrero: And I haven't, you know,

372
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.640
Daniel Guerrero: This hasn't happened.

373
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it didn't happen magically it's because of your conscious effort.

374
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking very hard to make this

375
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Happen.

376
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.810

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Using motivation of

398
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I want my marriage to work.

399
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

400
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:23.130
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, just

401
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:28.170
Daniel Guerrero: Just being able to provide for my kids, you know, feels good, because I stopped and I have never done.

402
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.460
Daniel Guerrero: No, you can wait.

403
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.000
Daniel Guerrero: So,

404
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.150
Daniel Guerrero: That's that's really important for me know

405
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.630
Daniel Guerrero: Let's be honest. That's quite like the main thing right now that that's working for me because

406
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.340
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it feels good to know that if they can depend on me. It feels good.

407
00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:02.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know, for them to be like, Hey, Dad, I need this or can we get that and, you know, of course, I first, you know, given bullshit. You know, like, Nah, you really don't need that.

408
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:14.760
Daniel Guerrero: Second really help you know and I'm like, all right, you know, and it feels good. It feels good to do that kind of stuff. No, I mean it's it, you know, and it's just like, you know, like little crap you know that

409
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:23.280
Daniel Guerrero: That makes them feel important. And it makes me feel good, you know, they're not getting involved in what they're involved in, you know, like

410
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:33.870
Daniel Guerrero: It's just little stuff, you know, I, my kids. They love to watch this new things called Tick tock. You know, they're always sharing these videos with me and you know so I get involved with them, you know, I sit there and watch it with them.

411
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.950
Daniel Guerrero: Are just just whatever the case may be, you know, it's just

412
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.310
Daniel Guerrero: That's what keeps me out. That's what keeps me in line.

413
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.060
Okay.

414
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, well then you can see how closely the importance of having an income is to you because right behind that is real. I like this feeling of providing and being able to give my children what they need and want

415
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So money. That's why we spent the first half of this discussion about it and we're back to it again. It's important to you. So when you're when you're telling me I am

416
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Using more than what is prescribed on my medicine bottle.

417
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you. This is your first. I think your first real recovery program so words like self medicating although you may have heard it once or twice. It may still feel a little wobbly. Like, what's she talking about

418
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the same thing. You're engaging in addictive behavior. Now I don't have a moral judgment about that there's just going to be a consequence. That's just the way it works. If I use more than is prescribed. I'm going to run out.

419
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:54.480
Daniel Guerrero: Right. And it and it's up to don't fear in you know because I don't want to. I don't want to put myself in a position where I'm like,

420
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:56.760
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

421
00:45:59.010 --> 00:45:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

422
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm going to disagree.

423
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: With those same people now they know where I live now I'm back with that now I'm starting to

424
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:05.490
Daniel Guerrero: Think

425
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I can make some extra money in it, you're back in it again.

426
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.750
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, and that's something that, you know, like me, personally.

427
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.410
Daniel Guerrero: I'd be damned if I go down that road, you know,

428
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're going, you're on it.

429
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.190
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I know that and that's

430
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

431
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So we just, you can stop today and get back on the road, you want to be on. It's just that simple, simple for me to say but difficult to do. I want to talk to you about a couple of things I want to talk to you about

432
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We all get tired.

433
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I get tired.

434
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I get tired humans get tired using your brain, the way are you are working so hard every single day humans get tired you have been asking of your human body more effort than maybe is reasonable.

435
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's not about

436
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's 930 at night. I shouldn't be tired Yeah, you should be

437
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I know your attention is divided

438
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But

439
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:11.880
This is offering

440
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.090
Daniel Guerrero: Alone just even toward

441
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, once you say a proper goodbye. So I get your full attention on this. This is no

442
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:20.850
Daniel Guerrero: She's gone.

443
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.610
Daniel Guerrero: She's out in the garage in the car. Yeah.

444
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.480
Okay.

445
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

446
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: These are real, like I'm keeping it real. It is self medicating behavior.

447
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You may run out there will be a consequence you might decide, you know what I'm going to run a game on Bret Hart health. I'm going to tell them. Someone stole it. I'm going to tell them something I'm going to blah, blah, blah.

448
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We've heard it all went

449
00:47:51.810 --> 00:48:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To bed so sad. You're going to be stuck days without it. Now, that's not the whole truth the truth could be you go pay out of pocket for it at CVS, but that's expensive.

450
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, the prescription might be there, the physician might write it and as sitting there, but now that money that you are giving them for those

451
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That cool toy those cool shoes, those things that you wanted that joy that you get from getting to your children, your addiction got fed

452
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can understand

453
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.290
Daniel Guerrero: Daniel

454
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All get tired, you may have been asking too much of yourself to begin with, as far as energy goes

455
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple of things can play with Play with this maybe talking with your prescribing physician about well what would happen if I didn't. If I took it at 1030 in the morning. Instead, what if I did laundry, which takes very little cognitive effort. I don't really have to be that great.

456
00:48:59.070 --> 00:48:59.400
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

457
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Laundry.

458
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I could be just like

459
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:07.860
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I get that.

460
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be a zombie from eight to 10 take that at 10 then that's going into my last those two hours, get me to 930 and frankly, we're supposed to be tired at 930

461
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:23.310
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, that's true.

462
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the irrational thinking, I am not allowed to be tired. That's that I'm a provider mentality. I'm a man. I'm not supposed to be tired. I gotta, I gotta be hundred percent all the time.

463
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not 100% nobody is that's the part that needs to change. You're going to be tired. So what because someone said you're not doing a good job, or is that coming from you.

464
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.780
Daniel Guerrero: Know, just like that, um,

465
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:59.280
Daniel Guerrero: Me personally, I think I've raised my standards, you know, because because of where I'm at, you know, you make some really good points. And I want to take these and

466
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.970
Daniel Guerrero: You know, first of all, I don't

467
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:16.770
Daniel Guerrero: I wanted, I wanted, I wanted to be able to know it soon be able to start coming off of these and you know be at a new normal. You know, like we talked about in a group, you know, and the new normal.

468
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.780
Daniel Guerrero: And

469
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:24.150
Daniel Guerrero: That's why I was able, you know, to talk about this and so

470
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:28.830
Daniel

471
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.340
Daniel Guerrero: I know this is hard.

472
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got it. You've got what it takes. I can tell you, you have done more difficult things you have faced probably life fret threatening encounters with people in your life.

473
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:44.880
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, yeah.

474
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Being tired being tired. If you use your rational mind.

475
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not life threatening. In the moment you think it is, it's perceived threat.

476
00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because you run it through all my lose my house. I will lose respect to my children, it'll feel like that in the moment. That's where you're gonna have to remember you and your commitment to recovery.

477
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The old way of thinking that I am how much money I have in my pocket that old way of thinking.

478
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got to fade away.

479
00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get to the point, not, not today because you're you're doing the self medicating that's informing our work together. So we're going to work on that part. We're going to get. We're going to make whatever shift is needed.

480
00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can say to yourself, I'm enough. I'm enough people want to turn tired and don't matter.

481
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get this done because my commitment to my recovery. My family, my values is so much stronger. Look what I've done this year I'm out, I'm out in the community. This is great.

482
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You did this.

483
00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It is one night at a time.

484
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get that groove when you really see you know what I've been asking that I need to be really like, you know, high energy so that I'm charming and I'm entertaining and and I can get this work done. Maybe I've been asking something unreasonable of myself.

485
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe nobody can do that. We can't stay high energy all day long. That's not how the body works. We have circadian rhythms. It wants you to go to sleep, you might be pushing yourself too hard.

486
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been doing that a long time.

487
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:35.010
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

488
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you know, I'm not trying to tell you, don't, don't take care of family and no you know not saying that I'm saying sometimes we just have to show up dead tired.

489
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:48.720
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

490
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.280
Daniel Guerrero: No.

491
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.260
Daniel Guerrero: No, and I and I agree with that 100%. No, it's

492
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:57.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know it has to

493
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:04.560
Daniel Guerrero: You know, come down on level, you know. Because if not, you know, it's going to get out of control, you know. And that's not something that I'm

494
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:07.170
Daniel Guerrero: I think I

495
00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.710
Daniel Guerrero: Don't think I'm willing to do that, you know, because

496
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:11.700
Daniel Guerrero: I know

497
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.180
Daniel Guerrero: How to control you know it's not good. No.

498
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how close it is. I mean, you do see how quick it went

499
00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

500
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on day three without it. I didn't tell when I don't want to tell the physician. I don't want to spend money picking it up. Oh, you are sweating throwing up diarrhea bones bacon. What are you going to do

501
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't go to work like that. Or can you and now what are you gonna do now, you now you're adding voice inside is like, look, you know what you got to do.

502
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got the authentic the loving spiritual Daniel has to fight back at the voice of addiction and say, We cannot

503
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Use

504
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside of was prescribed on the bottle. I don't want to hear it. You've got to literally in your mind when when it says you can take a little bit more say no. I also can't sell it. I also can't give it to a friend, I cannot divert that medicine.

505
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna follow the law.

506
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.750
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

507
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it's like why

508
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, this you fighting for your recovery for that life you want

509
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.860
Daniel Guerrero: You know, that's important to me to, you know,

510
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you see that when you took a little more. There was a decision of what's more important.

511
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna mess with my recovery, a little bit.

512
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be without energy

513
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:49.980
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

514
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It just went up.

515
00:54:52.320 --> 00:55:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't. And so recovery drop down we tell you what happened when recovery is not in the forefront of your mind like every day. I've got a standpoint.

516
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I doing the next right thing. So the next right thing happens these other things that you care about being able to ride for your family being able to look your children right in the eye and say, Tell the truth.

517
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You can manage your anger your fear your anxiety and your sadness, you can handle it without drinking without smoking weed.

518
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Without doing a drug, you've got what it takes to handle your life, you can look them in the eye and honestly telling them, you're going to get there, but can you do that today.

519
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.950
Daniel Guerrero: No, no.

520
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can never tell whether it's sort of my imagination that I think these are the things you want, but sometimes you'll talk to me about sort of wanting to sort of

521
00:55:51.090 --> 00:56:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Align more spiritually and sort of with those beliefs and really wanting this this vision of a life that you didn't have when you were a kid and I think you're working very hard at it.

522
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But a relapse can literally start getting set up a year in advance. It's that slow. It's slippery. One day, it's this. What's the big fuss when I took one 16th more. What's your frickin problem, right, you might be saying, lay off.

523
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.940
Daniel Guerrero: No.

524
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm just saying. That's how I talk to me. Right.

525
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So, and I, I can hear it. I know it's not you. I know it's the attic talking to me, defending itself justifying itself. But I'm talking to Daniel, the one that talks about the love he has for His children.

526
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And the trauma traumatic childhood. He had and how he wants to change your generation. It happens one day at a time where you face.

527
00:56:53.370 --> 00:57:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Being tired and you are still a man you are still a good person who's tired, who's working a difficult recovery program has chemically dependent on some and and you're kicking ass. You're doing great. But it does mean you're gonna be a little tired.

528
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm also saying, What if we shifted. When you take it just you, same amount of medicine just moving it forward.

529
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit because of your work schedule and maybe it means you tell your family. Listen, I'll be sort of Joe's or drowsy don't become an army at eight o'clock in the morning, you know,

530
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:39.690
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know what I'm going to be honest, I never thought about putting that into, you know, I'm just like, Oh, gotta take it this time that ticket at this time, you know, and

531
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, so

532
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That the doctor said, take it every day. But so you can take what I'm saying, because I'm not a physician, you can take what I'm saying.

533
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.340
Daniel Guerrero: It makes me. Yeah, no.

534
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.070
Daniel Guerrero: No. Why am I getting up at eight o'clock in the morning. I want to sleep in Tristan, you know,

535
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm saying

536
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but you see it right. It's like the message is the on the message is be consistent.

537
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all it's taken at that she's saying, take it at the same time every day. So you might just take it at

538
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 o'clock every day. That's all the differences. It means it moves it up a little bit. So maybe maybe doing that and see if you like the outcome.

539
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.130
Daniel Guerrero: Now you know something I want to know.

540
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to tell me. Here we are with 60 seconds. I know that's not much time. But what was it like to tell me

541
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I was taking a little piece.

542
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:44.850
Daniel Guerrero: I'm

543
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:55.020
Daniel Guerrero: Kind of, you know, I'll be honest with you, maybe just a little bit shameful because, you know, I've been. I've been working so hard, you know, not to not to fall into this area.

544
00:58:56.010 --> 00:59:04.590
Daniel Guerrero: And and so, you know, like, to me, it's kind of disturbing. You know, because I know that I know that I'm capable and and you know to

545
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:12.930
Daniel Guerrero: To stand my ground with this, you know, and I just a little bit of weakness. You know, so I need to overcome that, you know, weakness, and

546
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.740
Daniel Guerrero: I know I can do it. You know, it's just

547
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we look at it differently in it. Let's end today like this. What if we don't name call. What if we don't name called Daniel week. Do you mind if I do some some swear words for a second.

Gwenevere Abriel: Tell the addict to fuck off.

553
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand that's the one that wants. Hey baby, you know you're tired. Come on, take a little piece of pitching GOING TO KNOW THAT IS THE ONE GET BACK. You've got to have that inner dialogue inside your head.

554
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how nasty. I am. You don't be nice to the addict inside
