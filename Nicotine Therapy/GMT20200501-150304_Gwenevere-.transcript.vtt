46
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.340
Because it's

47
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.870

48
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What did they tell you. Well done. What did they tell you they can do to help you.

51
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, I see. So the

52
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The treatment is wait until feeling better.

53
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:07.170

77
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:09.150
Laura Lujan: So the fans, drop it up for Berlin orders, because they don't like Google, however, they're okay with this Google thing, things would change doesn't make any sense at all.

79
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.340

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.800
Laura Lujan: From four to six point

81
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for change. Okay, so

82
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.570
Laura Lujan: I did my first class yesterday or the day before it is pretty cool. I mean,

83
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.330
Laura Lujan: I I got in trouble. A little bit.

84
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So awesome.

85
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:48.720
Laura Lujan: SO IT'S MY OPINION TOO MUCH LIKE I gave the opposite like for someone to voice their like saying, I don't know why not me, but then I would defend the other times not. I mean,

86
00:09:49.680 --> 00:10:03.720
Laura Lujan: I don't know why I did it a couple months ago, just because a lot of before me, fair, I felt like I felt like you know before just getting a book by it's cover anything, you know, nowadays, and I'm like, well, the psychology of it and how it how it is that

87
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.520
Laura Lujan: You know there's ecology shows that like you know there's reason why people do opportunity.

88
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.310
Laura Lujan: So, you know, maybe there is a reason why I show or so hits over time, whatever.

89
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.380
Laura Lujan: So,

90
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They were doing.

91
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: They were doing a

92
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a role play

93
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And what side are you on

94
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.310
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

95
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the just so I know what was the other side called

96
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.830
Laura Lujan: So, okay, like the whole story was

97
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:46.320
Laura Lujan: This lady thought that he didn't understand where her uncle or whatever was so cool will be around for the after

98
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:58.740
Laura Lujan: Child abuse. Okay, I need abuses his kids or whatever her cousin or something and and he just didn't. And she said, understand what our goal is so cool with it. I don't play playing like nothing happened.

99
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:09.120
Laura Lujan: And she said she thought that it was weird and wrong and totally, you know, ignore everything and just shows that he's just a bigger time most of them are a bigger child if he doesn't, she thought.

100
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:17.160
Laura Lujan: No, I'm saying, well, maybe you don't know as finding what they teach these guys in prison to do is to you know move on with their lives to forget it.

101
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:32.310
Laura Lujan: So, you know, make sense of it all is a pilot. He was taught to new. He probably does. So right around that. He probably does like have a heart about it, but he was taught to this mother go directly to the sales side. And I think class stop do

102
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.690
Laura Lujan: It.

103
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.310
Laura Lujan: But

104
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.270
Laura Lujan: So I told her that. And she got her to matter because

105
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It was this was this real meaning.

106
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.300
This other

107
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: One was this woman in the group talking about her own uncle was this a real story for this woman in the group.

108
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.910
Laura Lujan: Oh, no, no, no.

109
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: A hypothetical scenario.

110
00:11:59.340 --> 00:11:59.760
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

111
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.130
Laura Lujan: It was active in a scenario that we read a story about

112
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.000
Laura Lujan: Yeah, okay. She was just defending that react. It was a real scenario I wouldn't know.

113
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you think you got in trouble.

114
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:20.130
Laura Lujan: Because like you can just tell you, like this really like after I said that. So the good attitude about it like this is like a whole because we're on a group chat.

115
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.630
Laura Lujan: Or you can feel

116
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:33.510
Laura Lujan: I was on my computer my life. So I can say, well, I'm face and I never done that before. I always my phone. So every group chat ever done like with whatever we do, I'll use my phone. I don't use my

117
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:44.670
Laura Lujan: Computer well but this thing you want change. I finally use my computer, I was able to see her. So, and you can tell she's having a weird like, I will, you know, not sure like let it go.

118
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.360
Oh,

119
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, for the record, I want you on the computer to

120
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you on the computer to

121
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.900
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

122
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

123
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:10.770
Laura Lujan: It was just that, like, well, I have more or less only my computer and it was four o'clock and i was i needed his phone or whatever. So because I use my boyfriend phone number. I do.

124
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when you meeting group. I'd rather you be on the computer. Because what you just got from thinking from change you're picking up on facial expressions, it matters.

125
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because a lot of our communication comes from from those expressions and

126
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes you might pick up on something and over react or under react and I would be able to see

127
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What you are talking about, like, oh yeah, I saw that, too. Um, I wonder how you made meaning out of that and I didn't or a look what she did.

128
00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we can talk more about it. It's more stuff for us to talk about. So I want you to be able to have a response to what someone's face looks like including mine, mine too. But I'm not the most important person in there. Um,

129
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.320
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I've heard you do that like whenever you say how you talk to her, whatever, like

130
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.420
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I didn't see me though.

131
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can possibly do that on a computer, that'd be great because then you could see people's faces and you can come to me later in individual therapy and you can say

132
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened to you I you could say, Boy, I really felt like irritated with so and so and agus this dismissive kind of posture.

133
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we can talk about it.

134
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

135
00:14:51.870 --> 00:15:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. Yeah, I mean, you can see the other clients if you swipe the screen on your phone, you should be able to see us but

136
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Little

137
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's kind of hard to see see face little facial expressions.

138
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When when they're so small.

139
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.220
Laura Lujan: Yeah, okay.

140
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.380
Laura Lujan: All right away.

141
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.280
Laura Lujan: That thing where my appeal. I never did it. What are the ballgame relatable and

142
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.430
Laura Lujan: I'm

143
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.060
Laura Lujan: Like to report to him.

144
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You saying a release.

But yes, kind of, kind of, pretending like it never happened.

174
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.570
Laura Lujan: I'm trying to do that. It was like I said it was

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's just show up.

180
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.100
Laura Lujan: You know what I mean.

181
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.590
Laura Lujan: When I was in a car and we were

182
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that one might be that one might have been hard.

183
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.470
Laura Lujan: But I so i guess i still kind of showed up with every time I didn't get in the car.

184
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I would have seen. Oh, you're on your way. Dennis, you would have been like see love them right here.

185
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference. It would have shown your commitment to it. It's

186
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm already getting group.

191
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to drive anywhere. You just have to log in.

192
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It was really not as difficult as having to drive all the way or get gas money or bus. Many are borrowing and car.

193
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The only change is a little bit more accountability and I know you have an idea because I've seen how hard you work. So it's there. But when you're in a lot of pain. It's hard to think about anything else.

194
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.690
Laura Lujan: normally put order.

Gwenevere Abriel: You're in a bit. It just means you show up anyway. And you can say, I mean, look, I'm in so much pain. I'm on my way to take care of this.

199
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When can I go to another group and then I get to say, no problem. And then I give you another group and then you go to that one. But now we're on Friday, and you've not gone to group.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can put it before, that works fine.

214
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not actually that fussy about it doesn't really matter to me but

215
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And so what's the other thing I'm looking for

216
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.400
Laura Lujan: The like pre chopped

217
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.440

Laura Lujan: Yeah so pre trial is

219
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, nice. Okay, cool. All right, and then it sounds like he wants a letter for me soon.

220
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:12.030
Laura Lujan: Know, like I said. He just, he's asking him what I was doing, because I guess do it over the other comes over.

221
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:29.370
Laura Lujan: She told me she told she called him and asked him about putting anything we can program and ask them, I was doing therapy sessions on my own. And he said, Well, yeah, she is that are on record owner color when they call me here, like, you know,

222
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. I'll wait for you to do the release and then I'll wait for you to tell me, hey, when can you send a letter. I'm going to wait for you to tell me

223
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.550
Okay.

224
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's go talk about something other than rules and all of that stuff. Let's talk about what's really going on for you.

225
00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The dynamics between you and your step mom I hit invited last time this sort of radical acceptance of the fact that she may not be capable of

226
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The level of honesty, maybe that you are and

227
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you make any change around the way you're talking to her.

228
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:21.060
Laura Lujan: Well, right now, she's gone. The last night, and she was because Cinderella.

229
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:28.350
Laura Lujan: And she was like, she did you find any reason the model that was my goal. And I think nine over here.

230
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:39.330
Laura Lujan: And so she called me and said, like an hour, two hours talking about she's also he told me the other day. He wanted my help. Right. And I was like, well, yeah, of course. You know, I want you know

231
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:55.230
Laura Lujan: You think you can help me, help me. And so she was trying to sit there and say that she called she spent 35 MINUTES OF HER NAME CALLING around to the rehab facilities and I'm pretty see what facilities would take your

232
00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.080
Laura Lujan: Patient treatment. And I guess there are three of them that call my my insurance or whatever.

233
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:09.000
Laura Lujan: And I guess out of those three one, she would like she told me to read it shadow mountain or whatever, someone to write it down.

234
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:21.270
Laura Lujan: And problem myself whenever, but she called and they said that they do not need a program and she was asking me if you know if I wanted to get into like a 90 day program right away.

235
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:37.650
Laura Lujan: And I asked her, like, yes, I'm like, I'm not trying to be rude, but you're not trying to follow my dad already, you know, why would I do that and I must be kidding. I'm just worried about it. Like, it just seems to me like you know you said we have

236
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.080
Laura Lujan: To

237
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Rewind relying

238
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me why you want rehab.

239
00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:07.830
Laura Lujan: Because of the fact that impatient with look better in front of the judge if I go in front of you know just on my child and say, Hey, I didn't vision rehab, you know, blah, blah, blah. I have him about hopefully they'll just keep me in and patient enhancements.

240
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

241
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, that's a possibility that the judge will see it is better, not everyone needs treatment. The other

242
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The other benefit you won't be there with your dad.

243
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.130
Laura Lujan: Yeah, yeah, that part.

244
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I don't hate that idea either

245
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.310
Laura Lujan: He liked the idea so much twice a week. But, you know,

246
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's the first one. The second piece.

247
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What what what what what I'm

248
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is this thought about calling cops on dad like where's that coming from, what is that

249
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.350
Laura Lujan: Because every day.

250
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.270
Laura Lujan: You know, during the morning I guess so. My dad called me like

251
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:12.690
Laura Lujan: And I call me like 1045 on Sunday morning and move on. Laura. Laura, Laura. I was I've had a sore throat, two days. No. Okay.

252
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:28.530
Laura Lujan: Yeah, you told me last night which point. Well, okay. Well, like you need to test it for Frodo again. I'm like, Okay, well, I already got, like, no, like, just because you have to start over today doesn't mean you have for not nearly

253
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.420
Laura Lujan: Enough, and you can hear it and he was flowing dry humor like soldier.

254
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:42.270
Laura Lujan: Template about in the morning and I'm like, are you kidding me and he's all will look, watch, watch. Check it out. I'm going to go take a shower probably back

255
00:27:42.690 --> 00:28:01.800
Laura Lujan: I'm here, I'm working on homework today. And then I found out from so long and I pray that he passed on to like one, and he says omen. And so like she told me she like that and it makes me wonder because you always said you know I was leaving, I was leaving, I was doing drugs.

256
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.360
Laura Lujan: Blah, blah, blah.

257
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

258
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't understand that he's supposed to be leaving me. He is supposed to be leaving maybe supposed to be leaving me

259
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what you mean. What does that mean,

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:23.340
Laura Lujan: In my step mom like my mom. Okay. My mom said that she supposed to be lean like he was so close. Good evening.

261
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Close to leaving. I was so close to leaving because I don't like a husband. That's cast out. Right. Why would she called the police husbands can pass out all they want to

262
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.940
Laura Lujan: Because according to her.

263
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not

264
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

265
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.790
Laura Lujan: Know I know she did creating

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.980
Laura Lujan: Yeah, this is the water. Yeah, there's nothing exciting to remind ourselves there and you're

267
00:28:53.610 --> 00:29:02.160
Laura Lujan: Right. But when as a harmless shrunk to be honest, like unless unless he's mad. He's almost 2 billion. He's bouncing off whatever but like he

268
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:12.360
Laura Lujan: So I won't want it badly done right. Well, you could walk up the stairs and she's while I'm going to call the cops. I'm used to being being so direct you can't walk up the stairs and my dad's like okay

269
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:19.260
Laura Lujan: When I'm in my house like whatever, and so he just was not on a cash and stock, and I laughed my ass off. And I was like, oh my god.

Gwenevere Abriel: It's really what law is he breaking

273
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:46.260
Laura Lujan: She's gonna, I guess, shooting a card for what's the current work well for tech, which I've done before. I'm okay.

274
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:54.900
Laura Lujan: I'm good. Like, I don't know. I'm more worried about him, you know, he thought into science. It's not from them. At that point, they would keep them from that and

275
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.530

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so far, the way you're describing the relationship with your step mom is the same as last week. So what I asked you earlier was have you done anything differently so that you're not sucked into the drama that was really when I was asking.

282
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.760
Laura Lujan: Yeah, yeah. So one more time. I would

287
00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:02.910
Laura Lujan: There's nothing like there's nothing you could say that I'm doing is I'm not doing it. There's no red flags. But you know, I mean, I'm talking to my feeling like he was actually my life.

288

Laura Lujan: Calling OR WHATEVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE. They don't mix the two credits don't turn into one. However, if you send both of these credits to another university, then they all become more

301
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Know when I did was I learned that you can do.

Laura Lujan: But, um, so I had that transcription ever and I was able to pull it up from all my old young people going over that I had on my email and I send that person to CNN and it went through. I was surprised because of the UN and credits on it needs to be.

304

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

316
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.550
Laura Lujan: And then there's one more. I don't remember. I wrote it down.

317
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What day do you start classes.

318
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.490
Laura Lujan: Remember,

319
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.480
Laura Lujan: I've just been

320
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:59.580
Laura Lujan: My dog is about clinical I usually don't like all my classes because I'd rather be in person for

321
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.880
Laura Lujan: This kind of taught me a lot. Oh.

322
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.060
Laura Lujan: I'm gonna like the online, a little bit more

323
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's great.

324
00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you applied for two jobs.

325
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And

326
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What has it been like. In other words, if you're staying at your boyfriend's house and step mom is okay with it this week she wasn't last week, but this week. She's been okay with it. She

327
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:42.390
Laura Lujan: Will tell me anything because I you know I ok and then a major reason why I defend your life, leaving. She was being rude I she started turning on really

328
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:54.660
Laura Lujan: Weird and religiously, and I know the reason why she got to go home. So a few weeks ago and they were finally like, you know, effects are finally like happening.

329
00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:08.340
Laura Lujan: So she was all messed up or whatever for like a week now she's fine again she's told me last night. She was like, I know what you asked us to do the my home. So I said, Yeah, I know it's a lot to do today. And again, it's not why. But if you want to believe that

330
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:10.380
Laura Lujan: You

331
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: break, break, break, break,

332
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

333
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: My question, again, though this is just this is about you, about what you have done.

334
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In your thinking.

335
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And

336
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're saying just check and see because you avoided her you did some really cool things apply for jobs and got connected with school which is exciting.

337
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I was asking you to do last week was to try a behavioral experiment and to change your thinking and to change what you say.

338
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

339
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do

340
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't do that.

341
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:11.820
Laura Lujan: I got it is my dad like we started. Are you sorry sorry I'm not yet.

342
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay. These are

343
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There, they're very hard to do.

344
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.380
Laura Lujan: Sorry.

345
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I mean, it's your life. It doesn't affect mine any does it

346
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.520
Laura Lujan: Right, that's not

347
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:32.490
Laura Lujan: Right.

348
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's instead let's let's think about what made it hard, let's actually take a second and and figure out what made it hard.

349
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me, Dad said this, I thought this and I got angry or defensive or scared or something. Well, what happened between you and your dad.

350
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.730
Laura Lujan: My dad said that

351
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.650
Laura Lujan: We have with me.

352
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.470
Laura Lujan: And I got

353
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.950
Laura Lujan: So caught up now.

354
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.250
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

355
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah so

356
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one.

357
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Any rehab, which is there's no such word as rehab. By the way, it's a residential level of care.

358
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye. But anyway, any one that's any good won't let family members, the in group together.

359
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No way.

360
00:37:44.640 --> 00:38:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: No way. No way. No way. No way. And if they did, you would call the licensing board and you'd complain like you. That's how bad that is you cannot, you can't be in a group with someone who assaulted you and and if they didn't, let's say you guys were best friends. I still

361
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.480
Laura Lujan: Love her yes or

362
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if you are best friends. I still would not have you in group.

363
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.370
Together.

364
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.830
Laura Lujan: When we come up, like, you know, like the bias like that everything is dating bias.

365
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's on ethical. Did you hear that word.

366
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.840
Laura Lujan: Yeah yeah

367
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.030
Laura Lujan: Yes, good word.

368
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a fact. So in in behavioral health, um,

369
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I have siblings that are here, I have spouses that are here and they both want to work with me.

370
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, I can't

371
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've already started working with one

372
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And no matter how good I am. And I'm pretty good at staying objective.

373
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it. I can't treat both siblings. Exactly.

374
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

375
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one. Yeah, so that's why in professional ethics. It's unless you're in a remote area and there's no choice. It's either there's nobody or there's just this one treatment facility, then

376
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's scary or, uh, but

377
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But you still have a right to refuse treatment Laura, you can say you have a right to say, let's say you go to this rehab. You get to say I am not comfortable with being in group was the same person who has hurt me.

378
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And they have to, they will have to get move them out of there.

379
00:39:52.410 --> 00:40:08.760
Laura Lujan: But that makes her why, even though because he grew up in Nashville. So this tiny little sign up. You're like, everyone knows everybody everybody everybody like straight up like I just almost impossible to find somebody like you didn't have today isn't related to us, you know, if I get

380
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:25.350
Laura Lujan: If I found ridiculous. I tried it, but like my dad like mess around with my with my brother. His brother's wife and I and then my okay my own home. His wife old are all day. Rather, I would rather

381
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.500
Laura Lujan: Say, I totally ridiculous but anyways.

382
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:34.020
Laura Lujan: Like that makes sense. It kind of, I guess, like made me laugh I growing

383
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:46.410
Laura Lujan: Pain, maybe, I don't know, I'm looking to buy into it but like the whole thing where you can have an ethical and we do that by waving okay because you're writing down what you know.

384
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The community that he grew up in there were overlaps.

385
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.350
In

386
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And

387
00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's incumbent, which means it's the responsibility of the professional to protect those ethics, you don't have you as the client, you're not responsible for knowing that it's on us to protect those

388
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We go to classes so that we know where they are so that we can protect you. You guys don't know that it's because it's professional ethics, we take classes every other year on it. So we keep abreast of what the laws are

389
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: professional ethics.

390
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way you would have you two would be in the same. No way. Oh.

391
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:50.850
Laura Lujan: Well, I forgot that was ridiculous. And I just, I felt like laughing and faith, and he's like, you know, we're not with you. I'm like, No, no, you listen and unless there's nothing happened. I'm sorry.

392
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:59.700
Laura Lujan: I did for once can use let me have a spotlight on some points and I just felt like, well, right, I mean, I'm not trying to be like a big about it or whatever.

393
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Number two, professional ethics was number one. Number two, there's no effing way your dad's ready to stop drinking, there's

394
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:11.610
Laura Lujan: Oh, yeah.

395
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way

396
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.470
Laura Lujan: You know, whatever.

397
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.170
Laura Lujan: You try to do at this point, your money.

398
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.630
Laura Lujan: And that's the goal is like a New Years back to repeat

399
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.170
Laura Lujan: Your evolutionary repeat I showed up. I saw my son's like 1999. And yeah, I know. That was the day I was born on like

400
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.960
Laura Lujan: Every, every year. It's the same thing. So

401
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:34.770
It.

402
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if you guys would like to do this as a buddy system, we're going to go in and

403
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:44.400
Laura Lujan: Produce

404
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He can do it. Now, right now.

405
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.430
Laura Lujan: It can be done by me again. I mean,

406
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.570
Laura Lujan: Then it could put that

407
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.050
Laura Lujan: On my part, I'm not going to get that. How are we

408
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:08.220
Laura Lujan: Gonna let him have that. How's that sound my, I thought, okay, so maybe he's telling you this to where I like half a dozen him and then whenever he bought some albums.

409
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.310
Laura Lujan: And then when I found interesting.

410
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

411
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.100
Yeah.

412
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the last time you did a stimulant. How far back.

413
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

414
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many times have you heard the thought, oh, I could go do that.

415
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.810
Laura Lujan: A comment about whatever I'm wearing my dashboard.

416
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.030
Laura Lujan: I remember that. I don't

417
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have them a couple times a day.

418
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.680
No.

419
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, two times a week now.

420
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what that says to me, it says whatever you're doing, it's working.

421
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If avoidance is working. If

422
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing me if the buprenorphine whatever it is that you're doing that is working because you February.

423
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: 20 and you're only having cravings thoughts. A couple times a week. That's pretty good.

424
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

425
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:31.110
Laura Lujan: Bad for everything you know my notes, whatever it is you're like all

426
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.360
Laura Lujan: Right.

427
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm not sure what you just said. Just try it again.

428
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:50.490
Laura Lujan: I felt really bad. Whenever we had to up my dose from a ship to ship to ship. Yeah, I felt like really kind of like is locked down with myself kind of

429
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.320
Laura Lujan: Like I figured, okay. Well, we could just fix it.

430
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:05.190
Laura Lujan: With another medication, but like I like you guys are always talking to me bring up my thought was great. I mean, I'm not a lawyer, like, I don't know.

431
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:06.810
Laura Lujan: But

432
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:08.850
Laura Lujan: They get it like

433
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

434
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Registered in school interviews looking into rehab. You have to thank you definitely could rationalize using more subs. Did you use more of the subs then was prescribed

435
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not giving yourself.

436
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let me, let me give you. Let me give you a compliment you need to see you guys on the frontline of recovery. You're not. You're not realizing how hard you're working

437
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Give your

438
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: give yourself credit

439
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Its massive most people barely get out of bed.

440
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You

441
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: School, problem solving, to these all these programs, talking with me about

442
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're, you're kicking ass.

443
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.890
Laura Lujan: Yeah yeah I myself have to credit

444
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When and you're going to get there, you're going to get there, you're going to get past this this bias. You have about, you know, I'm maybe what I'm weak because I had to take more subs. It's not a moral issue. It has to do with it must have been how much maybe heroin, you were doing before.

445
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It just meant that you had a lot of open receptors and you needed more to fill them.

446
00:46:52.110 --> 00:47:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't worry about the taper. When you're ready, and your coping skills are in place. I think you're going to do. You're going to do just fine tapering and you're going to feel really proud of it.

447
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't, don't worry about that. That's, that's to come right now we're trying to get you in a stable living environment. So just

448
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't judge yourself.

449
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:13.920
Yeah.

450
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's go back to the behavioral health piece. We've got a little bit of time left.

451
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how I asked you earlier I said what got in the way of

452
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not arguing with dad or not arguing with step mom.

453
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch another version of how it could have gone. Is this if dad says, well I'm going, Oh, we'll do it together, go to rehab together.

454
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

455
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You argued right you argue with them.

457
00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Another version. The one I talked about last week would look like this.

458
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is an interesting idea, Dad. I'll give that some thought.

459
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.040
Laura Lujan: It would be harder would be something

460
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You memorize it.

461
00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that, that sounds important to death, and she starts your recovery. Um, I'll give that some thought.

462
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.660
Laura Lujan: Okay, I'm like a bike ride my bike.

463
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:34.110
Laura Lujan: I didn't do that one. OK, I will give myself that credit. There was one time where I didn't do that.

464
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I tell me. Yeah.

465
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.620
Laura Lujan: We have to remember that just passed away.

466
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:53.910
Laura Lujan: I'm digital. Well, my dad called me. Okay. And he was like, What are you doing are you okay um I guess what's up. You don't know thing on earth did you see, did you see so Toronto posted any jargon. Right.

467
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.090
Laura Lujan: Well, I knew that if I just cooperate with him. It'll make

468
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.050
Laura Lujan: It'll make everything

469
00:48:59.070 --> 00:48:59.670
Laura Lujan: So,

470
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:13.380
Laura Lujan: It was kind of messed up whatever big borders, I am my bad timing to look at this person name on Facebook and Chris on this video. So I said, Okay, I'll do that. I'm sitting there like

471
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:23.520
Laura Lujan: Okay, yeah, I'm looking at I'm looking at right now on to the video that's a long video on dad, he's like, God, long while I'm pulling me in it right flowing

472
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:31.140
Laura Lujan: And I'm like, yeah, going to do that. Well, let me just like let me go. So I can, you know, so I've watched this video. It was trying to

473
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:42.390
Laura Lujan: You're trying to get me to watch the screen over to someone, one of our 20th distant cousins. They never met before he drinking, you know, totally excited about our

474
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:52.560
Laura Lujan: Forum for life for, you know, lots going to hell. My dad has a thing where whenever anyone does have any doesn't matter how old they are him, he just, he just

475
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:54.150
Laura Lujan: Can

476
00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I just clarify the video content was of a drunken man, is that right

477
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:07.440
Laura Lujan: Your video content of a hero, you know, or appeal.

478
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: An 18 year old.

479
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the video was have a funeral.

480
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

481
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:30.390
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I remember it was like them burying the dude and like putting dirt on him and I recorded it or whatever because because the card. We could have everyone there at one time.

482
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I have

483
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And

484
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I just so

485
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a family member that you you barely know

486
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.230
Laura Lujan: You've met him once.

487
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

488
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've only got four minutes. I want to hear. Well, you did where you protected your own boundaries. What did you do

489
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.520
Laura Lujan: I told my now that I want to hear. And I said, well, I sat there for like the whole like phony 30 minutes with him thing. Oh, yeah. You see this

490
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:07.770
Laura Lujan: What am I wasn't really watching him to do at all. But my dad. Well, he totally believe because I told them, I said, Okay, well, now we're

491
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:23.670
Laura Lujan: Now we're at 30 minutes that. Okay, so, and then he told me that they're putting them to the garden. You can become a gas on became that course I did. Are you okay, I love you, just not possible. It's like, well, I made him feel better about it you know the extent of like I

492
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So you and I are gonna disagree a little on whether that's the same thing.

493
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But But Laura. I don't ever

494
00:51:42.450 --> 00:52:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But you had to sacrifice and the difference between what I'm role modeling right now. Sound like this, but I don't know how you and your dad or I don't know if he would yell at you. I don't know what would happen, but the skill. This one I'm trying to teach looks like this.

495
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll take a look at it. I've got a little bit of time later, do you want me to text you when I've watched the video. Yeah. Text me when you watched it.

496
00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I decide on my time. If I'm going to watch it at all, but it gives me time to think about, well, maybe I don't want to watch it at all, or maybe I will but I didn't do it right now, when he wanted me to because it's not going to be

497
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's another step towards being able to say

498
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad, I understand this person means a lot to you. I don't know him.

499
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But how are you doing around the loss.

500
00:52:45.600 --> 00:53:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a skill to be able to to be able to meet someone's feeling and not take everything someone saying as a directive to go do something and this will take time, but yes, you get big applause for that. But it kind of breaks my heart a little bit

501
00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because because you still had to sacrifice and I don't want you to have to do that.

502
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The skill. I'm going to be teaching you is about a boundary

503
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you get to say no. But you do it in a sweet way. I think you're going to get there. At least you recognize that you pushed back a little bit.

504
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't 100% compromise, there was a little bit of you in that response and you got to say no by you basically didn't watch the video.

505
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:37.110
Laura Lujan: Here we're

506
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:45.330
Laura Lujan: kind of messed up a bit. I feel better or worse about it if he needs to do. But he made me no good.

507
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:46.650
Laura Lujan: Work.

508
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep talking. I'll get there. This is hard, but this is right at the center for most people in recovery, they're working on how to say no when they need know

509
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Most

510
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.780
Laura Lujan: Like

511
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

512
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:12.360
Laura Lujan: If someone asked me if I can get it or if I can help them yeah core. If I say, Yes, right away, like when

513
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.280
Laura Lujan: You guys should point to a my boyfriend was like all, what do you do, why you why you

514
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.800
Laura Lujan: Get over here right now. Okay.

515
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, that's what I'm picking up on and that'll take a little bit of time, but it's worth it because then what happens or is you give what you have to give

516
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Without resentment. It means we give and sometimes some days we only have a little bit to give and what we need that day is to take care of ourselves.

517
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Other days we have more resources and we can give to others.

518
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly the amount we have without resentment.

519
00:54:54.690 --> 00:55:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's getting into boundaries and that is a really important topic, and we're going to keep talking about it another day to meet right now. So I'm looking at my schedule.

520
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have

521
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your Tuesday morning

522
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:36.270
Laura Lujan: Medication you

Laura Lujan: Know,

524
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know that happened because you didn't go to group, right. You do know that right

525
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.830
Laura Lujan: Yeah, right.

526
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's where your doctor is

527
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoo. I think I've got something

528
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. It's right away. Monday this coming Monday. So we're going to meet right away, Monday, May 4 at 10am

529
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

530
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then I can. I'm going to dive right in and talk to you about boundaries.

531
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to we'll get right into that will kind of take what we talked about and will continue it. All right, I'm going to message, your doctor right now. Okay. And your next appointment is probably going to be bridged to that one. So I'll see you Monday at what time

532
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You then

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.000

Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.
