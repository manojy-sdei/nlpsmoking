00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Last minute appointment high

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Points. So what are you at your place or where are you at

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me get a note open here um I there's a piece of information missing somehow

6
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm you're running short, is it because you've been taken more than you're supposed to kind of

7
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.760
Jessica G: Um,

8
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:53.310
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah. So what's been happening is that, um, I take the two, which equals to four milligrams, but I feel like I'm just like I stay in a state of like

9
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570
Jessica G: Like kind of withdrawal, you know, not not not severe

10
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.830
Jessica G: But it's really, really uncomfortable. And so what I end up having to do is I end up having to take one more.

11
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.700
Jessica G: And then that night. I don't know if it's

12
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.480
Jessica G: Okay.

13
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on.

14
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've been taking four milligrams a day for at least February 4

15
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a little blip. And were you, I think, trying to remember if it was that you took

16
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody else's turns out was higher dose right

17
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And did we figure out if it turns out it was what milligram. It was remind me.

18
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.860
Jessica G: It was a

19
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Code for other that's that's a huge jump.

20
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.770
Jessica G: Yes, yes.

21
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And did you tell the doc, this happened.

22
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200
Jessica G: Um, Yes, I did. I did. Okay.

23
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That you ended up you took someone else's and it was eight milligrams, you told her.

24
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.020
Yes.

25
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.970
Okay.

26
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I think her only appointment today is right now. Ironically, I messaged her though. Just to see if they showed up or for some reason she might be free. I'll see if she can come in here, join us.

27
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days for you at the at the eight. How many days did you do that.

28
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.050
Jessica G: For two days.

29
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.530
Jessica G: Okay.

30
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I've got a note open here um

31
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What withdrawal symptoms are

32
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.870
Jessica G: I'm experiencing like

33
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.870
Jessica G: cold sweats like chills.

34
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.310
Jessica G: I'm

35
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.620
Jessica G: I'm just really sensitive to everything. I got so sensitive to everything.

36
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.570
Jessica G: I'm

37
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensitive meaning what tell me what that means.

38
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.790
Jessica G: Like I'm

39
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.480
Jessica G: Like touch and still

40
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.300
Jessica G: Really so I'm

41
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.550
Tactile okay

42
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.740
Jessica G: I'm

43
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.620
Jessica G: Learning no water.

44
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.570
Jessica G: Okay. And I've been like I got hard candy and I like try to just calm down and

45
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:26.400
Jessica G: And with the thick with it with the I've noticed over the extra one a concern. Like, it stops. Okay. And then the next day and back to the same. And it's kind of like the same thing. Like, okay, so today I'm going to try to take for

46
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

47
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.070
Jessica G: And then it's just the same thing all over again.

48
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so six seems to relieve it

49
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

50
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.470
Jessica G: Yeah.

51
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:53.610
Jessica G: And it's hard. It's hard to because I'm like really hard on myself because I was doing so good. I was already at such a low dose and

52
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.590
Jessica G: Going back up again.

53
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we talked about it. You sounded like if what you were saying was true, you weren't aware. I'm

54
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Illegal you weren't aware to pay attention that, you know, everything is not the same. They're very different

55
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Brand names. Same thing with brand name and generic I've watched or someone else have an eight and then when they go to for

56
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The distribution of the medicine was different on it and they were cutting it. And then, so it's, you don't want to mess with your medicine. You want to protect it. It's yours. Nobody's to have it and there's no messing with it.

57
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:53.010
Jessica G: And that's what it comes of it. That's what I wear what it kind of feels like like this medicine that I think it's not

58
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.560
Jessica G: As not as

59
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.210
Jessica G: Strong or is not as

60
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.200
Jessica G: Like effective. I don't know how to explain it.

61
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you can't tell because you're taking for so you see through that off. You didn't change your brand. Right.

62
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:21.210
Jessica G: No, it just changed the dose. So it was a four milligram strip and now it's a two milligrams strip

63
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.140
So,

64
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's because I believe that eight that eight thing you did. She's. Let me just say, she'll be done it in about 15 minutes she can join us. So let me just tell her.

65
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Alright, so let's go to and I'll be able to just sort of share with her once you've already shared this information.

66
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We have hot, cold sweats chills. So let's get that

67
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How let's go zero to 10 on that.

68
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: How bad is it compared to the cold turkey experience.

69
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.380
Jessica G: Compared to the cold turkey experience. It's

70
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.380
Jessica G: It's probably like that a five hour flight.

71
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And the sensitive tactile tactile is like touch.

72
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.220
What number

73
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:07.680
Jessica G: That one I would say is like probably like a seven. I feel like that's like, that's one of the worst symptoms for me.

74
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.920
Jessica G: Like the most uncomfortable.

75
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Describe what you're physically feeling right now. So I understand.

76
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.250
Jessica G: Um, well right now. I'm okay because they took the medication.

77
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right, right. Okay.

78
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.660
Jessica G: Yeah, but whenever I do

79
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.170
Jessica G: Like, because that I know I'm supposed to take it in the morning, but I've gotten

80
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.860
Jessica G: Into the habit of taking it.

81
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.750
Jessica G: I'm

82
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:48.030
Jessica G: Like in the daytime. That way it hopefully lasts longer and I'm able to, or like I'm able to make it through the night.

83
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.960
Jessica G: Because I know that it's worse for me in the nighttime.

84
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.840
Jessica G: Then that would then it is in the daytime. So it works better for me but on

85
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.270
Jessica G: Um, when I do wake up and everything, or

86
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.290
Jessica G: Like kind of in the early morning

87
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.110
Jessica G: I'm just, um,

88
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.030
Jessica G: I don't know how to explain what it feels like.

89
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:22.230
Jessica G: Like I I can feel myself in my own skin. That makes sense.

90
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.610
Jessica G: Like, I don't know how to explain it.

91
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.820
Jessica G: Even if I'm doing anything or if I'm wearing clothes. It's just like

92
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.570
Jessica G: I don't know, uncomfortable. Okay.

93
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And the runny nose, how bad is that

94
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A number

95
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.860
Jessica G: Out. It's like a 545

96
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.580
Jessica G: most amusing and water United's the same

97
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's really aside from the tactile sensitive touch. It's pretty across the board, five. Okay.

98
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you can learn from this you can see you do need to taper slowly. That's why we do this in the program. You hear people talking about half a milligram a quarter milligram sometimes

99
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When that's a really a sticky moment and those receptors don't want to reabsorb

100
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're feeling it firsthand that you you can't just go fast. You've got to go slow you now, you really know it.

101
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.970
Jessica G: Yeah, okay.

102
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.450
Jessica G: All right.

103
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The lesson learned, right there.

104
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do

105
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit about, you know, we touched on some assertiveness communication with this friend.

106
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's sort of this realization for you.

107
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.080
Jessica G: Um,

108
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.910
Jessica G: I feel like it was like a real eye opener because

109
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.440
Jessica G: Those are saying in Spanish.

110
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.180
Jessica G: That that says don't do

111
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:34.200
Jessica G: Good things mother school says when asked about his. Come on, don't do good things that look bad, or that seem bad, but to me, I feel like I was helping her out. But it was it was about being to do you know

112
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.940
Jessica G: So,

113
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.510
Jessica G: I feel like I regret I feel like I i impulsively made that decision.

114
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.260
Jessica G: And now, it took me back to like

115
00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:02.430
Jessica G: Just when I will when I used to have to like do the same kind of transactions with drugs and stuff. And I didn't like it. I don't like it. And I feel like

116
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.450
Jessica G: I'm not that person anymore and

117
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.530
Jessica G: Just one that decision, like 70 bucks so much

118
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but look at how you might be exaggerating it. Watch. Let's say you go six for the next two weeks.

119
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be into March, then two weeks later he wanted to five and two weeks later, at the end of March, maybe in April, actually for really check yourself a little bit. See if you're blowing it a little bit too big.

120
00:14:47.550 --> 00:15:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's only if we just said every two weeks, which is a random number. It's really gives people a settling in period. So that's pretty like aggressive and slow. It's a nice compromise in there. And if you went down one milligram if you wanted to, you could be right back at four in April.

121
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that far away.

122
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.760
Jessica G: All it's not

123
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.100
Jessica G: Already almost in March.

124
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.090
We're all good.

125
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

126
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. It's not. It's. Don't you think the lesson you just learned about I need to check and respect how strong this stuff is that I can't do people pleasing. I can't, I can't do that anymore. Don't you think it's worth a month of a lesson you you're really going to learn it.

127
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.130
Yeah.

128
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

129
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know

130
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and there's still more to learn to and some of them are going to be experiential. Some of them will be able to tell you

131
00:15:50.700 --> 00:16:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, you know, a good parent would old don't go speeding on the freeway and stay out late on New Year's Eve, you know, we're going to say those things but y'all don't know till you learn your lesson.

132
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.060
Jessica G: Story of my life.

133
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.550
Jessica G: Okay.

134
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take a tiny little bit before she gets here and talk a little bit about I didn't get to hear

135
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: More about what you meant by thank you for bringing me back. So, something happened around sort of pulling you out and sort of pressing continuing to press and you were starting to slip away from treatment time what you meant by that.

136
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.310
Jessica G: So I felt like

137
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.580
Jessica G: I felt like I was on kind of on

138
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.590
Jessica G: Let me try to set

139
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.010
Jessica G: The phone down a little bit.

140
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.900
Jessica G: I keep on moving. Okay, there were set. Okay.

141
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.200
Jessica G: So I felt like I was kind of

142
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:14.160
Jessica G: A got too real for me and maybe like I felt like subconsciously. I was pulling away and now was avoiding doing that. The, what is it called,

143
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Em, Dr.

144
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.810
Jessica G: The end our treatment. Oh.

145
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.870
Jessica G: Sorry, because

146
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It was getting real for you right now.

147
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.950
Jessica G: Yeah, I was getting real and I look for excuses.

148
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.850
Jessica G: And, you know, to not do it.

149
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So the nice thing just to reassure you and you can always say, No, I'm not up for it today as you did and you can also

150
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that there's going to be times when you don't want to tell me the story. You don't have to remember that part. He may say, no, I have it in my head. I don't want to tell you

151
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what's so unique about this.

152
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You just hold the image up but even that Jessica is it so distressing. When you think about some of that trauma that you've been through that it's hard for you to even pull up that memory.

153
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:25.290
Jessica G: Yeah I noticed that there's even like blocks. Then there's even like parts that I don't remember.

154
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But then, let me tell you some science, you're going to be amazed with the fact that that trauma.

155
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's actually a really strong SIGN THAT IT WAS SO traumatizing for you because what happens is

156
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Cortisol floods the hippocampus cortisol is this hormone. It's a stress hormone, right, you probably heard of it.

157
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's great in short bursts. We like it, we're like, we're ready to go, ready to handle and were made to handle short bursts of distress.

158
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But what when you're in chronic right distress or one really big flood of it. It covers the hippocampus, the hippocampus is the part of the brain that puts the timestamp and remembers details.

159
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: About an image about a memory about an experience. So what probably happened is you flooded it. Are we talking about like one memory or repeated.

160
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.810
Jessica G: Time period.

161
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

162
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only didn't mess with the timestamps so that when you start to think about it, when you start to pull when I invite you for bringing and, you know,

163
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens is it's being experienced as if it were happening in real time right now because it's not set in the past. So it doesn't surprise me that you're saying this.

164
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels to real guess

165
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Use look at that word like it's really happening right now.

166
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, so that's that's important for me to know because I'm going to need to tie Trey getting you there slower and differently. Okay. So you're telling me is important because we'll just modify what we're doing. Okay.

167
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Also, it also speaks, there's a really interesting thing when you said there's pieces. I don't remember.

168
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It corrupts memory, the cortisol, actually this hippocampus. It actually starts to

169
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It how don't want to say it doesn't dissolve it decomposes a little bit because of if you keep the chronic

170
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Cortisol running at it all the time because it's got lots of receptors on it. It actually starts to get smaller that part of the brain. So stress is no joke, you really don't want to be in a high stress state, all the time.

171
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.790
It messes, but I

172
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.160
Jessica G: Want

173
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To say

174
00:20:53.910 --> 00:21:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're like me, why am I forgetting. This was it. Because what most people will tell you is I will remember every detail of something, because it was so personal.

175
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It was so scary. Most people will say that unless they've had real like, you know, that sort of life threatening trauma or like, especially the the sexual history trauma.

176
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But regular people just like oh my gosh, I was so scared. Well, don't remember the details, but not when you're flooded like that. What it does is completely cut off the prefrontal cortex and it completely messes with the ability to remember

177
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Important details of the memory like it's like you can't get to it and it might. It might not, we might not be able to access and do we want to, I don't know. So here's the thing, here's how you register, let's say you had come to treatment. You had no nightmares.

178
00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You could freely, talk about your life. I'm not a problem. I've already done the reprocessing. I can talk about this and this and this and this and you're like easy breezy, but that isn't how you presented you presented with nightmares.

179
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.250
Jessica G: It's intruding so

180
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It wants to be done. It wants it, and we did do a little bit of work with the anchor room and facing it

181
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice that I didn't tell you retell me everything that's going on. No, you can use metaphor. You can use symbolism. Like if it's just a black blob or something. Fine.

182
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to read. Tell me, so I want to keep reassuring you in your consciousness and also your unconscious that you don't have to retell it because that can feel really traumatizing whoops just lost you.

183
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.530
Sorry.

184
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

185
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling a little better knowing you're not going to have to if you don't want to retell gory details.

186
00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:02.520
Jessica G: I do, I do, I do, but it's kind of like confusing for me because I feel like

187
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.790
Jessica G: Like okay, if I don't tell it then.

188
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.800
Jessica G: Am I really like or if I don't tell it.

189
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.380
Jessica G: Is it going to stay with more am I not going to prop. Oh, what

190
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.970
Jessica G: Am I not going to process it like I'm

191
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:35.610
Jessica G: As well as if I were actually playing and getting it out of me because I'm the type of person that I need to get it out, like, you know, okay.

192
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Then force you.

193
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That will be, you're going to have to go nice and slow. Sometimes we'll pull back and then maybe we'll come forward and little pullback and then we'll come forward, but that's that's useful for me to know because some people need a witness. They need to hear them.

194
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And they

195
00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it's been labeled it's been named we have another person that because I care for you, right, I'm going to hear it. I'm going to stay right there. I'm going to hold it. I'm not going to judge it. I'm not going to run away from it. I'm going to hold it right there. And to do this together.

196
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.100
And

197
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's going to be part of it. But I want to tell you

198
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Insight which is different than insight.

199
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You sharing your story and saying, I need once and for all, to say this awful thing this awful things this awful thing, this, this and this were awful and here you go. And I'm going to just say him.

200
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to say I'm with someone, I don't want to go through this suffering alone. I want to say it. Okay, fine. I got it. You can tell me the, whatever you want to. Okay, I will sit here with it. I won't judge it. We won't do anything with it. But I will say,

201
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people think, and I think it's part of what your goal was, you wanted to understand why you do what you do. Right.

202
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Insight that's what insight is. It's like, oh, well, if I did this about this back in my history. This is why I'm behaving. Now it has some positive effect insights. Lovely.

203
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But that would mean that people like psychologists, that would mean like people that are very analytical maybe in my field to therapists, a lot of times you're going to run into some of you continue this work that haven't healed themselves and they're going to be a little nutty to

204
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Insight in and of itself is not the absolute healing mechanism.

205
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you

206
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know why you're all screwy Louis doesn't mean you're going to feel better.

207
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense, just because you know, why doesn't mean you automatically heal.

208
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it was that easy. Don't you think I mean, my goodness, we we've got libraries and bookstores, full of self help books. Why don't you just go read one

209
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that easy. It's not that simple.

210
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The next element is a witness is this person to do it with not go this alone to see another person. How does she handle it. What does she do, is it what does she think about it. Oh, maybe it's not as bad.

211
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I'm actually, I'm okay. So there is some healing that especially if the wounding was inner personal than the healing can be inner personal so that would make sense in there. Now, I don't know what the stories are

212
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But the other piece. If you want to is, notice how you don't want to even think about those repeated things that have happened right you don't want to even bring them to consciousness. You don't want to

213
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's what the desensitization is is for is to start little

214
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Little ones, bringing him up for a little while and not thinking about it. And also, by the way. So we bring it up a little bit and we bring in positive

215
00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you know your your Resource Network and what it does is you're actually modifying that memory.

216
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it seems wild, but how you remember it. It's all corrupted and missing pieces and feels like it's happening right now when we bring it up a little bit and we bring in some of that positive network stuff. It changes the memory.

217
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know experience it as quite as terrifying. Wait a minute. Hey, look at my body, my heart isn't jumping out of my chest.

218
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.300
Jessica G: Hold on.

219
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.520
Jessica G: I'm in the bathroom.

220
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I got the Occupy

221
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.550
Jessica G: Okay.

222
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So, all right. So you're wondering, well, if I don't do this scary thing. And tell somebody will I heal, is that the basic idea.

223
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.410
Jessica G: Pretty much.

224
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.620
Jessica G: Yeah, I feel like because then

225
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.460
Jessica G: Right. During the trauma girl, you know,

226
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:21.300
Jessica G: Like I always felt like I never had a place in my home. I never had anyone

227
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:33.120
Jessica G: To speak up for me or to defend me or and stuff like that. I felt like, that's why I feel like that. Yeah, that has to do with

228
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:47.070
Jessica G: Like you know I always wanted my mom to just defend me for once, and protect me instead of, instead of making me shut up. Because otherwise, my brother wouldn't stop right

229
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.470
Jessica G: So I thought that's why that has a lot to do with why

230
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.990
Jessica G: Like the whole

231
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.900
Jessica G: I needed a witness

232
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So me protecting you right those moments where maybe advocacy might be there. Sometimes it'll be me doing it.

233
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. And so I'm going to bring Dr. Aubrey Ellen. So just see let let this help. This is help right now this is I'm hearing you were bringing in the doc and we're going to talk and try and help you out. Okay.

234
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.310
Jessica G: Okay, I felt a lot better.

235
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.040
Jessica G: Do every time we talk

236
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.820
Jessica G: You. Let's bring her in here.

237
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll probably share first and if I missed some pieces you just fill in. Okay, okay, okay. All right. Um, Doc. Get yourself on video, and I want to fill you in here, thanks for meeting with us on the fly.

238
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just test check volume. Can I hear you.

239
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.320
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah.

240
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, excellent. Fantastic.

241
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.550
Dawn Abriel: Sorry, I

242
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.600
Dawn Abriel: You don't have your pink fluffy robot and I don't recognize you.

243
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So, if I may, all do, because I can kind of spit it out pretty quickly. Um, can I kind of do the the abridged version of it for you, Jessica. So, this last weekend.

244
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll spare the story, but the bottom line is, she ends up taking eight milligrams, two days in a row. She was on for she'd been tapering down to four as your record may show she ended up taking two days. A DAY SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS TAKING EIGHT. She felt great.

245
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, of course, went right back to her for. And again, here it is Friday, day after day, when she just takes for as you know she's felt was about a level from zero to 10 at about a five cold sweats runny nose, sneezing, at about a five and

246
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: tactile sensitivity, like everything or close. Yeah. And it just stressed about a seven.

247
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And haven't asked what she did. For those symptoms, but just been focusing more on lesson learned, kind of concepts like

248
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's illegal to share your medicine with someone and it's still, you know, she this gals, you know more about assertiveness and sort of

249
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of real active in about this can't happen again, we have to really protect our medication and we don't share with anyone. And this is ours and and every and even like

250
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: eight milligrams strip is different than a four. And it's like, this is not a joke. This is very heavy duty.

251
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain Medicine, so that all aside, I wanted to say. She also has been taking six and then feels better. So she didn't go to h, which is what those two days were but she feels better at six.

252
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We did a little bit of work around not blowing it out of proportion. There was some negative thinking

253
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I've really blown it but in about April, she decided to she could be right back down to four. So once she heard April. It was like, we're almost done with February, just get through March, April, so it's actually not catastrophic

254
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.570
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. No, it isn't.

255
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So, yeah, yeah. What I'm saying is, go ahead. Ask your questions, but I wanted to give you that.

256
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:28.380
Dawn Abriel: So the, the six milligrams. How many days. Have you taken that

257
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:30.960
Jessica G: Um,

258
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.550
Jessica G: I would say

259
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.970
Jessica G: Since Wednesday.

260
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.300
Jessica G: Wednesday Tuesday.

261
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:49.800
Dawn Abriel: So about three days and you're, you don't have any withdrawal.

262
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.840
Jessica G: No. Okay.

263
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.980
Dawn Abriel: So you're going to run out. So let me write for

264
00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:02.070
Dawn Abriel: A prescription at the six middle ground level. So you can pick up a little more before group.

265
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then how would you feel if that was phenomenal. And we started over again. Yeah. Okay. Is that okay, Jessica. Does that work for you.

266
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.700
Jessica G: Yeah.

267
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't be. Don't be

268
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A lesson learned. That's all you. This is, this isn't here's a, here's an aspirin.

269
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:24.030
If

270
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.260
Jessica G: You

271
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Have other questions, so I know it can be nerve wracking to have Dr. Here, and some negative thinking might be going on but take a deep breath.

272
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Will snow that we're both here to take care of you. This is your treatment. Look how quickly you were able to get a physician here, chest like that. Okay. We're here to take care of you.

273
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We want you to succeed. I care about you. The doctor cares about you.

274
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that mind with the whole brain work now that it's not in a distress moment to see if there's other questions you have to see if something else you need or want

275
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.910
Jessica G: Okay.

276
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.310
Jessica G: I just remembered

277
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:31.770
Jessica G: I got an email that says that I have a bill $75

278
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.250
Jessica G: That's what popped up into my thing.

279
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:37.470
Jessica G: Right.

280
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can look. I mean, you may have a copay. I don't know.

281
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.860
Jessica G: Maybe there is something

282
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That I can look for you. And what about any concerns about interpersonal if there's anything

283
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:52.680
Jessica G: Anything wanted

284
00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask The Doctor about maybe how she feels how she thinks. Some people get in their minds that a doctor thinks negatively of them or something like that. This might be a nice time to check out any assumptions that you might have.

285
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.190
Jessica G: Um,

286
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.620
Jessica G: I can't, I can't really think of anything, just that.

287
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.180
Jessica G: I'm just pretty much surprised because

288
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.560
Jessica G: I was expecting like a whole different response like I was dreading contacting you guys and

289
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.380
Jessica G: I feel so much better now.

290
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.710
Jessica G: Well, I feel better, Jessica.

291
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:42.480
Dawn Abriel: I almost recommended the six lat two times ago when we talk because

292
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:52.560
Dawn Abriel: I and then you said that you had gone to the fore and that the four was okay. You wanted to stay at the four. So, um,

293
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:59.850
Dawn Abriel: So I didn't have a chance to recommend the six. So I'm not surprised that the six works better.

294
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.730
Jessica G: Yeah, I was. I feel like I was in a

295
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.310
Jessica G: Little bit of denial

296
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.320
Jessica G: Like, oh man, there

297
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Many people just they're just like, Hey, guys, you're there, rolling there right with you down the river region I other right there next year. Lots of

298
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.180
Time.

299
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.820
Jessica G: We all

300
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We all know that that

301
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Really well. But that's what what this is for is if we don't want to do what we always did. We're always going to get what we always thought we want to do it differently. So

302
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We took a chance and reached out and good. I'm glad you're having a different experience. Don't want it to be too rewarding, right, because then it's

303
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not punitive because you need to feel like you have somewhere to go when something something goes horizontal and sideways so good different outcome and anything more on that level.

304
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.760
Jessica G: No, just thank you guys, appreciate it.

305
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.860

So I'm looking

308
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything I can let the dog go once that's all worked out.

309
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You have any other questions talk because you. I really appreciate your meeting with us, you know,

310
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'm yeah I'll go ahead and order the medicine.

311
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, same pharmacy. No change.

318
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.980
Maybe when I was opening a note for you. Possibly. I see something

319
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't see it now, but I thought I saw something earlier, too. So you don't typically have a copay

320
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.710
Jessica G: I don't know.

321
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I could send a little message. See, see if somebody can offer a little something.

322
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can say you want me to send a little message asking what that might be.

323
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.600

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not again.

330
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.530
Jessica G: That's what I was thinking.

Gwenevere Abriel: Massage hands or you know we can do any number of things so that we can get back in the moment and because remember I was telling you the some of those things in the past, feel like they're being they're happening now.

380
00:44:48.720 --> 00:45:02.040
