Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. I'm Dr. Allah DAG and I'm here to help you.

20
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: With your opioid issue.

21
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, well, Tommy. Can you tell me a little bit of about yourself like your background with that, like how you ended up with us.

22
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.670
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah. Um, well, I haven't been getting well I started using opiates. When I was like 15 and then I started with Suboxone when I was around 1819

23
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.630
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Okay, so that was about 10 years ago and

24
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:42.540
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I had a doctor who was given giving me this Suboxone and along with my other medications. He was like high interest for like eight years and then

25
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.020
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I ended up switching doctors to one that was covered by medical clinical lay

26
00:02:49.770 --> 00:03:07.680
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: And then she had referred me to you guys just recently. Well, I lost. I had this really great doctor with clinical lay up until December. And then I feel like they've kind of just been tossing me around here. So this doctor to that doctor and she had referred me to you guys, so

27
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.610
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, that's basically how I ended up here.

28
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay. Um, okay. Cool. Well, hopefully we can we can hang on to and

29
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Take care of you, like you had like a study

30
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sounds like so you were on it for 10 years and

31
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: last eight years, right. You were or no, you

32
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.430
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Like I address. Yeah. And then, yeah, it's kind of been like switching from this doctor that Dr. Past a year and a half or so.

33
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay, um,

34
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: And I've actually been on the Methadone for like two months now.

35
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.760
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Oh me over because I had stopped you getting the Suboxone

36
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

37
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.100
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: And I really don't like it. You know, I'd really like to get back on the Suboxone

38
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so going from methadone or Suboxone is going to be a you know a little bit of a challenge to you aware that

39
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.100
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: You have to be off of the methadone, I guess, right, I mean,

40
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah so methadone.

41
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:35.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: It stays in your system for they say 48 hours, but I've had patients really have to stay clear of of all of everything for like four or five days before. So like, there needs to be a gap. Before we start you on the Suboxone

42
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.300
Good.

43
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that gap can be difficult.

44
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can do I can give you something.

45
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:54.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like quantity and patches that kind of help with the withdrawal, a little bit ease ease the irritability and like it's just a blood pressure lowering medication.

46
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can give you those patches and then it looks like. Are you still seeing some somebody that gives you clonazepam so I was

47
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.270
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Checking know that's that's what the other problem is, um,

48
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:19.620
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I haven't been able to get my Klonopin steadily for the past like five days. And I'm really been feeling terrible not having that and then having the, you know, having to go back and forth the Methadone clinic.

49
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So who is, who is the doctor giving you your Klonopin

50
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.760
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Well, he stopped working for clinical a and now and

51
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.760
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: So it was Dr. Towns.

52
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Uh huh.

53
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:43.350
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Who gave me the last prescription for that. But I've done a clause and also for about the same time, same amount of time as a Suboxone so I've been like that for like 10 years now.

54
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: 10 years as well. Okay, and

55
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.120
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: It's just really hard not having it for the past

56
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.470
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: You know, five, six days.

57
00:05:50.160 --> 00:06:00.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, yeah, it's not something you really should be running out of so so the clinic, the clinic, your ad is like, sorry. There's no doctor here that can give that to you. Is that what they're saying.

58
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.830
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, he says, uh,

59
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.540
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: It's really, it's really a mess. They said they sent me to a doctor in Fairfield, which is next town over and

60
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:20.610
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I thought I've been waiting this couple weeks to meet with him. I thought he was just going to take care of everything for me. But it turns out he ended up not being able to do anything for me.

61
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: None of it.

62
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:32.520
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: No and yeah i know i don't i can't believe that they're letting me just, you know, go without it like this. I've been calling them and like messaging them and doing everything I can. But I'm not getting anywhere.

63
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's not good.

64
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so here's what I think we should do. Okay.

65
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I do think if you've been on clonazepam for that long for 10 years. You can't just suddenly stop it.

66
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:54.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now that's like dangerous. We don't want that. You could go into withdrawal. And that's, you know, not a good thing from from benzodiazepines. Okay.

67
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:07.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, long term moving forward. Should you remain on it you know that's something between you and the psychiatrist taking care of you to discuss. But I think short term. I mean, you need to be covered. Yeah, um,

68
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so for that.

69
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe what I can do, since you've been out for five days now. No, no.

70
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:24.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: No. So, so I can give you some to kind of hold you over until you can be seen by one of our psychiatry, yes.

71
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, good health. Okay.

72
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:39.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then establish care and, you know, tell them your history and then continue your prescription or whatever you're going to do. But yeah, I think that's important. So I'll definitely give you some to hold you up.

73
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'll give you a week's worth and within that week, we'll get you connected

74
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.220
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Good. Okay, thank you.

75
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you take how much two milligrams times

76
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.440
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, I just take two milligrams in the morning.

77
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, so I'll get you that ordered

78
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: And

79
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: So have you ever had any seizures or overdose situations or

80
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:16.980
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, I had in back in like 2014 well the doctor he had been giving me an absurd amount of medications. He had me on a milligrams of Xanax and eight milligrams of Klonopin per day.

81
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:26.400
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: And even then, I was taking more than what he was getting me and I was getting early appointments with him and he's on probation. Now, because of all this, like,

82
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.800
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I know it's terrible. But, uh, yeah. At that time I had

83
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:43.560
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Coming off of it. But I went to a medical detox facility to, you know, reduce the amount that I was on. So I ended up just falling back down to two milligrams per day.

84
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: After that, okay.

85
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, okay, who was who was that doctor

86
00:08:51.090 --> 00:09:05.790
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Dr Ouma in Santa Lena yes i i stopped seeing and that's he's the one that was with for like eight years. And then finally, I stopped seeing him and I found this great doctor with clinical lay, but then she moved on.

87
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:21.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, gotcha. Okay. Um, okay, so fine. So we'll figure it out. The Klonopin thing until we can find you somebody here and then you can steadily see that person and get your prescription. So that's taken care of. Good.

88
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:30.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now the question of, okay, how do we move you from methadone maintenance to back to Suboxone

89
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: How much methadone or you're on right now. What's the dose.

90
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:47.490
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: 80 milligrams and I haven't gone. I didn't go today. I just I slept in and ended up being too late and I knew I had this appointment. Anyway, so I figured I might be covered or

91
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.130
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: You know, whatever, whatever happens with it. Um, but yeah, he milligrams

92
00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:00.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you're an 80 milligrams and you've been doing it for two months. So yeah, I mean,

93
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:08.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you're just gonna. So here's what you do you work with the clinic there the Methadone clinic.

94
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mom.

95
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:23.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you tell them the plan and you say, I want it. And the thing is the interesting part is actually um Methadone clinics. Nowadays most of them also prescribe Suboxone

96
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.360
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah. Yeah. Except for this one I'm going to because

97
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.070
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I wasn't searching at the down. You know, I was just searching for those Suboxone but um

98
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So they don't offer it as

99
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:45.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. Okay, so. Nevermind that but but just tell them the plan just say, Okay, I found a Suboxone provider. So I need to taper off my methadone.

100
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: As quickly as I can tolerate

101
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you ask them to work with you on a daily basis to lower it

102
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, going down more than

103
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:08.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: A couple of milligrams. I mean, you could initially try to go down by like five milligrams at a time, and every couple of days. If you want or you could go weekly

104
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:15.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, but I mean it's a process and and you really need to like get to zero.

105
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:28.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then stay there, stay at zero for like four or five days before we try because the reason we want to wait that long is if we take it now, like let's say we gave it to today or Suboxone

106
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.100
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: You

107
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:46.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Put yourself into withdrawal. The Suboxone activity is half of what methadone activity is and so methadone is on your receptors. Now, so if you kick that off and put the half reactivity Suboxone you're going to feel like, Oh my God, you know, I just wanted to Mega withdrawal.

108
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.820
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Okay, I'm

109
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:53.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not gonna kill you. It's not like dangerous in that sense, but it feels bad.

110
00:11:54.030 --> 00:12:02.970
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah. Um, so I'd like to just do everything I can to get on the Suboxone as fast as possible. I wasn't even sure if I was going to end up going back to this methadone clinic.

111
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:16.890
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Because I'm in really my I got in a car accident, a couple days ago. So now my transportation. The 45 minute drive it is to the Methadone clinic is really getting that little screwed up until I can get my car fixed anyway.

112
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:24.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. So you're thinking, Are you thinking, okay, I'll just stop, I'm not going to take anymore.

113
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.200
Yeah.

114
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

115
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, but I'm okay. The thing is,

116
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: You may. We'll see how you do.

117
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:45.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like I said, I can give you. Clonidine patches. I'll give you the things that would help someone if we

118
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:56.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: weren't using Suboxone to help them through withdrawal. We have all the other things, right, like a muscle relaxer, do you get stomach pains stomach.

119
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cramps, I can give you

120
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.630
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Not much, not much.

121
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:07.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so maybe just the muscle relaxer the quantity and patch, just in general.

122
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:15.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you have your clonazepam. I mean, it is it is a standard thing that you take anyway but it's there.

123
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:25.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Between those three things, and you're not taking any more methadone. I mean, your body's going to clear itself of of the Methadone

124
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.670
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: And yeah.

125
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.990
To withdraw.

126
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:44.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you want to do like probably four or five days of that at least. And then, and then if you know you're feeling like I think it's, I don't know if we can try to start you on Suboxone

127
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.810
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah.

128
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:56.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Basically, like we could do a week, you know, meet again in a week and say okay and this week. Did you stay away from all opioids WHATSOEVER NO methadone know Suboxone, no nothing.

129
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: And if you have

130
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe we can try and then go from there.

131
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:15.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. The other option for you would be to be to go into an inpatient like you had in the past for that.

132
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Situation go

133
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:29.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Find an inpatient detox facility and tell them that you want to be induced onto Suboxone but you've been taking methadone and, most recently, you had 80 milligrams in your system.

134
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:44.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then they can induce you in the inpatient said setting, they could give you maybe more sedatives like phenobarbital, the heavy duty stuff to kind of keep your body calmer and stuff they can do it in that setting as well.

135
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: So those

136
00:14:48.420 --> 00:15:00.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are crazy and you're like, this is too hard. I don't think I can do this, you know, that might be honestly the safest easiest way to try to do it. It's monitored.

137
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you so you understand that.

138
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:15.780
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'd like to do, we can to avoid that situation that just, I just don't like the idea of being, you know, away from everything you know

139
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

140
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:30.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. I mean, we'll try no promises, though I mean like if anything you don't feel right about anything you can go, you know, obviously there's emergency room services if it's horrible, but

141
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:40.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: They're really the best places in inpatient detox. So you may want to still do the research, like call if your medical

142
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:57.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: There, there is that number, the sap see number do you have that number. There's a number where you call and they triage you and they can see like, okay, you're, you're, you need detox. So here's the detox center that's covered under your insurance or something.

143
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.430
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, I've been doing a detox before I'm

144
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not aware, it is close to

145
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.460
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah yeah

146
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.090
Okay.

147
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:16.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you have that as your like Plan B have it on the thing, just like, Hey, worst case scenario, just go there and like check in and tell them hey I'm switching please switch Mina Suboxone

148
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:23.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's what I do. I'm not just detoxing I'm detoxing from methadone getting on Suboxone that you got to tell them that piece.

149
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, otherwise they put you on some automatic protocol on your on the street and you have no Suboxone

150
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.070
Yeah.

151
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, so let's do this. So I'm going to give you the medications necessary to hold you over and then we meet again in a week, we'll meet individually, because this is a unique situation. And then we see how you feel, like, how did it go. Are you okay

152
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: See if we want to attempt the induction.

153
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: You have any support at home, who do you live with.

154

“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, I live with my parents are very supportive. Yeah. So, okay.

155
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:08.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your parents. Okay, good. Any family history of substance use problems alcohol.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.860
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: No, no.

159
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any history of suicidal thoughts ideation like attempts anything

160
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right now, we should worry about

161
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.280
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: No, no.

162
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: How about allergies to mess.

163
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.130

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Chart.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, no allergies and then how about nicotine you smoke or, or, yeah.

166
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.050
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: I smoke probably like 10 cigarettes a day.

167
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so like half a pack a day.

168
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:09.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, right now is probably not the best time to talk about quitting. But when you're ready, like we could do stuff for that too. We have patches. We can give you patches plus lozenge gum, you know, whatever.

169
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.050
We can work on

170
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: But right now.

171
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: We got a bigger

172
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.570
Issue.

173
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:26.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you tell talk, talk to me about 15 years old is when you started was it with pills like what

174
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.280
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Well, yeah, it was like pills, you know, just

175
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.820
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: recreationally you know like oxy cotton and all that and then

176
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:44.760
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, it was mainly just the bills. You know, I'm sure for bills, not for me. I never really had a you know a reason to be prescribed it but I'm just getting it off the streets.

177
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha, gotcha. Okay.

178
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you use any other drugs anymore.

179
00:18:53.340 --> 00:19:00.330
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, I mean not recently in the past few days I've used marijuana because just, you know, something to get

180
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.250
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Something to me feeling a little bit better. Anyway, but I'm not much

181
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not much. Okay. Okay. Um,

182
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:17.580
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: But I don't like the idea of being on the methadone, it's so easy to diverge from the treatment plan like

183
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:27.120
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: When you're on Suboxone it's you can't really go out and take any opiates because they don't really have an effect. And let's take them certain amount

184
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:37.050
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: But with methadone, you can easily take something else and it, you know. So I think I like being on the spot on, it's a lot safer in that aspect.

185
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's true.

186
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:47.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're right, it has a stronger binding to the receptor. So if you try to use. It's not very effective.

187
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:57.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah um vs methadone is a full agonist. And yeah, people do unfortunately still use, you know, they chip or whatever, you know,

188
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:57.840
Yeah.

189
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: So either way, though, you know,

190
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:17.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's about where you're at, mentally, right, like, well, how far you allow yourself to go and having your own sense of like, okay, why am I even doing this in the first place. I'm taking this medication like I might as well follow through and do what I'm supposed to be doing.

191
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.210
Yeah.

192
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:30.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: But, yeah, yeah. There are some differences there, and also lifestyle wise you know like having a medication that like any other that you can take in your own privacy versus having to go somewhere.

193
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, that's like you said 45 minute drive. I mean,

194
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:49.440
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Yeah, it'd be a lot easier to be the head of our firm, a new them the hills. So it's kind of like over by like Berryessa so it's kind of hard to get places, especially now that I'm waiting for my part of your paradigm, not even sure how long that's going to be

195
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh man, I can't believe I'm sorry about the car accident. What happened there.

196
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:59.820
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Is some she just stopped in the middle of the intersection, because it's something else going on. And I ended up hitting her in the back.

197
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.500
Huh.

198
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sorry about that. It's like

199
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:08.370
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: That's all right.

200
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

201
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'm putting in

202
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.890

203
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.880
“iMyFone”的 iPhone: Okay, and then I guess I'll just go to my regular pharmacy then right

204
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: What I have here is far Mocha integrative is that

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:51.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like I said, I'll put in a week's worth and and I'm going to put in a request that the team at the virtual clinic where you checked in that they help you get an appointment with our psychiatry team here.

208
