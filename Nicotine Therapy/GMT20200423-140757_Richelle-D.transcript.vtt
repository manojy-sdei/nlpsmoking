00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:19.860
Richelle Direny: So as you know, just like with with group. I'm just the process of the whole logging in checking in. So you're pretty familiar with that a lot of you know just understanding that anything that is said that could be deemed as

12
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.250
Richelle Direny: You know making suggestions or starts to hurt yourself or someone else confidentially goes through out the door, but everything is all confidential. We are on a recorded session.

13
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.670
Richelle Direny: So you don't just kind of just, just little blurbs that we don't talk about in group, a lot of the soul, just kind of going over that.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.430
Richelle Direny: So given that I'm going to be your assigned because I think I'm the only

19
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:28.440
Richelle Direny: Therapist that's going to see, are we are assigned therapists. So, you know, after this we can schedule what our follow up session is going to be in that will be getting more into talking about your treatment plan. Like, what are your goals and what is it that you want to work on.

20
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.420
Richelle Direny: You know, traditionally, your goal is always to maintain sobriety.

21
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.230
Richelle Direny: But you know, it's okay. You want to it's we want to talk about. Yes. You want to maintain your goal of sobriety are saying on this journey sobriety, but then

22
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.260
Richelle Direny: The goal that's more looking at taking a deeper look are kind of like peeling it back like a banana, going to the deeper layers.

23
00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:02.100
Richelle Direny: Of what does it mean to maintain your sobriety. What are those core things that needs to be addressed and worked on, to be able to maintain that. Because then if you don't address them.

24
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.630
Richelle Direny: And do those things. It's going to be very hard to maintain that sobriety, because it's learning how to address.

25
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.890
Richelle Direny: Those and work through those core issues, whether it's forgiveness, whether it's to letting things go on whatever it is.

26
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:32.010
Richelle Direny: That you need to work on. So in our next session. That's what we talked about we get more into depth about that. But for today, it's, you know, just kind of me getting a better understanding of your history and kind of the road. You've traveled

27
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.780
Richelle Direny: And helping you along that way based on that big.

28
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.370
rosita stotridge: My big goal for the future. I know you know the step thing is to little, little plans.

29
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.120
Richelle Direny: We do.

30
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.210
rosita stotridge: He those to get to your cargo, but my hospital would be

31
00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.510
Richelle Direny: I want my kids. We want your children back. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's something that you brought up in in in group yesterday.

32
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.580
Richelle Direny: Is just so you know, not being there having your children with you.

33
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.070
I just

34
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.250
rosita stotridge: And I was in a sandbox and clinic when they had took my kids.

35
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.630
And my sister was pushing against it.

36
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.490
And with the Suboxone clinic because I have been in and out of

37
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.170
I was in a methadone clinic out methadone clinic for

38
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.840
I want to say about eight, nine years.

39
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:43.770
Richelle Direny: And then I decided I wanted to get off the methadone. So I went to Suboxone because I kept on getting told us a box someone's you know

40
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.420
Better in health wise.

41
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.360
rosita stotridge: For you, than what methadone was so I switched to Suboxone

42
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.590
And I've been on Suboxone now for

43
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.740
Three, three years.

44
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:12.150
rosita stotridge: Just listen. Totally were my sister was it um my sister doesn't lock Mike optical father

45
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.170
Richelle Direny: And then that makes it a big issue there um

46
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.300
Richelle Direny: Do you still like your by your kids biological father. Are you still with him. Yeah, I'm still with him. Gotcha, gotcha.

47
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.640
He

48
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.410
rosita stotridge: He gets along with my sister, but my sister just not approved with him and

49
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:49.350
Richelle Direny: How many children do you have, I have for it all four of them are with him. Yes, I have no no all four of them are the year with yeah

50
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.630
rosita stotridge: My oldest isn't my

51
00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:00.750
Richelle Direny: younger sister, your gotcha, gotcha. But, but before we get into that, because I mean a lot of that conversation and what you're about to share

52
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:10.680
Richelle Direny: We will get more into that either later or in our next appointment, because then in me getting a better understanding of the dynamic of what's

53
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:27.360
Richelle Direny: Going on in terms of the correlation with you, not having your children and trying to work to regain custody from your sister and the role that you're is the he's your husband or your boyfriend. Boyfriend okay i'm still legally married

54
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.350
Richelle Direny: Gotcha. So, but just understand that whole dynamic

55
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.990
rosita stotridge: I have the law and heck a lot of

56
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.680
Richelle Direny: Do. Yeah, sounds like it so so in working out a goal. It's

57
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:53.490
Richelle Direny: A goal that you can be successful and not to set up yourself for failure. Um, that's how we you know you sharing that piece um me

58
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.480
Richelle Direny: Both of us kind of analyzing the situation.

59
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:11.400
Richelle Direny: And working on creating long term goals and developing short term goals to reach those long term goals. Because I think when we try to do it on our own in our minds, our minds.

60
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:20.130
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like what we talked about yesterday. You see the mountain in front of you. You're making goals of how to get over that mountain

61
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:28.290
Richelle Direny: But then you don't necessarily really truly analyze those goals to say to see if you will be successful. And sometimes we set up ourselves.

62
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:37.020
Richelle Direny: For failure without realizing it. So it's kind of like, okay, I'm going to work at computed completing my

63
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:52.950
Richelle Direny: Like if they're in the legal system and you have to work with a case worker with the care plan. I'm going to achieve my care plan in the next one year. Okay. The question is, is that realistic, are you setting yourself up for failure can you realistically I'm there.

64
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.850
Richelle Direny: With the current

65
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.800
Once we get to that bridge and I'm still here with you.

66
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:13.410
Richelle Direny: Or would you be able to help me with my care plan with through the DCS, you will share them with me. Yes, that's what part of your goal is, is that you will share them with me and then together. I will

67
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:21.060
Richelle Direny: Work with you to understand what your care plan is and how to attain those goals.

68
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:35.400
Richelle Direny: Because you someone is just handing you and says, This is your goal that you have to follow. And if you don't, clearly understand it and you're working to to meet those goals. It was very over overwhelming and it's been a

69
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.800
little over a year since my Fisher as my kids and

70
00:09:41.910 --> 00:10:00.450
Richelle Direny: It just, it happened DCS didn't come in my home or nothing like that. My sister went down an emergency petition and they took on and are you is your sister older yes if she um she has she has children on her own got one biological son and a daughter.

71
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:13.530
Richelle Direny: Got you. But yes, so we will talk more about it. And yes, by all means, we will review your you know what your care plan is and then we will talk about, you know, how can we work through it because

72
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:20.580
Richelle Direny: Again, all of that without maybe necessarily realizing it. Or if you're have if you identify

73
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:32.460
Richelle Direny: All of that can also be a trigger to a relapse or a trigger to using because you just want to numb and you want to end, but you have to come to that to identify those things are triggers.

74
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:44.910
Richelle Direny: So while you want to maintain sobriety while you want to stay on this journey. Um, you have to understand what does it take and what are those triggers to a relapse, so that when life.

75
00:10:45.390 --> 00:11:04.050
Richelle Direny: comes knocking like it always does. You know, how do you handle it. So, but without further ado let's you know get into kind of going over for me at least for understanding of the whole purpose of our session today is to go over the history and in, you know,

76
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:14.610
Richelle Direny: Just kind of letting you know you know when I send the reminders that you have gotten a reminder from you before. Right. Yeah.

77
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.310
Richelle Direny: Okay. If you are unable, if you like, you're running late or you're unable to make it or something comes up.

78
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.200
Richelle Direny: Because especially with with care workers. I don't know how it is in Tennessee. Sometimes they pop up. Sometimes they

79
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.730
Richelle Direny: Announced he tell you all you gotta do this or whatever the situation is and if you have something planned with me.

80
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:38.580
Richelle Direny: It's just sending me a message. Okay, Rochelle. This just came up and this is what I have to do. So there is like that contact that you do that additional piece of content that you have. Okay.

81
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, so tell me, how did you hear about bright hearth.

82
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:56.070
rosita stotridge: Well, I was trying to get into another clinic and I had been a basically a NOT AND A HALF, AND I HAD cobbled over two or 300 clinics.

83
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.840
Richelle Direny: That's a lot of clinics called a lot of what

84
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:12.330
rosita stotridge: My insurance is community United Health community plan and a lot of places this not take it and

85
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:30.660
rosita stotridge: Is when the coronavirus had just started up so everybody was independent mode on that and shutting down and didn't know what they want to do and I was watching. I think it might have been a Ron and Kelly. Do you know what I'm talking about the good morning show Ron and Kelly.

86
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.560
Richelle Direny: And Kelly, who's had a whole bunch of different co host, but she's the one that's

87
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.740
rosita stotridge: Her

88
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:48.480
rosita stotridge: I was watching our show when they had said something about telemedicine and I was like, you know, I wonder if there's something out there were, you know,

89
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:59.130
rosita stotridge: A Suboxone clinic, like that. And I Googled it and Bret Hart's was the first one that came up to the Google and I called and I read and that

90
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.540
Happen.

91
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.820
Richelle Direny: Nice, nice.

92
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.950
Richelle Direny: That's nice, that that outlet at least helped

93
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.040
Richelle Direny: Give you an idea as to

94
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.610
Richelle Direny: You know, it helps a lot.

95
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:23.640
rosita stotridge: Right now I've only got one vehicle and I share it with my boyfriend for, you know, for you to get back and forth to work in

96
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:34.710
rosita stotridge: Your life like how you say you're an over thinker overthink things. So I'm one of those people I think about, okay, okay. This can happen, the time this happens.

97
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:47.100
rosita stotridge: You can get to halfway to work. Does that happen and I would always get so nervous. I went and you know they'd be a flat or something, and I wouldn't be able to make it to the doctors. I mean, this is, I mean, it's just

98
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.850
Richelle Direny: One thing after the other. Yes, it's very

99
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.550
Richelle Direny: You know, it's funny that you said you mentioned overthinking and we're talking about an in group yesterday.

100
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:04.230
Richelle Direny: I was watching this movie with my family. Last night I just kind of yesterday. I just said, You know what, I'm spending the rest of the evening with my family.

101
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:15.750
Richelle Direny: I'm on interrupted and we decided to watch. I don't know if you have Facebook but sometimes on Facebook, they, they have these how they know what you're on your phone.

102
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:23.790
Richelle Direny: They take those commercials and kind of put them on your Facebook page as ads. So I've seen this one movie called Apple mortgage, Kate.

103
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:33.210
Richelle Direny: Until we were watching it last night and like the gist of it was like, here's this lady that was losing her mortgage, but she likes to bake and she her grandmother and her mom, mom.

104
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.880
Richelle Direny: They had this you know trademark in their family. They baked Apple cakes.

105
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:49.140
Richelle Direny: And so it was really good, but she was like, really, about to lose her house like like a life head like hitter from every direction. She's raising three boys and boys, they eat.

106
00:14:49.770 --> 00:15:01.980
Richelle Direny: I'm like, there's never enough food to feed them. And one of the things that in everything that everyone was trying to help her do as she's like losing her house and you know struggling

107
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.930
Richelle Direny: She thought about the worst case scenario in everything.

108
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:14.280
Richelle Direny: It's like she overthought everything like you're watching the movie, you were getting annoyed with it because it's just like, oh my god. Just try

109
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:27.870
Richelle Direny: Just do it. Don't overthink it. And it just goes to show that we all in our own way. We overanalyze we overthink and we think about the most negative thing and why it can't work without actually just saying

110
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:37.410
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna take a leap of faith and I'm going to do it. And let's see what happened. And in that in her case she finally relinquish all of her negative thoughts and everything else.

111
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:45.870
Richelle Direny: And just did it. And she saved her her house and that's why it's called Apple mortgage cake because she ended up saving her house through

112
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:55.650
Richelle Direny: Following what everybody was saying to do it. It's a really cute movie but it it really spoke to exactly what we were talking about yesterday. Thank you. Thank you.

113
00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:02.160
Richelle Direny: Is it on Netflix or what you can Google it on Netflix. So there's this um

114
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:14.130
Richelle Direny: Where I watched it. There's this thing called pure flix. It's kind of like Netflix, but it's like you're Christian version of Netflix. So it's called P pure flix p q r e flicks

115
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.630
Richelle Direny: That's where I watch it. You could Google to see if it's on Netflix or even on YouTube because I've also watched a lot of movies on youtube

116
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:35.490
Richelle Direny: To look that up. I didn't even know there was a thing called pure flix. Yeah, it's like I'm like I said, it's like a Christian version of Netflix. So it's like all these like Christian movies, if you will.

117
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:44.400
Richelle Direny: But it's on that. So it's the same way. Like you pay for a subscription to Netflix. It's the same way you pay for a scripts purse for those scripts subscription.

118
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:59.070
Richelle Direny: To pure flix but you could if you know if it's not something that you want to get or think about getting but it's a lot of positive movies that are on there but um if you wanted that particular movie. It's on. Um, you can see if it's on Netflix or if it's on.

119
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:09.060
Richelle Direny: YouTube. YouTube because like I said you can watch movies on you. I've been watching a lot of movies on youtube. I don't know how

120
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:20.310
rosita stotridge: I found one side that it's letting me watch like brand new movies that just come out. I just watched it trolls. The neutral movie what's

121
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.010

123
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.030
rosita stotridge: It's not a horror or anything like that. It's the spin

124
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.390
rosita stotridge: Yeah, it will make you jump.

125
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:56.970
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we had my daughter wanting to watch them like, I don't know about that. But, um, but, yeah, but that's kind of where that that that comes in, but that, you know, I'm happy that you were able to find us. A lot of people don't. It's kind of like that hidden Chen, where

126
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:10.380
Richelle Direny: When you think about bright heart. You're like, oh, I don't know. And then you find out, like, it's so convenient on you. It's the same concept as if you're physically going to a location, but you're just doing it on the telemedicine.

127
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.950
Richelle Direny: Give me. Um, if you could just not go into a little bit of details to tell me how it is.

128
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:28.830
Richelle Direny: Like how did you start this journey of addiction, like what what transpired what happened. How old were you when you first started, whether it's a drink or whatever it is that you're doing in high school.

129
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.440
my junior year

130
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:54.240
Started just pretty much saying and I fell in love with it. My puppy love first love the bad boy. I was a good girl. I was on the varsity cheerleading team, but until two I live in a small community as say there's probably maybe 300 400 graduation glass.

133
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:23.160
Richelle Direny: But I was spoiled rotten and I just after smoking pot skipping school and one thing led to another. Um, so the first thing that you tried was smoking marijuana. Yeah.

136
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.320

137
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.590
Okay.

Richelle Direny: And it didn't work. When was that

188
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.450
rosita stotridge: The very first time that I started the Methadone clinic.

189
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.940
Is when I lived in Virginia Norfolk, Virginia.

190
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.160
And it was back I have tagged Julian. Oh, none.

191
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.550
Because I got clean

192
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:14.130
I had moved from here, moved went to Virginia to get away. I had an opportunity. My sister can have a step sister that lives in Virginia has been retired military

193
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:29.760
And they went to give me a way out. So I went there and state with them and I was clean for two and a half years. Well I about two years and I had Kaylee.

194
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.030
And I ended up getting on.

195
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:41.190
And I hadn't told a good doctor. I did not tell the doctor anything about my addiction problem and the time

196
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.610
rosita stotridge: And after ahead Kalia had gained so much weight. I ended up getting an ascetic nerve.

197
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.690
Myself.

198
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.710
And ended up grabbing me Percocet.

199
00:27:54.090 --> 00:28:00.660
And it been out of control. From there, and my addiction started back so

200
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:13.980
rosita stotridge: I would say the first the first time I've gotten to the clinic was 2010

201
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:29.940
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm third treatment. And that was, I went to a methadone clinic in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Okay, and then 2010 in between 2010 and now have

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.170
Richelle Direny: And in that time in those last

204
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.720
Richelle Direny: 2010. This is after the birth of your first child.

205
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.910

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.630
I missed

212
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.570
I missed all the last

213
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.310
I mean,

214
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.190
rosita stotridge: Even being an addict.

215
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.640
I was still there for my kids.

216
00:29:52.050 --> 00:30:00.270
rosita stotridge: Especially again, you know, like recitals or Caledon Homecoming Queen. I was there.

217
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:10.500
rosita stotridge: A mom at a Go Fund Me and Suboxone or methadone or something not you know in the younger years it was about getting half. It was

218
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:23.670
Now, it was still maintaining maintaining and being sick and not not being sick and john to take care of the daily things that I needed to take care of.

219
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.530
And

220
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.200
I just

221
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.960
Miss Kindles burst sports, Mr first wall.

222
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.300
As missed everything

223
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.400
rosita stotridge: But I can't I'm learning not to hold on to that.

224
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.050
I got to look beyond it, and

225
00:30:54.090 --> 00:31:06.240
Richelle Direny: It's yeah you yes learning how to look beyond it button and not you know yes it's a memory. It's something that's there. Um, it's just learning how to not let

226
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:26.520
Richelle Direny: You know, the, the spilt milk affects your today because you can't undo it. You can't undo it and it's coming to that place of acceptance that you you can't undo it. You can only focus on today and moving forward. That's all you can. That's all you have the power to do

227
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:36.840
Richelle Direny: You don't have the power to change yesterday, but you have the power to do something today and keep moving on. And it's, um,

228
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.160
Richelle Direny: It's getting through every hour of the day not going, day by day, but it's getting through each hour

229
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.570
Yeah.

230
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.420
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, it's very, it's

231
00:31:52.740 --> 00:32:00.090
rosita stotridge: Being a mother and I mean I don't know of a bother you can feel what the mom does. I have no idea, but

232
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:08.040
rosita stotridge: It's, I don't even like watching TV shows or movies that involves

233
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.420
Kids children.

234
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:17.940
Richelle Direny: Because it's a bit, it's a it's a bad memory of I just miss it. I miss it so bad.

235
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.570
Richelle Direny: You know, it's so it is how

236
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.180
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of just giving a tip before we move on, it's

237
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.130
Richelle Direny: It's how you receive the information

238
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:56.130
Richelle Direny: You could receive the information and look at it as all the things that you're missing and keep you stagnant in the past of what you're missing daily or you can receive it as encouragement of how much harder. You need to work in Rick

239
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.560
Richelle Direny: You remember that movie, you know, it just hit me, you remember that movie losing Isaiah.

240
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.600
Richelle Direny: With Halle Berry. It's a very, very old movie.

241
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:14.220
Richelle Direny: Losing Isaiah with Halle Berry. And I want to say her name is Meryl Streep

242
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.440
Richelle Direny: It's an old, old movie, but it was very was a child.

243
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:29.820
Richelle Direny: No Halle Berry was the drug addict. She was the drug addict who she was so focused on getting high. I think maybe because she was

244
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:40.620
Richelle Direny: I think I want to say she was homeless in the movie, but um she was. I think she was homeless in the movie, but it's just so happened. I want to say like her addiction was heroin.

245
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:48.300
Richelle Direny: Or cocaine or whatever it was, whatever drug. It was and she gave birth behind a dumpster.

246
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:56.010
Richelle Direny: And after she gave birth, she gave birth herself behind the dumpster. She put the baby in the garbage. But then the next day she went back to get the baby. And the baby was gone.

247
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:07.680
Richelle Direny: And so, Meryl Streep, who was, I think it was a nurse or a doctor had developed this attachment to this little boy and eventually had adopted the child.

248
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.030
Richelle Direny: And losing Isaiah. The whole premise of the movie.

249
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:23.760
Richelle Direny: Is what I'm saying to you, it's, it's, you have two choices. You can either look at, like you said, you don't like watching movies or maybe being around people with hat would have children or hearing about their stories.

250
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:34.650
Richelle Direny: It's how you receive it. Do I just stay focused on what I'm missing and how much I long and miss them or do I now stay focused on or do I receive the information as

251
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:47.280
Richelle Direny: I need to fix me I need to work on me so that I can regain custody of them or working on not just regaining custody, but developing a relationship with them.

252
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:59.250
Richelle Direny: And so, losing the whole name losing Isaiah was Halle Berry was the drug addict in the movie, how much she worked very hard to regain

253
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:11.130
Richelle Direny: Custody and how she went to court and fought this family to gain back custody of the child and because she had the past of the drug use.

254
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:19.170
Richelle Direny: In court and her case everybody kind of was looking at her as just this addict and how she had to really work hard.

255
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:27.630
Richelle Direny: With her caseworker and everything to regain custody of this child that she saw wanted back in the end.

256
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:36.420
Richelle Direny: It came down to it was about, you know, working through her care plan with the caseworker and just kind of how things had gone gone wrong for her.

257
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:45.210
Richelle Direny: But how this child who didn't really know who she was, because all he knew was this mom and dad and brother and sister who had gotten him.

258
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:55.680
Richelle Direny: Um, but how she worked at gaining a relationship with this child through this adopted mother, where the adopted mother than chills because she now noticed

259
00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:04.320
Richelle Direny: Mother to mother what it must mean like for her and how she felt. And so, towards the end of the movie it was more about

260
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:16.170
Richelle Direny: Her now working with her allowing her back in the child's life and it was, it's a very powerful, but it speaks volumes to what you're talking about. And seeing how do I receive this movie.

261
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.490
rosita stotridge: My sister is very she's very thoughtful.

262
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.060
I don't know that might not be the word but

263
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:34.410
I'm like I said, we didn't, we didn't grow up in the same home and my sister had like kind of resentment against me, but

264
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:51.780
rosita stotridge: My mom. My mom Randolph when my when my sister was younger and letter of my memo and took off with my step dad. That was a truck driver. I was two months ago with a baby and my mom just took off with my step dad and they

265
00:36:51.960 --> 00:37:06.990
Richelle Direny: Go on. So you stayed with mom and she got sent with grandma. So now I have issues with you, which is this was frustration because there's nothing to do with me. Yeah. And you really get rid up with your mom and she'll talk. My sister saying

266
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:14.370
rosita stotridge: But like how how you just explained it right there. If I tried to get her to set, you know, try to open up like that.

267
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:27.450
rosita stotridge: She wants. She wants to open up like that with me at all. She won't talk to me about it. But she does, she has a very, very bad resentment with me or she became famous that bet you never has.

268
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.350
And she just

269
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:43.500
Richelle Direny: When it goes back to what I talked to what I just said to you control you have no control like her resentment is her resentment which base. If I'm just going to go with based on just what you're saying.

270
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.680
Richelle Direny: Your resentments is this place because they don't have nothing. So you really are frustrated with our mother.

271
00:37:50.700 --> 00:38:02.670
Richelle Direny: Our mother is the one that you really need to have that conversation with, um, so I guess a beat being bitter into spiteful towards me. I had no choice. I mean, she chose

272
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:15.570
Richelle Direny: I was an infant. Then she kept me like you can't be upset with me. But then she's looking with you had the best years with or an idea of the best years with our mother. Oh, yeah. So, and I didn't get that.

273
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:28.080
rosita stotridge: She would get so angry because my mom didn't make me live it said that it made me better. So my stepsisters doing it and I was around us that Fisher is more than what I was with my sister.

274
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:40.860
rosita stotridge: I call my step father, Dad, you know, when he is he's, he's my he's my dad, he's my dad and my sister, my younger she hated it. I mean, it's

275
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:54.780
rosita stotridge: As I was around her and I would say you know that you really like bad went one with us there, you know, and I'll be like, what, what yeah you want you know Sam was there with us. I mean, she doesn't use

276
00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.560
Richelle Direny: But that's not something you have control over her how her outlook and that's something like in family therapy.

277
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:12.930
Richelle Direny: Between you and her that you guys would have to do sometime later. But I think for you right now, you have to work in the realm of what you have control. I have control of this, that's all I have.

278
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:24.720
Richelle Direny: Anything outside of those parameters. I have no control over. I can't do anything about it. I can only I can only do and work within the realm of what I'm giving control of

279
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:41.790
Richelle Direny: You have to work on you and what I have to work on is regaining a relationship with my children. They are young right now and they may not understand that. But all you can do. Like I said, like, even with that movie. It's what did she do with the information that came in.

280
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:51.180
Richelle Direny: To her, she said, I want my child back. That's my goal. That's the only thing I'm looking at

281
00:39:51.570 --> 00:40:05.670
Richelle Direny: And if this this which is the drugs and the addiction and all of that, if that's going to take me away from my goal, then I don't want any part of that does she have to work against the grains and everything that got thrown to her. She did.

282
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:07.680
Richelle Direny: Um, but

283
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.760
rosita stotridge: Can I thought when we do when I go to court with my sister on all this

284
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:24.540
rosita stotridge: As you know, may pass it pass my drug screens don't have known you know no problems doing good maintaining

285
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:34.650
rosita stotridge: And are they are they a way I could buy if it's a judge tries to order me to be off the box and before I get my kids back

286
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.550
Richelle Direny: What you would do is remember there are certain drugs that are like still new and just limited education, what you can do.

287
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:51.270
Richelle Direny: Is you can give because you're a part of this program you can give consent that if your caseworker once the contact bright heart.

288
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:59.880
Richelle Direny: To find out, are you going to groups are you seeing if you're doing counseling. Are you doing A, B, C, D, or if you're doing all of it. If you give consent.

289
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:09.390
Richelle Direny: Then we could you know have that conversation. Now that would have to be them speaking to the doctor to say whether or not

290
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:18.390
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, you coming off that because they can order you to say, oh, you got to get off Suboxone in order for you to get your kids.

291
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.920
Richelle Direny: You know, I don't believe that they can do that because if the doctor can

292
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:33.270
Richelle Direny: Justify or, you know, to show documentation as to why and how long it takes. Before that, so for some people coming on Suboxone is a, it's a long term goal.

293
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:40.680
Richelle Direny: But not long term like in the next six months. It's a long term as in, you know, further out that eventually you'll get to that point.

294
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:45.810
Richelle Direny: But how do you get to that point, you have to do the therapy, along with the tapering

295
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:51.690
Richelle Direny: You have to do the two, you're not going to just say, oh, I just want to come off of it. Just like that.

296
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:59.010
Richelle Direny: But then if you are never addressing. Why were you on it in the first place. What caused you to be on it in the first place. Well, I was an addict.

297
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.920
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, why were you an addict in the first place. Well, I had all these other issues going on if you never address that.

298
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:12.450
Richelle Direny: Then saying that I want to taper off of the Suboxone and never addressing these underlying issues. Guess what you're gonna

299
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:30.510
Richelle Direny: You're, you're setting yourself up for failure and you're you're setting yourself up to lose your children. I've been there, done that. Exactly so. So do you have any pending legal charges. No, no. Do you have, um,

300
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.210
Richelle Direny: Have you been incarcerated.

301
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:34.980
Richelle Direny: OK.

302
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:45.420
Richelle Direny: OK. Okay. Um, no underlying underlining not mental health medical issues. I'm the only

303
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:50.610
rosita stotridge: One kidney one over three and a half of the uterus.

304
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.280
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

305
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.350
rosita stotridge: It was our birth defect.

306
00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:07.530
Richelle Direny: You had four children. Yeah, a half of the uterus and one ovary. Yes. So you are a blessed woman.

307
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.040
Richelle Direny: Yes, I am very pleased that

308
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:16.200
rosita stotridge: My children. They're. They're beautiful angels

309
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.450
I mean, they really are.

310
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:27.660
rosita stotridge: My youngest Kindle. She is just she's a doll baby. Beautiful. They're so special. But yes, it's

311
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:35.370
rosita stotridge: When I get when when I went in being pregnant. I would have I would sign a consent forms delay like students

312
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:52.800
rosita stotridge: When they be doing X ultrasounds, only they would let students come in because it's called a your chronic at your clinic uterus. So maybe in pregnant with one kid would be like you being pregnant with twins, because my uterus is so small. So,

313
00:43:54.090 --> 00:44:11.850
rosita stotridge: If I got pregnant with twins were my uterus is so small. If I got pregnant with twins and they both was in the same sec, I could carry books that well, it would be very high risk and watch me very well, but I would been able to carry them. But if in separate sex.

314
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:26.970
rosita stotridge: They would have to try to take one and safe one with Leah because they've been in separate sex. It's more room that they would have to have in there and they would be no way that I could so maybe I'm pregnant with one baby. It'd be like you've been pregnant.

315
00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:39.030
Richelle Direny: With twins. Wow. Well, I have to say is that you're a blessed woman in one day. Once you everything is on you will be able to tell your story. So maybe your journey is your journey for a reason because

316
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:46.200
Richelle Direny: To have all of that and still be able to bring forth for children is a miracle within itself. Um, so

317
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.320
Richelle Direny: And that's one thing.

318
00:44:49.530 --> 00:45:00.750
rosita stotridge: Because I didn't know about my birth defect until I was 16 I went to or until I was 15 I went to UT cheerleading camp and they draw me in a third, a human. Human

319
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:14.550
rosita stotridge: And they had Jordan my kidney, but that's how we found out that I was 16 years old before we even knew any of this, and that doctors looking like I know you've had your organs, you know, kidney, so no

320
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:22.680
Richelle Direny: One kidney is a birth defect as well. Yes, I only have some reap reap

321
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.150
Richelle Direny: Reap Rufus system came about. Yeah.

322
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:51.360
Richelle Direny: Wow, wow, that's truly amazing. And it's truly a miracle. It's a miracle. So you've gotten through, you know, having a half of a reproductive system for healthy children, you have a story to tell. One day, um, do you have any. Were you ever diagnosed with a mental illness. No, I've never

323
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.890
rosita stotridge: I've never actually sat down with the

324
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.900

325

Richelle Direny: I'm now.

343
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:12.960

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:16.470
Richelle Direny: Now I'm BIT OF COURSE HE SAYS SHE TRIED IT, which means that she was able to what is it was an overdose, or she was a full he went to cut herself, um, they think she was going through

385
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.150
rosita stotridge: I can't take it. After you have a baby.

386
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:30.570
Richelle Direny: Little smarter. Yes, I was down there helping her at the time she had just had her youngest son, and he was probably

387
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:39.510
Two, three weeks old, and we didn't before you leave about 10 minutes from me. My mom and dad did and

388
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:46.590
rosita stotridge: We're she was having problem, you know, she really didn't want to go and chase you didn't want to have really had nothing to do with thing.

389
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:54.420
rosita stotridge: So I was going down there and helping her out with him and I had went in there. She went to take shower. Now, what made me go check on her because I

390
00:53:54.870 --> 00:54:11.580
rosita stotridge: Heard it down and she was in the bathtub and she had tried slit her wrists and within the water. So my instant I didn't have a phone. So I just grabbed the baby and I took off running to my mom and dad's and they call 911

391
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.350
Richelle Direny: And how long ago was

392
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:23.040
Goodness.

393
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.510
2000 maybe

394
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.370
20 years 20 years ago.

395
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:34.740
Richelle Direny: Okay.

396
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:50.940
Richelle Direny: Now, substance abuse, I know you talked about the people who were addicts, your, your dad. Your, your one of your stepsisters and your mom. Now what about your uncle your know your grandparents were addicts, were they

397
00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:11.580
Richelle Direny: Not that I know now. Okay. And for your children. You don't know of them being diagnosed with anything a DD ADHD behavioral disturbances. Yes, my fish magister tickling then therapist, when all this was going on with the

398
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.720
custody battle.

399
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:33.480
rosita stotridge: My Kaylee. I was she went and she was an addicted to anything when I had her Hayden and Ella. I was in the Methadone clinic. When I had them so they had to stay in children's hospital for about a month.

rosita stotridge: Candle. I was on Sunday Texas her. She stayed probably two to three weeks at children's coming off of it, but they have diagnosed Hayden with ADHD.

402
00:55:53.580 --> 00:56:00.930
rosita stotridge: And I said it's a side effect from the Methadone is what I haven't read no papers. This is what my sister as it to me.

403
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.140
rosita stotridge: Ella.

404
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.990
got diagnosed with them.

405
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:12.600
It's in the same. It's not OCD.

406
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.600
It's not ADHD.

407
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.590
rosita stotridge: But it's in the same diaphragm. I won't. I can't

408
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:32.460
Richelle Direny: Well, they'll see the 88 they're two different things ADHD is a hyperactivity disorder OCD is obsessive compulsive

409
00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.490
rosita stotridge: Right Hayden stuff at ADHD.

410
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.770
rosita stotridge: Ella's though I can't say says she has ADHD and there's another one. I can't thank you

411
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.420
Richelle Direny: Is it a behavioral thing.

412
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:52.950
rosita stotridge: Yeah, it was in the same isn't the thing that for him as a behavioral thing that OCD is an ADHD.

413
00:56:53.370 --> 00:57:05.250
Richelle Direny: What OCD is not in the same. It's not in the same thing OCD is completely. It's a little different, um, is it like is it like conduct disorder oppositional defiance. If it's a behavior.

414
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:05.970
Yeah.

415
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:08.430
What you just said, what's the

416
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.830
Richelle Direny: Oppositional defiance is when. What's the initials for that.

417
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.110
Richelle Direny: Oppositional defiance is there's no initials, it's just

418
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.600
rosita stotridge: Odd DC. Maybe. Is that what it is.

419
00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.760
Richelle Direny: Oppositional defiance disorder would be odd.

420
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:44.340
Richelle Direny: That, that sounds like is it is it like they act out like they just have these out versus they have no regards to authority and like they will just have like this outburst and just just very hard to come. Yeah, that's it. How old is he. How old is that

421
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:48.240
It's a she, and she's the one that just turn

422
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:50.100
For

423
00:57:51.570 --> 00:58:05.430
Richelle Direny: Some wow that's kind of yeah opposite if if you're talking about child behavioral disorders behavioral especially there's those oppositional where there's nothing you can do to I'm saying it was

424
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.530
rosita stotridge: a birth defect reaction also the Methadone

425
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:25.200
Richelle Direny: Yo, I have to think about what diagnosis. That is, um, that as a think about the diagnosis, but that's what she has. Yeah, like she

426
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:37.200
rosita stotridge: If you tell her to go do something she is. She's gotten better with it at it now but she'll. She would tell you know and i mean be determined on not doing it.

427
00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:44.910
Richelle Direny: I mean, but and you're saying that that's because of the fact that she was I mean oppositional. That's a behavioral. This is what they

428
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:51.210
rosita stotridge: never took my daughter. I thought my daughter was acting like a little normal two year old kid.

429
00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.350
And me.

430
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:58.530
rosita stotridge: But I think my sister, not like to clinics. My sister's very against

431
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:08.880
rosita stotridge: Addict thing my sister couldn't stand that my kids and I had my I had my own skeletons in my closet about

432
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.460
rosita stotridge: Making a choice about having babies addicted.

433
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.460
rosita stotridge: No. Was it there. No, it wasn't.

434
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:37.230
rosita stotridge: That just like I told her, just because I'm an addict. Does that mean that I can never be a mother acting experience motherhood, just because I because I went and doing nothing else. I was just in the Methadone clinic. That's all I was doing and

435
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:50.370
rosita stotridge: She just, yeah. She said she's been very against it from day one. She said at the baby can later and go through withdrawal think no different than you doing it. And it was just

436
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:56.340
Richelle Direny: I mean, yeah, it is. I'm looking at it. Is this the only thing when it comes down to a child with mental health, it would have to be

437
00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:07.050
Richelle Direny: Oppositional it says she's oppositional and I mean that's, I would have to read that, because that's to say that it's attached to the fact that I can, I can see it being

438
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:12.690
Richelle Direny: Medical something medical related to the fact that you were

439
01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:21.390
Richelle Direny: Because she was born addicted but oppositional is more a behavioral thing where and like you said it could just be

440
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:34.110
Richelle Direny: The fact that she's a kitten, and she's mimicking at four years old. You're mimicking what the other kids are doing or whatever else is going on. So at four years old to say you have oppositional defiance is a bit

441
01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:42.510
Richelle Direny: I mean, what kid doesn't tell you know something, you tell them to do. I mean, that's, let me find a kid that doesn't tell you notice something. Then I'm going to give that kid a minute.

442
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:44.670
Richelle Direny: Because

443
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.170
rosita stotridge: I don't know things that she

444
01:00:53.910 --> 01:01:12.210
rosita stotridge: And I mean she she did take them to their best Boca she did have, you know, she did have a folder on it, everything but elsewhere. Some doctors, I think, because there's so many people that are against you know people that women that's on Suboxone or methadone having children.

445
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:20.880
rosita stotridge: A lot of I got I got treated like dirt. A few nurses there my parentheses, I mean very rude.

446
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:32.850
Richelle Direny: And that you just you just gotta take it and swallow it and move on. Yeah. Again, it is, it is. You just haven't taken swallow it just, there's just lacking.

447
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:42.840
rosita stotridge: Knowledge of the whole concept for someone that is got the disease with an addiction. But some people just

448
01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:49.290
rosita stotridge: I can't, like, I can't understand where my sisters and my brother and my sister can understand where I'm coming from.

449
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:49.950
Mm hmm.

450
01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:59.220
Richelle Direny: But it goes. It comes down to this. It's, it's, it's whether or not I want to understand it or whether or not I want to be stuck in my ways of thinking

451
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:07.920
Richelle Direny: If it's not affecting me directly, like that, or I'm not doing it, then I don't want to understand it and I don't care to understand it. That's kind of when you can't really fight.

452
01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:24.450
Richelle Direny: A person's choice say they wanted. This is how they then you pick your battles, is this one worth fighting if they refuse to to do something so moving to the next arm thing use. Hold on.

453
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.760
Richelle Direny: Were you you were born and raised in Ohio. I mean, in in Tennessee.

454
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.430
Yeah. Yes.

455
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.270
Richelle Direny: We talked about what you want.

456
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:44.880
rosita stotridge: I'm moved

457
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:54.690
The first boyfriend. I told you the first love available within government down. I started drifting down the wrong path.

458
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:08.070
My stepsister had given me a chance. And she said, you can come up here. She said, and stay with me and I hope you get a job and you know you get clean get up on your feet.

459
01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:25.050
rosita stotridge: My whole plan was to you know get clean. Get a job and and go back to school that was, that was my plan because this is before had, you know, had kids so that that was a big plan a month. Well, I got down in

460
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.800
rosita stotridge: Virginia and I stayed there for

461
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.130
Seven years six and a half years.

462
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:39.690
Yeah, about six minutes anywhere from five, six years I had lived down there.

463
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.010
Then I ended up moving back up here because

464
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.440
Amanda

465
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.720
Has been bitten Raquel

466
01:03:53.070 --> 01:04:02.340
Richelle Direny: Okay, so this is what we're doing. Um, I mean there's a lot you can work on, but we're gonna we're going to chip away at it slowly. Chip. Chip. Chip.

467
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:13.830
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, you can't take down the whole wall of Jericho just in one setting takes a lot of planning and preparation on a long time before you bring down the wall.

468
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:24.060
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, it's just the, you know, I like I always tell everyone you know I'm here with you. You're on. If you want to stay on that journey. I'll be on that journey with you.

469
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:35.310
Richelle Direny: I'll try to guide you as much as you allow I think what makes a great relationship is communication between the two. And I'm showing up.

470
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:44.100
Richelle Direny: And that's it, showing up and coming to that place of not just, um,

471
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:52.830
Richelle Direny: Awareness but acceptance. You can't accept something if you're not aware of it and once you're aware of it. You have to learn how to accept it.

472
01:04:53.070 --> 01:05:00.990
Richelle Direny: And accept what is in your power to do what is in the power in your power and control to do and accept the things that you have no control over.

473
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:12.480
Richelle Direny: Um, and understanding why you don't have control over certain things. So that's kind of when I say like, I'm here on this journey with you and if one of your goals is to

474
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:19.650
Richelle Direny: If one of your goals is to and I know one of your biggest goal that you're focusing on is to be able to work towards

475
01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:32.100
Richelle Direny: meeting the goals of your career care plan to regain custody for you to understand what that looks like and for you to come to that place of willingness to say you are willing to

476
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.500
Richelle Direny: Go through the trenches, if that's what you have to do to get it.

477
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:49.050
Richelle Direny: And, you know, maybe this is early in the game, but you know something, like I said, it's what you. It's what you receive the information. Will you take away from it information, it's two different directions. You can go, you can

478
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:50.760
Richelle Direny: Huh.

479
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.130
rosita stotridge: I said I think they'll probably made me do

480
01:05:54.300 --> 01:06:03.330
Richelle Direny: parenting classes and there'll be all kinds of things. And I'm sure I'm sure because and that's what I was saying in everything that comes to you.

481
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:15.930
Richelle Direny: If it's overwhelming. In that moment, walk away from it. So you're my coach and what what the reason why you're walking away so you can reset your mind to be able to receive the information and then at a time.

482
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:25.950
Richelle Direny: And the reason why I said, you know, it's what you do when you read when when information is given to you. You can either go this way or you can go that way, but you have to determine what is going to be your destination.

483
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:36.540
Richelle Direny: Depending on direction that you go in and you have to. And, you know, as I was talking to you. And I thought about that movie losing Isaiah, it really speaks to exactly what you're going to go through

484
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:46.050
Richelle Direny: It speaks 100% of what you're going to go through, because there was a lot that she had to do. There was a point where she gained back custody of the child.

485
01:06:46.560 --> 01:07:00.330
Richelle Direny: And then the child was pretty much ripped away from her and how she handled that. Did she go back to relapse, or did she get the she stayed on that journey. She didn't allow her circumstances in her situation.

486
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:06.840
Richelle Direny: To get her down that she lose sight of the goal, but eventually

487
01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:11.160
Richelle Direny: Area. Yeah, exactly. Did that when

488
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:19.080
rosita stotridge: I when they took they got me what they got me on with my kids was neglect and

489
01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:35.970
rosita stotridge: It was neglect and Benjamin is what they call me and then they mimic comes in play, because I was late and my oldest daughter has always had a relationship with my mother, where she stayed with her like for

490
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:46.800
rosita stotridge: Two, three weeks at a time. It wasn't just me going and open up the door and draw could help my kid it was nothing like that he had agreement.

491
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:56.310
rosita stotridge: I mean, and we've done this. Ever since Kaylee is Warren and when I lived in Virginia, you know, she would come down here and stay with my mom for a month and then come back home and

492
01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.190
rosita stotridge: But the town Kaylee third school

493
01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:12.360
rosita stotridge: I had with through junior had with my husband and come here and when I met my kids and his dad. Now we had go to place and the school that Kaylee was going to

494
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:31.710
rosita stotridge: Get into sport and she loved volleyball. I mean just crazy about volleyball. And I told her, I said, Okay, yes. And because I was living at my mom's that, you know, for the past 30 YEARS TO IN SO IT'S MY MOM'S HOME TO WORK AND

495
01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:43.410
rosita stotridge: Idea as that. Okay, Kayla, so this is what we'll do is I'll let you stay with nano during the week go to school and out rally do your volleyball and everything and you can normally I'm a weekend.

496
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:51.660
rosita stotridge: She said, Okay, I had and humid even come over to my house on through the week, you know, and found that I would take her to school.

497
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.590
That was slam my sister never really complained about that now.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:22.500
rosita stotridge: Was it was a little role that we add me concerned about it. And this is in the fall and you know like in between little newborns. When you take out their socks la got buzz.

518
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:38.550
rosita stotridge: And how they can you know what new skin pigment in between their toes that tell her toes. Look, my sister took pictures of that and blew it up. They that's where the Nicolette come in. So they got me for Nikolay

rosita stotridge: And they got me for my they said my kids. One of my goals, before I can have them back all my kids has got a result in one home. So that means like Haley couldn't stay with my mom and come with me on the weekend and my step dad and crispy couldn't be keeping the other three

520
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.310
rosita stotridge: Like they did, they all would have to resign and home so that they don't mean because

521
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.190
Pretty much mean

522
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.660
rosita stotridge: When we say the grandparents too much, but my dad.

523
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:22.200
rosita stotridge: My biological dad played it all against Me went and testified against me and said that he was too old to take care of them. And it was just craziness.

524
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:32.820
Richelle Direny: YEAH, YEAH, IT'S IT TO YOU HAVE YOUR Reverend Steve, for sure. You have a lot going on. Um, and it sounds like your sister.

525
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:39.600
Richelle Direny: She really is finding a way to keep building a case against you. But the question is, or

526
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:54.870
Richelle Direny: The question is, or what it appears to be is that you don't have enough strength to fight her or courage. Yeah. You know, you don't have enough courage and because

527
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.690
Richelle Direny: She knows that she uses it against you. Yeah.

528
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:12.690
rosita stotridge: I got very overwhelmed and when they took them away and a new day wasn't coming home, my dad and being an addict. I couldn't find a way out. But heroin heroin was not the way

529
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:22.350
Richelle Direny: It just, it just helps you to numb the pain, the thought, when do you want to sell it come in the house is gone, everything worse.

530
01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:23.160
rosita stotridge: The pain was

531
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:26.820
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. And you needed to stop feeling in that moment.

532
01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:38.280
Richelle Direny: So, definitely. That's why I said you have to. It's not just about taking Suboxone. It's not just taking these things. It's, you have to get to the source of it and because your sister knows your weakness.

533
01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:46.860
Richelle Direny: Because you show it and you don't have anything to come up against every time. If the more I kick you down. The more I speak down to you, the more I put you in a slumber.

534
01:14:47.280 --> 01:15:05.190
Richelle Direny: The, you're just going to reach for some kind of numbing device that out of, um, that you basically just take me away from here, feeling so I don't have to feel and see and know what's going on. And, you know, so I didn't, I didn't

535
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:14.190
Richelle Direny: I didn't thought I did she knows that she knows if it based on what you're saying that went to my court dates. I don't know my drug test.

536
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:23.220
rosita stotridge: Passed all much or test. I've done that. I'm Brigitte view things they wanted me to do. I mean, I've done everything that the judge asked me to do.

537
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:32.790
rosita stotridge: But except for one thing. And this is what really bugs me in the answer show where my sister doesn't like

538
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.660
rosita stotridge: The kids is that she's trying

539
01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.770
rosita stotridge: She's trying to say is abusive.

540
01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:56.100
rosita stotridge: And you've never hit me. I mean, we've had arguments, where we have raised her voice with one another, but they have never been no hit and and she just make the sound wonky is just

541
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:02.940
awful person and bear, they don't want the kids.

542
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.990
rosita stotridge: She says you don't want my kids around. So basically when they

543
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:16.440
Richelle Direny: See fight for his own children. Well, this is the crazy part two is

544
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.540
rosita stotridge: Where I'm still married

545
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.720
Richelle Direny: My wife has no right over there.

546
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.010
rosita stotridge: Yes, girl.

547
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:31.950
Richelle Direny: Yeah, he has no record for them. He has it, they're technically they're all of them belong to your husband. Yes, unless your husband, unless your husband.

548
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:41.700
Richelle Direny: Says he has to sign to say no, they are not my kids and then that's when he can claim rights over again so yeah yeah

549
01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:50.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it is. Let me hold on, let me see what I can schedule your next your next appointment is is definitely

Yeah, they wanted me to

552
01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.990
Imagine the rigid few things live in everything. They were asking me to do.

553
01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:11.010
Well, there's a call of a protection order.

554
01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:17.760
Think that's I think that's what that's called wanted me to take one of those out on my kids is that

555
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:26.970
This word. You know, I could even have a process of trying to get them back and then they want to judge them and try to order said

556
01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:39.660
I had to be completely out, out of the box and clinic office, the box and before I get them back and it was craziness and I didn't have nobody with knowledge or anything to actually help

557
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.520
