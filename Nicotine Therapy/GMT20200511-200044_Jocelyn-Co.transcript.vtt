00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.319
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's start with what's working out for you. Okay.

2
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.110
mitchell u: For a while machover as well like

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.190
Jocelyn Corrales: We diversity. Yes. With regards to activities. Your know just your daily activities. Yes, just your day to be activity dislike you what you're doing.

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.700
Jocelyn Corrales: The day

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
mitchell u: Daily. I just finished working out. I work out every day.

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.390
mitchell u: The treadmill.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.840
mitchell u: I'm in a program right now for like the next either I have like a month or like two months left because I transferred from another program due to insurance issues.

8
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.050
mitchell u: So like I can either take the credits for my last rehab.

9
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
mitchell u: And use them with this rehab because I needed to 90 days in total for core

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.380
mitchell u: So I'm still debating whether to use my previous credits or just do another full 90 here.

11
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.600
mitchell u: Because I just 16 days credits are

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.560
mitchell u: Really, I could I could do two and a half months in this rehab and take my last rehabs credits and then be done.

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:25.020
mitchell u: But I might just do the whole 90 at this rehab plus my 16 credits. So I have a little over so I can show the judge and maybe the judge will be a little happier. Um, yeah. Yeah, but uh yeah everything's working out. I wake up I go to group I

14
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.790
mitchell u: Yeah, I have group till like three o'clock, pretty much.

15
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.050
mitchell u: I do my running in between groups.

16
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.120
mitchell u: I have my computer here. So they let me study like I'm studying computer science in school.

17
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.900
mitchell u: And

18
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:59.490
mitchell u: I'm signing up for school this month school starts next month online courses, some computer science classes I'm yeah I'm about to transfer I have very few classes and then I transfer

19
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.660
Jocelyn Corrales: What do you mean transfer transfer

20
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.150
mitchell u: transfer to a four year college. Yeah.

21
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.420
mitchell u: I mean Community College, though.

22
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.290
mitchell u: But yeah, as far as everything in this rehab. It's pretty good. You know, I'm just, I'm just praying that like my insurance covers

23
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Every week

24
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:35.580
mitchell u: You know I yet although it's good. Oh, it's good but like the last place last place I got a I got unlucky because they they didn't do my PSYCH EVALUATION they forgot it, which is

25
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.820
mitchell u: Pretty crazy like that never happens. But yeah, here, they're they're on top of things. It seems

26
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.240
Jocelyn Corrales: Like

27
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.560
mitchell u: And it's a small rehab. It's like four people max or five people, Max. And right now it's just two of us. So it's good. I like it.

28
00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.920
mitchell u: Only thing I don't like is I always want to stay home here because we have everything here and they always want to go out and do this and that. It's like

29
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.340
mitchell u: I don't know. I've done a lot of rehab. So I'm kind of

30
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.470
mitchell u: Used to being a homebody, I guess.

31
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.050
mitchell u: And even at home. I'm kind of a homebody

32
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.640
mitchell u: But it's good. They let me work with you guys because like

33
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.010
mitchell u: I don't know. I was on methadone before I moved to you guys like I made transferred from methadone or Suboxone because I wanted more like freedom in my life.

34
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.580
Jocelyn Corrales: I was on

35
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:37.470
mitchell u: Don't for two years and I don't know. So far so good, and it's it's a step down, you know, and I haven't touched heroin in like a long time so

36
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.880
mitchell u: That's good to know. Like I'm

37
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.400
mitchell u: Doing good. You know, I kinda yeah it's been like it's been like four years since I've had like a full blown heroin addiction, you know,

38
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.740
mitchell u: Then a couple years. I don't know.

39
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.360
mitchell u: For for but it's been a while.

40
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.590
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good to hear. At least you're not doing it again.

41
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so we regards to your activities of daily living.

42
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you able to you know what time do you usually wake up. Are you able to do your, your basic necessities such as you know showery

43
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Brushing your teeth.

44
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.850
mitchell u: Yeah.

45
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.990
Jocelyn Corrales: I wake up.

46
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.940
mitchell u: At 730 usually the the rehab wakes people up at eight o'clock.

47
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.700
mitchell u: But I wake up usually 730 because I go to bed pretty early. I go to bed at like 1011

48
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.540
mitchell u: It's a pretty relaxed place.

49
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.560
mitchell u: It's it's expensive, but I'm lucky I'm on my parent's insurance for one more year so I'm pretty lucky like to go here.

50
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.530
mitchell u: They I don't pay any copay while I'm here. But yeah, I wake up 730

51
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.520
Jocelyn Corrales: I

52
00:04:44.610 --> 00:05:00.450
mitchell u: I brush my teeth. I get ready. And then I usually shower, like I actually after this. I'm going to shower because I just did the treadmill for like an hour. So I usually shower after my workout, which is like in the morning also

53
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.700
mitchell u: And I start groups at eight o'clock or 830 sorry 830 I start groups.

54
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.600
mitchell u: We do a meditation group at 830 till nine and then from 930 to 1030 I do yoga.

55
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.730
mitchell u: So today we did yoga.

56
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.360
mitchell u: And then from 11 to 12 we do some relapse prevention group.

57
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.270
mitchell u: And then from

58
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.800
mitchell u: 1230 or 12 o'clock we lunch.

59
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:46.770
mitchell u: And then 1231 30s and other group, but sometimes it'll be wanted to, I don't know, it's, it's pretty like it's just depends on the counselor and who's here.

60
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.820
Jocelyn Corrales: And then

61
00:05:47.880 --> 00:06:02.820
mitchell u: From two to three. We have one more group and then throughout the week. I have like three therapies. I have that RP with one person once a week and then I have therapy with another person twice a week.

62
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:21.330
mitchell u: And that's random it's on whatever day they really you know whatever day they have time. Pretty much i don't know i i was in a six month treatment facility so i i don't do much in this therapy because I did all that in that six month the place. I don't know. I

63
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Heard it

64
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.050
Jocelyn Corrales: But currently, are you in a rehab. Is that an online rehab or

65
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.490
mitchell u: Impatient, I'm going to

66
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.250
mitchell u: Know, so uh yeah I'm in the garage right now.

67
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.600
mitchell u: Okay.

68
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.950
Jocelyn Corrales: So that's, that's an inpatient facility and you're in the garage of the

69
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:47.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Resident. So that's why you have a program a day to day activity.

70
00:06:48.270 --> 00:07:03.960
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, we have a schedule the weekends, we don't have anything really. They just always try to take us out. But I just want to stay. You know, I just like staying back. It's a relaxed place. It doesn't really feel like a rehab.

71
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.070
mitchell u: To be honest, I've been to like rehabs where you wake up at like

72
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.110
mitchell u: 530 and, you know,

73
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.900
mitchell u: And it's like, yeah.

74
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.650
Jocelyn Corrales: At least very have various very therapeutic. And it seems like

75
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.730
Jocelyn Corrales: You're no

76
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.760
mitchell u: Yeah, it feels like home living

77
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:35.610
mitchell u: And that's what I like. Because really, when you when you're finished with rehab and you're and you're at home but life's gonna be like life's not going to be like wake up at these crazy times and do this crazy shit all day like

78
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.600
mitchell u: Yeah, every I did a six month program that was like that.

79
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.110
mitchell u: And the day I got out I relapse, because that's just not

80
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.670
mitchell u: This you know what

81
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.440
Jocelyn Corrales: The things that scare

82
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.490
mitchell u: relapses. What are you gonna do when you have dead time, and you don't know what to

83
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Do

84
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.190
mitchell u: And that's what living is, you know,

85
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.120
Jocelyn Corrales: It feels like

86
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.620
Jocelyn Corrales: very traditional

87
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.330
mitchell u: Yeah yeah

88
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.490
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm very strict

89
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.530
mitchell u: Yeah, this place is a lot different. So

90
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.580
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

91
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:13.410
Jocelyn Corrales: So how many months. Are you staying on that program facility. Three. Three months and you're stealing her

92
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:21.240
mitchell u: I got here in March 27 but I was at another facility for 16 days, but they

93
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.740
mitchell u: Had insurance issue so I

94
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.390
mitchell u: Transferred but I might still just do my full three months here instead of

95
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Owning

96
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.380
mitchell u: You know, two and a half plus my last place.

97
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.850
mitchell u: I don't know. Yeah, like

98
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.420
mitchell u: It depends if my insurance covers the full 90 I'll do the phone.

99
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.020
Jocelyn Corrales: And that's good.

100
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.810
mitchell u: Because it doesn't feel like a rehab. It feels like

101
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:53.310
mitchell u: Rather a good. There's nothing to do. Anyways, with this coronavirus thing going on. You know, I might as well just get the credits and even go overboard with the credits. So, the judge gives me a lenient because I already took a deal with the judge.

102
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.350
mitchell u: Mm hmm. I already pleaded to a deal. They just have the sentence me on and it's over.

103
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:04.050
mitchell u: I turned to do for so I did two months in jail plus three months in rehab.

104
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.910
mitchell u: That wasn't my sentence and

105
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:20.100
mitchell u: Yeah I did the jail time already. And then now I have to just do this. You have yeah and then three or felony probation, but I've done that before. It's not a big deal. Yeah.

106
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.330
mitchell u: Yeah so everything's everything's pretty good, you know,

107
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.670
Jocelyn Corrales: And you have actually good plans because you've mentioned that you want to go back

108
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.710
Jocelyn Corrales: To a four year college

109
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:37.260
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to go to my community college and then transfer. I only have like a few classes left

110
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.000
Jocelyn Corrales: I finished.

111
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.200
mitchell u: All my G like computer science classes the hard ones.

112
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:53.850
mitchell u: I'm just I when I go back, I have to do like discrete math and I have to do this one is like optional, but I'm going to take this assembly language class.

113
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.260
mitchell u: I'm taking an assembly language before, but I'm going to take another one.

114
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:11.460
mitchell u: Just, I don't know, I feel like that, knowing those basics is very important to me. I don't know. Are you I'm really into and over here in this rehab. What I like is they let me use my computer.

115
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:18.150
mitchell u: Because I let them use the computer I brought three computers. And so I compromise, you know,

116
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.410
mitchell u: They use my computer for for like yoga and like we do.

117
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.140
mitchell u: That you know it's it's like, you know, it's just nice to have those options.

mitchell u: It was three of us now it's

122
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:48.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, it's nice also to do this because, you know, it's actually kind of relaxing afterwards. It's like doing meditation.

123
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.940
mitchell u: Yeah, I like it a lot.

124
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:56.190
mitchell u: I really like it. And what I do is I do the yoga and then I go run out there because I'm all

125
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Stretching, and it's

126
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.130
mitchell u: Very easy for me.

mitchell u: Yesterday I ran. I ran like 30 minutes

128
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.080

134
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:31.170

137
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:57.720
mitchell u: But, uh, because of that, I was in lockdown on I couldn't go to like the more nicer places like without fighting for it. But, uh,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.790
mitchell u: Pretty much.

139
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.460
mitchell u: Yeah, I couldn't move a lot. It was just when the cells open so kindness.

Jocelyn Corrales: Okay that's good to hear. So with regards to your mental health, you've mentioned you're doing yoga, as you know, as a form of relaxation. Also, how do you manage your, you know, when you have mood swings, or you know you feel like cranky, or you have excited. These. How do you manage it.

142
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.700
mitchell u: I just like I do different things I'll work out. I'll read

143
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:49.740
mitchell u: I'll, I'll, like sometimes if it's like, let's say, let's say I feel very anxious

144
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.860
mitchell u: To do something bad. And I know I can't do that and I'm

145
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.960
mitchell u: Contemplating in my head. I'll just

146
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.430
mitchell u: Go on the on my

147
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:15.000
mitchell u: They also let us use our phones here, which is pretty cool. Usually rehabs take the phone away so I watched like YouTube videos or something and you know I just kind of, I just shy to jump to I just kind of try to jump into something else like I don't know how to explain it.

148
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:15.840
Jocelyn Corrales: I like

149
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing something. It's like doing something to distract you.

150
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:29.520
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. I tried to get into other things I watched a lot of documentaries and like, yeah, it's hard sometimes. But you know the

151
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.610
mitchell u: I'm lucky that I haven't, I haven't been like an actual heroin addict in a long time.

152
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:44.730
mitchell u: So the and being on Suboxone you know in the rehab. They talk you down about it, you know, they're not fans of Suboxone or methadone.

153
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.210
Jocelyn Corrales: I need a

154
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:52.290
mitchell u: But like, to me it's like I have a lot of friends that passed away and it's like I'm sure they would love to be on Suboxone

155
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.580
mitchell u: And I've already more than 10 times, you know, in the

156
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.960
mitchell u: Hospital and it's like

157
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.930
mitchell u: I don't know Suboxone I haven't had anything bad happened to me because it's it's only

158
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.090
mitchell u: Good things gave me my family back

159
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:16.020
mitchell u: Again, my, you know, I gave me school gave me my risk gave me responsibility that made me a you know accountable and

160
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:27.420
mitchell u: Honestly, it's been working out for me and i don't i don't care about, like, people like I think it's better to do harm reduction, rather than this whole like counting your sobriety days like I think

161
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:27.690
Jocelyn Corrales: That's

162
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.950
mitchell u: too intense and

163
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:37.020
mitchell u: It's not to me being sober is not really a virtue, it's, it's just like an interesting choice, you know,

164
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.890
mitchell u: Like my parents.

165
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.930
mitchell u: My parents are. We're not from America. Originally I wasn't born here, you know,

166
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:59.580
mitchell u: I speak another language like our culture is different and to us. It's like, oh, he's sober. Okay, well grandma's sober everyday to, like, it's not a you know what I'm saying it's, it's, like, that's just the choice. It's like, okay, Edison. Okay, he's on this like

167
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.170
mitchell u: I just don't, I don't look at it like a hurry. I, I don't know.

168
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:15.090
mitchell u: It's, I don't know. I think it's dangerous to look at it that way, because then I meet people in jail. And they're like, I'm an addict. If drugs are here. I'm taking it, you know.

169
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:15.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Like

170
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.460
mitchell u: The choice to take it.

171
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, it's sure

172
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.110
mitchell u: You're not just like this don't subject yourself to being the

173
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.090
mitchell u: Best you

174
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true. I think it's crazy.

175
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:38.310
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually usually a choice because you know if you know if you decided not to change, you know, even if you're in rehab. If

176
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.040
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, if you have decided not to change, you know,

177
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:47.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You would still go back and relax. But if you have decided to change, you know,

178
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:47.880
mitchell u: Yeah.

179
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Well, it's always a choice.

180
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:56.160
mitchell u: I think even if someone does relapse. They shouldn't subject themselves to being this addict, like they should

181
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:06.780
mitchell u: Know like hey i did i i picked up and now I'm physically addicted and I have to go to the dealer every day. And all I need to change. You know, you need to

182
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:13.110
mitchell u: Understand that like people. People just subject themselves. They're like, Oh, I did it. Now I'm that's me.

183
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:22.830
mitchell u: It's like no, like you have a choice like this. I don't think this whole powerless thing. I think it's a little too crazy. I don't know.

184
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.480
mitchell u: I think it's crazy.

185
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.630
mitchell u: I don't know.

186
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.370
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually difficult to change if you yourself is not

187
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.440
Jocelyn Corrales: If you are not ready for it.

188
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.730
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. And that's why I don't see any shame and using, you know, maintenance medication like somebody

189
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you know, a year Suboxone saved me actually

190
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.450
mitchell u: Methadone it from not using heroin for those two years of being on

191
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.930
mitchell u: I forgot how heroin feels when I inject it, you know, I forgot that rush

192
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:12.180
mitchell u: And then I dropped down because now my now my so when I was on heroin my high was here no methadone and my highs here. That's what I know from opiates, but now I'm on Suboxone and my, my boss, is here, you know,

193
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.850
mitchell u: That's what I know with opiates, because all of that time lapse that happened I

194
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.200
mitchell u: Don't know what this feels

195
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.880
mitchell u: Like anymore. I know what this feels

196
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:32.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, actually, it actually helps you, you know, for having a withdrawal and, you know, just in case you know for some other patients if they tried to quit.

197
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:42.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Immediately they would have withdrawal. So what happens is that instead of quitting it, they tend to relapse and go back to it. So that's why it's very helpful. Having that Suboxone

198
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.280
Jocelyn Corrales: But usually

199
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Your providers are also going to taper down your Suboxone intake until you're able to do that.

200
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.980
mitchell u: I know I'm not ready.

201
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Like me

202
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.250
mitchell u: But when I was 19 I was on Suboxone and I tapered myself down

203
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:11.040
mitchell u: He actually it was pretty easy for me. I just caught it in little slivers, and I was in school. Also, I don't know, I, yeah, I feel like it's a lot easier to taper than methadone like methadone.

204
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:23.160
mitchell u: Yes, it was hell done with even with them tapering me like one milligram of like a week it was still but with Suboxone. I don't know. I didn't have a hard time like and I did it a couple

205
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, because you're already used

206
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:31.710
Jocelyn Corrales: To taking Suboxone instead of taking the Methadone so you being tapering down right now.

207
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.730
mitchell u: No. No idea. Yeah, I, I think I need to be on Suboxone a lot longer, you know,

208
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.300
Jocelyn Corrales: That's okay.

209
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.710
mitchell u: Yeah, I'm not

210
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.280
Good always

211
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:57.750
Jocelyn Corrales: You can always tell your provider about it, regarding your, you know, tapering down. You surely when they tried to taper down they doing a taper down immediately, but usually they do it in a probably only one week or two weeks or it depends.

212
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so how how many milligrams, or even for your Suboxone

213
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.480
Jocelyn Corrales: 12 okay

214
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.290
Yeah.

215
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:05.880
Yeah.

216
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Your providers go your doctor is going to discuss that.

217
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.930
Jocelyn Corrales: We do with

218
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.830
mitchell u: I'm not worried. I know. I feel like I should be on it longer.

219
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I think you still have a long way to go.

220
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you're still at 12 milligrams

221
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.460
mitchell u: Yeah yeah yeah

222
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:38.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Okay. So with regards to your maybe with regards to your mental health. If you're know when you're feeling anxious, you said you you try to read or you, you know, you try to distract yourself from being anxious

223
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:47.190
Jocelyn Corrales: You try to read or you do work out. Have you tried you know when you're having bad moods instead of getting angry. How have you tried you know being alone.

224
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

225
00:19:48.720 --> 00:20:02.640
mitchell u: Yeah, I prefer it. Isn't it the only thing that sucks about here is because it's such a low client rehab. It's hard to just go be alone. I mean, I have my own room, but it's like people like go up to be like, Are you okay, are you okay

226
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.850
mitchell u: Sometimes I just wanna

227
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.760
mitchell u: I don't want people around it just

228
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I know, I know.

229
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:22.890
mitchell u: I'm an introvert, you know, I like to be my own thing and sometimes they think they think, oh, it's a bad mood or it's not to go

230
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.060
mitchell u: I want to chill out. Like, that's all.

231
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:38.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, usually introverts are, you know, if you're a home but you you're a home by the type of person, sometimes you know you don't like to socialize. You just want to be alone.

232
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:44.670
mitchell u: Yeah, that's what I like all the time, actually all the time. And don't get me wrong. There's some

233
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.130
mitchell u: Instances. Yes, I like to socialize, but I get, you know,

234
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Most of the time you like yellow

235
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:58.380
mitchell u: With the rehab. It's like this is kind of a dream all these people. I'm not going to see them ever again after

236
00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.610
98

237
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.670
mitchell u: I don't even live in this area, like it's

238
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.770
mitchell u: I don't want to get too close with people.

239
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.930
mitchell u: It's just not. I don't know. These are people I'm gonna be hanging out with for sure.

240
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.750
Jocelyn Corrales: You have friends outside

241
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:18.120
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. I have people that visit me in this night and yeah

242
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:33.360
mitchell u: My pants are sick of rehab they they're the only ones who don't visit me they they come and bring me tea and stuff like that and cigarettes, but they don't they don't want to visit, they don't like rehabs they think they think rehabs are scam.

243
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.400
mitchell u: Scam, yeah.

244
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.920
Jocelyn Corrales: That may sound youth, you know, getting

245
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:38.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Out there.

246
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.310
mitchell u: For me, I know they're they're there for me, they're there for.

247
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.680
Jocelyn Corrales: And okay, that's good. That's good to hear.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.170
Jocelyn Corrales: So we'd be there. So your spiritual self. Would you consider yourself spiritual or religious

249
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:55.050
mitchell u: not religious but yeah spiritual. I grew up traditional, you know, very traditional home.

250
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.170
mitchell u: Not very religious, though just

251
00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.940

252
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.530
mitchell u: You know, traditional values in my house.

253
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:05.940
mitchell u: You know, like

254
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.350

255
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.630
mitchell u: End. You know, you got this. You

256
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.650

257
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.840
mitchell u: God, yeah.

258
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.750
mitchell u: You know, we don't you know

259
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:26.700
mitchell u: That kind of stuff. Like, I grew up like that, that's for sure. That's for sure, very conservative household. Yeah.

260
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.200
Jocelyn Corrales: But let me believe that there is a higher being, or a god.

261
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:47.490
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I believe in God. Yeah, but I don't know if it's if it's the same as like as, like, I don't know, like a Christian or or Jewish god you know like my family. We actually were supposed to be Jewish but we don't really do anything, you know,

262
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.280
mitchell u: We don't even eat kosher. We don't, I don't know where

264
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:06.030
mitchell u: But, but we don't practice. Yeah, we don't but but still our values, our I think our values are very spiritual like what we do and

265
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.580
mitchell u: How we coordinate ourselves and all

266
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.510
Jocelyn Corrales: This stuff.

267
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.990
Jocelyn Corrales: For sure. But the fact that you believe there is a God, you know,

268
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:19.770
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. I believe there's a God yeah i don't i don't stick it in people's faces, though I don't you know like I don't talk about it.

269
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.530
mitchell u: Yeah, I was at a rehab was

270
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually nurse, they actually there are some people

271
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Are quite sensitive about it.

272
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:33.930
mitchell u: But yeah, for sure. I was at a place and or even here. There was a guy. He grabbed me and he said, I'm going to pray for you.

273
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:44.970
mitchell u: And he said on and he grabbed me or you know he's like saying this prayer and these are and Mitchell accepts Jesus in his life. And I'm thinking in my head Jewish man.

274
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.090
mitchell u: I didn't want to say it, though I didn't say it. I was just like, Okay.

275
00:23:59.250 --> 00:23:59.910
I respect.

276
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.370
mitchell u: I respect that.

277
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.190
mitchell u: As well I know he means well

278
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.760
Yes.

279
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.660
mitchell u: I don't I don't shun down people's

280
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:16.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Thing you know that's that's very good. If you know that's very cool. Have you know to be, you know, cool like that.

281
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and you're not angry elbow and yes he means well actually

282
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.820
mitchell u: Yeah, yeah. That's how I look at it. That's my you know I I respected. I think it's I think it's good for him, you know, whatever.

283
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:39.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Have you tried, maybe you know protest, you mentioned you know you're Jewish, have you tried. Maybe. Probably learning about it. You're learning about here.

284
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.210
mitchell u: I can read Hebrew.

285
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:55.530
mitchell u: I know basics, but I don't know for me being spiritual is very different than being religious I feel like I feel like religious is more of like

286
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:12.960
mitchell u: You know the actual context and the content that's in each religion, but I feel like spirituality is like living like you know like this yin and yang kind of life like like karma and balance finding balance in your life and

287
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:22.110
mitchell u: Moral like just I don't know really tuning your moral compass, I guess you could say.

288
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:29.880
mitchell u: It's kind of like a balance. Yeah, just doing the right doing the doing what you're doing what you feel is right and

289
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.780
mitchell u: You know, recognizing when you do something wrong and stuff like that. I feel like that spirituality to me.

290
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:47.190
mitchell u: Because like there were moments where like, you know, something bad happens. And I think, oh god, you know. Oh god, I say, oh God in my head. It's like

291
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.410
mitchell u: Why would I say that I, oh, it's a

292
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Spiritual you know

293
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:51.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, yes.

294
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.060
mitchell u: Some form of hope when I don't

295
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.710
Jocelyn Corrales: See a fish tank. Thank you.

296
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Know, yes.

297
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.680
mitchell u: Yeah, no, I, I definitely think like that.

298
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

299
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:11.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, but you mentioned you're interested in reading about it. Have you know, have you tried connecting with you know

300
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.190
Jocelyn Corrales: Are trying to improve your, you know, spirituality or spiritual connection with God, something like that.

301
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.180
mitchell u: Well, I'm here. I do that.

302
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.480
mitchell u: How do I explain it.

303
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.470
mitchell u: Like I accept things that I can't control.

304
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:38.610
mitchell u: You know, I give that power over to you know to live to live to handle it to God, you know,

305
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:39.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

306
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:47.280
mitchell u: All the things I can't control it. I don't I try not to worry about things that I can't control like like when I was in jail.

307
00:26:47.640 --> 00:27:04.440
mitchell u: Before I took a deal before I took deal. I was thinking all man they're gonna hit me with a bad deal. They're gonna, you know, they're really going to hit me this time. And, and I just like I tried every day to not talk about it and not think about it and just live day to day and

308
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:11.010
mitchell u: You know, certain days I would screw up and I'll talk to myself and say, oh man, do you think they're gonna hit me hard

309
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.690
mitchell u: But do you also free, like, you know, this is my

310
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.820
mitchell u: Sugar, for sure. Yeah, I didn't do anything out loud, but definitely

311
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes. The still brain. You don't need to say allow

312
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.080
mitchell u: Here, you know,

313
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.490
mitchell u: For sure, for sure.

314
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.000
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

315
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.360
mitchell u: When there's no real hope. Like, that's what I think, you know,

316
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true, that's true. And it gives you hope also

317
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, knowing that someone's watching over you.

318
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:50.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, knowing that someone you know has control over you, those things that you could let control. He's in control of your life.

319
00:27:50.370 --> 00:28:02.880
mitchell u: Yeah, like certain situations. I mean certain situations. I'll call coincidence but other situations. I might. I might accept it and be like, Oh, there's a reason this is happening.

320
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.690
You know, yes.

321
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:17.310
mitchell u: Not all of them. I do believe in some coincidences, but there's certain things where I feel like by not thinking it's a coincidence and kind of helps guide you. You know, you kind of take it in a personal level.

322
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.500
mitchell u: That kind of thing.

323
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:30.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So you mentioned that your mom and dad sense you stuff I do you still you have a good relationship with your parents.

324
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:35.220
mitchell u: Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Yeah, they, they're very supportive.

325
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:46.680
mitchell u: No matter what, like whether I'm in jail or rehab or whatever they always take care of me. They just don't visit the rehab because of I think coronavirus

326
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.570
mitchell u: And oh yeah yeah

327
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.900
mitchell u: Like they don't really like rehab. Anyways, like

328
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.720
Jocelyn Corrales: I think it's safer for them to stay up home.

329
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.430
Jocelyn Corrales: This title. Yeah.

330
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.900

436
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.470
Okay.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.040
mitchell u: Yeah.

438
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:35.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and you mentioned that a little bit. You have your own room. There are times that when you want to be alone. You can be alone because you know someone's always

439
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.540
mitchell u: Yeah.

440
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.250
Jocelyn Corrales: I think I need to be alone.

441
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.190
mitchell u: But yeah, there is always those people that are just like they think when you're alone, you're sad.

442
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.260
mitchell u: It's like, dude, I'm not sad I want

443
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.360
mitchell u: I want peace of mind like

444
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.900
mitchell u: Sometimes doing nothing is doing something, you know,

445
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.210
mitchell u: Yes, sometimes I miss

446
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.290
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing nothing

447
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.900
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually like doing self reflection.

448
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.850
Jocelyn Corrales: And meditation.

449
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.820
mitchell u: See you lay down, you know,

450
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.580
Jocelyn Corrales: And people think oh he's

451
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.510
mitchell u: Isolating myself isolating Oh wait, you know,

452
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:17.220
mitchell u: That's like a one thing I don't like about being in rehab like people, you know,

453
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Have your own privacy.

454
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:33.720
mitchell u: Over speculate and are very presumptuous sometimes and it's just like, no, it's there, like, or like you could be like, Oh, I'm fine. They're like, how do you really feel. What do you mean you're fine. You know, and it's like, I'm fine. Like, leave me alone.

455
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:38.580
mitchell u: Like, I can't say I'm fine in rehab. They say, oh,

456
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.100
mitchell u: Fine, fine means something else. What is what is fine, you know,

457
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:54.360
mitchell u: And I sometimes I just, I think I feel like rehabs overcomplicate the simple things, which makes it worse, you know,

458
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.880
mitchell u: I don't want to hear about like this. Like, it's really just don't pick up and you're good, you know,

459
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:11.940
mitchell u: And they say no, before you pick up and when you pick up this little layers and this and i don't know i think i think we're over complicating a simple subject and

460
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.590
mitchell u: I don't. You don't sound intelligent overcomplicate

461
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:22.380
Jocelyn Corrales: They have, they have a specific time. Like, for example, I know you're in a program

462
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Day to day

463
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Activity, but

464
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:30.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you have a you know a free time sometime around before you

465
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.980

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:21.030
mitchell u: So like maybe or 12 a zoom meeting. And then after that. So that's the only thing I don't like because then the things I want to do, like, let's say I want to write like I don't know. I've been writing some si, si stuffs I'm C code and and also some web development stuff I've been doing

473
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:27.060
mitchell u: And sometimes it's like, by that time, I'm drained mentally and I can't really

474
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:27.930
mitchell u: Do that stuff.

475
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.160
mitchell u: Like I just laid down. And that's the only thing I don't like you know

476
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could do your, you know,

477
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:43.680
Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned you wanted to do your development writing stuff. Maybe we could do that after your zoom meeting.

478
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:50.340
mitchell u: Yeah, I try, but sometimes I'm drains. You know, I do do that though I you do that I wrote a lot of stuff.

479
00:40:51.840 --> 00:41:08.820
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe you could do some arresting you know or your time alone on the four o'clock time. Maybe you could inform everybody like can you could, could you know you could tell everybody that not to disturb you on that particular RS because that's your me time

480
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:09.360

484
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.310
mitchell u: That's like the kind of stuff where I don't want anyone around even like I want to be myself and

485
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.170
mitchell u: They always think

486
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:30.240
mitchell u: It's some emotional distress. They're always like, Oh, is he okay

487
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.400
mitchell u: Just like nah, you know it's it's a little too much anything. You know what I mean.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.620
mitchell u: Yeah. Yeah. And I guess.

570
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.020
Jocelyn Corrales: I cannot concentrate. If you're a lot of people

571
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.740
mitchell u: Yeah, it's so annoying to them that people knock on your door or you're

mitchell u: I read the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous book.

575
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:19.230

585
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.770
mitchell u: Yeah, I don't do it. I know I'm not that close with the people here.

586
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.480
Jocelyn Corrales: And when you study, you know, it's also good if you feel tired, just go to sleep.

587
00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.250
mitchell u: Yeah yeah

588
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:21.120

Jocelyn Corrales: And you are not very tired, you know,

590
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:38.190
Jocelyn Corrales: This actually some of the mistakes for, you know, for some other people they try to you know they don't sleep they study all day. Oh my. It seems that they do not have speed. So sometimes you don't retain all the information that they are trying to

591
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.880
mitchell u: Yeah yeah

592
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:48.360

Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

607
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:49.980
Jocelyn Corrales: And read your routine daily at else or activities of daily living. I know you are you exercise a lot. I just split in here. Continue with exercise and yoga. Do you, do you do exercise twice right once in the morning in once a night.

608
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:55.290
mitchell u: Oh no, I do. So I do yoga and then I do my run right after

609
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.640
Jocelyn Corrales: And I mean,

610
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.100
Jocelyn Corrales: In the morning exercise only in the morning.

611
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:04.740
mitchell u: Yeah, very few times, I'll do night if I do night I'll do weights here and there, but it's not every day.

612
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:14.010
mitchell u: So ride like yoga more and then I'll do I run on the treadmill for one hour every morning.

613
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.520
mitchell u: See

614
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:24.960
mitchell u: Yeah.

615
00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:32.940
mitchell u: FOR THE HOUR EVERY MORNING AND I'LL DO weightlifting, I don't know.

616
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:35.850
Jocelyn Corrales: F9

617
00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:40.260
mitchell u: weightlifting at night on certain days. Yeah, on and off.

618
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:50.790
mitchell u: Yeah. On a diet, a little i i still drink soda. That's my problem.

619
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.280
mitchell u: Oh, yeah.

620
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.170
Jocelyn Corrales: We could put that in your team, maybe could lesson.

621
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.000
Jocelyn Corrales: You are still at

622
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.130
mitchell u: I'm trying not to eat at night, either just eat my breakfast, lunch, dinner.

623
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.400
mitchell u: It's hard, you know, but

624
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:09.720
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually

625
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:28.680
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually fine to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner on time, but try to lessen your intake instead of missing or not eating at all. So it's actually not a good habit to miss your breakfast, lunch, or dinner, but instead of eating the whole meal or a lot of carbohydrates. Try to lessen

626
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.580
mitchell u: Down your

627
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.980
mitchell u: Protein, stuff like that. Yeah.

628
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.650
Jocelyn Corrales: So try to lessen down in your carbohydrates for it.

629
00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:40.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Now CC are also doing weightlifting, and I think you should eat.

630
00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Protein. Yeah, yeah.

631
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.590
Jocelyn Corrales: And lesson.

632
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I

633
00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:54.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Placed in here. Lesson soda intake.

634
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.910
Jocelyn Corrales: I think this the one that's the reason I think that's probably the reason why you're gaining weight because of the soda.

635
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:06.690
mitchell u: No, no, I haven't been gaining weight. I actually lost a lot of weight.

636
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.600
mitchell u: I know I'm trying to get to like a certain

637
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.960
mitchell u: I don't know, I just want to eat like a certain

638
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.070

639
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:19.890
mitchell u: Yeah I don't know target way. And look, and it's not far from it. I just want to be
