00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.429
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah Nia

2
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

3
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.100
Hi.

4
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Good afternoon.

5
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.080
Saraniah Aston: Good afternoon.

6
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I'm gonna open up a note, while you are there sort of maybe thinking about what you want to share what you want to do, maybe read something, show me something, say something. Tell me something, asked me some

7
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.260
Saraniah Aston: I had a full

8
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.890
Saraniah Aston: Year when for you.

9
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.560
Saraniah Aston: And I can't find it.

10
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.800
Saraniah Aston: I don't know where I've been searching everywhere.

11
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.050
Saraniah Aston: Fun little frustrating.

12
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.970
Saraniah Aston: But, uh,

13
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well there might be a remembering of it. If you can start with the felt sense. Like, what was the message you wanted me to come away with with this dear when letter.

14
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.250
Saraniah Aston: Okay, it's kind of

15
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.560
Saraniah Aston: It's a hard. This one really

16
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.930
Saraniah Aston: Let me close the door.

17
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.830
Saraniah Aston: I'll try my best.

18
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.080
Saraniah Aston: I have a serious issue with my mother. Yeah.

19
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.640
Saraniah Aston: And

20
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.710
Saraniah Aston: She has a serious

21
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.610
Problem.

22
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.040
Saraniah Aston: And

23
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.020
Saraniah Aston: You know she is a pain patient. She has back pain. She's had backing.

24
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.260
Saraniah Aston: She's had different kinds of pain for since I was about

25
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.670
Saraniah Aston: 1716

26
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.970
Saraniah Aston: And I wouldn't know what opiates were if it weren't for my mother, giving them to me when I was 16

27
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.820
Saraniah Aston: And now.

28
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.990
Saraniah Aston: I'm trying to recover and I'm trying really hard and

29
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.990
Saraniah Aston: You know she

30
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.390
Saraniah Aston: Just runs out of her medication and

31
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.430
Saraniah Aston: Gets

32
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:52.350
Saraniah Aston: Set sick and goes to the hospital and for the first time, the other day, she told me what I knew to be true, which I've known for a long time, which is that

33
00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:09.480
Saraniah Aston: She said, my life has been so stressful that i just i right now. I just can't help it, but to take extra so I ran out. So she takes mine.

34
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.340
Oh,

35
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.180
Saraniah Aston: And she she's always every time she does that,

37
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.720
Saraniah Aston: It. She's always been able to give it back to me like in time so that I won't ever go you know without my medication.

38
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.450
Saraniah Aston: Except this last week.

39
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.420
Saraniah Aston: I basically had to pay for it for her.

40
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.270
Saraniah Aston: Problem and

41
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.420
Saraniah Aston: You know, it doesn't matter. It wasn't a full day's worth that I was missing. It was, you know,

42
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.170
Saraniah Aston: It was, I had a quarter of what I needed for the day and

43
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.790
Saraniah Aston: It just made me really upset and angry and

44
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.590
Saraniah Aston: Even when she knew that I was out, she asked me again. She's like, you don't have just one like no

45
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.000
Saraniah Aston: No, I don't have anything, leave me alone.

46
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.110
And

47
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:32.280
Saraniah Aston: Then after she went to the hospital. My Brother To Brother, the hospital and I kept telling you, once you go to school and she's like, because I've already gone and they don't want. They don't want me to come back anymore.

48
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.580
Saraniah Aston: She went back and they gave her something. I don't know what it is, don't care, but I could tell because she was sitting at her desk.

49
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:58.650
Saraniah Aston: With a smile, and she grabbed by the hand she never touches me ever, and she loved me. I couldn't even look right in the eyes, but she's saying, yeah, I just want you to know how grateful I am for your help and

50
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.590
Saraniah Aston: You're a good person.

51
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.710
Saraniah Aston: And I love you.

52
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

53
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.250
Saraniah Aston: Just makes me

54
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.180
Saraniah Aston: makes me sick.

55
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.070
Saraniah Aston: So,

56
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:24.780
Saraniah Aston: I know will be moving soon I don't quite have a place set in stone yet, but I know I'm going to be moving soon. Yeah, okay.

57
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we knew this was going to be temporary.

58
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay but to have all of those realities.

59
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's just can't dance around it can't hide it. It's just right there and that that just a moment ago, it just

60
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It just makes me sick.

61
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.250
Saraniah Aston: Your own family members.

62
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.910
Saraniah Aston: With you, the one who should be some agree.

63
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.220
Saraniah Aston: It's wrong.

64
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.400
Saraniah Aston: She says things like, well, you know, I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my job or

65
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.730
Saraniah Aston: Stuff like that. And you know i i feel guilty.

66
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, that's not yours. So let's let's stop that one right there right before you said that I was going to say none of that is yours. That's hers.

67
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's upsetting. Right. What was bringing the tears, is how wrong. This is a parent's job is to protect you. Everything sideways.

68
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.530
Saraniah Aston: I mean, Mom. These for me to be in this program.

69
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.220
Saraniah Aston: She wants me to

70
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.350
Saraniah Aston: Take it better. That was the goal. And I know she still wants that.

71
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.720
Saraniah Aston: But she's kind of

72
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.070
Saraniah Aston: wrecking me a little bit on the way.

73
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only is she asking of you to divert medicine right

74
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.270
Yeah.

75
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Which messes with the prescribed dose.

76
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: putting you in danger, and it doesn't match what recovery says, So what recovery says is

77
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're chemically dependent dependent on something, then we address the chemical dependence. If you're having behavioral health emotional health to address those issues.

78
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom isn't acknowledging that she has a chemical dependence, right, she's saying I have pain. I'm guessing.

79
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.870
Saraniah Aston: Yeah yeah

80
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I use and I took more here and there, because I'm so stressed. So it's she's treating her own anxiety and then on top of that she's not doing the behavioral health part

81
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.430
Saraniah Aston: Not at all.

82
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Not at

83
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.260
Saraniah Aston: All

84
00:08:49.530 --> 00:09:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice that it none of it matches so you're hearing all these things in group and you hear it for me guessing you're feeling congruency I'm guessing we

85
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can grow on see means

86
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It matches.

87
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like there's I'm hoping little hypocrisy in our dynamic little hypocrisy, where I say and do something that's the exact opposite of what I just said and did.

88
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully, what you see in here is a real sense of I pretty much know what one's gonna say, now she's going to do this thing. It'll be you know Authenticity. Authenticity, you know, it'll come from there.

89
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have this other relationship with opiates. It is not the same at all.

90
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't match their incongruent.

91
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So congruency is like parallel lines. They like parallel that this goes like this in congruent, they bump it bump into each other like that.

92
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.760
Saraniah Aston: I see.

93
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a really uncomfortable conflicted feeling

94
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.070
And

95
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if that's what is making that I just feel sick around this whole thing just wondering if that's what it is, is this

96
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:07.920
Saraniah Aston: Boy Yeah.

97
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.820
Okay.

98
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.860
Saraniah Aston: I mean, I haven't brought it up to you because I'm scared. You know, I don't want my mom.

99
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.400
Saraniah Aston: To get in trouble or anything like that, you know,

100
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.830
Saraniah Aston: So I just keep it. I've been keeping it to myself adult this last

101
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:34.950
Saraniah Aston: Time. I'm like, the day before yesterday when I actually had to go without and that was just pushing it too far.

102
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.440
Saraniah Aston: And I gotta take care of myself so

103
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.650
Saraniah Aston: I have to say something to somebody

104
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad I'm glad you did. And as far as I'm concerned, you're not in any trouble.

105
00:10:51.510 --> 00:11:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You. You did what your family system demands of you, you've been doing this for a long time just happens to be with you know the the subs. But this this offset or thing where you're taking care of your mother.

106
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: When you know it should be this other way has been going on for a long time.

107
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And

108
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.590
Saraniah Aston: She does take care of

109
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.440
Saraniah Aston: Financially right now. That's the thing. So

110
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Which makes it even harder to have a healthy detachment, certainly. So the fact that you're you're you're in this struggle is is a testament to how badly you want to grow because

111
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pushing on that conflict, I either align with my mother and I'm supposed to be grateful to her, she's paying for this this program do I align with her, do I align with her, or do I listen to

112
00:11:49.080 --> 00:12:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: my authentic self. Which is, I want to be healthy. I want everything to sort of want to grow and say I want to hear things that are towards my growth. I don't want mixed messages I want to impress all my emotions.

113
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to get my daughter.

114
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

115
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't always lay out so clean life that

116
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You can

117
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Be grateful to your mother and angry.

118
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You can

119
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But our mind would prefer you have one right in our social structure says the one you want to them. How can you be angry at the very woman who's being financially so generous how

120
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Far as I'm concerned.

121
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome to it.

122
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, like,

123
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for your generosity.

124
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of what you're paying for mom is that I not divert my medicine. It's considered in the program.

125
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Illegal

126
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And against my treatment plan.

127
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's my ability

128
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To protect my recovery and I don't want to have the irritability. I don't want to have the withdrawal symptoms so that I give up on this program and start to consider.

129
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Heroin or pills again.

130
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I've

131
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to take it the way it's prescribed now that isn't that where the rubber meets the road. Isn't this the hard part right there. How

132
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How to say no to protect yourself.

133
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're being grateful to your mother for her generosity, how to navigate that. And on top of that, the How dare you make me decide this like

134
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so much going on.

135
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.610
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

136
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.130
Saraniah Aston: But in the meanwhile under all this chaos.

137
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.130
Saraniah Aston: I am working my butt off.

138
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:59.550
Saraniah Aston: I built my bad, my own backdrop for my photography. So I can take new pictures of all my inventory that I have

139
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.840
Saraniah Aston: And I'm reopening my shop I have it set for the 30th.

140
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.310
Saraniah Aston: And

141
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:16.470
Saraniah Aston: It's my backdrop looks really good. I have my mannequin. I have my stuff. And I know what to do.

142
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:23.130
Saraniah Aston: I'm going to work. And I'm going to work very hard and I know I can because I really enjoy it.

143
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:31.650
Saraniah Aston: And this is my second around. This is my second time trying like restarting

144
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.160
Saraniah Aston: Because I've

145
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:48.870
Saraniah Aston: Before I did a certain way to one way it worked. But it didn't work well enough. And now I've learned a lot of stuff and I'm just going to go back in selling

146
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.420
Saraniah Aston: with a vengeance.

147
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

148
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.060
Saraniah Aston: It's gonna be good.

149
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.400
Saraniah Aston: It's gonna be really good.

150
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You did both even with the chaos, even with and I heard you in group to right there's more going on. There's these these things going on with your father, too. And I know there's still, you know, life continues to send you these messages to pull your attention away from your goals and

151
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you're bragging I be private to that's a big deal to not fall apart and to hold on to. I'm going to

152
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this background and you did it. And there's a mannequin, and you've got a date to even got a date, like when you're going to open the store. And that's it. Now, did you also did you put it out there like this is what I'm opening

153
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.130
Saraniah Aston: Did you send it

154
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Snap that that's going to help you stick with it.

155
00:15:43.950 --> 00:16:00.810
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's exactly what my goal was to give myself that time put everything together to steam all of the dresses and everything and have it basically just I want everything to look nice and clean. Instead of all kind of kooky and chaotic.

156
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.980
Saraniah Aston: And that's what works, apparently. So I'm going to do that.

157
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it.

158
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.160
Saraniah Aston: So that's kind of a part of my salvation and the ability to take that with me when I move it to my place.

159
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.590
Saraniah Aston: And I'm just going to run with it.

160
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So the background is mobile enough it's transportable that it's not going to like

161
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:33.570
Saraniah Aston: When yeah it's, um, it's actually just a Rolling Rock. I bought a cheap Rolling Rock and I tied

162
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.190
Saraniah Aston: A

163
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.650
Saraniah Aston: Of thick white shower curtain onto it.

164
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.160
Yeah.

165
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.740
Saraniah Aston: It looks really pretty.

166
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.580
Saraniah Aston: Good. Well, and

167
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.470
Saraniah Aston: Also, if not we'll

168
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.630
Saraniah Aston: Take it apart so

169
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.530
I love it.

170
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to hear about maybe some bragging.

171
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.320
Around

172
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: remembering your body

173
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing a scan breathing into it being patient compassionate and present with your truth.

174
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember doing that.

175
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about it.

176
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.400
Saraniah Aston: You mean outside of here.

177
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.330
Uh huh.

178
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.300
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I

179
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.770
Saraniah Aston: I have done some, like, kind of like tried by skin.

180
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.650
Saraniah Aston: And

181
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.070
Saraniah Aston: Basically

182
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:57.930
Saraniah Aston: I knew what was going to happen. This morning I knew that my mother was going to be in need, and I knew that she wasn't going to do anything. She's gonna stay in bed.

183
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:08.970
Saraniah Aston: And probably, probably hear her moaning or whatever, until I say, Mom, do you need this, this, this and this. And then finally,

184
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:33.120
Saraniah Aston: When I told her you take a shower. She said, Hey Mia. You think you can help you. I'll pay you back. I swear I will write it down on a piece of paper. So okay, so I went in to the house this morning, knowing what the situation would be so I sat on the couch and I I took some breath.

185
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.280
Saraniah Aston: And

186
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.810
Saraniah Aston: I just kind of sat there and with my eyes closed and just I breathe.

187
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.380
Saraniah Aston: And I call I was home.

188
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.710
Saraniah Aston: Where I felt aware

189
00:18:52.590 --> 00:19:01.500
Saraniah Aston: I was aware of my might be my being upset and my anger and I was also aware of my my mother's

190
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.310
Saraniah Aston: Problem and what would come and

191
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.700
Saraniah Aston: So,

192
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:23.670
Saraniah Aston: I caught all I can say was that I became calm and very aware and I got medicine and I put it on her desk and I wrote a letter.

193
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.750
Saraniah Aston: That this very last time this will ever happen.

194
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:48.600
Saraniah Aston: And I was very sure of myself about it and it's because I sat down and I took those breath. And I thought, and I just, it was like a brainstorm what started to happen a calm one and one that I see every little particle of information.

195
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.030
Saraniah Aston: Uh huh, was in this column.

196
00:19:52.140 --> 00:20:02.580
Saraniah Aston: State, um, I didn't feel any kind of add or OCD or panic or anything. Yeah, and

197
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.020
Saraniah Aston: And then after I did everything I left my shower shower.

198
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.480
Saraniah Aston: I just, you know, I, I realized that I was in control.

199
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:26.160
Saraniah Aston: And that's about it, I realized, Hey, this is interesting. I can continue to do this and explore this little bit more. Is this helpful.

200
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.460
Yeah.

201
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So what one part of what I heard in that that experience is, notice how you were saying, I could, I noticed the thoughts every little particle

202
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: As if there were more thoughts that contributed to the solution. Is that right, like you could think it through.

203
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

204
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because you were using

205
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This part of your brain.

206
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're normally just emotional, it's just

207
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be catastrophic. This is awful. How could this be happening. I don't deserve this. Who, what kind of how could any mother treat me like that. Right. All it does is reinforce

208
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The problem thought the one that originated the sponsoring negative belief about the self. What you did when you calmed

209
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The body and you did the breathing was you access the prefrontal cortex. That's the smart brain that's the smart part that goes, I'm going to think this through. What are the possible five 310 consequences if I go this path.

210
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Ooh, not ready for that one. I'm going to try on 10 1010. You know what I'm going to go this path.

211
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.890
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, and I felt more grounded to like I was able to make

212
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:58.920
Saraniah Aston: These conscious kind of decisions in my head, and I felt more grounded just safer for some reason.

213
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.170
Saraniah Aston: I guess because I was thinking, sort of, logically,

214
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:15.390
Saraniah Aston: So that was a good thing and I will continue to do that because I didn't do like a full body scan. I just did that.

215
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.030
Saraniah Aston: But I'm interested in all kinds of things like meditation and

216
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.720
Saraniah Aston: body awareness and all this kind of stuff.

217
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going to, I think, really fall in love with it.

218
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You just described, its fundamental purpose is to get you back into the body when remember that feeling the one where you're

219
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, everything's falling apart. There's no ground.

220
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.970
Saraniah Aston: Out of Control can't

221
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.290
Saraniah Aston: Think straight because of it.

222
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.100
Yeah.

223
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was just as elegant as those breaths.

224
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's so much more going on when you're doing it, the more that you do these additional

225
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Somatic skills, the more you learn about them. We can do one right now with a real quick one. You can add this one to it to the repertoire. You have body scan, you can do that.

226
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can

227
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Write. What am I hearing

228
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I seeing

229
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I smelling. What am I tasting, you already know grounding. The five senses that one a lot of people forget, but it's a really good one to

230
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely focuses on that gets your mind off the worst. How could my mother be putting me in this position gets you out of that for a second. Because remember, you only need a fraction of a second to get this online.

231
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not asking for much, but a miracle happens in that amount of time, we'll take it. So, all these silly little, these little hacks that I'm bringing

232
00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I only need a little bit of time. I only need enough for the rest of your brain to be working. And then I know you'll come up with an actual solution because you know better than anybody what to do. I don't know, you know,

233
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So this one. Let's do this one together. This is another one.

234
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.470
Saraniah Aston: Good.

235
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a fancy name for it, and I welcome. If you can think of a better one. But unfortunately, it's kind of just

236
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Safety peripheral right and left.

237
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.370
So,

238
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like you to do is when you're ready and settle down.

239
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do this activity together and all. It asks, is that you look at something. One thing right in front of you. So for me, I'm looking at an apple right because I'm sitting there staring at a computer. And so I'm looking at this apple

240
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And the work is this, so pick an object and just sort of stare at it. Got it.

241
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:48.750
Mm hmm.

242
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And now do not look away your direct gaze will stay right there.

243
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: First

244
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of pay attention to the body. Let's do both. Let's be aware if there is any charge left. Pay attention to stomach chest size hands just do a scan and see if there's any elevated energy

245
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Vibration.

246
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything tight just just scan it and see if it's there.

247
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what I want you to do. Don't look away from that object is I want you to describe don't look away though this is peripheral so what I'm watching you, as described to your right, the different changes in color.

248
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: might even be able to name some objects, but do it only because you can kind of get a sense of what they are from your periphery. There's a slight blending of memory.

249
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I don't know that I would know that bookcase was a bookcase, but I happen to know it's gold so gold bookcase white sweater contrast did to kind of know from memory. It's a maroon rap.

250
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's white floor.

251
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: gray walls. I can't really tell if there's my water bottle and if I really need to, you know, I do have my hand here.

252
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see my hand.

253
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see my hand moving

254
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Along the lines. The contrast. I can see that the wind is blowing outside because I see the shadows changing

255
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I see him.

256
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.110
Saraniah Aston: And this comes from focusing on this album on this object.

257
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm describing what's to my right to my peripheral vision. But I'm not looking at it. I'm working very hard.

258
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To describe this is very specific. And I'll explain later. See if you can do it.

259
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Described was to write without looking at it.

260
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:49.710
Saraniah Aston: Was to my right is my door to go outside my end table with my lamp on it and

261
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.240
Saraniah Aston: I'm okay. I'm gonna be

262
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.210
Saraniah Aston: There's a

263
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:06.480
Saraniah Aston: Little antique case that I put my medicine every night for the next day, um,

264
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What about big contrast in color and they're like, really tell.

265
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:13.620
What

266
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.050
Saraniah Aston: I'm seeing metals medals. Yeah.

267
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be it.

268
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's just peripheral vision, you know, see if you can just staying at that object. Looking at the that single object then describe

269
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: With peripheral vision. What is to your left.

270
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.660
Saraniah Aston: My man did

271
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.120
Saraniah Aston: You my backdrop

272
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:40.470
White

273
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.060
Saraniah Aston: White

274
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.200
Yeah.

275
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But even then, you can make out the difference between the mannequin in the white where there's just enough color gradation difference that you can you can tell it, it's still there.

276
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.650
Saraniah Aston: Yeah and there's a pink. Pink rug.

277
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else, any other light source wall. Anything else where you can see contrast, maybe even color.

278
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.430
Saraniah Aston: Well, there's windows. I have a window.

279
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.300
Saraniah Aston: And for them.

280
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.490
Saraniah Aston: Which has a blue trim really pretty bright blue trim the like.

281
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.610
Saraniah Aston: There's a mirror.

282
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:29.910
Saraniah Aston: There's a lot of purple because purple is my favorite color. So I have purple accents everywhere.

283
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:39.000
Saraniah Aston: There's my art supplies as well. And my magazine magazines that I use. I cut out of

284
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you can you make out any of the colors in those colored pencils. Can you tell it all or markers. Can you tell, can you distinguish without looking at him.

285
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.510
Saraniah Aston: No, no.

286
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now scan body. Pay attention to you and see how the body is doing is it squeezing, is it flexing, is it at ease.

287
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.000
Saraniah Aston: It's completely relaxed. Yeah.

288
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did that happen. What is it,

289
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.760
Saraniah Aston: Well, I don't know. I was looking at my object which is a

290
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.070
Saraniah Aston: Like five

291
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.250
Saraniah Aston: Tablets of melatonin.

292
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.590
Saraniah Aston: They're pink.

293
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.520
Uh huh.

294
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.230
Saraniah Aston: And

295
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.690
Saraniah Aston: And they're seeing in a, like a glass.

296
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:49.650
Saraniah Aston: Kind of plastic see through jar so I can see through it and

297
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.280
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. That was really hard, but it was really interesting to

298
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: See, so this is what I believe is what made it possible for your body to relax. I believe that I'm pretty sure this is me just having learned it this way is that, you know, when you're

299
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In a fight or flight response. You actually get tunnel vision. It's it in our. We do it instinctively. In other words, if there is a danger, our eyes will only fixate here.

300
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's where it's going to save our life.

301
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this activity made you do it made you turn your peripheral vision. It made you focus out this way, which sends a message to the body, we must not be in danger.

302
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:46.020
Saraniah Aston: If being grounded, kind of, kind of like grounding yourself like a

303
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.340
Saraniah Aston: Knowing that this is there that is there.

304
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.440
Saraniah Aston: You are here.

305
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I like that piece.

306
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.850
Saraniah Aston: Your presence.

307
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I like that it orient you to where you are in the moment.

308
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:03.870
Saraniah Aston: Right.

309
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.800
Saraniah Aston: That's how I feel.

310
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool. I hadn't thought about that element. Can I include that when I described the activity and other people

311
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Please.

312
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it. Um, so my understanding of the scientific part of it, or the the biology of it is that it sends a contradictory message right to the fret.

313
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought and it basically the body is pressing to send the message. We're okay the same one is breath, which is contradicting the, oh my goodness this is catastrophic thought to actually there is no danger there is only perceived threat and how can I see danger when I'm able to do this.

314
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It brings heart rate down

315
00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A little trick.

316
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:14.280
Saraniah Aston: So and also I don't see myself like wallowing in my sorrow and just laying in bed and playing with my phone after we're done with our session I see myself doing things with that backdrop

317
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah well that's really cool.

318
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.340
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that was nice that was relaxing.

319
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice little thing and we can do that anywhere. Can't wait. No one will ever know we're doing that. So you

320
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.880
Saraniah Aston: Like a tool to take with you.

321
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Everywhere portable. So just picture that you were on that same couch and you remember to do the breathing. Maybe you also remember to notice the texture of the couch, you paid attention to the the air that's kind of coming across your skin, your hair you notice the scent.

322
00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice what you hear, maybe, maybe you can hear your mom. Maybe you can hear your own heartbeat, your own pulse and starting to get slower. As you regulate

323
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that your but it's touching the couch. Oh, it's holding me down. I got gravity here. There it is.

324
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can feel I can feel I'm a little tense or I can feel some heat and I feel the texture of my clothing and then I opened my eyes and I look at something on a coffee table.

325
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I start to become aware of the things over to my right, I can even add a hand NONE OF COURSE, I CAN SEE THE WHITE this

326
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this a shirt blouse and let's call it and then I can see my hand can make out a little bit of the color and that's about it. But if I pull them apart. I can actually kind of distinguish that their fingers and other hand

327
00:33:49.470 --> 00:34:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I really took a lot of focus to do that. I didn't really concentrate. And so, oh yeah, that's right. I'm gonna go and I'm going to go get one more time. I'm going to go get medicine for my mom. I'm going to write a letter and I'm done with that.

328
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can you can think of all about after you do these mindfulness practices, you can get their

329
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Practices make it possible for your otherwise hijacked mind.

330
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To work efficiently for all the different parts to work Taylor.

331
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.980
Saraniah Aston: Do you use that term a lot hijacked

332
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Because it does that, the amygdala does

333
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:33.480
Saraniah Aston: It mean

334
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It is completely inconsiderate of the other parts of the brain. It just has no respect.

335
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want to keep you alive. It doesn't have fitness. It just does. Right.

336
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just this

337
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay alive. Just, just, that's it.

338
00:34:51.090 --> 00:35:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Danger no danger, danger, no danger. So sending that contradictory message. Let's the other parts they just take longer to get there. And those the amygdala will indeed.

339
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Block getting access to the other ones. So we've got to be able to regulate first. That's why I keep saying right body first address it first regulate first and then all the fancy thinking can come online.

340
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't give yourself a hard time because you can't think of other cool things to do last. Oh.

341
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: District right activated.

342
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to get huh

343
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I get back in my body first. That's number one. Number one, send the message I'm okay, send the message I'm okay. I'm here, I see these things, like you said, I love that I here in this

344
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I know because I see these things I'm aware of them and I can be aware also then you added one that's in front of you, the object that you're staring at right that you're focused on

345
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we doing for time here. We got good amount of time.

346
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So what was

347
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What was like so far for you what we're doing.

348
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:14.040
Saraniah Aston: It's awesome shows me that I have been doing up complete extreme opposite

349
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.400
Saraniah Aston: Of that for my entire life.

350
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.920
Saraniah Aston: I have been

351
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.120
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely. Just in tunnel vision. That's how I survived.

352
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: which reinforces what that there's danger, right, just keep cycling keeps reinforce and guess what we we don't actually want to tolerate that kind of intense distress for long. All that flood of cortisol is damaging to our organs messes with our memory.

353
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's a powerful awareness, you've been doing it for a long time.

354
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.100
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I really, really have it all of those things on the side.

355
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:05.280
Saraniah Aston: That I could have been aware of. I have been there's been nothing on the sides just black or red just

356
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.000
Saraniah Aston: Straight forward survival.

357
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Sardinia. Can you imagine that your mom walks in the room and you do it looking right let's say here instead of eyes. It's pretty intense to do it in someone's eyes, but instead

358
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You say, I'm going to do this, I'm going to practice it on a practice just just doing it on the regular not even waiting for an antagonistic remark.

359
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Or where she's pulling some antic but instead of just going to do it on a regular There she is. What do I noticed to my right, only do it you know I do for a little bit. You don't have to, you know, do it for long, which is to practice. See you look

360
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

361
00:37:49.410 --> 00:38:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting used to looking not quite dead in the eye, but just being able to pull away from that intensity so that you can be okay. You can go back then to looking at eye contact. Again, but just to be able to oscillate and move between those two. Make sure that you're working optimally.

362
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.500
Right.

363
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's intense, it's a lot to ask that, years and years and years and years of the two people communicate and how they feel around each other.

364
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it differently. Your face will be different when you're doing that and because of mirror neurons. She may regulate to

365
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is a really wild phenomenon. By the way, it explains why

366
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: People yawn when someone yawns in front of you and I didn't know that. But it's because we have mirror neurons. Have you ever done. Have you ever so it's just

367
00:38:49.020 --> 00:39:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. But if you weren't looking at them. If you didn't know they were yawning isn't really contagious, or do you have to see them do it. You've got to see him doing

368
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.200
Saraniah Aston: It is right, you have to see it happen. You have to see them do it. Obviously. Yeah.

369
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, are yawning probably all over the house right now and I'm not yawning.

370
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.230
Saraniah Aston: That really is a weird thing.

371
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but it's because we have inside

372
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Of our head to certain part in our brain mirror neurons which means you'll end up like over time you'll you'll if I was persistent in it. You might turn your head a certain way, you might start to mirror me

373
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're wired that way because we're tribal

374
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we want to send this message to the other.

375
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I see you

376
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You see me. We feel same we okay

377
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah

378
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no reason why you have to wait for her face.

379
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To be safe, you

380
00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Could do it and you might be able to pull it off with some of these practices. These practices of feeling grounded in the self and you might play with this one because you can still be looking at her. Maybe ever knows

381
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody that feels safe, it will still look like you're you're looking at her. There's enough distance they can't tell the difference. Really, whether they're looking at the I are in here.

382
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:17.820
Saraniah Aston: And then right

383
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be okay. She might mirror. Okay. And then you get to feel even more. Okay, now she gets to feel okay. And guess what, nobody's upset.

384
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.090
Saraniah Aston: She's very much that way and

385
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:41.070
Saraniah Aston: Like grab she'll grab on to that good that good feeling like the okay Enos

386
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.140
Saraniah Aston: She'll become a part of that.

387
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.520
Is

388
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.990
Saraniah Aston: Because she wants that, you know, so

389
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.490
Saraniah Aston: It's a good way to keep the peace mirror

390
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.260
Saraniah Aston: Ready.

391
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty cool thing.

392
00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.850
Saraniah Aston: You realize I'm getting an education.

393
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, well hey I'm always learning to

394
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That I had known that. And then I ran across again. Okay, that's that term mirror neurons. And plus it just seems so impossible. How can that be, but then I think of beyond. And I'm like, what else is going to explain the on. I don't understand it.

395
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.110
Saraniah Aston: Right.

396
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.060
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

397
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be something that we're already. It's not like a learned behavior.

398
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just there. It's in us.

399
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:34.950
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, no, the tribal thing that makes sense because that's basically what what we were

400
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What we still are. That's the same thing as when you hear me saying that we're wired for attachment. That's the same concept.

401
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be looking to these other human beings for validation

402
00:41:50.580 --> 00:42:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay, you're okay. We're okay. We're the good guys. They're not in our tribe, they're bad. It takes a lot to overcome those sort of fundamental instinctual longings and desires. It takes a lot

403
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I say these kinds of things over and over, because many of you right my clients you give yourself such a hard time. How can I still be drawn to these people that are toxic or negative or why do I keep going back and doing the same things.

404
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.020
Saraniah Aston: Fear of change.

405
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.120
Saraniah Aston: Constantly

406
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's it. I think it's because it's familiar

407
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I i'm not going to be drawn to something that I'm not already. I'm not already comfortable with.

408
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:34.710
Right.

409
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I grew up in normalized

410
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:46.740
Saraniah Aston: Right. I mean, when I guess when you're being raised, you're also kind of being programmed a little bit

411
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.080
Saraniah Aston: To whatever. However, your parents want you to be raised.

412
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:54.930
Saraniah Aston: So,

413
00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a different, that's a different piece. Do you want to explore that further. They want you raised in a particular way that has intention behind it.

414
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So pro around, I think.

415
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, are you thinking that maybe there was some intentional disregard of you intentional and validation from either of your character.

416
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:30.330
Saraniah Aston: Oh, well, my dad is a genius and he wanted that for me. He wanted me to be

417
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:45.270
Saraniah Aston: A very special child. And I think I was, but I wasn't the kind of special that he wanted that he had been grooming me to be since I was, you know, since I could speak.

418
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.900
Saraniah Aston: I never was that I never became that

419
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:57.720
Saraniah Aston: I went in a different direction. And what he wanted for me.

420
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted for himself you to be something other than what you are

421
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.870
Yeah.

422
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.410
Saraniah Aston: Which is like a genius.

423
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does it mean to you that that's part of your history that happened.

424
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:21.060
Saraniah Aston: Well,

425
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.910
Saraniah Aston: It definitely took a long time for me, I realized that I'm not a genius.

426
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:42.690
Saraniah Aston: And don't have that in me and that's fine. I don't want to be a genius. I wouldn't want to be a genius. Sounds very difficult. Um, but I did feel very inadequate now.

427
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:50.520
Saraniah Aston: I don't, I don't feel inadequate for not being a genius. I feel

428
00:44:51.930 --> 00:45:00.900
Saraniah Aston: That what I've been through and gone through and come out the other side alive and wanting to be alive.

429
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.510
Saraniah Aston: Is what

430
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.850
Saraniah Aston: I prefer then being a genius.

431
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.030
Saraniah Aston: Does any of this make sense.

432
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.750
Saraniah Aston: Am I going off the path kill

433
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound like you are right, where

434
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A very predictable way of I asked, kind of, what's it been like for you to have that history and you're like, I didn't want turns out I I'm perfectly fine with not being genius. I like who I am.

435
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.710
Saraniah Aston: I really do. I feel like they need to stay that quietly. You know, I don't know what

436
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.390
Saraniah Aston: To

437
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about it. Don't be quiet about it in here. I want to hear what you like.

438
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.220
Saraniah Aston: Well, I just, I know that I

439
00:45:52.740 --> 00:46:03.060
Saraniah Aston: I make people laugh like belly. Laughs I can make a whole room of people laugh because funny.

440
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.790
Saraniah Aston: And

441
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.370
Saraniah Aston: I know that I i have a

442
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.920
Saraniah Aston: Kind of a commanding

443
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.710
Saraniah Aston: Or about me when I enter a room and

444
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.350
Saraniah Aston: People feel me and are drawn to me a lot.

445
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.860
Saraniah Aston: Sometimes not always the right people, but

446
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: She likes it, like the notion that there's a draw toward

447
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.310
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

448
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.330
Okay.

449
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Command.

450
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:50.640
Saraniah Aston: What

451
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Commanding or ability to make people laugh and

452
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.550
Saraniah Aston: And see me.

453
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To see you

454
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am seen

455
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:12.000
Saraniah Aston: But the problem with that is oftentimes, which I can change now is there's a lot of intimidation.

456
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.800
Saraniah Aston: Around

457
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.140
Saraniah Aston: Me like people seem to be intimidated at first.

458
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.730
Saraniah Aston: However, drawn to me but intimidated. So it's weird.

459
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I check that out just a little bit. Can I see how you measure whether one is intimidated and one person's not like how, how are you measuring whether let's say it will take me because I'm here.

460
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Have there been signs that

461
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm intimidated by you.

462
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.440
Saraniah Aston: Have there been cited. No, no, not at all.

463
00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it look like on a person when they are intimidated. What's it look like

464
00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:11.730
Saraniah Aston: Well, sometimes when I first meet people, or they not meet them yet, or they see me, they know about me maybe or someone saying hey that's that girl Mia, blah, blah, blah. I can sometimes see them.

465
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:20.040
Saraniah Aston: Women often going and kind of curious yet really bitchy

466
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.460
Saraniah Aston: Threatened kind of mode.

467
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:30.240
Saraniah Aston: And that they get over once they give me a chance to speak.

468
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.200
Saraniah Aston: Men.

469
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.750
Saraniah Aston: Are different men.

470
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:53.010
Saraniah Aston: Will often try to speak to me. And then they will get angry with me for having a voice and for giving my opinion and for saying no, I'm not interested in that, or

471
00:48:54.300 --> 00:49:02.220
Saraniah Aston: Or saying that something is idiotic in my point of view, they become threatened and by that.

472
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.890
Saraniah Aston: Men, especially and oftentimes they come kind of means

473
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.830
Saraniah Aston: Um,

474
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:19.410
Saraniah Aston: But the good ones just kind of latch on and they're just like, well, they kind of just jump on my ride.

475
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the rumor what it

476
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.320
Saraniah Aston: Is crazy nights.

477
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:46.140
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, she's an attention seeker I'm mostly that I'm that I'm crazy. And then I'm damaged. I asked my friend list in my only I have two friends here.

478
00:49:46.830 --> 00:50:05.310
Saraniah Aston: And one of them is Justin and I asked him about a month ago, I was really curious. I said, if you were if someone were to ask you what I'm all about. How would you describe me to them and he fumbled over his words. And he looked embarrassed and and and

479
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:13.260
Saraniah Aston: Ashamed almost and then I already thinking, okay, so he's already spoken about me. Okay.

480
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:33.270
Saraniah Aston: And then I'm like, I started giving him answer. So do you tell them that I'm nice or that I'm pretty or I'm artistic or that i'm i'm kind, caring loving interesting funny all this stuff and he he didn't answer to any of those. And then I said, How about damage.

481
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:48.420
Saraniah Aston: Which you described me as being a damaged person people and he looked a little shameful, but he didn't answer. He just nodded his head really quickly and it responds, yes.

482
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do after he nodded once you do

483
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.870
Saraniah Aston: I accepted it.

484
00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:57.780
Saraniah Aston: I understood

485
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.810
Saraniah Aston: And I, I basically said, damn. That sucks.

486
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.300
Saraniah Aston: But I know that stuff.

487
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:08.880
Saraniah Aston: And screw it.

488
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:11.940
Saraniah Aston: Screw it.

489
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did you use that word damage. Why don't you throw that one out there.

490
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not

491
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.230
Saraniah Aston: Because I know that that's how I am seeing

492
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:36.510
Saraniah Aston: You know when I let people in and I tell a little bit about myself and I open up and I show myself a little bit more

493
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:42.270
Saraniah Aston: People see the pain because I open about it and

494
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:51.270
Saraniah Aston: They see me. I'm very passionate when I speak, and I'm very, I can be intense and I think

495
00:51:52.620 --> 00:52:01.590
Saraniah Aston: They're just like, whoa, she's been through a lot and she's cool. She's very cool, but she's very dentist.

496
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.270
Saraniah Aston: That's how I imagined people describing me

497
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wondered why we said that were damaged.

498
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.780
Saraniah Aston: Because I'm damage.

499
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.320
Saraniah Aston: But to everyone else, and

500
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:23.070
Saraniah Aston: I'm damn I'm just like a damaged goods like I'm

501
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:32.760
Saraniah Aston: I mean I have PTSD. People don't understand that that means I'm crazy just sent to a lot of people

502
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:42.240
Saraniah Aston: I think I need to just figure out a different way to approach people

503
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.150
Saraniah Aston: And I think

504
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:54.630
Saraniah Aston: One of the ways is by not saying so many things about myself because I don't need to do that anymore.

505
00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well we touched on that when that certainly about risking you dip your toe and to see if we are trustworthy. Like, we're going to test us out first, whether we can sort of

506
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Be careful with your vulnerability like don't trust us right away. Just give us, but that's that's about me. That's about whether I can sit with intensity that has nothing to do with whether you're damaged or not, that just has to do with

507
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to talk about donuts.

508
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't mean like I wanna, I want to have a light and fluffy.

509
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's more about

510
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:33.900
It doesn't make you

511
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.460
Saraniah Aston: Well, I mean, my past and all these things are built up to the substance abuse problem. The

512
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:46.770
Saraniah Aston: The

513
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:48.990
Saraniah Aston: My

514
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:54.930
Saraniah Aston: Cycle at my breakdown that I had and Israel.

515
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:04.110
Saraniah Aston: All of these things that are that I've been through make up an image of a damn girl.

516
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.280
Saraniah Aston: But I wanted to change that now.

517
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wanna

518
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:15.600
Saraniah Aston: I'm aware of that, but I'm putting the damage girl in the past.

519
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

520
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're open to it. See if you're comfortable telling me a story.

521
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: About what proceeded what you just described, was the breakdown. What was going on in Israel.

522
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:42.720
Saraniah Aston: I had postpartum depression. After I had my child. And it was never

523
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:50.010
Saraniah Aston: Dealt with or acknowledge any way at all. So I just have to go through it and

524
00:54:51.900 --> 00:55:05.370
Saraniah Aston: My ex husband was neglectful and doing drugs and I had to protect my child. And I started developing psoriasis and all kinds of stuff like that and

525
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:21.540
Saraniah Aston: And then there was war and bomb rotten apples are rockets falling right outside the window, and I have to take my daughter to the shelter every single time that air raid siren went off and I

526
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.970
Saraniah Aston: Was saying to her.

527
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.580
Saraniah Aston: A happy song about

528
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.330
Saraniah Aston: Rockets and

529
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:39.570
Saraniah Aston: Trauma and raised. I was raised by a higher ranking official of the IDF

530
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:55.050
Saraniah Aston: And just all these things and you know when I when I talked about them, like my ex husband just it was basically like that you deserve that kind of thing, shoving it under the rug. It was painful for him to acknowledge and

531
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:03.870
Saraniah Aston: Just all of these things just made me go to a place I'd never been before.

532
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:07.560
Saraniah Aston: Which was completely psychotic

533
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.910
Saraniah Aston: I can literally say that I have been temporarily insane.

534
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know

535
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That one of the

536
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: most impactful traumas.

537
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Of children.

538
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't necessarily a molestation a punch in the face. Do you know it's that this caregiver did not say back, I believe you.

539
00:56:42.810 --> 00:57:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The in the experience of the event itself like we can wreck and psychologically in spirit. We can reconcile ourselves with the flesh, like this flesh was cut rip torn bruised scraped it bled and but there's something again member that attachment things happening again.

540
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To have your reality.

541
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: invalidated makes us crazy

542
00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:26.160
Saraniah Aston: And that happens so much with my ex husband, wife had a baby and I would tell them, please. Do you see what I'm going through, there's men coming in and out of the house musician in a house all the time. I've got my baby hear a dog walked over my baby.

543
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:33.150
Saraniah Aston: Like, and he's basically telling me you're crazy you're reacting. What are you talking about, and

544
00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:41.550
Saraniah Aston: That over and over and over and over and over again and I snuck out when I packed all my stuff. My mother was visiting

545
00:57:42.210 --> 00:58:00.720
Saraniah Aston: I at me at midnight. I wouldn't throw room and I list her to her pack all your stuff I raised for a girl that I barely knew to pick us up in the morning before anyone else awake. I took my mom, a little bit of stuff my he loves the mid and we took off.

546
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.500
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, and I had a lawyer and he was telling you what to do.

547
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:08.100
Saraniah Aston: That was crazy.

548
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, that was saying.

549
00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.860
Saraniah Aston: That actually was

550
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a few. So, for a lot of people, they'll have this few experience or future. I don't know how you want to pronounce it, but I call it a few

551
00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're going to do. It's exactly what you described, you may not even remember having a consciousness of it. It was your mind and been made up. You didn't question it. And you may even forget important parts of an event and you just did it.

552
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a fugue state, you can almost be in a trance unconscious state while you're doing something like that and i know i don't think you're crazy. That's the psychological

553
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: self preservation. It wants to not go insane. It can't stand to have. I have all my senses from my eyes, my ears. My tactile experience is sending this message, but I have this other husband telling me what I'm experiencing is not real.

554
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.870
Saraniah Aston: And his parents. Yeah.

555
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:20.070
Saraniah Aston: They told me that

556
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:32.160
Saraniah Aston: That they could get me kicked out of Israel, and they would take my child. And I was like, do you not see that your son is a drug addict. We work with me here. I'm in fear and they would just smile.

557
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:35.850
Saraniah Aston: So,

558
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:37.770
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

559
00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:44.820
Saraniah Aston: I don't know if it's all these things that literally made me

560
00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:47.280
Saraniah Aston: Lose it

561
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.980
Saraniah Aston: And end up in the hospital.

562
00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like it doesn't it. I mean, can you imagine along the way that if anyone was really listening to you that this sequence of events would have happened the way it did.

563
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I don't think somebody would have said, wait a minute. We've got a move.

564
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not safe. The baby's not safe.

565
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the sequence doesn't happen. We don't know what would have happened, obviously, but no along the way. We've got to be able to say to ourselves, and you have an invalidating childhood. So now you're right for the perfect storm of invalidation you're used to it.

566
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it had to get so bad that he loved was in danger.

567
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can finally say no, wait i right this is happening. I can feel for another that her safety set in danger, and we took took action.

568
01:00:47.850 --> 01:01:04.260
Saraniah Aston: Yep, and no one would listen to me, and no one would agree with me know see that it's true. And so I had to be a grown up and a mother and do my job. And that's what I did. And I got blamed for it. I got chastised for it. I got

569
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:09.060
Saraniah Aston: My in laws completely shunned me

570
01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.910
Saraniah Aston: And yeah, so

571
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:32.250
Saraniah Aston: But when I was in the hospital and my ex husband came to visit me. You could second see on his face that it was like he's been through this whole time and suddenly he sees that something is seriously wrong and he feels guilty. I could see that.

572
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.150
Saraniah Aston: And since then, he does have more care.

573
01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.760
Saraniah Aston: To him for me.

574
01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:44.670
Saraniah Aston: Around my mental health.

575
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.310
Saraniah Aston: Your we're over time.

576
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I just saw that, too. And I was like, oh, wow, that was fast.

577
01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:55.950
Yeah.

578
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking in here. I wanted to just take a quick peek at what

579
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So far,

580
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I just take a look at my notes from last time.

581
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.920
Saraniah Aston: I think you should always wear white, by the way.

582
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:12.720
Saraniah Aston: Good.

583
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:16.230
Saraniah Aston: Oh, thank you. I never, I never wear white and never have

584
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:17.190
Saraniah Aston: I don't know why.

585
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

586
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I've gotten from a real habit. I've got a bunch of pieces I just throw it on and I don't even think

587
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: About it anymore. Everything goes with white. It's just like black. It's just easy. It matches everything

588
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Except Brown, I suppose.

589
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But thank you

590
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

591
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to

592
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right now, we have

593
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We have one more piece. Sorry, you're my last client for to face.

594
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.280
I did.

595
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.040
Saraniah Aston: I saw you gone. I didn't

596
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I didn't do the full jaan I interrupted by myself.

597
01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think what I'd like to do, if we can, it's, it's, it's hard to, you know, I just sort of meet with you and then I don't look in here, but I would like to continue to develop the anchor room really create reports this safe space for you.

598
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like, if you're up to it. I'd like to do not am Dr around some of those stories.

599
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.020
Saraniah Aston: Let's Cmdr.

600
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's I movement Desensitization and Reprocessing you pick one of those, let's say, and

601
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We can work with. This is how it would sound. It would sound like this. Well, if there's many, many phases to it, but one part of it. The part that you guys are usually interested in is the bilateral stimulation

602
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It will be having your eyes moving left and right, and I'll be asking you to hold. You don't have to tell me what it is that you hold this WORST MEMORY

603
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst image that's the desensitization part you've rolled out in your awareness. I identify with you what the negative cognition is we might be weaving in positive

604
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The Member of the protective figure the nurturing figure and the wise figure we would be kind of leading those in May. Just see again, you got you got

605
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The iron the protective figures, an Iron Dome detects rockets in the air. This big

606
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.790
Saraniah Aston: Hmm.

607
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing figure a saint holding a

608
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Child

609
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The child.

610
01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.770
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. No. Am I this Angel. Angel.

611
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.820
Saraniah Aston: I don't know.

612
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.110
Saraniah Aston: Perhaps

613
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You may well we can revisit it we would refine it before we started installing with that and Frida Kahlo for the wise figure. She's the artist. So obviously, you told me that

614
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So the idea would be to address the PTSD more directly

615
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.820
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

616
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we, you and I have been doing is we've been doing work around a disc emotional dysregulation, we've been addressing really calling it out naming it

617
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The family dynamics, we've been seeing the connection, I think, between family dynamics and the men that you've been kind of letting past that that you kind of intuitively know that there might be a problem. Maybe, but I'll just look past that are

618
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But you only hit some of those things we've been kind of learning new skills, about how to regulate

619
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this thing I'm introducing right now would be

620
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty direct work on addressing the PTSD symptoms really kind of looking at those trauma pieces and and having a different relationship with those memories so that it's not

621
01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Causing dysregulation

622
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:37.740
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I can handle that.

623
01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.530
Saraniah Aston: I can totally handle that.

624
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.890
Saraniah Aston: They won't like trigger anything or they won't, but it doesn't really work that way.

625
01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:49.260
Saraniah Aston: It's

626
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.910
Saraniah Aston: Really coming from me, it's, it's fine, it's safe.

627
01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's reassuring. It's pretty typical though for people to have an increase in distress though from this because it, what it does is it opens up otherwise I'm

628
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of forgotten fragments of it because we were only thinking about a little bit in our workspace like on our desk, really, really thinking about right this amount

629
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Of business.

630
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.200
Saraniah Aston: You might not understand it would be difficult. I get it.

631
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:23.370
Saraniah Aston: I know

632
01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.070
Saraniah Aston: It will be opening up things right.

633
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.380
Saraniah Aston: I'm ready. I've been ready for a while.

634
01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I, I want to give you the warnings, though, that there might be an increase in nightmares. There might be irritability, there might be this stuff, but that's the short term, the long term is there's reprocessing of that information. It's not just tonic. It means

635
01:06:46.680 --> 01:07:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, it's set in the past. I'm not reliving it I'm not reliving it's in the past. So that can be an exciting experience that the emotional connection to it is starting to know a little bit down dimming dimming that trauma experience damned down. Oh.

636
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.280
Saraniah Aston: By opening it up and to look at it.

637
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.530
Saraniah Aston: Well, seeing what it is for real.

638
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of like that accepted really unique feature about this. If I do it with fidelity. You don't actually have to tell me the trauma.

639
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You only have to be thinking about it, even for this technique to work. You just have to, and I

640
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I just say, Okay, bring it up, it might be this particular story of this story or this story, this story, and we'll give it a name will say, we'll call that one Israel, you know, shells are exploding or give it a name and then you pull it out and think about it.

641
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't actually it. You don't have to retell the story if you don't want to. That's what's kind of unique about this. So it doesn't have this intense reach romanization that the typical exposure therapy does

642
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:57.270
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

643
01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it.

644
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's pick it up a time to meet

645
01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.200
Okay.

646
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Next week we already

647
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We already have something we already have nine o'clock on Friday.

648
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.340
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, Friday.

649
01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:18.690
Yeah.

650
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Following week

651
01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:24.150
Saraniah Aston: And then that's a group right

652
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's individual you're getting. Remember, we wanted to

653
01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:27.990
Saraniah Aston: Do it.

654
01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's you're getting a solid week of of one of Uranus.

655
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.590
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I asked my mom. And she's like,

656
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:43.110
Saraniah Aston: She came. She's like, I want you to do that extra day that you were talking about. So

657
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we can even get in, we'll kind of if we have time, we'll finish the anchor room and then maybe if there's time we can. I can start to do some of that introduce you to what that might feel like doing the preparation work for you and Dr.

658
01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but let's look at a head just in case, because I'm getting booked up quickly. I want to make sure that there were, we've got some time. The following week

659
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What about may 20

660
01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: At 110 which is it's a Wednesday, do you typically have some specific going on right then.

661
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:19.710
Nope.

662
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: 110 on May 20 now. So the next services. We have our Friday at 9am you want to get there. That's a bit early for you it will take some alarm settings if you get in there at 845 then I'll know okay she's definitely here. She's, she's ready to go and group Monday and Wednesday the 20th

663
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is our individual therapy at wanted

664
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm excited. Good.

665
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to move this right along.

666
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:54.990
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I guess so.

667
01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.290
Saraniah Aston: Kind of intensive. Isn't it a little bit.

668
01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it is right. But remember, you've question. Should I be in intensive

669
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that yourself. And let's play with it. All you have to do is say this was just too much. I want to pull back and then we pull back. It's whatever is working. Okay, that's

670
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.100
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I'm all for it.

671
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.360
Saraniah Aston: Thank you.

672
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:21.870
Saraniah Aston: Bye.

673
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.
