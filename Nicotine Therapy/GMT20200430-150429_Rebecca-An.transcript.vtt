Jessica Freeman: Kieran Kieran had a really, really high fever yesterday and all of last night and

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.610
Jessica Freeman: He came and crawl into bed with me in about 5am he was burning up he had like it was almost 103 degrees. And it was like that all day yesterday and it wouldn't come down with Motrin or

16
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:33.330
Jessica Freeman: Tylenol just would not come down. So I gave him, you know, a tepid bath. A couple times and I did, you know, push fluids and he was still making urine. So it's like, Okay, I'm just, you know, hope for the best. You what I can manage. But about 630 his fever finally broke

17
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.100
Jessica Freeman: And he's back in the normal 9899 range. Now,

18
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.960
Jessica Freeman: He's still

19
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:50.940
Jessica Freeman: In my bed. He's been in my bed like all day yesterday and it's only nine but he hasn't moved and he hasn't drank anything's morning

20
00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.350
Jessica Freeman: He hasn't eaten anything yet. So my mom's coming over to try to man like monitor him while I'm doing this. And then my meeting afterwards.

21
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:17.580
Jessica Freeman: So it's been a little rough like I've been really worried really worried because I don't want to have to take him to a hospital. Like, I don't want to expose him. I've been so careful like so careful to not expose him to anything. And so

22
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.430
Jessica Freeman: I know it's just been a rough couple days.

23
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You remember a couple week or so ago you were taking him to virtual doctor because of his ears. Right. Yeah.

24
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.340
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and he's on an antibiotic, and he was back to normal. But he was fine.

25
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:42.510
Jessica Freeman: And then yesterday, just his fever just spiked. I mean, I mean, he was back to normal and then out of the blue. He has a fever spike.

26
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.800
Jessica Freeman: So I'm going to finish out the antibiotics and hopefully, hopefully, everything's okay now. Now this the fever broke. I hope it doesn't go back up, then I've just been worried

27
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.640
Yeah.

28
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't blame you. I would be to

29
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.380
Jessica Freeman: You know, if I have to get him seen like that's a whole nother ball of problems that I just don't want it.

30
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.250
Jessica Freeman: So I'm glad it finally broke

31
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.460
Jessica Freeman: But I'm kind of tired, you know,

32
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.600
Yeah.

33
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you know when you're in

34
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That state.

35
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you got to really be careful. You got to watch you know how you talk to people because it'd be easy to snap, you know,

36
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I mean really talk to anybody. I mean, it's just

37
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.400
Jessica Freeman: I'm home all the time.

38
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.830
Jessica Freeman: I mean, can nobody else and then we

39
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:50.370
Jessica Freeman: I mean mom and Bob like we went over there for dinner the other night, and I know they're being really careful to and you know they're the constant in our life. You know, we see them.

40
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.200
Jessica Freeman: All the time.

41
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

42
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.060
Jessica Freeman: If not every day, every other day, I just, I hope you didn't catch anything. I don't know. I'm just

43
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.400
Jessica Freeman: I'm worried about my little boy.

44
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame you. I would be to, you know, it's our natural state when something's not right with our babies.

45
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

46
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.730
Jessica Freeman: Especially now you know because you you'd like under typical circumstances you would

47
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:28.800
Jessica Freeman: Be like, okay, well he's sick. I'm going to take him to the doctor or he's, you know, really sick is fevered high. We're going to go to the ER. You know, I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to take him anywhere.

48
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.670
Yeah.

49
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I would just wait and see and play it out and it might just be the end result of any infection that was coming up on his ears, you know,

50
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mother had to go through that last little hurdle in order to

51
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Start getting better. You know when you we put antibiotics in our body. It's because it's fighting something for us right

52
00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we think about that, and sometimes our bodies. You know what either reject the antibiotics or fight it a little bit, you know, you got three things going on that's fighting each other in there. So, you know, I would just kind of wait and see.

53
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:22.290
Jessica Freeman: And I mean I educated myself, you know, I looked at several different websites about, you know, what causes high fevers and children, and then you know when to worry how to manage it.

54
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So good.

55
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:34.890
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mean, I think I did everything right. Like I wouldn't change anything that I've done, and the fever finally broke so that makes me feel a lot of relief.

56
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.580
Yeah.

57
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely I don't blame you.

58
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.460
Jessica Freeman: I hosted and chaired a meeting yesterday.

59
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.560
Jessica Freeman: Right, yeah.

60
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Zoom Zoom meeting. Yeah.

61
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.970
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, well, my, my downtown Indy group, you know that meets every day at noon eastern 10 for me. I'm

62
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.440
Jessica Freeman: One of the I used to be a secretary at that meeting and I had to give up my position when I moved

63
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:16.980
Jessica Freeman: So they asked, they asked me if I could cover one day, I was like, absolutely. So maybe I'll cover it again. I'm actually supposed to share a meeting tonight. It's not the downtown, meaning it's a different

64
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.370
Jessica Freeman: It's a different, but I'm not sure I have to get in touch with that girl and ask questions. But anyway, stay involved.

65
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

66
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which helps you know

67
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My

68
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:43.440
Jessica Freeman: readings are a big help, especially with those people. You know, I know I can count on like really good solid stuff from them.

69
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.520
Jessica Freeman: You know, because they've been in recovery, a long time.

70
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.740
Jessica Freeman: Hang on.

71
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, go check them.

72
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.800
Jessica Freeman: What's the matter,

73
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does it still have a view.

74
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:58.050
Jessica Freeman: It's only like 99 right now. Let me check with my mom what her. She says she's on her way. Okay.

75
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have the opportunity to get back in to see the virtual doctor today for him.

76
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:17.190
Jessica Freeman: I mean I can try that. But like at this point. I feel like he needs to be seen like we already did that. And it's not working. So maybe something else is is wrong.

77
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

78
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:28.740
Jessica Freeman: I mean, the fever broke. Okay, I don't know what he's upset about right now. He won't drink anything. His lips are all chapped. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. And I need my mom to get here.

79
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: maybe it'd be a good idea to take him in maybe call ahead of time and let them know what's going on with them and

80
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find out what it is that they suggest that you do, since you've already pretty much done everything you know

81
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.360
Jessica Freeman: No. What's wrong with him.

82
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, he definitely doesn't come with a book that says if the symptoms come. This is what's

83
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is the guesswork.

84
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.630
Jessica Freeman: Do you want me what do

85
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.870
