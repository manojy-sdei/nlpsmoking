I got

12
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.010

17
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.790
Brandon Arrington: Detox and everything, which is probably for the best because

18
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.430
Brandon Arrington: If you know anything about that drug

19
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.260
Brandon Arrington: It, it will get ahold of you and let go.

20
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.630
Dr. Ogawa: So,

21
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.360
Brandon Arrington: I'm going to another town where I don't know anybody to a residential program and I'm gonna stay there for

22
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.690
Brandon Arrington: Maybe 90 days we'll go from there. But I want to do my meetings through bright heart.

23
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.820
Brandon Arrington: Even while I'm up there.

24
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.850
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, yeah, I think that will hurt.

25
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.390
Brandon Arrington: Cuz i don't i don't really

26
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:39.750
Brandon Arrington: Know like as far as like the meeting rooms and stuff like that. It will be even more so because I know they have stuff to do while I'm in that program up there, but this has been working for me so

27
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.100
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, okay. Yeah. And what are you going to go detox just heroin.

28
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.560
Brandon Arrington: That's my, that's my main thing, but I also have been using

29
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.390
Brandon Arrington: Painkillers methamphetamine.

30
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.710
Brandon Arrington: Occasionally cocaine I smoke weed every day.

31
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.160
Brandon Arrington: I haven't been drinking, which is weird.

32
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.450
Brandon Arrington: Because amount Holland.

33
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.280
Brandon Arrington: They're just basically everything I need to get my shit together.

34
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.780
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, I mean I think it's great that I guess now it's a good time as me.

35
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.040
Dr. Ogawa: Sorry, it's been kind of rough for you. Yeah.

36
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.890
Brandon Arrington: It's not nobody's fault with my own, but we me and my girlfriend, she had a miscarriage and

37
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.140
Brandon Arrington: I just look for any excuse, just to keep getting further and further away.

38
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.990
Brandon Arrington: Like it's gonna be pretty bad right now. I use about

39
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.940
Brandon Arrington: A gram a day.

40
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.590
Brandon Arrington: And

41
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.360
Brandon Arrington: And my thoughts are so scattered. I can't get one project done and I got 100 on going. So

42
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.710
Dr. Ogawa: How do you usually use your heroin.

43
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.030
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

44
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.470
Dr. Ogawa: And and then I think I saw in the notes like get you started. When you were in prison.

45
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.330
Dr. Ogawa: Is that how it all started.

46
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.930
Brandon Arrington: I did eight years in prison.

47
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.670
Brandon Arrington: And the last

48
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.710
Brandon Arrington: Three years.

49
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.620
Brandon Arrington: I got introduced to heroin and been strong. Now, ever since.

50
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.120
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And when was the last time you use

51
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.580
Brandon Arrington: I just used before I started

52
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.610
Dr. Ogawa: Just like started this meeting.

53
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.980
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Okay. All right.

54
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.840
Brandon Arrington: I'm enough. They're not all over the place and

55
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.930
Dr. Ogawa: It keeps you stable.

56
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.680
Brandon Arrington: Right.

57
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:57.000
Dr. Ogawa: Got it. And right. So tell me, I think. So you were on buprenorphine before. How did that go

58
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.480
Brandon Arrington: So, everything was going just fine. I got off for all and then I told you what happened with me and my girlfriend and

59
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.130
Brandon Arrington: I just been I would start since

60
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.450
Dr. Ogawa: So you haven't had any Suboxone either

61
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.160
Brandon Arrington: And that oh yeah

62
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:30.720
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, and so it sounds, you know, I'm a little bit. Um, I actually have to ask if I can give you that much supply at once, especially because it's like we are first

63
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.500
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, I'm going to be going to the into every week. What they did before was giving me a two week and then I go to a

64
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.150
Brandon Arrington: Meeting every week. Anyways, so it'll be

65
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:54.540
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah yeah might be a week and maybe can be two weeks or four. I'm not sure like to, you know, help you out and get you to the detox. If we can

66
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.080
Dr. Ogawa: To get back to you on that though.

67
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.210
Dr. Ogawa: Um, yeah. Did you have any problems with them medicine last time.

68
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.580
Brandon Arrington: No, I was actually doing like the best identity a while.

69
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.780
Dr. Ogawa: And

70
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.400
Brandon Arrington: I don't know why.

71
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.260
Brandon Arrington: I use that as an excuse to start over. Yeah.

72
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.960
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Well, it sounds like. I mean, that's a tough question.

73
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.850
Dr. Ogawa: Um,

74
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.430
Dr. Ogawa: You know, sounds like you're going to have some time to think about it though, and

75
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.980
Dr. Ogawa: Are doing next time you'll be

76
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.490
Dr. Ogawa: Wiser about it. It's still be hard, but you'll have some ways to deal with them next time. Okay.

77
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.360
Dr. Ogawa: And then Suboxone will help you physically not happens with Nicole cravings.

78
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.000
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, that's the only way I've been able to kick is through Suboxone

79
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.420
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, yeah. And how did you start it last time with Dr. Dr.

80
00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.130
Brandon Arrington: So,

81
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.600
Brandon Arrington: Um, I happened to be

82
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.100
Brandon Arrington: At somebody's house that was doing a meeting.

83
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.040
Brandon Arrington: And inquired about it and

84
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.510
Brandon Arrington: Like I do not want this for the rest of my life.

85
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.560
Dr. Ogawa: So,

86
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.750
Brandon Arrington: I started just like wanting to know more. And then I called and started

87
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.120
Dr. Ogawa: Did you have to like way go through withdrawals, that kind of stuff.

88
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.380
Brandon Arrington: Oh, so yeah yeah he said he couldn't start me on the medication because I had been using

89
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.650
Brandon Arrington: I

90
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:48.330
Brandon Arrington: Will stop using tonight. Like, I won't use anymore because by Sunday when I go to that program. I'm going to be full fledged withdraw.

91
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.070
Dr. Ogawa: And

92
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.080
Brandon Arrington: As long as I have the Suboxone to go through it and I will continue to go through it.

93
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.910
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, yeah. So sounds like you kind of know what to do.

94
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:13.530
Dr. Ogawa: With heroin and anything that's like short acting opiates rack and everybody's a little different but we recommend at least 12 hours after your last use

95
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:26.850
Dr. Ogawa: Before you start your first dose and because you're gonna feel really bad such a strong medicine that if you take it too soon. It's going to kick off any heroin that you had in your system.

96
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.970
Dr. Ogawa: And you're going to feel withdrawals and feel terrible.

97
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.620
Brandon Arrington: I've done that before, too.

98
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.450
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, saying, oh,

99
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.680
Yeah.

100
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:43.830
Dr. Ogawa: So um yeah 12 hours at least if you can wait till Sunday that's even longer. So it's even better if you can do that.

101
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:54.360
Dr. Ogawa: And then when you're ready to start and you, you were on looks like three of the eight milligrams a day in the past.

102
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:04.080
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. And so if we know that was your dose and I would probably, I don't know if you want to start with that right away.

103
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:15.690
Dr. Ogawa: So you might want to start with, like, one a day and see how you go and if it's not enough, then maybe the next day you can do to the next day three, or something like that.

104
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.230
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, just might be

105
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:28.530
Dr. Ogawa: Well, you can see how it goes. I would say the first at least give one or three at 123 hours between a dose or, you know,

106
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.680
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, so, so you're not doing too much.

107
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.770
Dr. Ogawa: And then we can do that, did you end up needing any medicines to get you through the withdrawal last time.

108
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.450
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, actually. Dr. Packer put together this little like

109
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.750
Brandon Arrington: I was like a care kit and

110
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.270
Brandon Arrington: Basically nurse me back to hell in a

111
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.960
Brandon Arrington: Little bit every thurs

112
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.020
Brandon Arrington: A chronic back pain I suffer from and he gave me something that wasn't an opioid

113
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.610
Dr. Ogawa: And then if

114
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:13.020
Brandon Arrington: If you know heroin it like doesn't make you pass that go to the bathroom. So he gave me something for that.

115
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.970
Brandon Arrington: Just basically everything to kick easiest is gonna be

116
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:34.350
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, yeah. So, um, I have all that here looks like a pretty good package and so one medicines combo multiple that's for the the diarrhea issue that you

117
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:45.570
Dr. Ogawa: Most people have when they withdraw. Okay. You can you read it, you need to and then pro magazines for nausea sometimes for coffee, too, but you can

118
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.430
Brandon Arrington: Raise it

119
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.890
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, okay, yeah. That order quantity probably also will help

120
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.530
Dr. Ogawa: That's for tremors shakes.

121
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.170
Dr. Ogawa: And that also things I can take that.

122
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.420
Brandon Arrington: When I when I'm kicking

123
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.920
Brandon Arrington: It. And that's what caused me to use most of the time.

124
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.870
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah yeah

125
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:16.290
Dr. Ogawa: So you might need to end up. And, you know, asking, maybe up the detox. Like, is there something that we need to do about things it part to

126
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.060
Dr. Ogawa: The Suboxone can take care of some of it, but

127
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.190
Dr. Ogawa: May not take care of all of it.

128
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.060
Brandon Arrington: Yeah.

129
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.380
Dr. Ogawa: For sure. Yeah, because all these feelings are going to come back when we take that away.

130
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.010
From you.

131
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.650
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

132
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:41.340
Dr. Ogawa: Good, good. Um, so you said other painkillers. What other painkillers. Do you use

133
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.620
Brandon Arrington: oxy cotton or

134
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.480
Brandon Arrington: Norco

135
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.840
Brandon Arrington: I only only basically use those as

136
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.830
Brandon Arrington: To stretch out because heroines expensive. So are those

137
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.120
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, but none of us manageable. At this point, so

138
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:16.320
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, yeah. And yeah, be careful with all of those, you know, could be other things to next day to

139
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.150
Dr. Ogawa: Come and they're all opiates.

140
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.190
Dr. Ogawa: So also, when you go through withdrawal for starting the Suboxone

141
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.930
Dr. Ogawa: Hey,

142
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.700
Dr. Ogawa: You're gonna have to be off of all of those opiates. Okay.

143
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.240
Dr. Ogawa: So I'll

144
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.440
Dr. Ogawa: Do the same thing.

145
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:41.730
Dr. Ogawa: Um, let's see. Have you noticed that you had to use more and more and more overtime.

146
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.080
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, I did.

147
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:54.510
Brandon Arrington: I can use even today like and not get high. It doesn't even it just gets me to where I'm functional My back's not killing me and

148
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.390
Brandon Arrington: I can actually just do my regular stuff.

149
00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.820
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, yeah, yeah.

150
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.740
Dr. Ogawa: All right. Sorry, I'm laughing because I'm

151
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.210
Dr. Ogawa: Enjoying your dog.

152
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.510
Brandon Arrington: Is beating him in on his neck. I don't know if you can see but they had the chain so tight. It scared him.

153
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.160
Dr. Ogawa: Oh no, what seems like he's bringing us to you.

154
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.720
Brandon Arrington: saved him.

155
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.190
Oh,

156
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.260
Dr. Ogawa: Very sweet.

157
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:35.610
Dr. Ogawa: And let's see. So it sounds like you know that you feel like you've lost control over the situation.

158
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.160
Brandon Arrington: Well, I've lost 45 pounds to

159
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.130
Dr. Ogawa: Oh wow, from just abuse and not

160
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.200
Dr. Ogawa: Being able to kind of do ever style.

161
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:52.470
Dr. Ogawa: Right and. And do you still have to use despite consequences like

162
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.300
Dr. Ogawa: Running out or getting into trouble like that.

163
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.580
Brandon Arrington: Well, I don't

164
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.810
Brandon Arrington: I can see like if I didn't have it. I would definitely be going out and getting in trouble in order to get in.

165
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.770
Brandon Arrington: The last well. Hey, quit.

166
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.430
Brandon Arrington: Oh, but I have it or I have access to it. So it hasn't been

167
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.650
Brandon Arrington: It hasn't been bad as far as committee. Cool.

168
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.720
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, okay. Hey,

169
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.230
Inside

170
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:38.880
Dr. Ogawa: And. Okay. So, when was the last time you were like sober off of opiates. Stay with us last time.

171
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.960
I'm

172
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.850
Brandon Arrington: Actually was clean. A few months ago.

173
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:59.040
Brandon Arrington: My girlfriend and I got met and she doesn't use she's a nurse, so she doesn't even drink and she's really been the one to like keep me on the straight and narrow and

174
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.610
Brandon Arrington: Continue to strive to do better.

175
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.360
Brandon Arrington: But that didn't last long.

176
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.060
Brandon Arrington: Because I'm not, I'm not dealing with

177
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.850
Brandon Arrington: Life, like I was locked up for almost 10 years straight and

178
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:26.010
Brandon Arrington: I'm not adjusting to all this very well and as an escape or excuse whatever I use

179
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:33.510
Brandon Arrington: And it's come to the point where I just need to deal with my underlying issues or it's going to keep happening.

180
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:43.320
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. And do you have anyone around you. Someone I feel like would be your support person.

181
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.460
Brandon Arrington: I do

182
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.100
But our sponsors.

183
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:59.580
Brandon Arrington: Okay. Yeah, no, I do. Um, I haven't asked him yet. But he has 30 years clean or 20 years clean

184
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.700
Brandon Arrington: He knows how it is so

185
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.400
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

186
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.130
Dr. Ogawa: Otherwise, do you feel pretty safe when you're at home.

187
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:16.440
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, yeah. I still have my grandparents. For now, and they don't use and they're positive influences

188
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.910
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, great.

189
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:26.340
Brandon Arrington: It's just when I leave here and go into town. I live in a small country town and called Corning California

190
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.870
Brandon Arrington: All it is is just basically a bunch of tweeters

191
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.000
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, so I think it probably would be good to go to a facility. It's a little bit far away.

192
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:45.240
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, at least to give me my foundation. Once I kick in every clear my head like it'll be better.

193
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:55.680
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Um, let's see. Okay. Other things do you take any other medications.

194
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.150
Brandon Arrington: No.

195
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.200
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, any medical problems that I need to know about.

196
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.340
No.

197
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.790
Dr. Ogawa: Alright and then oh surgeries. Have you had a surgery.

198
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.380
Brandon Arrington: Not lately.

199
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.610
Brandon Arrington: Surgery a spleen ectomy but that was

200
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.770
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

201
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.250
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, one of the reason I went to prison was for DUI.

202
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.680
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, I see. Okay, well I'm glad you survived a

203
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:33.030
Brandon Arrington: Lot.

204
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.150
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, good, good, good.

205
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.790
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And I saw, I think you are Barbara last time, Doctor.

206
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.600
Dr. Ogawa: Doctor talk

207
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.420
Dr. Ogawa: Is that still like a

208
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.570
Brandon Arrington: Will cover has we had a word, but I set up my garage as a barbershop.

209
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.940
Brandon Arrington: So I do a couple haircuts.

210
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.450
But

211
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.030
Brandon Arrington: Slow

212
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.320
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, well, maybe in the facility. People want some

213
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.690
Brandon Arrington: Thinking actually

214
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.430
Dr. Ogawa: Do you have any allergies to medications.

215
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.360
Dr. Ogawa: And have you ever heard of Narcan. Do you have

216
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.680
Brandon Arrington: I have heard merkin

217
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.860
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And do you know what it is.

218
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.680
Brandon Arrington: Just basically a lifesaver.

219
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:38.610
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, it is. And so I will prescribe that to you unless you already have some just. Okay. And so, you know, and I hope you never have to use it. But I want you to have it, just in case.

220
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:47.730
Dr. Ogawa: And so usually the form that will prescribe as a nasal spray and you just squirt one spray and, you know,

221
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.770
Dr. Ogawa: It's

222
00:18:49.860 --> 00:19:08.910
Dr. Ogawa: Really more for the people around you, whether it's going to be your grandparents or other people at the facility in case you have an overdose, or you take too much medication or something like that. And it basically versus Suboxone but it also reverses any opiates.

223
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:17.790
Dr. Ogawa: So they can use it on you. You can use it on someone, if someone accidentally gets in your medications or something like that.

224
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.920
Dr. Ogawa: You think you can

225
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.900
Brandon Arrington: Ask her offer

226
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:31.230
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, yeah, yeah. I think it's really easy if you can teach other people how to use it or let them know to use it on that would be good.

227
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.290
Brandon Arrington: Yeah. Awesome. Whenever I get it.

228
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:46.350
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, yeah. And it's super easy. The instructions will be right on there. Um, alright, so I think that's most of the questions I have

229
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.780
Brandon Arrington: Any questions for me.

230
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.890
Brandon Arrington: Hey guys, sorry.

231
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.550
Brandon Arrington: Okay, oh inside

232
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.620
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, I'm in a meeting right now you go around back and

233
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.340
Brandon Arrington: You're talking to me. I just said, I'm in a fucking meeting. Excuse me.

234
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.040
Brandon Arrington: Come on around

235
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:19.110
Brandon Arrington: Can you hear me all right. Sorry about that. My neighbor was coming over here and he doesn't know that I'm in a meeting with my doctor

236
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.870
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, I'm still here.

237
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.400
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. Um, yeah. Do you have any questions.

238
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:28.800
Brandon Arrington: No.

239
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.020
Brandon Arrington: Oh, we're under my groups with

240
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.040
Brandon Arrington: When we started group.

241
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:44.850
Dr. Ogawa: That I don't know. Um, I'll ask, and I also need to just, uh, probably fun one or two weeks worth what after we hang up but left to get back to on

242
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:53.940
Dr. Ogawa: You know how many we can give you at once. And oh, what's the name of the facility, you're going to do you happen to know

243
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.330
Brandon Arrington: Visions in Redding, California.

244
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.450
Dr. Ogawa: Already. Okay. And because maybe they'll have to talk to them or something like that.

245
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:04.740
Dr. Ogawa: He's

246
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.280
Brandon Arrington: His name's Toby and I could give you this number, actually, if you wanted to.

247
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:10.980
Dr. Ogawa: Write it down.

248
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.710
Brandon Arrington: Toby's number is

249
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.940
Brandon Arrington: 530-917-3811

250
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:51.990
Dr. Ogawa: Right, just in case and and then yeah I think can or maybe our Jane will let you know about when your groups and your counseling is going to be and

251
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.630
Dr. Ogawa: I think, you know, I know you've kind of gone through it before, but let me just

252
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.930
Dr. Ogawa: Run through the induction medication, start with you, real quick, just in case.

253
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:16.590
Dr. Ogawa: I guess you're a little different because we're going to start you right off the bat with eight milligrams, but so say you think that tonight's going to be your last use

254
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.680
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, I will. Yeah.

255
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.630
Brandon Arrington: I mean, we can just get them.

256
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.490
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

257
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:33.270
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, so I would say tomorrow morning would be the soonest time, you can start 12 hours since your last views.

258
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:43.260
Dr. Ogawa: And that's actually good when people stop at the at night, and then they can no sleep through their withdrawal period and then kind of be ready in the morning.

259
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:52.020
Dr. Ogawa: If you want to move it to a Saturday night, AND THEN SUNDAY MORNING. That's fine. Or if you want to stretch it out. That's fine.

260
00:22:53.010 --> 00:23:09.630
Dr. Ogawa: But it should be at least 12 hours before and after your last use, you should be feeling a good amount of withdrawals. At least, I would say like at least three things, if not more like runny nose, shake shakes by RIA

261
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:18.930
Dr. Ogawa: Your eyes might be watering might just feel really achy should have at least three things that are going for you.

262
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:32.550
Dr. Ogawa: And then when you take your first dose, you should start feeling better, because it's going to calm that down. If you feel worse than that's probably a sign that you took it too soon.

263
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:49.350
Dr. Ogawa: And then once you start that you can see is that enough that first eight milligram and kind of wait it out for like 123 hours or longer if you want to, to see sad enough

264
00:23:50.070 --> 00:24:10.020
Dr. Ogawa: If it's not, you're still feeling too much withdrawals. Then take another one. So that's two. Okay. And then same thing. Wait, again for another 123 hours and let's kind of the time it takes for your body to process that too. So rested now and then, again, it's

265
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.020
Dr. Ogawa: Well,

266
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:23.790
Dr. Ogawa: Be careful if you if you end up thinking about keeping the third one. That's usually more than most people for the first day.

267
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.420
Dr. Ogawa: But I think that was your dose in the past.

268
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:37.260
Brandon Arrington: Yeah, I do more drugs than most people do. And I'm not glorifying. It was three I've, I've taken four in a day or

269
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:46.020
Brandon Arrington: Two don't feel that, and I know it when I have a runny nose, but I sneeze. When I don't use like

270
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:47.820
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah.

271
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.220
Brandon Arrington: So, yeah.

272
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.070
Brandon Arrington: I really don't think three is gonna

273
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.840
Dr. Ogawa: It'll be a problem.

274
00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:10.680
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah hopefully not and hopefully it'll be the right dose for you but you know it's one more time. Again, your body's a little different this time to so you can see, just be careful give enough time between that those doses.

275
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.480
Dr. Ogawa: And then that'll be like your new jokes, whatever it is.

276
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.150
Dr. Ogawa: And then we'll just continue that every day.

277
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.160
Dr. Ogawa: And

278
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.980
Dr. Ogawa: Usually

279
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.690
Dr. Ogawa: I like to follow up with you.

280
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:38.970
Dr. Ogawa: Should we try to make an appointment, like Sunday or something like that.

281
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:46.290
Dr. Ogawa: Saturday or Sunday with that. I'm not sure how it works out. If you're going to the detox.

282
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.670
Brandon Arrington: Well,

283
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:56.730
Brandon Arrington: Sunday. If you wanted to do it after I get to the detox or if you wanted to do it before I go, probably after right

284
00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.100
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, doesn't matter.

285
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.330
Brandon Arrington: Okay, can we, what's your time. What's your availability.

286
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.360
Dr. Ogawa: And Sunday.

287
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.780
Dr. Ogawa: I think I can do it anytime like mid day like 10 to do

288
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.640
Brandon Arrington: Tend to

289
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:16.620
Brandon Arrington: Do

290
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.990
Brandon Arrington: Well, because I have to be there before three

291
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:26.760
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

292
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.300
Brandon Arrington: So that's gonna

293
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.290
Brandon Arrington: That's gonna put us to where I won't be there yet.

294
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.970
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, yeah. And so maybe we can do by

295
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:52.470
Dr. Ogawa: 10:10am yeah and then I'll have can let you give you a call to like confirm. So if you need to change it. That's time to

296
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.910
Dr. Ogawa: And just so we can make sure you're doing okay before

297
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:04.230
Dr. Ogawa: You go and between now and when you're withdrawing and hopefully you're doing better. By the time. We'll see you

298
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.240
Brandon Arrington: Sure they're gonna let me use he said that the blackout.

299
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.100
Brandon Arrington: They'll make an exception, I can use my phone for zoom meetings or for

300
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.640
Brandon Arrington: So if you guys talk to Toby.

301
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.910
Brandon Arrington: Or when you talk to Toby, if you could just

302
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.880
Brandon Arrington: See our meetings or once a week.

303
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:35.250
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. Yeah, and that's fine. And yeah, let's let's try to figure it out and

304
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.770
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Oh.

305
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:48.990
Dr. Ogawa: I'm the tablets. You already taken it. So you already know, probably, but you gotta put them under your tongue, and they have to sit there until they dissolve is

306
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.110
Brandon Arrington: There any way I could do this bill.

307
00:27:53.070 --> 00:28:08.490
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. And oh, you got the film's last time. Yeah. We can try for the tablets, and I think it really just depends on what your insurance approves but I can try for the tablets, and then they might switch it to a film.

308
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:18.330
Dr. Ogawa: And yeah, but either way under the tongue. Don't swallow it, because then you're not going to get enough of the medication.

309
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:33.420
Dr. Ogawa: It works better if it goes through your saliva and then also if you crush it more for the tablet, but that part of it. That's not active the Norwalk, so

310
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.920
Dr. Ogawa: And that's going to reverse all the opiates. So you're going to feel bad.

311
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:51.240
Dr. Ogawa: So that's another reason why you should just put it on your tongue and let it dissolve because it will work at the good part will work best. That way in the bad part that's not going to make you feel good and won't really be acted out

312
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.740
Dr. Ogawa: Oh yeah. Okay. Um, but yeah, I think you know all this. But any other questions.

313
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.380
Brandon Arrington: No, that's it.

314
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:16.800
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, so, um, yeah, let me just, I'm not sure about a couple things. So, um, I don't know. Anybody's working right now. But let me just follow up on a couple of things. Okay, and then we'll try to touch base on Sunday.
