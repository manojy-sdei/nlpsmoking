Alyse: Yeah, they're gonna sit there and scratch each other and try to eat each other for a minute.

36
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.230
Alyse: And then I'll walk out the room and somebody will be screaming because there'll be at the footer themselves over to their stomach.

Alyse: Like roll around the house now like they can roll.

38
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.400
Richelle Direny: So what's going on at least

39
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yeah, I heard you. You're moving what's going on.

40
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.870
Alyse: Yeah, we don't you

41
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
Alyse: Don't you know the normal, but no, I'm on Suboxone that's what the problem is. That's

42
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.270
All

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.560
Alyse: Right.

44
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.890
Richelle Direny: Okay, so how their babies.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.860
Alyse: Bother me five months on the 14

46
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.160
Richelle Direny: Okay, so five months ago, we know we've been on Suboxone

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.130
Richelle Direny: So what's now what's the new development.

48
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.840
Alyse: I mean, it has always been an ongoing thing. It just gets shoved under the rug, a little bit. She saw you know peace and and be like, Yeah, I'm going to get all them soon.

49
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:14.340
Alyse: I'm just like, to me, it's like, Why should I have to put myself an unstable situation and an unstable situation to make you happy. I rather not. So, therefore,

50
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.160
Alyse: I'm just fine. Like, this is what I think. No, I don't plan on being on them. The rest of my life. But if I happen to be

51
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.280
Alyse: With you just texted me. He just text me

52
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.110
Alyse: Do you have everything ready for tomorrow.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.220
Richelle Direny: When he was happening tomorrow, your

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.840
Alyse: Timer. Yeah.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.930
Richelle Direny: What do you mean, if you haven't been

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.490
Alyse: Ready for all my shit around here, like all my stuff. He knows I don't have all my stuff packed up yet.

57
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.590
Richelle Direny: So I don't understand. So you guys came to a mutual agreement for you to move. I

58
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.290
Alyse: Know you just don't want me to fuck here. I mean, oh sorry, you just don't want to hear anymore. And because

59
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.610
Richelle Direny: He wants you to move out.

60
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.680
Alyse: Yeah, he wants, he gone. He's already talking started talking to somebody else for shell. Like, that's where it's like the disgusting partly that's why I won't even mess with them no more.

61
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.840
Alyse: Like saying

62
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.530
Alyse: Like you cross the line like there's no more.

63
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.310
Richelle Direny: So he's helping you about is that what's going on.

64
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:27.840
Alyse: I mean, you know, for him. It's helped move out as, Oh, I'll get you an apartment, but then yet. You'll be my in house babysitter. When I want to drop my kids off, but I want to go, you know, screw somebody

65
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.680
Richelle Direny: within the boundaries, you have to set boundaries.

66
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.960
Alyse: With all my boundary is I don't want shift from me.

67
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:46.560
Alyse: Like what I wanted was this nice little life you know and like, and now, not only do my daughter's get their power taken away from them. But now, not, not that i don't i

68
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.510
Alyse: Don't mind working, but I've been with these girls are day for four months, you don't. I mean, like, you like I'm panicking. My brain that I'm not going to be able to be with them all time now.

69
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.600
Richelle Direny: What do you mean be with who my

70
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.430
Alyse: Girls, you know, like

71
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.360
Alyse: We're leaving.

72
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.020
Richelle Direny: You're leaving him with them. I mean, you're leaving them with him.

73
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.850
Alyse: No, no, no, I'm just gonna have to start working, which I that's not the problem. I don't care about working. I just care about not being able to be around my daughter's all time now.

74
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.800
Richelle Direny: Oh, you're saying that you're gonna once you start working. You're going to have to put them in daycare and just kind of that life now.

75
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.020
Alyse: And it's just like

76
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.530
Richelle Direny: So it's just the three of you just the four of you moving out.

77
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.340
Yep.

78
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.120
Richelle Direny: So how is Xavier dealing with that.

79
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.070
Alyse: He doesn't seem to really care too much ELYSEE doesn't act like he does, he probably knows

80
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.510
Alyse: Yeah.

81
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.120
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like a norm for him.

82
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.400
Alyse: It's

83
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.100
Richelle Direny: So you're probably going to have a little bit more acting out a little bit more challenges where that's concerned.

84
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.960
Alyse: Yeah, I'm sure.

85
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.580
Alyse: But

86
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.270
Richelle Direny: I want to go through the sequence of events because my thing is from the from our from the history. This happened prior to you having the girls.

87
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:16.410
Richelle Direny: When you were pregnant and you had to move back in with your mom and then you move back in. Shortly after, because it wasn't very long that you were out and he moved you back in. So I mean it's not

88
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.710
Richelle Direny: Run out running run out running so

89
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:33.630
Alyse: Yeah, yeah. And my problem is, he started talking somebody like to me like I can do what you're going out to the bars anything or cheater like he's like you always accuse me. I said the I'm gonna accuse you of shit when you

90
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:45.990
Alyse: Get drunk and leave and go to a bar and look at women because that's what you say you do like why would I not accuse you of things like this. Like, don't tell, I gotta go. Squirrel, it's not

91
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.960
Richelle Direny: It's not an acute. It's not an accusation. If it's a fact accusation is meaning that

92
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.590
Richelle Direny: You believe that this is what's happening. You think that this is what's happening.

93
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.540
Richelle Direny: If it's actually happening. It's no longer an accusation. It is

94
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.170
Richelle Direny: A reality or facts, if that's what

95
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:15.300
Alyse: For him for him. It's an accusation because he doesn't do it but i mean you are giving me the proof to say that this is what you're doing. You know what I mean.

96
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.090
Alyse: Um, I don't know, like

97
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.430
Alyse: What is it, it's been

98
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:35.790
Alyse: Like so. Over the weekend, I finally I finally got out of him. Friday. He didn't know that his Google like maps was still connected. So the computer. So I jumped on there and he was at a place where his ex girlfriend used to work.

99
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:45.600
Alyse: So when I messaged him about it. He's like, Oh no, the guy that works for me moved over here. I came to bring him his check

100
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:57.600
Alyse: I'm like, okay, like the way it rolled off his tongue Rochelle was so flawlessly. And then the dude showed up at the house Saturday morning for his check

101
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.500
Alyse: So then I finally got it out of him that day is, again, I'm talking to somebody, knowing my have a mess around with her, blah, blah, blah. I'm just talking to her.

102
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:19.140
Alyse: So that's fine. I will leave on my terms when I want to leave because I'm not rushing for anybody. Especially not that, you know, the fact that I really have nowhere to go. I mean,

103
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.090
Alyse: I'm not going to. I'm just not going to go stay at my mom's house. It's just not. It's not a no. I'm not staying at my mother's house.

104
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:28.860
Alyse: So,

105
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.250
Richelle Direny: Is it because it's because of

106
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.590
Richelle Direny: What does she live on housing or something.

107
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:46.380
Alyse: No, no. Just she rents and they'll raise her rent and it's small already and they're all miserable as people over there anyways. So why do I want to put I'm miserable self and even more misery, like I normally do.

108
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:59.040
Richelle Direny: So what about you remember when you were saying over there and we have this long conversation because you had what was it something like something like a healthy mothers or something that case worker that was supposed to meet with you.

109
00:08:59.580 --> 00:08:59.970
Richelle Direny: And I have

110
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.290
Alyse: Said to you I don't you bring up the

111
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.980
Richelle Direny: Conversation with her about trying to help you get your own place.

112
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.180
Yeah.

113
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:16.590
Alyse: Yeah, yeah. So you know all that all that stuff goes out the window and I knew back end because, don't you know i think i'm something special and I'll be around here forever.

114
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:31.440
Alyse: So, I mean, I talked to her yesterday. Like there's there's nothing they anybody's really going to do for me unless I go to a shelter and I'm not, please, please.

115
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:42.270
Alyse: Like if I had to, if that was my last my absolute last place to go. And we were living under a bridge. I wouldn't go to a shelter. I mean, I don't know how shelters are in

116
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:53.940
Alyse: Florida, the ones up here, not so great. I mean, I'm sure they're not so great in general but like they're just really nice and environment. I'd my myself in or my girls with being in recovery.

117
00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:00.960
Alyse: With being it's just like, it's like prison but you're allowed to walk in and out, you don't. I mean, that's what they're like around here.

118
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.550
Alyse: So,

119
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.900
Alyse: And I hate saying that because I sound like I'm some like

120
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:22.170
Alyse: Better than person. And that's not, it's just like, I'm not going to have my shift. So I walked into a shelter with the stuff I have. And they looked at me like all fresh me like, you know what I mean that they're just roofless around here. That's just the truth so

121
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.170
Alyse: Um,

122
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:35.520
Alyse: Yeah, basically like only way to get like housing as it started through like going through a shelter, you'd have to get like a homeless letter. You know what I mean.

123
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.090
Alyse: Froze

124
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.770
Richelle Direny: Yeah, hello.

125
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.400
Richelle Direny: Ya know it kicked me off the internet, just, I don't know what happened.

126
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.540
Yeah.

127
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.510
Richelle Direny: It keeps me off the internet only on

128
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.580
Richelle Direny: But everything else.

129
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.070
Richelle Direny: Sorry about that.

130
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:55.230
Alyse: Yeah, it's okay because when you would if I would have known to kick you off. He called me, I just realized he he asked me if I have everything ready for the bank tomorrow.

131
00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:07.740
Alyse: Because so they're doing the stimulus package you know where whatever and, like, make sure you have everything ready for the bank, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So

132
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.820
Richelle Direny: So this is what, this is what i and i because I want you to

133
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.500
Alyse: Not

134
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.390
Richelle Direny: Be, how can I put it

135
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.960
Richelle Direny: Because we've been meeting for a while now and being fully aware

136
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.600
Alyse: Of everything that's going on.

137
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:38.820
Richelle Direny: You have to put yourself in a position that you're not running in and out, because it's not just you by yourself. You're running in and out with now three kids before it was just with your son.

138
00:12:39.270 --> 00:13:00.120
Richelle Direny: And that's not it's of course it's not good for the kids, but for you emotionally and mentally and everything else it's not healthy. It really isn't healthy. So at some point if you decide this time that you're walking out and you're moving out that

139
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.720
Richelle Direny: You're not a month later running back in

140
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:16.050
Alyse: Yeah, and and that's my problem. Like, I don't want to leave I it wasn't my choice to be like, oh, here, let's blow up this big ass fight and do all this stuff and

141
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:24.570
Alyse: All and whatever, like I'm that wasn't my plan. Now this is his and then when he wants to play his mental games again.

142
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.740
Alyse: And then

143
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.150
Richelle Direny: Fall in that trap.

144
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:41.100
Richelle Direny: Because what did they say the best predictor of the future is past occurrences or situations or whatever. So you have to stand on your, you have to stand your ground and say what you are

145
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:50.400
Richelle Direny: And what's acceptable and what's don't know there are certain things that we have no control over. And I'm not saying to work hard to gain control over.

146
00:13:50.880 --> 00:14:10.440
Richelle Direny: What you have what you Elise have control over is what you will accept and what you won't. And that's what you have complete and total control over because this is what I can see happening which which based on our time together, what has happened in the past, is that

147
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:18.000
Richelle Direny: You are tired of the games. The, the, the, the infidelity.

148
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:29.730
Richelle Direny: And you know, when he is in a place where emotionally. He's unstable and whether he's out drinking or having fun or doing him.

149
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:42.390
Richelle Direny: Your home dealing with not just your biological children, but all the children together when you're home tending to the home and doing everything and kind of keeping this whole life up and then

150
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:49.950
Richelle Direny: You have this whole blown out argument then you walk out. Then he realizes oh I can't function.

151
00:14:50.460 --> 00:15:07.230
Richelle Direny: I can't function without her. I need her back then he comes up and he says, What was me. This is how I was feeling this is what was going on and the tears start coming and the melodrama comes and then it melt your heart. Then you school back up everything and you come back home.

152
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.450
Richelle Direny: Then it all happens again and then you scoop up everything and you leave.

153
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.340
Richelle Direny: You have to come to a place and you both have to be clear. If you whatever time you decide to walk out.

154
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:28.830
Richelle Direny: You're deciding, we're going to co parent, but I'm not going to come back. Once you decide

155
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.570
That

156
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.330
Richelle Direny: I don't want anybody else but you and then you're saying come back in.

157
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:43.500
Richelle Direny: Because really, why you're seeing come back in, is because you realize this is too much for me to handle by myself.

158
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.240
Alyse: I really look back in my life.

159
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.050
Richelle Direny: Because this is what happened the last time.

160
00:15:50.370 --> 00:16:03.810
Alyse: Yeah. And now, but my problem is like I walk out like I really feel like no matter how rough it gets. If I walk out that door tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, I won't walk back in because now

161
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:13.110
Alyse: Now you've made it about these two, you don't mean like meaning favorable deal, unfortunately, that's what I like, I don't mean to say like that way about a savior, but

162
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.780
Alyse: You don't really care about heroes all like that. Anyway, so whatever

163
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.790
Alyse: But it's

164
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:27.630
Richelle Direny: But, but that's exactly what I'm saying if you decide to take your time, get a job, save up enough money to move out.

165
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.340
Richelle Direny: At least for now.

166
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.340
Richelle Direny: There is no coming back because this whole back and forth back

167
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.570
Richelle Direny: And forth

168
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.850
Alyse: You have to start

169
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.880
Richelle Direny: Thinking about you, Elise and what makes the least happy.

170
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.240
Alyse: Were shot. He's calling me

171
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.990
Alyse: Can you hear me. Hold on, hold on.

172
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.960
Alyse: Sorry.

173
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:00.780
Alyse: Yeah.

174
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:12.720
Alyse: That's, you know, when I don't call him right obviously because I'm busy doing something, but that doesn't matter. He's only worried about money.

175
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:23.070
Alyse: Stimulus package, who cares about your stimulus package you're going to get. Oh damn money. Please be a crook. Sorry.

176
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.560
Alyse: Well, this is like

177
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.260
Alyse: You know, if you biotech is with a bit

178
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:38.850
Alyse: This was not something to do with some type of business or something, I don't know. It's stupid. He's having me do. Should I know nothing about that I

179
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.660
Alyse: I don't know, but

180
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.440
Alyse: I

181
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.450
Alyse: See, now we get to this point where I'm like this horrible person and feel like

182
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.930
Alyse: My children are never going to be around any horror that he brings around. So I just, you know, like

183
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:07.290
Alyse: There's just so much drama in my life right now because I'm just one of those people like I'm be damned if my child like your kids had no choice, because you can't be a dad and mom.

184
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:19.230
Alyse: Or you can't be a much of anything and their moms, you know, a piece of crap. So, whatever, but I'm not a piece of shit and my girls are not going to be around some random Harold horror for the week.

185
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:31.560
Alyse: Like it's just this is just where it starts to get the ugly like this. Is it just that ugly point it is what it is. I won't accept it from him because you're not going to use it over me, or tell me what I can do this or that.

186
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.020
Alyse: Dude, here this thing she's a mess.

187
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:56.820
Alyse: And it just sucks like whatever, whatever. I mean, I say I'm moving on tomorrow, but in all reality. I really don't want to move out until I'm able to get a job because I'm not going to get stuck in this predicament, nor are you going to give me any money and

188
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.500
Alyse: Whatever. And this is just

189
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.480
Richelle Direny: So if you

190
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.260
Richelle Direny: Let's say if you get a job tomorrow. Let's just, for argument's sake, you get a job tomorrow.

191
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.810
Richelle Direny: Where the girl is going to be

192
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.620
Alyse: Probably with my mother. Okay, so

193
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.090
Richelle Direny: Because before you make a move, you need to make you need to plan.

194
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.970
Richelle Direny: And that's what that's what, that's where

195
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:35.190
Richelle Direny: I would like to have our conversation move forward to what is your plan and it has to be a solid effective functional authentic plan.

196
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:44.250
Richelle Direny: That, you know, so even if it means if he's not saying you have to leave right now. Technically, I mean, you can't. What are you going to put me out with the children.

197
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:54.000
Richelle Direny: On the side of the road. And if that's not what's happening if it means that, okay, well we're cohabitation for now until you can

198
00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:10.950
Richelle Direny: First, find work because you need income to be able to maintain if it means that you need assistance with that you call up your caseworker and you let her know this is kind of where I am, this is what's going on. This is where I am. Is there any assistance.

199
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:28.770
Richelle Direny: Within the county that you live in where you live. Is there assistance and can you apply for housing, whatever it is that they have there in that part of Ohio that you're living in and they provide you with that assistance.

200
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.810
Richelle Direny: Um,

201
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.030
Richelle Direny: To find how to get housing. So if it's going to take you, let's say,

202
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:44.160
Richelle Direny: A month you're making him aware that okay you know it's going to take a month. So you're going to cohabitate there.

203
00:21:44.610 --> 00:22:00.450
Richelle Direny: At least you know that's being worked on, you're actively looking for a job. The conversation is your mom is going is helping us going to assist you with the children in terms of childcare until you can afford or get some type of financial assistance for them to be in daycare.

204
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.530
Richelle Direny: You know you're having. If you're having a plan.

205
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.420
Richelle Direny: Do you have your own people.

206
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.770
Richelle Direny: To get back and force them to

207
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.870
Richelle Direny: go wherever you need to know.

208
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:28.260
Richelle Direny: So you have to have a plan. Because what you're working on is to be independent, that's ultimately what you're doing is working on some independence. Now whether or not you decide, both of you decide to reconcile and work on the relationship you still need to learn independence.

209
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.920
Alyse: Yeah, and that's my problem.

210
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.700
Richelle Direny: Because you're constantly completely dependent upon him.

211
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.140
Alyse: Yeah, and he loves it. He loves every bit of it. It's like a game.

212
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.770
Alyse: I mean, I started school on seven foot school has nothing to do with anything like that's really not going to give me

213
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.880
Richelle Direny: everything to do with it. It's a part of the plan. It's a part of the bigger picture.

214
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.890
Alyse: Premium plans. We don't work out. I don't know how I don't plan. Very well. Never have.

215
00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.700
Obviously,

216
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.460
Alyse: I mean, I know this is things I need but it's like I'm not going to sit in the House, while you go out

217
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:13.980
Alyse: And hor in party and drink. Well, I'm stuck here in the same house that I've been in for months and months and months.

218
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.190
Alyse: If, then, you think I'm a watch your kids to

219
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.500
Alyse: This is why, you know what I mean all weekend I said here by myself.

220
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.950
Alyse: While he was out of a hotel parties, while he was out drinking while he was out screw and whoever, it's just like

221
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:41.310
Alyse: There's only so much I can mentally take before I blow and I blow that I broke the window. Not on purpose because I want to purposely broke it, because I knew I wouldn't hurt my thoughts.

222
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.420
Richelle Direny: Because the question is what is your, your focus

223
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.210
Alyse: My focus is anger. I don't know. I'm just straight angry. I'm just angry. I'm

224
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, so when you're angry. What does that do for you.

225
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.880
Alyse: Where does that mean by going to rage.

226
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.630
Richelle Direny: How productive. Are you when you're angry.

227
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.590
Alyse: Oh, so does not matter. Exactly. So

228
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.970
Richelle Direny: Again, I asked the question.

229
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.200
Richelle Direny: What is your real goal.

230
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.140
Alyse: With a real. I mean, I really need like like

231
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:24.210
Alyse: There is no okay this is always going to be a thing, it's always going to be this is going to happen. It'll be bad for a while. Get good

232
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:37.890
Alyse: It'll do that or we go our separate ways. You know what I mean. So instead of keep on playing a head game I really just need to, like you said, make a plan, try to figure out how to get a job right now, even though nobody other than really Walmart's how your a

233
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.200
Richelle Direny: Game they pay money.

234
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.850
Alyse: I'm not saying that I'm not

235
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.470
Richelle Direny: Gonna know I know none. And I know

236
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.270
Richelle Direny: When I it's because

237
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.340
Richelle Direny: I hear you speak. You saying

238
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.620
Alyse: It was negative. And I'm like, in that name, it's not

239
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.700
Richelle Direny: Even so much negative you're convincing yourself you're trying to convince yourself.

240
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.930
Alyse: Of what it is that you need to

241
00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:06.780
Richelle Direny: Do, but I would like you to to get to that place where you focus on Elise and what is best for Elise is ultimately going to be best for your children as well.

242
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:23.460
Richelle Direny: So if what's best for Elise is to learn to be independence is to learn to pretty much be independent of any everyone around you. I'm not saying that you're not gonna, you're not going to need Harrell. You're not going to need your mom and dad.

243
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.020
Richelle Direny: You're not going to need your sister.

244
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.150
Alyse: Your sister everyone

245
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.040
Richelle Direny: But Elise has to learn

246
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:42.840
Alyse: I know and that's the thing. Like, I don't, I don't know if I've ever really been independent like I've always had somebody there to have Kellen honor depend on

247
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:53.670
Alyse: For a long time, a long time so it's like I guess maybe that first step towards it real independence is what's scary because I don't know how to

248
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.650
Alyse: I don't

249
00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:05.820
Alyse: I don't know how to do it on my own. I never have me doing it on my own led me to getting high. I feel like, like if I think about it in real life.

250
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.320
Alyse: Like, that's where it takes me like just that the failure. The whole everything and boom right back where I was.

251
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.730
Richelle Direny: So is that your truth. Are you afraid of

252
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.230
Alyse: Yeah, I'm afraid that's my

253
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.150
Alyse: That's my heart that I

254
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:22.710
Alyse: Can't do

255
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.340
Richelle Direny: Anything until you first come to accept that.

256
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:34.350
Richelle Direny: You're afraid. It's like, I'm afraid. Yeah, you are we afraid of, I'm afraid of snakes.

257
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.170
Alyse: Florida.

258
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.310
Alyse: Girl by

259
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:44.460
Richelle Direny: I know I listen, I don't like a gwan is and I got like 100 of them out my back door know

260
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.480
Alyse: We have to take a trip out your back door. One day because I need to play.

261
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.350
Richelle Direny: I will, I will take you on a trip out the back door so you can see

262
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.960
Richelle Direny: These little baby alligator monkey on

263
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.950
Richelle Direny: Baby alligators. Okay.

264
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.450
Alyse: So she has a little

265
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.680
Richelle Direny: ridges of things that Sam.

266
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.930
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yes. Yeah.

267
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:17.640
Alyse: You know, growing up. One of my good friends. They had one, and he would sit on the back of the couch, literally, like his body, it would be from like here to here and then the rest of this was his whole tail.

268
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.970
Alyse: And he would know if you were coming by, we feed them dog food like Bill jack treats if he would

269
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.030
Alyse: With you and that sound of that tail in the air. Oh my gosh, and try and tell you

270
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:36.540
Richelle Direny: But see, I've accepted and I've acknowledged, so I know like at a time like now I'm not trying to go outside.

271
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.240
Richelle Direny: I know I know when I could do things and I can. I'm in control of it. You see, I'm trying to tell you so.

272
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you have to acknowledge because

273
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.890
Richelle Direny: behind everything of you saying, or I'm not taking care of kids, and I'm not doing that if he thinks that he wants to go do this and this and that.

274
00:27:53.370 --> 00:28:12.480
Richelle Direny: All of that is your fear of having to live, independent of him that's taking the best of you. And when we're fearful in life we make unwise decision. It's kind of like right now we're we're fearful of what this coronavirus can, if we can catch it and what

275
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.860
Richelle Direny: And so because we're so

276
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:20.400
Richelle Direny: Fearful we do unwise things you go buy 100 bucks of toilet paper is now you know good well you'll need that much.

277
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.800
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you go about

278
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.870
Richelle Direny: Artist alcohol that is called hand sanitizer. What you need so much alcohol for

279
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.250
Richelle Direny: What you're going to

280
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.540
Alyse: Soap and water.

281
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.770
Richelle Direny: You got it in your house.

282
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.690
Alyse: free flowing water and soap.

283
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:53.820
Richelle Direny: Soap only cost about $2 use it you soon as that but because of our fear we run and we buy we go and we get all these things because we're so fearful, we don't realize that we're weakening our immune system simply because of the mental anguish, we put ourselves in.

284
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.940
Alyse: Do you understand that that is what

285
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:17.520
Alyse: I've been saying for two days now like I'm going to end up in the hospital like half dead with Corona because it'll be me that does it. It'll be me all me right about now because of how stress. I am like, mentally, emotionally, like drained everything like sore throat last night, girl.

286
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.970
Alyse: scare the hell out of me.

287
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:26.520
Richelle Direny: So then you have this little tickle in your throne, then you're like, Oh, that's wonderful.

288
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.560
Richelle Direny: That's a sign.

289
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:45.900
Richelle Direny: Now all of a sudden you don't got all the signs and you go to the doctor and the doctor said girl back. You don't got nothing. I'm telling I'm at night. I'm like 100 degrees. What is your AC on

290
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:53.970
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, I don't let it go past 90 I mean come on now, or you just took a hot shower. Do you think that's maybe the reason why your skin is hot.

291
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.460
Richelle Direny: Like I remember because I told you.

292
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:07.770
Richelle Direny: I had a second job. This was the funniest thing they were testing people, but because the, the nurses and everybody who was testing or the staff that was testing the people because that was one of the things you had to do was, you take their temperature

293
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:24.120
Richelle Direny: They're like, Oh, there's a scan and I'm like, So, me being silly. I was like, What you mean a scare. Oh, somebody came in here and their temperature was high on knowingly I just just said, Why did you take his temperature when he just came out as a hot boiling, son. Well, yeah.

294
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.490
Alyse: A

295
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.360
Alyse: Look series. Yeah, I know what you mean. But it's like

296
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.280
Richelle Direny: Somebody temperature

297
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.890
Richelle Direny: Their temperature is over 100 and something degrees.

298
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:56.010
Richelle Direny: They just walked out of the hot boiling some because they were running around. So, because of this because of fear. We do things that are not wise. And that is the reality of what's going on with you because you fear what life is going to be like under the covering in which you are in

299
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.380
Richelle Direny: She's calling you again.

300
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.420
Alyse: No, no, no, no. The baby flipped over.

301
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.520
Alyse: Look at it. Okay, because

302
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:22.380
Richelle Direny: You're so fearful because of the covering that you're you're under even though emotionally is depleting everything in you. You are so it's almost like you're able to function in the dysfunction.

303
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:24.750
Alyse: Yeah, you're okay with

304
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.390
Richelle Direny: The fear of now going

305
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.040
Richelle Direny: Out there and finding dealing with life alone.

306
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.490
Alyse: It's like, you don't want to have to face that

307
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.170
Richelle Direny: So then what do you do

308
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.670
Richelle Direny: You just focus on

309
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.180
Richelle Direny: All of the things that are causing you so much mental

310
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.620
Alyse: anguish and emotional

311
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.560
Alyse: Yeah, I got it right, yet again, Rochelle.

312
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.730
Alyse: So thanks for, let me know. I live in acting the way I've been asking

313
00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:00.690
Alyse: Because like even my moms like even though I was like a leaf like. Give it a break like no sooner. He says something like

314
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:11.430
Alyse: And my moms like, dude, you're 13 years old, like, shut up and sit down or like you need to figure out what you're going to do like my debts, it just 22

315
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:21.120
Alyse: I knew that's what it was. But no, I don't want to admit to it. I'm sure you know what I mean like I had gone through this road before and it was hard enough by myself.

316
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:36.090
Alyse: With Xavier. Now I have two little babies. So what the hell do you think I expect like I don't know what to expect. I don't want to expect anything I want to sit my ass where I am and live my life but I'm some awful horrible person because I'm on Suboxone

317
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.730
Richelle Direny: It's not about this, so it's

318
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.670
Richelle Direny: For him, it's not even so much about the Suboxone

319
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.320
Alyse: It's okay. He doesn't have control.

320
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.760
Richelle Direny: But it's a clutch at the end of the day it's a clutch. It's

321
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.500
Richelle Direny: Because remember, in the past, we've talked about, if I'm abusing

322
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.340
Alcohol.

323
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.430
Richelle Direny: I don't want to admit it. I don't want to deal with the fact that I've used

324
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.990
Alyse: Alcohol and I'm depending on

325
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.430
Alyse: Alcohol to get me through

326
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.560
Richelle Direny: My stressors. So guess what

327
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.410
Richelle Direny: At least you over here taking

328
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.220
Alyse: Suboxone

329
00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:21.090
Richelle Direny: Let's focus on that. Let's talk about that. Because guess what if I point a finger. All I'm looking at is the fingers, the finger that's been pointed at you. I'm not paying attention. There's three

330
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.140
Alyse: pointing back at me.

331
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.870
Alyse: A

332
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.570
Alyse: Bad because that was like me that my whole pregnancy like bitching about his drinking

333
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.340
Richelle Direny: But then

334
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:48.990
Richelle Direny: Now you faced your truth which is now he's fully aware of it. So now he's reversing it but when it's all said and done, it's not so much about the Suboxone. It's a way for him to justify his unhealthy.

335
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.880
Alyse: Action in the things that he's doing.

336
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.600
Alyse: I'm gonna have to use that on him.

337
00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.210
Richelle Direny: It's not a matter of using it on him. You need to build your own character, you need to build

338
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.040
Richelle Direny: You need to start your journey.

339
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.960
Richelle Direny: And that journey.

340
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.470
Alyse: Is

341
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.590
Richelle Direny: What is, what is it that at least once.

342
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.060
Richelle Direny: What is happiness for at least what is happiness for at least what does

343
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:22.500
Alyse: He know and that's that's the thing, like I've lot like yet again and like I've lost myself through this all i don't know what makes me happy. I don't know what

344
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:33.750
Alyse: I mean literally just to be able to do what I want to do when I want to do it. Like that's as simple as it takes like if I want to go see my cousin on 117 I will

345
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:43.590
Alyse: Because prior to this, or knows if I go walk through my guardian cards or her house. It's some big deal or the people I hang around like you know i mean

346
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:50.460
Alyse: If you really understood what was what my life was like in this House, you'd understand why I like trip, the way I do about certain things.

347
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:59.160
Alyse: It's just I don't want somebody to tell me when and like if I want to go jump off the top. I was. That's what I want to do. I don't want somebody to tell me

348
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.250
Richelle Direny: Giving them the power stop giving them the power

349
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.300
Even if

350
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.510
Alyse: I give them the power because I'm always dependent

351
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.480
Alyse: Because I haven't really goes back my fear.

352
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:20.280
Richelle Direny: It goes back to your fear and anxiety of what life is like. So here it is. I um, I found this little quote. Hold on a second. This little

353
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:27.450
Richelle Direny: Poll about strength about you're a warrior and you Elise, my friend, or a warrior.

354
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.700
Alyse: Thank you, my friend, Rochelle.

355
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:31.950
Alyse: Hold on.

356
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.430
Alyse: Am I gonna have to write this down and you get our message attorney.

357
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.580
Richelle Direny: You know, I found it on Pinterest actually and I

358
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:38.820
Alyse: Oh,

359
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.200
Richelle Direny: I don't know how you can

360
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:46.290
Alyse: Message people from Pinterest. You have to save it to your phone like save image like sometimes you can

361
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.840
Alyse: There's those little those three little buttons that will come

362
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.520
Richelle Direny: Up. Oh, OK, I see it. I see.

363
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.980
Richelle Direny: Well, but when it says Save it saving it to a board.

364
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.450
Alyse: Okay, hold on.

365
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.300
Alyse: I was gonna say

366
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.950
Richelle Direny: Okay, I think I can't find it. I found how to do it. Okay.

367
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.840
Alyse: See smart woman, you're

368
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.350
Richelle Direny: All right, I'm sending it

369
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:35.010
Richelle Direny: Like sharing it with you. I just shared it with you. Basically it says, remind yourself of what you have been able to overcome all the times you felt like you weren't eight you weren't going to make it through you proved yourself wrong you're more powerful than you think.

370
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.870
Richelle Direny: The title of it is warrior.

371
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.150
Alyse: Um,

372
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.830
Alyse: I like that.

373
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.820
Alyse: And I try to think that way. I really do. But it's like

374
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.880
Alyse: If I

375
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:12.480
Richelle Direny: Remember we talked about in the past. The other problem of everything is that you battle with and I think it's taking you a live a long time to come to terms with it. It seems like of all of your relationship. This is the most

376
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:24.780
Richelle Direny: Successful, I guess you have been or the longest and somewhat stable relationship that you've been in

377
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.520
I think you're frozen.

378
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.160
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

379
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.420
Richelle Direny: You are frozen for a while.

380
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.430
Alyse: You were frozen for a while.

381
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.890
Alyse: And I'm like, I'm like, yeah, that's a fun way to leave it out of all of your relationships. This is the most. And I'm like, thankful our show.

382
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.210
So now.

383
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.090
Richelle Direny: I'm like she is just sitting there children like she boy she listening real well.

384
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.250
Both frozen.

385
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:15.840
Richelle Direny: Know I was saying this is it seems like it's the most stability that you've had in a relationship. And so because of that you want to hang on to it.

386
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:28.590
Richelle Direny: And you know that it's at this point it's very unhealthy for both you and him, but because if the stable is that you've been disabled as relationship that you've been in in many ways.

387
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:39.690
Richelle Direny: You're holding on to hope that things are going to be better and that's not a bad thing. That's not a bad thing, but how much of yourself. Are you going to lose in the process.

388
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.550
Richelle Direny: I think you're frozen again.

389
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.320
Richelle Direny: It was I frozen.

390
00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.970
Alyse: Yeah, okay.

391
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:54.510
Richelle Direny: Good.

392
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.650
Deal.

393
00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:03.540
Alyse: Well, I just see you like you'll you just, there's no sound at all. It's on that looking, you're just stuck in this position.

394
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.910
Alyse: Well well lost their game.

395
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:23.400
Richelle Direny: Okay. Yeah, no, I was saying, you know, because it's the stability that you've had, um, the question is how much more of yourself. Are you going to lose in just the idea of what you think is a good thing.

396
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:34.650
Alyse: Yeah. Actually, you say it that way. It's like, damn, I've lost like a lot of myself. I probably don't have much more to lose. Seriously, if you look in that aspect.

397
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:43.770
Alyse: Because, I mean, I probably wouldn't run off as away from her actual good relationship like someone who really treated me right because I wouldn't know how to Hell of a handle it.

398
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.710
Richelle Direny: Look, you have two girls and as much as the other girls his daughter.

399
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.530
Richelle Direny: I think it's only one daughter, he has right to

400
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.730
Richelle Direny: That lives with you.

401
00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.690
Richelle Direny: Okay, even though they're not your biological daughter daughters. Think about it.

402
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:09.030
Richelle Direny: You being in such mental and emotional anguish and physical anguish, all the time.

403
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:24.720
Richelle Direny: And you both are going at it with each other. You are telling all of these girls, even though your, your, your daughters now or or infants. What you're basically telling them it's okay to stay in a relationship as long as there are some stability.

404
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.110
Richelle Direny: Even if you're unhappy.

405
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:34.740
Richelle Direny: Even if you're losing a piece of yourself every day. It's okay to be in it as long as he is paying the bills.

406
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.480
Alyse: Even even

407
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:46.260
Richelle Direny: If you're being you feel like you're being YOU'RE DRAGGED IN THE DIRT you're being disrespected all the time as a woman, we just have to put up with it and it's okay.

408
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.930
Alyse: No, no, no.

409
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.540
Alyse: Got make sure I tell i vocally tell them, even though my show them differently. I know, I know.

410
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.400
Richelle Direny: And I can tell you I love you, but if I do otherwise do you really feel loved.

411
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.030
Yeah.

Alyse: Yeah, and that's

413
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.670
Richelle Direny: Knowing me it's about showing me. Yeah.

414
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.960
Alyse: And I think that's where I'm

415
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:19.470
Alyse: Like, that's what I've said in the past like the past couple days. I don't know if I've ever seen this before, but like in a house full of people I've never felt so alone, yet again, like, and

416
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:27.420
Alyse: I think it's guns that place like I need to venture like I need to figure out what's best for me.

417
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:36.360
Alyse: And it's like that I have like these two little lines that I'm responsible for not not sucks, but it makes it harder but makes it more

418
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:45.180
Alyse: Like makes it like reach out don't know how to say like reachable like like it makes him want to like work for more to try to know what that's like.

419
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:52.470
Richelle Direny: But you have to come face to face and admit what your fear so I'm fearful of being independent now.

420
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.750
Richelle Direny: That you're learning to

421
00:41:55.170 --> 00:42:01.980
Richelle Direny: To admit those words that I'm fearful. Now we're going to break apart, fear, what exactly are you fearful of

422
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:13.620
Alyse: Failing on fee if you recall, feeling like I'm fearful of like it becoming too much. I need being that person I was a few short years ago you know i mean like

423
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:23.010
Alyse: I mean, I, I feel like I've been through some shifts and events over. So if I can be through this shifts over then like none of the shifts to make me want to run back out and get hot.

424
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:35.190
Alyse: Like, I'm not saying that I'm not capable and going back out and doing that stuff, but it's like I think about like where I wasn't a few years ago. And I'm like, I don't get it. I understand.

425
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.070
Alyse: doing those things.

426
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:45.450
Alyse: Like oh, did I ever get to that place, you don't. I mean, like,

427
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:55.350
Richelle Direny: Because you because of the fear of wanting to do feel the emotions of it, go through it and it's okay because guess what the least we all are capable

428
00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:13.560
Richelle Direny: Of backsliding we all are capable of doing it. And as long as we know that we are capable of it. Now I say, Okay, I know that I'm capable. So this is what I'm going to do. I'm not going to put myself into. I'm going to try my best not to put myself in situations that contempt me

429
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.120
Richelle Direny: If alcohol is your issue. Are you gonna go chill out at a bar. No.

430
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.080
Alyse: No.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.280
Richelle Direny: Dude, I'm trying to tell you

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.790
Alyse: Oh, yeah.

433
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:34.230
Richelle Direny: If you know I'm a really, I really overwhelmed and this is going on. And I just can't see my way through it. Are you going to reach for your support system. Are you gonna say let me sit down and let me try to deal with it myself feet.

434
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:41.880
Alyse: In it says, maintaining it. And now I don't know where I'm going with this so much. But stop touching your game face girl. Sorry. Listen.

435
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.410
Alyse: I know by no teaching

436
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.170
Alyse: It's, I know it's allergy time. That's the problem.

437
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.120
Richelle Direny: So listen, there's this mean that says

438
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.440
Richelle Direny: I've done so much crap.

439
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.300
Richelle Direny: In my life that if I die because I touch my face I'm gonna be pissed.

440
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.510
Alyse: I feel it. I'm like, you know, I like I backed out of like that whole

441
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:16.290
Alyse: When I was in the treatment. I wish you know like living there. And all like, I remember like like I have a lot of them leaves on my Facebook and like the foundation that they have with each other that like

442
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:32.160
Alyse: Like I I sold I've sold myself short so many times in life, who don't dominate their that one. Like, I really do. I saw my my myself short nine times out of 10 either because I'm fearful of something or because

443
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:44.190
Alyse: I care too much about others, like I put myself like short string you know i mean for other people or stuff like that. Like, and

444
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.920
Alyse: I don't know. I don't know. Where are we going, because my brains just everywhere, but it's like you

445
00:44:53.310 --> 00:45:06.330
Richelle Direny: Identify like you're trying to pick apart and understand all of the different fears that you have and what how you have allowed yourself because of your fear you you run away from different opportunities.

446
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:14.880
Richelle Direny: Because you're saying that you short sell yourself from now when you say that the community group of women on your Facebook page. Like, what about it.

447
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.190
Richelle Direny: resonates with you.

448
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:31.260
Alyse: Get their strength. Like, they're like, like you always like, to me it's like you always know that like you'll have somebody to catch you like you always have some support, like you don't. I mean, and I don't. I think that's where

449
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:39.330
Alyse: Even if it's kind words. Even if it's a hey you're going to do good like Tim, then that means like a lot to me. You know what I mean. And I

450
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.750
Richelle Direny: I don't think that and I think our minds, create these things.

451
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.670
Alyse: And create these

452
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:54.300
Richelle Direny: These things to say, Oh, she knows that she got no it's not that she knows it. It's that those community of women constantly reminds that each other.

453
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.480
Alyse: They remind each other that it's okay.

454
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.910
Richelle Direny: It's okay to feel the way you're feeling

455
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.470
Richelle Direny: What are we going to do now.

456
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:16.140
Richelle Direny: Are you going to allow those emotions to bring you down and tear you down and make to take 10 steps back is that they're telling their reminding each other but you the onlooker you think, Oh, she got her crap together. No, it is that because they all have

457
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:27.030
Richelle Direny: Taken that accountability to say, you know what I'm going to check in on a lead, because I know that maybe she's struggling right now, or I'm going to check in on

458
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:39.390
Richelle Direny: This person you understand your because you know what your struggles are you're going to keep it in the forefront of your mind and you're going to always be mindful of it, you're always going to be mindful of it.

459
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:39.900
Alyse: It's

460
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:51.060
Richelle Direny: Not that they really have. It's not that they don't, they're not fearful every day that they may slip back into this life of addiction. It's that they make it

461
00:46:51.780 --> 00:47:01.080
Richelle Direny: Where they keep it in the forefront of their mind of all the different triggers. What are the different triggers and admitting ABC and D are triggers. So I'm going to

462
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.390
Richelle Direny: Make an active decision not to allow myself to be in certain positions.

463
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.820
Richelle Direny: I'm not going to allow myself to get into certain arguments and discussions. That's going to give

464
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.310
Richelle Direny: Me that's going to make me feel overwhelmed.

465
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.220
Richelle Direny: I'm just not going to do that.

466
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:27.570
Richelle Direny: Don't overthink it. Elise and I think maybe that's what makes you overwhelmed you overthink everything

467
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.030
Alyse: Oh, yeah. And I'm always completely negative is it does that say walk by faith.

468
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:43.560
Alyse: Yeah, find you. I have this thing with the word thing. That's funny. That's my word. That would be my word case, it's like attached to me somewhere.

469
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.730
Alyse: Yeah, I'm just, I don't

470
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.200
Alyse: Like I

471
00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:56.190
Alyse: Like

472
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.050
Alyse: You hear me.

473
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.660
Richelle Direny: Ya hear you.

474
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.310
Alyse: Talk to somebody called me like I'm

475
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.790
Alyse: I mean, I understand that.

476
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:24.630
Alyse: OK, so maybe then we just need to sit down and talk then because like we talked last night and he keeps on all everything's okay I'm here to help if you need me this and that but it's like how does one accept help or whatever. When you're kicking me out by

477
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:27.000
Richelle Direny: Thinking about him.

478
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.850
Richelle Direny: Before you sit and have a conversation with him.

479
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.160
Alyse: You first need to be sure

480
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.780
Alyse: Of yourself you need

481
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.250
Richelle Direny: For of the direction you're going in, you need to be confident

482
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:40.470
Richelle Direny: And

483
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.670
Richelle Direny: Whatever decisions.

484
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.220
Richelle Direny: That you're going to make and what it is that you're going to be

485
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.870
Richelle Direny: Doing you

486
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.120
Richelle Direny: Admit

487
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.670
Richelle Direny: The struggles, you have to yourself.

488
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.730
Richelle Direny: You need to be aware of it, you need to

489
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.780
Alyse: Admit the struggles

490
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.710
Richelle Direny: That you have

491
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.700
Richelle Direny: So that when you and you have to end, you also remember we talked about

492
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.240
Alyse: Expectations as well. Oh yeah, my bad expectations.

493
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.950
Richelle Direny: And you so. And when you enter that conversation with him. You need to lower

494
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.450
Richelle Direny: Your expectations because you

495
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.470
Richelle Direny: Have no control.

496
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.690
Richelle Direny: In what direction he cares. The conversation or hoppy or how he responds to anything.

497
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.130
Richelle Direny: You only have control.

498
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.560
Richelle Direny: over you and how you respond

499
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:20.580
Richelle Direny: By reacting

500
00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:35.670
Richelle Direny: And your reaction and everything else. So you need to just be sure of yourself and you need to know what it is that Elise is doing and what at least once. And what Elise goals are, who she is so precious. Hi.

501
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:43.620
Know where

502
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.960
Richelle Direny: She is the one that you said that will start screaming and she doesn't see you

503
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.950
Alyse: Know, that's the other one. She was just in there, don't offend. Anyways, though.

504
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.670
Richelle Direny: But yes, so you have to just before you get you get to that place of having that conversation because

505
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:00.480
Alyse: What

506
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.420
Richelle Direny: What I'm hearing you say is more so.

507
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:14.820
Richelle Direny: If he doesn't, if you enter a conversation with him and he doesn't speak in a way, or meet the expectations that you have in your mind.

508
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.400
Richelle Direny: Of wanting the relationship to work and

509
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.960
Alyse: And making a plan.

510
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.900
Alyse: iron out the issue.

511
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:23.880
Richelle Direny: That

512
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.440
It's just going to go south.

513
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.730
Alyse: Yeah, and automatically goes on, mostly with anything.

514
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:38.160
Alyse: And then just because I'm so fearful INSIDE. AND I'M SO ADRIAN five day if it's not what I want to hear. I go off the deep end.

515
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, I want you to answer this. I want them to ask this to the core of you and I want you to be not honest with me but honest with yourself.

516
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.460
Richelle Direny: At this point in time.

517
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.820
Richelle Direny: In everything that you've been through.

518
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.380
Richelle Direny: And you're going through

519
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.430
Richelle Direny: Do you still want the relationship to work.

520
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.060
Alyse: Yeah, yeah, they don't. Yeah, yeah.

521
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.530
Richelle Direny: And

522
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:12.150
Richelle Direny: If I know that you guys are supposedly engaged. Do you still want to enter a marriage with this individual.

523
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:13.170
No.

524
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.600
Alyse: But you still want relation

525
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.800
Alyse: To work. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It doesn't even sound right.

526
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.510
Alyse: No, no.

527
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:32.910
Richelle Direny: But you have to, you have to come to terms with that and because you said there's that part of you. How much when you what percent of you that still wants to make that relationship work and you have to be honest with yourself.

528
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.770
Alyse: Less than half of me.

529
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:51.450
Alyse: Because as much as I like in my head because as you're saying like, you're like, you're talking about this. And I'm like,

530
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:59.670
Alyse: Yeah, I want to work but oh he doesn't give me that much attention. And yeah, I wanted to work but well she doesn't do this. You know what I mean like I have all these things.

531
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:04.890
Richelle Direny: That you want it to work, even though he's not doing because you know what

532
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:17.010
Richelle Direny: What he's not doing and all his limitations will always be there, regardless if you are married or not married. That's just relationships. They have their highs and your lows sometimes for more lows than you do. Highs

533
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.850
Alyse: Or shall I would be with him for the rest of my life. Like I would choose not to ever be with anybody else she okay

534
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:32.310
Richelle Direny: That's, that's, that's the stop there. Elise, hold on, I want you to stop there. And this is the reason why I want you to stop there because every decision you make,

535
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:44.910
Richelle Direny: Every argument you engage in every thought you have every emotion you have it's defending that ultimate decision of wanting to be with him for the rest of your life.

536
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:59.400
Richelle Direny: And that's why it frustrates you and that's why it puts you in so much mental anguish and that's why you're so fearful you're fearful of losing this person that you want to devote your life to for the rest of your life.

537
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:14.820
Richelle Direny: And that's why every time he comes in. He has you try to have a conversation with him, you're trying to convey that message to him. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. Why can't you see that

538
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.090
Yeah.

539
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:34.740
Richelle Direny: And you're always speaking through that blow horn that blow horn that says, Harold. I want you and only you, no matter how much you're hurting me no matter how much I am in daily emotional pain mental pain.

540
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.800
Richelle Direny: I still want to be with you, even though you're treating me like crap. I want to be with you.

541
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:52.440
Richelle Direny: Your speak. That's the blow horn you're speaking through out of your mouth. You're saying I'm taking care of these kids, but in the core of you, you actually like taking care all them dog on six kids.

542
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.270
Alyse: The I thought I was going to make it to the session. I don't have any prior show

543
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:02.670
Alyse: But

544
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.410
Alyse: That's the probably the most honest, the most realest thing I've heard all week.

545
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:18.780
Alyse: And it's the truth because like in my head notes you know I'm saying, like, I'm not saying you're watching these kids inside I'm letting you know it's like I that's where I find my, you know, it's my purpose for the day.

546
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:25.800
Richelle Direny: Their school and the teacher call you and you drop airplane and you run over to that school

547
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.230
Alyse: Year deal with the situation. Yeah.

548
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:35.130
Richelle Direny: That's not a person who's saying that's not my kids unique called a daddy. No, that's a mother who is saying, I'm going to be there for my kid.

549
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:45.540
Richelle Direny: Even though this kid is looking at you, intellectually, you ain't my mama. Why are you saying all these things to me. Whatever looker go sit down somewhere. Let me go handle these teachers.

550
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.260
Alyse: Yeah.

551
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.150
Richelle Direny: Is that an action.

552
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:48.990
Of a person

553
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.300
Richelle Direny: Who is not

554
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.500
Richelle Direny: In love with children that does not belong to her.

555
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.430
Alyse: Very

556
00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:01.470
Richelle Direny: So you say these things to him. But the reality of it is

557
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.570
Alyse: You love everything that's

558
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:09.510
Richelle Direny: Around you and every conversation you engage in with this individual that you're saying

559
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:11.940
Richelle Direny: That you want to leave no

560
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.080
Alyse: You

561
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:14.010
Alyse: Don't want to

562
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.180
Richelle Direny: Because

563
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:17.250
Alyse: You want this relationship to work.

564
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:20.730
Alyse: Yeah yeah yeah

565
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:33.210
Richelle Direny: About the only thing in the all time we've met. About the only thing that you're short of Elise, is that you're not willing to give up.

566
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:46.710
Richelle Direny: The meta the Suboxone and our time together because you feel like that's the only thing that you have control over. And that's keeping you stable and it's getting used to everything that you're going through. Yeah.

567
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:56.100
Richelle Direny: So the same way, you're sure about that is how you need to start being sure about everything else in your life to regain control and respect.

568
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.860
Alyse: Yeah, because, like, like I said, why would I. Why would I take something away from me that keeps me

569
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:08.970
Alyse: Present for the moment. You know what I mean, like, I'm not saying the thing is like some miracle drug and whatever. It's not I'm saying it's

570
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:21.450
Alyse: It works for me. Okay. For right now, I'm not that person. I once was out there. Okay. It works for me right now. So I take something that helps me and works for me and throw that all away.

571
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:30.030
Alyse: And put myself you know impossibly a situation that's not good for me in so many different ways.

572
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:38.850
Alyse: Because of what somebody else wants right now. You know, I mean, like, it's, I don't know. I

573
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:56.970
Richelle Direny: Can you have to justify it. You don't have to because as you said earlier. You're nothing going to stay on it for the rest of your life until you're at. You're just saying that I've been on drugs for whatever amount of years 1015 years

574
00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:01.620
Richelle Direny: I've only been on Suboxone for what, a year or two. So,

575
00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:16.440
Richelle Direny: I'm still I'm still in a very I'm still in the baby stages of my recovery. And so if it means that I have to maintain this being on this on.

576
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:24.420
Richelle Direny: To that place where now I can be independent of it because I've mastered the skills identified those things within me.

577
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:32.820
Richelle Direny: That put me in that place where I was putting needles in my arm. I was doing all these unhealthy habits, simply because I feared

578
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:43.590
Richelle Direny: Feeling I feared understanding why I was hurt I feared all that. Now I know why I am and know now I know how to get through these things.

579
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:55.800
Richelle Direny: Then at that point you I think you will get to that place where you say no or have a pencil box on and no longer have to rush, because I'm at that place where I have. I know.

580
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:58.380
Richelle Direny: I got the skill.

581
00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:03.390
Richelle Direny: You

582
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:04.620
Richelle Direny: Know maybe

583
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:19.050
Alyse: You know i i talk you up every, every damn session, we have on Tuesdays and they're like something. I'm like, well, let me tell you, you better get a counselor on her name happens to be, Rochelle.

584
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:29.190
Alyse: They're probably say, Terry. Listen to me. Oh my god, I'm like, Listen, if you guys ever fight over or she leaves. We're gonna have a serious issue you're having a walk out. They're gonna walk out for

585
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:36.480
Alyse: It just because you are so you are like you're so knowledgeable in your field.

586
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:41.070
Alyse: Particularly you've never been an addict or an alcoholic.

587
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:50.310
Alyse: Know, especially for somebody who hasn't been in the shoes that like because that was always such a big problem. It's a big problem for

588
00:58:51.150 --> 00:59:00.900
Alyse: Myself, let alone a lot of people taking advice from somebody who's never been there that doesn't know. You know what I mean. But it's like you relate so well and your knowledge of

589
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:08.610
Alyse: Your knowledge of whatever this is works out very well. Sometimes you get me so dumbfounded. I don't know what to say.

590
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:17.100
Richelle Direny: I appreciate that. And I think a lot of it is just my passion in helping

591
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.630
Alyse: You understand you, and understand

592
00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:31.740
Richelle Direny: All of the the walls that we all feel in life attic or not addict. We all feel those walls, you know, we all have relationship issues. We all have children issues.

593
00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:34.830
Alyse: So, I get that.

594
00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:47.310
Richelle Direny: It's, it's just, I just, I love that. I'm very passionate about helping people to understand, you know, everything their feelings, their emotions and just wanting to be better.

595
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:56.370
Alyse: It's just like so hard for me because like you said this whole feeling and I don't want to do this on my own anymore. You just have to get myself.

596
00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:06.390
Alyse: I have to know what I really want you know what I mean, it's because I want it. You know, you know, I want to be here, more than anything, like, I really do. But then

597
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:18.390
Alyse: I don't know how to convey that to him. But even if I do it is what it is I'm just going to get here today and I'm going to talk to her a little bit and I don't know.

598
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.380
Alyse: The

599
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:28.410
Alyse: Time we don't feel like I'm going to be like in that like nasty ass face I have that in the past couple days. I feel like I'm definitely not there anymore.

600
01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:47.490
Richelle Direny: You know you're not in for someone who wants to move out. You sure it really talking to, like, now like like the last time you pretty much hauled but um I the next time we meet, I want you to during that time before we meet again, I want you to

601
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.030
Richelle Direny: Write down, ask the question, title, what does Elise

602
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.170
Who

603
01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.050
Alyse: This is all aspects.

604
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:17.280
Richelle Direny: Just, I want you to you're asking yourself, Elise. What do you want, you're going to identify your strengths and your weaknesses.

605
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:31.290
Richelle Direny: And put down all of the things that you've overcome all the trials you face and what have you done to overcome and I basically, I want you to journal about you, so you can read it because you

606
01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.320
Richelle Direny: Question, your own abilities.

607
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:39.900
Richelle Direny: I think you're a very strong woman. I don't think you believe you're a strong woman.

608
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:41.520
Alyse: Yeah.

609
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:48.180
Richelle Direny: And because he knows how much of a strong woman you are

610
01:01:49.650 --> 01:02:00.270
Richelle Direny: He I don't think he wants you to recognize it for yourself. Because if you recognize it for yourself. You are going to be a force to reckon with

611
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.460
Richelle Direny: But if I feel like I've searched for that for so long.

612
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.820
Richelle Direny: You'll need to search for what is right there, you know,

613
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:09.840
Yeah.

614
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:21.120
Alyse: That this is gonna be a good thing for me to sit down and write this and then be able to go back and read it and I mean there's journaling stuff is time. Remember, we tried this long time ago and I was just like,

615
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.160
Alyse: Well, no, I got started school so I got to start writing. So I my little start journaling.

616
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.350
Richelle Direny: You

617
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.000
Alyse: Are you just, you have the ability

618
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.280
Richelle Direny: I think you just question it because

619
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.380
Alyse: There's so many distractions.

620
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.130
Alyse: In your life.

621
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:47.430
Richelle Direny: Is very hard for you. Stay focused on who Elise is and your capabilities and I think you will be a force to reckon with and I think that one day you will get to that place where you can help other women.

622
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:56.280
Richelle Direny: Who has been in your shoe. But, you first have to own it. I want you to start in even in another thing I want you to put fear.

623
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.060
Richelle Direny: I want you to break down fear.

624
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:02.580
As related to you.

625
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.080
Okay.

626
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:15.090
Richelle Direny: Break it down, break down your fear because once you break it down. I think you will understand what has been all the things that has been you're stumbling block.

627
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.630
Alyse: All those things that have held me back then, like,

628
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:27.060
Alyse: That's a good one too. Because, like, I'm just thinking, you know what I mean, like my has already gone. And I'm like, oh, I could

629
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.380
Alyse: So yeah, this will be good. I'm excited about this action.

630
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.210

644
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.780
Richelle Direny: They were so excited to show me this deck on dessert.

645
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:44.970
Richelle Direny: I don't know why they thought that was cool.
