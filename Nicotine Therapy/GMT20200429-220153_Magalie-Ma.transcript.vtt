176
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.580
Galaxy J2: He was sneaking coming

177
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:45.240
Magalie Marcellus: Upon

178
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.130

180
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.900
Galaxy J2: Don't do it.

181
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.540

182
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.780
Galaxy J2: OK, now I realized why he don't do it because

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.700
Galaxy J2: He is so

184
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.590
Galaxy J2: He's so scared to hurt. He had just say he didn't write that letter.

186
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:28.140

187
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:44.760

00:25:47.850 --> 00:26:01.020
Galaxy J2: They will generally gentlemen don't hate her mother like Stephanie does. I even access every over the years I seen the Texas use text your mother on Facebook and

191
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:38.910
Galaxy J2: It would make Robin, would you know get tears in her eyes but Robin was no angel. She did mess up, back when Bronson was 18 months old, though breastfeeding.

Galaxy J2: Had problems and she can talk more

197
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.090

Galaxy J2: Time. Now I get to get her out a lot of money for a lawyer.

225
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.350
And

226
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:01.740
Galaxy J2: Then she violation goes back or can believe it, then why

227
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.950

232
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:26.550
Galaxy J2: You know the breast, you know, babies are so addicted to that Robin breastfed our kids. So they were like three

233
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:27.900
Galaxy J2: I think that's

234
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.610
Galaxy J2: Too long. But

235
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.400
Galaxy J2: But here it was, it wasn't

236
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.810
Galaxy J2: In London aggressive as even as long as withdraws

237
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.220
Her daughter.

Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

243
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.710
Magalie Marcellus: So, so then the concern.
