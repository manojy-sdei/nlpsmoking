00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning.

2
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.030
Ariel Mirabal: Good morning, please.

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.949
Gwenevere Abriel: Audio, video and sink.

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.690
Ariel Mirabal: I gotcha.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.650
Good.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so, um, any challenges today, or we've got some good timing right now to kind of have some some focused attention. Fantastic. So I had about 20 seconds right before you came here to look over our previous note.

7
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what we did what we we put a good amount of effort into developing your anchor room.

8
00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We are not done. But I want to check in on yet and see if there's anything kind of right happening now. Because sometimes, life gets like yeah and that's what we're presenting with. So I want to check in with you and see if there's anything that's kind of present for you.

9
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.420
Ariel Mirabal: Know, actually, you feel, I feel totally okay today.

10
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll take it.

11
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.060
Yeah.

12
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: For out one. This is a great day then to do kind of what can feel like both difficult and relieving but again the destination is to have a safe.

13
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of happy places. Happy Room this happy safe room that has everything that Lou LaBelle needed at the time and so can I kind of bring us back a little bit through some of the

14
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: details that you shared with me and see if I can bring us back to that moment because now we've got lots of time.

15
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.230
Yeah.

16
00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we might be able to get get all the way through it. If not, that's fine too. Okay. Um, so again, just to remind you, no way for us wrong whatever comes up just share it with me.

17
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got your coffee. I'm still caffeinated myself here.

18
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So little slow feeling a little slow myself.

19
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I see, I see the original description of feeling blocked was around being open to speak with Arlene to get close to her, and that's how it originated, or is it took you know involved.

20
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was the original identified area feeling blocked the emotion was sad.

21
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The body so much somatic experience was not in the stomach and the labeled emotion anxious

22
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice a wiggling in the fingers and I tried to focus or feet and I'm really trying to think, yes, it being discreet know

23
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The right bounces and wiggles. I guess that might be maybe the right side.

24
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

25
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you share a story about eight years ago.

26
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hartman

27
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And Russ, his mom asked

28
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming asked for us. Do you miss my cooking.

29
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then the notes says at age six I was always shy.

30
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And the nickname is Lou LaBelle and this room that you described was an additional room. The color was changing at that time from pale green, pink and purple deep bread. And then I think eventually I'll see that it had a set color, but this is how it started.

31
00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a large window facing the mountains and I can see out nice view no blinds or curtains. There's crisscross windows.

32
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can hear the hummingbirds.

33
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: At the window.

34
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The room is empty.

35
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Open blank space. It's quiet. It's a peaceful place.

36
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There's peace and thoughts.

37
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: See, and then

38
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, one side would be trees and river. I guess it's like a mural maybe

39
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, like that working. Is it painted

40
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.900
Ariel Mirabal: It was painted mural. Yeah.

41
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, painted

42
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: don't always get everything everybody says

43
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

44
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.790
Ariel Mirabal: No, no.

45
00:04:45.210 --> 00:05:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah nature on one of the walls and the wall that is opposite the window is that mural of a forest. And you can see now the light blue color to the left and the right walls and you can hear the air flow the breeze and your breathing.

46
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I invite you Arielle to turn turn your attention, very much to this imagery. There we go. Yeah, if you're comfortable, you can always open when you need some relief.

47
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you're as comfortable to try and bring yourself to this moment again.

48
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The temperature is very cool. And there's a ceiling fan.

49
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The scent is would see no awareness of any particular taste and you had walked into the room. The door you notice is white. White trim around the door. The door is like has around arch. It's made of wood.

50
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The door locks have a regular gold metal door handle you can lock from the inside, and it is locked

51
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And looking out the window. The feet feel the hard brown wood flooring.

52
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And noticing. It's cool.

53
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's also this sense of soft and grainy.

54
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The hands are together in front of me relaxed.

55
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotions calm.

56
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's a noticing of butterflies in the stomach and the message of those butterflies is a good feeling. Maybe I feel happy to be happy.

57
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Running around like fly and play and running so excited, playing with Barbies Barbie castle seeing little pink twin bed with a canopy.

58
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like the walls are pink.

59
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the right temperature feeling playful.

60
00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this introduction of this misinformation came about and it was that my mom.

61
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Was not a liar.

62
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the misinformation. She would say things that now I know

63
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: She was not right about a lot.

64
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything is too good to be true.

65
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing is as it appears, people are terrible.

66
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Little about and Arielle face to face each other in the room a little bell ass. Were you scared.

67
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Me adult self says definitely scared, but I did it.

68
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And the adult

69
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe says something like, be strong, maybe this is advice and do not worry about what other people think. So I'm just going to write the word

70
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: advises you strong and do not worry about what

71
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If something bad happens. There's nothing you can do or say take it if I think it's if we change it if it's from an instrument if if something bad happens, and there is nothing you can do or say, take a deep breath and walk away.

72
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If mean kids call you names make fun or make you feel bad about yourself.

73
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I would hug you and tell you I love you.

74
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels good.

75
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think she knew how to do that. I think you're talking about your mother.

76
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Neither did my brothers and sisters

77
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So was maybe mother not showing affection to to siblings. Is that what that was.

78
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.650
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I don't think she knew

79
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.450
Ariel Mirabal: Really, how to do that with us because it didn't she didn't get a lot of that when she was a child.

80
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: She loved us. But she was never able to show a lot of caring and love. I feel sad.

81
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you noticing right now. What's happening for you now.

82
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.870
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like I mean just currently in life.

83
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In this moment. Yeah.

84
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.440
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like I want to focus really hard on doing things different from my daughter.

85
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.730
Ariel Mirabal: The future.

86
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.230
Ariel Mirabal: I'm always thinking about that.

87
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.030
Ariel Mirabal: I want my daughter to have everything I did not have even things I feel I didn't

88
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:13.170
Ariel Mirabal: Know, so I try to go above and beyond. Sometimes, and I think that I even overwhelm myself like I'm trying to merge.

89
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

90
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.590
Ariel Mirabal: Right, that's I thought about first

91
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.210
So,

92
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're in thoughts of wanting to change the dynamic, you know, change the future change a generation. I'm not be what you experienced

93
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.810
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, make sure that my daughter feels all the love that she can feel

94
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.410
Yeah.

95
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there any

96
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense for a moment as I was kind of attempting to bring you back to the space.

97
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: At any moment. We've actually felt what Lola Bell felt

98
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:12.750
Ariel Mirabal: As we get deeper into the conversation, usually it's a certain point where I really do start to feel that way. But like yet. Last week I did, and I don't think I'm to that we just yet.

99
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.370
Ariel Mirabal: Maybe it's like trying not to.

100
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that looks. That's how it looks. And so maybe what we'll do is we'll do a different activity and this because it's

101
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll happen in its own time. So I'd like to do something a little different, but it does require a little bit of preparation. Do you happen to have

102
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be two chairs. But let me show you what I'm hoping for. You'd have to turn your camera down so that I could see you into two chairs.

103
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously can't be in one place. A two places at one time, but it's called an empty chair technique so

104
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be able to see a chair here. See how my couch is here and then I would have a seat here and then in practice this is what would happen.

105
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be here you'd be obviously I'd be guiding you the whole time. You don't have to know what's up and I can explain what I'm about to do. But you'd be here, and then I'd say switch

106
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here. And I'd say, switch. So there's this movement, but you'd still be in my frame and still be able to see both of you, you know, in these two roles. Do you happen either have an edge of a bed and a chair, you could bring so that I could see both seated spots.

107
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.240
Ariel Mirabal: I'm actually in my daughter's play rooms so there's not that chair but

108
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: On a couple chairs from the dining room maybe

109
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple. Yeah, yeah.

110
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, take your time, I'm going to update some notes while you do that, that's perfect.

111
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This is impromptu

112
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.960
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, smaller chairs.

113
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.340
Ariel Mirabal: The same size, though, they're like my daughter was little chairs those

114
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: At depends on you. Are they gonna work for you.

115
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.360
Going to be saying

116
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.780
Ariel Mirabal: Let me just figure out where to

117
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Be able to see you know you and each one

118
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.930
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, missy.

119
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.270
Ariel Mirabal: I put the song.

120
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.850
Ariel Mirabal: Are kind of low

121
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.870
So this would be

122
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I would say tilting down. I see more the fan, you can

123
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Get almost there.

124
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care.

125
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: About say

126
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that can work that can work. Okay.

127
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, you do want them facing each other. I was good. Just the way you've had that facing each other. Yeah, that's beautiful. So

128
00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The setup is together and I kind of gave you an overview. So let's stand up together and stand back from those two chairs and you're going to make a decision about who's in what so the chairs and you're going to look at them. So, stand back and look at these two chairs.

129
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And so a little, a little explanation. So the activity. I want to do today is it's a psychodynamic activity based sort of insert of Freud's theory. So pretty old.

130
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But it comes from Fritz pearls work and you don't have to do the analysis. Remember, I'm here. You just whatever that thought is you share it, and then I'm going to guide and I'll probably say switch. So as you're standing here looking at these two chairs. Now, are you sitting in one

131
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.180
Ariel Mirabal: No, I was just spread between them.

132
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh ok ok so good. We're looking at them. And what I'd like you to think about is this in one of those chairs is going to be

133
00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The child aspect of the self. So in this psychodynamic theory. There are three ego states, in a sense, there's this parent state. I was thinking of it like the waggling finger like a you better. You must you oughta right this sort of parent figure with all the rules and doctrines and

134
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: A culture, even on oftentimes it's this parent. And then there is the child ego state, and that is the embodiment, which means it's basically all of the emotions. So it's sad it's happy it's terrified. It's jealous. It's got rage envy. It's really the embodiment of

135
00:16:41.220 --> 00:17:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only emotions, but also creativity and spontaneity. I mean think about you know that younger self isn't really preoccupied with what right, wrong, you know, rules. It's more open to whatever it's inspired by but very much thinking about that it represents the emotional self. Okay.

136
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's this one in the middle.

137
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this one in the middle is the adult. So you've got carrot adult in the middle and child.

138
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the adult ego state is the ideal. It's the one that knows how to modulate, which means it can sort of address the parent and it can meet the needs also have the child is in the mill almost constantly assessing chronic parent and an inner child state.

139
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, what I'd like to do is I'd like to have

140
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why I want you to look at one of these chairs, once you look one of these chairs and see if you know which one may be Lou LaBelle might be seated in and then you

141
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The adult or maybe it is

142
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The parent. Your mother might actually be in the other one. I'm not quite sure yet. And that can change. And all you have to do is just, I'll just say, Okay, let's let's switch this out.

143
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you to look at these two chairs and don't rush it. Just take your time and see what's this conversation between what, which one would with the child sense of self, all those emotions being

144
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just start with that.

145
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.040
Ariel Mirabal: I see the blue sure we were

146
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I've got it's over on my left, and it's your right. So, but for me, it'll be here on my left hand side notes. And so over there to your left. And who's going to be there. Do you get a sense that this is parent state or this is adult that's kind of your first response to that.

147
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, um, have a seat in adult and so adult is

148
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Basically, as you are yellow. Okay, so we're going to kind of go with that. So we've got Arielle and Lavelle

149
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So, nice and slow. And remember, you don't have to explain anything to me. So I'm here, I can do that part.

150
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like you to do is I want you to look at little bell

151
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously your imagination and of course you can. Giggle if you if that comes up, because this is she's not really there, you're not crazy.

152
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But really get a sense

153
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense if she can look you in the eye, she can make contact with you I contact, see if you guys can do that or if you're willing to do it.

154
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the first response. Can you guys look at each other.

155
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.570
Ariel Mirabal: I don't think she can look at me directly, but I can look at her.

156
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what she doing

157
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.030
Ariel Mirabal: Just kind of looking around.

158
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, she's checking it out. Okay, so let's switch head over there.

159
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So just sort of get embodied in that being looking around, get a sense of how it feels to be you looking around.

160
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe

161
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You could identify how you were feeling emotionally

162
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: As we

163
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, as you were asked and invited to look at Oriel and you looked around and weren't quite able to give

164
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The adult self eye contact when emotion. Are you feeling, though the

165
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.280
Ariel Mirabal: Nervous or scared.

166
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

167
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So switch

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna get your exercise. This morning we're looking for some exercise.

Gwenevere Abriel: glutes.

170
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I should do it with you if I exercise.

171
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so. Oh my goodness. Do you see her. Do you, did you hear what she said. So pay attention to. Okay, remembering what she said. And I'd like you to

172
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to a mirror of her now mirroring is saying back the word she said maybe even in a Sweet. Comforting validating tone, you know, seeking to maybe reassure a little that she's

173
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She's heard at least you know it seems weird. Yes, go ahead.

174
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead, you're

175
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:03.780

177
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.640
Ariel Mirabal: She's looking directly at me.

178
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how do you feel as she looks at you.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but what about your own emotion. How do you label your own emotion right now.

182
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.650
Ariel Mirabal: Say,

183
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.730
Ariel Mirabal: Comfortable.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.420
Like

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.170

Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I don't know what it was, but it sounded, it was less giggle more serious and I type something changed versus the way you said it to me.

218
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.110
Ariel Mirabal: I think it's just because I'm not actually talking to a person

Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, so I'm going to be therapist. I'm I have my two states here and I got this pang of concern. I don't know why I did like like we're going to go to solution really fast.

Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what's going on. All right, let me just say

Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Did you finish that thought.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you let her know you you relate on on an emotional level.

301
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This is validation where we take our own experience. And we kind of go into

302
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.770
Ariel Mirabal: Quite a bit.

303
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You

304
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.010
Ariel Mirabal: I'm sorry.

305
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I interrupted you. The tele health isn't too smooth means I cut you off sometimes so finished that piece. It's important I have learned and share that with her.

306
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.170
Ariel Mirabal: I have learned over time.

307
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.470
Ariel Mirabal: That

308
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.850
Ariel Mirabal: Things always get better.

309
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.290
Ariel Mirabal: There are ways to help

310
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, switch

311
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Respond to that well.

312
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.130
Ariel Mirabal: What can I do to make it better. Yeah.

313
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Really see her.

314
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at her. Her smallness that she's asking you.

315
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.320
Ariel Mirabal: Sometimes

316
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.170
Ariel Mirabal: There is

317
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:37.680
Ariel Mirabal: Sometimes, there isn't anything that you could do to make things better, but you can always make

318
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.990
Ariel Mirabal: Trying to make it a little better for you.

319
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at her face. She know what you're talking about.

320
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.230
Ariel Mirabal: She's confused.

321
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so switch

322
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell the adults can you tell Arielle how you're feeling and

323
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.250
Ariel Mirabal: Use

324
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.150
Ariel Mirabal: What do you mean

325
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: About how to make it better for myself.

326
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.950
Ariel Mirabal: Yes. What do you mean by I can make

327
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.220
Ariel Mirabal: Things better for myself if I catch

328
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own time.

329
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.520
Ariel Mirabal: Control.

330
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:54.990
Ariel Mirabal: The way that your mind works and then try to create some place of happiness or

331
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:11.640
Ariel Mirabal: When you see her crying when you see your side to a happy place in the House do something that you love and just really try not to focus on her being so sad because

332
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.970
Ariel Mirabal: Sometimes, she's just

333
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.490
Ariel Mirabal: Going to be sad and sometimes Verizon.

334
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And take a look a little bell how she has her Facebook but she doing

335
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, switch

336
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you share

337
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're thinking about how you feeling

338
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.890
Ariel Mirabal: Wish I could make her feel better all the time.

339
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, switch

340
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.350
Ariel Mirabal: I always wished I could make her feel better all the time.

341
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.140
Ariel Mirabal: So,

342
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.400
Ariel Mirabal: But I have learned

343
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.190
Ariel Mirabal: That sometimes i i can't and

344
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:36.720
Ariel Mirabal: I have to

345
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.870
Ariel Mirabal: To help myself not get

346
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:44.820
Ariel Mirabal: Upset

347
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.500
By that

348
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she look like she understands what you're saying.

349
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.410
Ariel Mirabal: Sounds better

350
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's switch

351
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Where

352
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go out in place and this is a chance for you to get all the information that you want.

353
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything you want from

354
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone

355
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.030
Ariel Mirabal: Everybody

356
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay switch

357
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Really see her. This is going to give her permission.

358
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To really go out and play.

359
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.310
Ariel Mirabal: Really hard work.

360
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's right. So let's let's stop right there.

361
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me your therapist why that's hard.

362
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:45.930
Ariel Mirabal: Stock on what I would say to that, you know, and she said, I just wanted to know that everybody is going to be okay. It's like

363
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.250
Ariel Mirabal: We can't really

364
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:59.490
Ariel Mirabal: predict the future. But what would I say to a young child so small and to explain, you know,

365
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get too lost

366
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: In in in that that's that's that's missing.

367
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: The point of it just by a hairline. You come back to really Arielle tell me your therapist. Why is it difficult for you to tell

368
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The self everything's gonna be okay. Tell me why that's so hard.

369
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.390
Ariel Mirabal: Because sometimes they don't feel okay right

370
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

371
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.000
Hard

372
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.650
Ariel Mirabal: Times time and I don't want to discourage her

373
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.440
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, and scare her.

374
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, don't, don't just a way to protecting her

375
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are her

376
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're uncertain that everything's going to be okay.

377
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why we're here. That's why we're doing this this work together.

378
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a really important piece and you got there. You found your way.

379
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can't say it to ourselves if we can't know it for ourselves. It's darn near impossible to genuinely teach it reassure it to live it when we don't have that face already

380
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That knowing and not really knowing and that's what faith is it's I know I'll be okay i don't know how i don't have to

381
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to know how I'm going to be okay. I just know I will be and if for no other reason because the alternative

382
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is suffering and misery.

383
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm not okay. The world is constantly in flux and groundless and scary and

384
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Constantly grasping for facts and being correct and right and looking for precision and certainty, when there is none. There is no amount they can fill that space. We just ran into just now.

385
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: No momentary interpersonal being correct in that moment will fill it. It's not the same.

386
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: As knowing on sort of that spiritual level.

387
00:45:47.670 --> 00:46:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how I'm going to be okay. I just do. That's what faith is that's and I'm not trying to put the God in this. I'm trying to just put it's the abyss of unknown. We can't tell the future and so

388
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a deliberate, intentional.

389
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought I know I'm going to be okay. I know, because I'm okay right now. I feel my body. Now I can look back in time and say this was hard and sad and scary and guess what

390
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

391
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all we've got. And I wish I had something else, but I don't

392
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had formal religion, you could go there though they'll give you some if you don't, if this isn't enough. You know, I'm trying to say. You can grab ahold of there's formal religion that will give you the bridge. It'll say, do these

393
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Things.

394
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's how you know you'll be okay. You could do that. But psychology offers this

395
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.500
Ariel Mirabal: I like this.

396
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So this space we're ending in right now.

397
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want I want if we could pick it right back up. How in whatever shape or form because it'll, it'll show up in its many different ways. It's probably if it's a theme, it will show up all over the place and it's the, I don't know that I'm going to be okay.

398
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And if you take that and where you started, which was I, I want this connection with our lean. I want to feel close

399
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, what's the connection even, even if it's barely any connection at all, just take a second and kind of kind of think about that for a moment.

400
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.490
Ariel Mirabal: By me thinking that things are never going to get better.

401
00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.910
Ariel Mirabal: Situation, particularly, it's like a really negative outlook.

402
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:08.400
On

403
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.100
Ariel Mirabal: The situation itself.

404
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.190
Ariel Mirabal: Instead of just saying, well,

405
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.190
Ariel Mirabal: Things are going to get better somehow

406
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

407
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.510
We have to

408
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: relieve some pressure

409
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.470
Ariel Mirabal: I think so.

410
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe still important, but not quite as urgent.

411
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.380
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I mean,

412
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.830
Ariel Mirabal: I still

413
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.750
Ariel Mirabal: A lot of what

414
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.740
Ariel Mirabal: goes on. I always still sometimes I'm like how why

415
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.380
Ariel Mirabal: Like why did that happen. How could like things that I don't think I could have changed.

416
00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:02.340
Ariel Mirabal: And I think that I didn't do my were saying myself or, you know, things like that. But just kind of came out from the other end.

417
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.380
So,

418
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.260
Ariel Mirabal: And I get that.

419
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:23.580
Ariel Mirabal: Like, oh, I couldn't have done anything to change that, you know, and she said or did. So it's like, is this going to keep going on so that I have that negative outlook instead of this is going to get better somehow

420
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.190
Ariel Mirabal: So hard

421
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In my suspicion is real. The key is

422
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

423
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever happens, I'm like, I agree. Someone like someone else or someone says something nasty or mean I'm okay.

424
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

425
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.560
Yeah.

426
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This history of growing up. Not feeling okay

427
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: might still be following you and

428
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It might take if we're on if this hypothesis that we just kind of bumped into just now.

429
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's at the core of what's keeping you from

430
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just accepting people just the way they are and not having to be correct. And right in that moment, you know when that argument like clearly you're wrong, like kind of those moments.

431
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, because those show up. Right.

432
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:36.510
Yes.

433
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What being okay with you.

434
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Really and truly actually believing it will free you up.

435
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To then

436
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Really looking at Arlene types, right, the rest of the world, basically.

437
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: With genuine curiosity. Will you no longer see them as a threat.

438
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're ready in your argument.

439
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because ultimately, you don't need to do that, you're already okay but right now this is just philosophical because I don't think in your core. You know that yet.

440
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Saw that

441
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that play out.

442
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And so when moments like that feel sharp and acute, that means just like right in the moment, there might be this urgency to either escape it.

443
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Party drink get high right that's to get out of the intensity of how awful because I'm not okay is at the core of most people's distress, by the way.

444
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the self.

445
00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I not be okay. Like, that's how do we function without that. That's pretty key. Yeah.

446
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm not okay. Then I'm constantly having to justify my existence defend myself.

447
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough it it spirals down quickly if someone says something that's disapproving and that threatens the little bit of sort of structure and identity that we have

448
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It can feel overwhelming.

449
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take these last few minutes and just see what comes up. What charge might be left in the body what what thoughts come to mind. Maybe we could process further

450
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.410
Ariel Mirabal: This whole

451
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.340
Like

452
00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:10.140
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know the words I'm looking for but having more faith, I guess, having more

453
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:17.640
Ariel Mirabal: Of a positive trying to look at things in a different way, like nothing's necessarily what people

454
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

455
00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.690
Ariel Mirabal: Like her trying to maybe

456
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.490
Ariel Mirabal: Instead of always

457
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:40.710
Ariel Mirabal: Like, you know, like you said, oh, that's obviously wrong, instead of having to always be right on top of something that I know wasn't right, even though it wasn't just trying to be a person that you know

458
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:48.240
Ariel Mirabal: Is ok and has to get better. You know, things will get better.

459
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:55.830
Ariel Mirabal: And just being super positive about it and you know again looking at it in a different way, having a positive outlook.

460
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something you want to experiment with over the coming week or so.

461
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So I have a little sentence a self talk statement which it's it's not just a statement. It's an action which means it's in our cognitive action, but it's a hard one.

462
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give it to you and then you decide

463
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:19.950
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

464
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it looks like this.

465
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Your initial reaction is going to be defensiveness, you're going to be insulted. It's going to happen because this you've been doing. We all do. We all do.

466
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do it still stings stings, everybody. We all want approval want to just find think everybody thanks for a fantastic. So you're not you're not broken.

467
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Either that or we all are. I don't know.

468
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's because we're wired for attachment. So let's put that aside series still really

469
00:54:52.020 --> 00:55:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going anywhere. We're going to care about what other people say, and think, because we're socialized creatures, that's not going anywhere. It's still going to stay

470
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you go to and this is the invitation. If you want to play with it this week. It's this and it's not an easy one to do but the thought goes like this.

471
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the most generous assumption I can make about her.

472
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Generous meaning.

473
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice the original one. Is she thinks I'm stupid. She thinks I screwed up that little right that's the first. That's the ouch. Now why the intervention is this. What's the most generous assumption I can make about her intention.

474
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: She's trying to help. She's doing the best she can she's pissed off, she's disappointed.

475
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: She's might be overwhelmed. She doesn't know how to ask for help, she's hungry. She's tired. She's lonely. SHE'S DISAPPOINTED IN HER OWN blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That is an intervention and it is not an easy one to do

477
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your habit is you have this big brain that stores great facts that goes to morals and values and you you get up your hooks on a real solid, right, wrong one. When you see someone doing something wrong. Right. And you're like, gotcha.

478
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:34.080
Yes.

479
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this one. Y'all are going down because I know y'all are down on this one. I got my facts on this one. Yeah, no, you're wrong.

480
00:56:48.390 --> 00:57:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's, here's what that reinforces when you do that old style. It's basically saying that you have to defend the self it reinforces insecurity, if you can believe it. I know that seems just like I do, but instead if you do this one, which is

481
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, now I'm like I'm so offended. Oh. That's so rude. I would never do that. Oh, rude rude rude rude rude. Selfish, selfish selfish.

482
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the most generous assumption I can make

483
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she gets sleep last night. She's a little grumpy.

484
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know as soon as you have that thought and it's you just made it up. You don't know. You could check it out.

485
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But just holding that generous thought in your mind.

486
00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture how different your body's going to feel how your emotion is going to change from anger rage irritation discuss repulsion maybe to like a softening

487
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To compassion because you to have gone without sleep and then have been irritable just even imagining the most generous of assumptions changes the way we feel

488
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:19.440
Ariel Mirabal: I think I've been able to do it like a couple of times, but out of like a million.

489
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:26.340
Ariel Mirabal: And I totally remember to it feeling it does, it feels really good inside it makes you feel happy.

490
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.980
Ariel Mirabal: You feel like that.

491
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:40.320
Ariel Mirabal: That could have gotten really, I could have gone the opposite direction. But I handled it pretty well. Like, you know, I remember feeling pretty happy about the situation.

492
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:45.540
Ariel Mirabal: And it does do is, it's just like you said, it's really hard. It's hard to do.

493
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the side. I mean, there's plenty of argument. Anyone could say to me, well, well, that doesn't sound very assertive and maybe I'm sick and tired of being a doormat, and I don't want to put up with it anymore. And maybe that's not what I need.

494
00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There's plenty of argument to the contrary. But that wasn't the focus of today.

495
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Today was about. I don't, I see you as someone has has the ability to assert, you can speak. You know, it's funny people that just can't.

496
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, assertive is is the area that kind of like let's hone that skill. It's hone that skill. Um, but right now, just based on what we did today, you just be okay with you, just the way it is not having to have someone think of you in a particular way.

497
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That that can be out there, but they can have misinformation about you. They're misinformed. They're angry they think I did something I didn't. And I'm still okay

498
00:59:53.490 --> 01:00:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to do so the experiment. If you're up to. It is to see if you can remember. I noticed you didn't write it down. So my dying be remembered.

499
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:03.300
Ariel Mirabal: Remember it. Yeah.

500
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, but that's the experiment. Will it be remembered. Will you

501
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it, which has the thought and then how will it feel, then you can come back and tell me all about it. You can say, oh, I didn't work. Oh, mercy.

502
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just stayed angry all day or yeah and then all of a sudden something changed her face and then we have we made breakfast together or no then it escalated or so whatever happens. I'm curious about it. I don't

503
01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:40.860
Ariel Mirabal: Buy it very, very, I am curious to know, like I said, I remember a couple of times I've done it in my life, but

504
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:46.680
Ariel Mirabal: I can say it's been quite a while. So I definitely would like to experiment with that. This week I'm going to do that.

505
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:58.890
Ariel Mirabal: And then just so I can make sure it stays in my head through the week. It's what is the nicest thing I can assume what is the nicest assumption that I can make about her. Yeah.

506
01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: My, my wording is a little different. What that's fine, whatever works, whatever you're going to remember

507
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, remember, then go with that. Okay.

508
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.020
Ariel Mirabal: I'm

509
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:17.130
Ariel Mirabal: Sorry, I just want to remember that anytime of, like, whatever it might be.

510
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.010
Ariel Mirabal: Any disagreement or anything. I even noticed it's not even there yet. It's just

511
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.140
Ariel Mirabal: I definitely try this and see how

512
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.740
Ariel Mirabal: It goes

513
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:26.430
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

514
01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:27.690
Ariel Mirabal: Maybe no one wants to

515
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And just know that that's not the end of the story. That's, that's one piece of a complex interaction, right, our human interactions, they're complex there's so subtle all these nonverbal communications, etc. So, um, let's take a look at next week.

516
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Four. Do I need to message the dark, are you all just let her know you're here.

517
01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:00.660
Ariel Mirabal: And then she can take a graph, I'm fine right now. Okay.

518
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

519
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to stick with this one for me 20

520
01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:17.460
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, and on Wednesdays 16

521
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're good.

522
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Week.

523
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Sounds good.
