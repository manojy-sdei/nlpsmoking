Jonathan Figg: Okay, so, um,

Jonathan Figg: Okay, over the last seven months as your use been increasing.

64
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:20.070
TW801: Or decreasing when I went into the program. I tried to go in and cut it off completely. So I didn't have a myth, but I

65
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:39.330
TW801: got injured and I just couldn't not have them. And during that period of, you know, sobering and and trying to get my life together and seeing what I was going to do out here, it wasn't going to be something I was going to not do it. Okay. All right.

66
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.340
Jonathan Figg: And so before you're in their recovery program. These last seven months, were you using more and more opiates over time.

67
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.570
TW801: I don't know if I'd even ONE MORE PILLS. It was that

TW801: Heroin

70
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.270
Okay.

71
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.050
Jonathan Figg: Heroin, okay, how are you using those

72
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.310
Jonathan Figg: As looking okay did you inject it on

73
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.370
TW801: Never and I did a lot of time with mess over the past year. Okay.

74
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.050
TW801: Do

75
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.610
Jonathan Figg: I should. Okay. Um, and

76
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.450
Jonathan Figg: Have you ever been treated with Suboxone or buprenorphine before these last few weeks.

77
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.550
TW801: No, I'd never

78
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:44.550
TW801: Thought about methadone or any other treatment. So I got into SRC, people started talking

79
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.890
TW801: About it.

80
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.390
Jonathan Figg: Okay, I got you. Okay. Um, and

81
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.260
Jonathan Figg: So you

82
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.130
Jonathan Figg: Were in the program where you abstinent for a time before you were started on the Suboxone

83
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:14.910
TW801: I know I came from the hospital where I was still on opiates. There was maybe three day period where they put me in the mission before I got accepted.

84
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.500
TW801: So I went out and I I went out there, but I was taking my opiates as well. Gotcha. Okay.

85
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.510
Jonathan Figg: And how much Suboxone. Have you been taking in the past few weeks.

86
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.590
TW801: And they just started me on the 60 day

87
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.330
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so it's two eight milligram films or tablets.

88
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.640
TW801: Yeah, okay.

89
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.330
Jonathan Figg: Are you taking them at the same time or split between two doses.

90
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.660
TW801: Time and happy to do that.

91
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.310
TW801: In the morning

92
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.810
Jonathan Figg: Okay. Um, did you start on a lower dose than that.

93
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.180
TW801: No, that's what I study

94
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.980
Jonathan Figg: You choose where you started. Okay. Have you been noticing any side effects are problems with that dose of medication.

95
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:15.870
TW801: I don't know if it's a side effect. I've been sick, but it's been a long time and I started coughing up red. So I don't know if that was from this thing, or if that's just because I've been coffee for so long.

96
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.860
TW801: It was just something I was noticing. Okay.

97
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.550
Jonathan Figg: That's not, that's probably not related to the Suboxone

98
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.690
Jonathan Figg: That does sound like something should be evaluated.

99
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.400
Jonathan Figg: As the has that dose kept you out of withdrawal.

100
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.620
TW801: I think so. I mean, I started to do anything.

101
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.660
TW801: I know I didn't take any yesterday because

102
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.810
TW801: Well, because they didn't have one. I don't know.

103
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.950
TW801: Why withdraw is everything eight

104
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.310
TW801: That's

105
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.380
Jonathan Figg: What's kind of the pattern symptoms that you develop in withdrawal so

106
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.650
Every

107
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.870
Jonathan Figg: And then what happens

108
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.550
TW801: I'm sorry.

109
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.190
Jonathan Figg: Okay, um,

TW801: Everything.

112
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.920
Jonathan Figg: And then what happens

113
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.900
TW801: Sometimes

114
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.330
TW801: Not yet.

115
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.660
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

116
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.530
Jonathan Figg: So you haven't had those symptoms so far since you've been on you.

117
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.410
Jonathan Figg: Know, right, yeah. Okay.

118
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.480
Jonathan Figg: And do you take any other medications.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.540
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

122
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.560
Jonathan Figg: And

Jonathan Figg: Are you allergic to anything.

124
00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.760
TW801: And this villain.

125
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.650
Jonathan Figg: Penicillin ampicillin something in Toronto was in between there.

126
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.170
Jonathan Figg: Okay, gotcha.

127
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.950
Jonathan Figg: And are those recent allergies or was that something from childhood.

128
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.110
TW801: It wasn't that it was just wrapped around said okay

129
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.810
Jonathan Figg: What about the ampicillin.

130
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.890
TW801: I don't, I don't remember. I mean, I assume it's probably just the same thing.

131
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.220
TW801: They're just ones I've always said

132
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.040
Jonathan Figg: Gotcha. Okay. The just all your life. You've told people were told me

Yeah.

134
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:56.910
TW801: Okay.

135
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.450
TW801: But the composition was

136
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:09.270
TW801: severe nausea and stomach bleeding. Okay, just all something similar, where it was.

137
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.490
TW801: Maybe that was the bleeding and the other one was severe nausea.

138
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.330
TW801: Okay.

139
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:25.110
Jonathan Figg: That sounds like it's accurate. That makes sense with the tour at all with the costume. Okay. Um, have you had any recent lab work.

140
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:34.800
TW801: Um, no. I have to get some done. I've got my first. Well, I mean, I guess I have had recent lab work done.

141
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.790
TW801: For the bicycle program. Maybe it was

142
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:50.220
TW801: I don't know, was trying to get all these different things from the doctor and my health in order so I did have some things done at Quest, and I have some things lined up to do

145
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:04.770
Jonathan Figg: No, not yet. Okay. So we need to follow up on that, that's fine. I'm okay. I'm

146
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.700
Jonathan Figg: And when's the last time that. Sorry about that. Timers going on. Whoops.

152
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.770
Jonathan Figg: Okay, awesome. Um, have you had any other long term occupations.

153
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.480
TW801: Yeah.

154
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:40.560
Jonathan Figg: Okay. Um, when we think about family history we usually talk about mom, dad, brother sisters

155
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.990
TW801: So Amanda sisters

156
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.700
Jonathan Figg: Does anybody else have problems with misusing medications or drugs.

157
00:13:48.630 --> 00:14:00.570
TW801: And my dad was an addict. My biological father died when I was 12 and his addiction my step dad was an outage. She's 30 years clean and activating a

158
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:18.180
TW801: My family on that side is what straight edge and then my dad as a very large family so speckled throughout the there's addicts and not but not anyone that I keep in close contact with. Okay. All right.

159
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.360
Jonathan Figg: Um, let's kind of all the history that I need just to make sure I understand the background that

160
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.320
Jonathan Figg: You have and

161
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.510
TW801: Other medical things that we want to be.

162
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:38.460
Jonathan Figg: So let's, um, let's talk a little bit about how bright heart program our program works. So we are an addiction treatment, recovery program.

163
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:55.770
Jonathan Figg: We do all of our treatment by telemedicine and we use zoom like we're using right now we're structured around weekly support groups where we put people with other people who have similar backgrounds have similar

164
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:09.060
Jonathan Figg: Problems and are in various stages of recovery, so that you can support each other, kind of like an NA meeting would be the group is led by a therapist who has a background in addiction medicine.

165
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:23.790
Jonathan Figg: And the meetings are about a week, excuse me about an hour long each week at the same time and they start with a check in with the doctor so you get access to the doctor who's treating you on a weekly or every other week basis.

166
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:34.410
Jonathan Figg: Now, when we can make sure you have the right dose. So you're not having to try it, you're not having cravings, that we can address any concerns about relapse ahead of time.

167
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:45.270
Jonathan Figg: On we can make sure that you have a good supply of medication and don't run out all of those things. And then the therapist usually has a topic.

168
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:56.940
Jonathan Figg: There, you know, there's a period of like sharing and the therapist usually has a topic about relapse prevention or stress management or something to that effect to help support. Everyone does that make sense.

169
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.340
Jonathan Figg: Yes. Okay, cool. Um,

170
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:12.120
Jonathan Figg: Did. So you've been on the buprenorphine now for just a little bit of time did they explain how that medication works and what it does.

171
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.180
TW801: I don't think so. No. Okay.

172
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.510
Jonathan Figg: So you you in the past, you are using

173
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.650
Jonathan Figg: Let's say you have like hydrocodone phones.

174
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.060
Jonathan Figg: So Norco is what I see in the reason

175
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:44.100
Jonathan Figg: Why hydrocodone is an opiate medication and activate certain things in your brain. And those things that important things are one, it activates a pleasure center in your brain. That's what gives the high to

176
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:55.560
Jonathan Figg: It reinforces the need for it. So, it builds a dependence and three, it turns off your wakefulness. So it can make you sleepy and it can turn off your breathing.

177
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:05.280
Jonathan Figg: That's the overdose. Right. Those are the kind of the four things that opiates do buprenorphine is an opiate but it works differently. It only

178
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.290
Jonathan Figg: Hear me okay

179
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.430
TW801: Okay, so

180
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:22.470
Jonathan Figg: buprenorphine will stop withdrawal, because it is an opiate it helps reduce cravings, because it doesn't have the withdrawal and it doesn't have the high that other

181
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:38.430
Jonathan Figg: Opiates do it blocks of other opiates. So if you're on buprenorphine and you use something else in a normal amount, it will prevent that other thing from working. So it helps prevent people from getting high.

182
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.740
Jonathan Figg: Or using other drugs because they don't get the effect that they're looking for.

183
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:57.120
Jonathan Figg: And then it's a safer medication because it does not. It has basically a limit beyond which it doesn't do any more.

184
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:13.140
Jonathan Figg: If we go about like 32 milligrams. So you're on 60 milligrams usually be on 32 milligrams doesn't have any additional effect. So it's very, very difficult to overdose on or hurt yourself with. So it's a safe medication. So that's why we like you were an orphan.

185
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:26.100
Jonathan Figg: That's why we're able to prescribe it kinda like any other normal outpatient medication as opposed to like methadone, where you have to show up every day and take it in front of someone does that all make sense.

186
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.690
Jonathan Figg: Yes.

187
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.040
TW801: Good. Okay.

188
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:44.250
Jonathan Figg: So the way starting into the program we work is we one I give you another prescription for Suboxone so you had severe text, which is buprenorphine alone.

189
00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:04.890
Jonathan Figg: The preferred medication is a combination of buprenorphine and Alok so naloxone is the reversal agent and it's an abuse deterrence in the pill or in the tablet or film. So what happens you you've learned to dissolve the tablets under your tongue. Correct. Yeah.

190
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.450
Jonathan Figg: Okay, as long as you take it. That's the correct way to take as long as you take it that way.

191
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:23.880
Jonathan Figg: You only get the buprenorphine. You only get the medication that helps prevent here withdrawing cravings and and that kind of thing. The no oxygen does not get absorbed. But if someone were to misuse it either, you know, crush it up to snorted shoot it.

192
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:33.900
Jonathan Figg: If they chew it up and swallow it, they don't get the buprenorphine and instead get a whole bunch of new locks on which puts them into withdrawal and prevents them from getting

193
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:45.810
Jonathan Figg: High off the medication. So it's an abuse deterrent to make sure people take the medication correct way and the combination helps has been shown to help prevent people from relaxing.

194
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.030
Jonathan Figg: Because it encourages them to be consistent, take the medication and appropriate

195
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.290
TW801: Way that makes sense.

196
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.610
TW801: Okay, cool.

197
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:03.780
Jonathan Figg: Um, so we definitely prefer especially for people who have a history with prescription medications. We don't want this to be

198
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:22.200
Jonathan Figg: We want this to feel like an appropriate medication that you take every day, kind of like how someone with high blood pressure might take a blood pressure pill. It's just a pedal that helps you feel healthy and be functional and continue your recovery. Does that make sense.

199
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.490
Jonathan Figg: Right.

200
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.240
Oh,

201
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.190
TW801: My god.

202
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.820
TW801: A lot

203
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:33.660
Jonathan Figg: Actually right yeah don't want things to be a fix. We want things to feel normal. So

204
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.620
Jonathan Figg: What I'd like to do is write a new prescription since you already feel relatively well

205
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:57.390
Jonathan Figg: On 16 milligrams. And I don't think you're having side effects withdrawals or cravings. Those are the three things that we care about there. I would stick with this dose. I'll write your prescription on. Do you still have a current supply of the buprenorphine that you got from other programs.

206
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.900
TW801: For

207
00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:59.730
Jonathan Figg: You're totally out

208
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.850
Jonathan Figg: Yeah okay, I'm going to write the prescription right now this morning and I want you to go to the pharmacy and about an hour, hour and a half.

209
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:23.490
Jonathan Figg: To find out whether they're going to kick us kickback the prescription and require us to fill out a form because sometimes they do that and it delays things and I want us to find out about that as early as possible so that you get the medication as soon as possible. Okay.

210
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:30.660
Jonathan Figg: And then, and then I'd like to see I have

211
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:41.910
Jonathan Figg: relapse prevention groups on Tuesday at 3pm and Thursday at 3pm when either of those times work well for you.

212
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.130
TW801: Um, yeah, those are both after my other classes, it

213
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.890
Jonathan Figg: Is there a preference on one versus another.

214
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.850
TW801: Not particularly. Either one will work for me.

215
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.170
Jonathan Figg: Okay. All right.

216
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:09.120
Jonathan Figg: All right, how about our Thursday at 3pm groups. So what we'll do is we'll enroll in that one of the groups, like I said, they're done through zoom. Just the same way, we're having this meeting and

217
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.080
TW801: What you'll do

218
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:16.080
Jonathan Figg: Is you'll call on zoom you'll call the virtual clinic, which is the number you called before me.

219
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:28.770
Jonathan Figg: About and the first time we want you to do it at least 1530 minutes before the group would start just to make sure anything extra is taking care of paperwork or

220
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:37.710
Jonathan Figg: Any extra communication that they have for you and then they'll give you the number for the group room, kind of like how they gave you my number.

221
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:46.230
Jonathan Figg: That you can get into the group and that group number changes every week. So you do have to login or you do have to call the virtual clinic each time.

222
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.680
Jonathan Figg: For group, okay. I'm okay and then

223
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:59.430
Jonathan Figg: Let's see, I think. Let's make sure I have your correct pharmacy.

224
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:06.060
Jonathan Figg: In our systems. So I show CBS on hatch road, is that correct for you.

225
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.880
TW801: That is

226
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.740
TW801: Yeah.

227
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:12.900
TW801: But

228
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.210
TW801: Well, I just moved from

229
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:22.920
TW801: The facility to house not in series and more and Invesco that new your problem.

230
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.170
Jonathan Figg: Is there a better pharmacy for you.

231
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.210
TW801: CBS

232
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.020
TW801: CBS

233
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.280
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, there's a CVS over on

234
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.570
Jonathan Figg: Carpenter run

235
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.910
TW801: A carpenter, Tom.

236
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.380
Jonathan Figg: Where are you sorry

237
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.010
TW801: I'm on Tali and Marja

238
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.720
To

239
00:23:59.490 --> 00:23:59.820
See

240
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:12.180
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so there's that. And then we pharmacies. Let's see if this is why we have Google Maps, right, this is, this is what, let's see, there's a

241
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.000
Jonathan Figg: There's a CVS or Rite Aid right over.

242
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.610
Jonathan Figg: At the corner of McHenry and brings more that looks like it's

243
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.510
Jonathan Figg: Probably relatively close

244
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.470
Jonathan Figg: To all these a long road, though, but you're down in the desk. Oh.

245
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:41.400
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, there's a CD. Yeah, it looks like the CPS over on Carpenter in Kansas is probably fairly close to you what I tell you to do is

246
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.900
Jonathan Figg: If you can

247
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.600
Jonathan Figg: Maybe

248
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:56.640
Jonathan Figg: Find out what the nearest pharmacy is to you after we from this call and then

249
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:10.770
Jonathan Figg: Call the virtual clinic and let them know they can update that and all I'll hold off on sending that prescription here for just a little bit so that we can find out what the best pharmacy for you is, do you know the exact address right now.

250
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.630
TW801: Is 1412 not burning

251
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.520
Jonathan Figg: Okay, here, that helps. Yeah.

252
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:26.730
TW801: My bad 1216 smell burning. Cool. Okay.

253
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.820
Jonathan Figg: 16. There we go. So now I can map right where you are. And now pharmacies.

254
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:49.620
Jonathan Figg: Okay, yeah. Let's see. Um, the, probably the CVS. Yeah. Probably the CVS over on Greg's more the corner brings more McHenry So it'd be South southeast of you.

255
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:58.200
Jonathan Figg: Is probably the best closest one to you. There's a Walmart in the opposite direction. So either one. Whichever you prefer.

256
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.650
Jonathan Figg: And so all update your pharmacy is the CBS okay for you.

257
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.290
Jonathan Figg: Yeah. OK, cool. So all update your pharmacy. I'll send your prescription

258
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.270
Jonathan Figg: And then

259
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.860
Jonathan Figg: I'm going to have

260
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:27.660
Jonathan Figg: The care coordinators who you talked to before me follow up with you to get your lab records. That's the only thing we want to make sure that your livers working well and that you've been tested for HIV and hepatitis.

261
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.040
Jonathan Figg: At some point in the recent past. Okay.

262
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.350
Jonathan Figg: Okay, I'm done. That's all I have. Do you have any questions or concerns right now.

263
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.750
TW801: I don't, I don't think so. Okay.

264
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.330
TW801: All right, so we decided going to which which yeah

265
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.780
Jonathan Figg: It's going to be CBS at

266
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.280
Jonathan Figg: Let's see the actual address of the CBS

267
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.200
Jonathan Figg: Is 1700 McHenry Avenue and it's at the corner of McHenry And Briggs more

268
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.840
TW801: Okay, okay. Yeah.

269
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.440
And then

270
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:22.740
Jonathan Figg: Okay. And then do you understand about column a virtual clinic and that the group will be Thursday at 3pm.

271
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:35.640
Jonathan Figg: Yes, there is a 3pm okay that I'll have, I'll just have the care coordinators follow up with you about the lab work so that we can get those records. Anything else I can help you with before we go.

272
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.800
TW801: Know that you've got everything

273
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:41.730
TW801: Wonderful.

274
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:51.360
Jonathan Figg: You so nice to meet you. This morning, Tanya and then I'll look to talk to you again next Thursday at three, okay.

275
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.960
TW801: Okay, thank you so much.

276
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.750
Jonathan Figg: My pleasure. You have a wonderful day. Take care.

277
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.110
Jonathan Figg: Bye bye. Thank you.

278
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.430
Jonathan Figg: Alright, so during the

279
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:14.520
Jonathan Figg: Video we pulled her jurors report, which shows, she's recently been prescriptive morphine and then before that she was prescribed Marcos and

280
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.600
Jonathan Figg: Inventors as well. And then we pulled her as I am.

281
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.330
Jonathan Figg: Which

282
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:39.600
Jonathan Figg: Was not concerning and she's appropriate for buprenorphine treatment and we pulled her expert and an audit scores zero, so I'm not concerned about her drinking and she's recently been in recovery. And then we're going to

283
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.830
Jonathan Figg: write her a prescription for

284
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.580
Jonathan Figg: People for Suboxone

285
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.230
Jonathan Figg: eight milligrams twice a day, and she'll be in the

286
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:53.760
Room.
