00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.760

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.780
Lindsay Short: Hello.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

4
00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.080
Lindsay Short: Pretty good, how are you

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good. I'm good. And, nice to meet you.

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice to meet you. Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're going to complete what's called a bio psychosocial

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it won't take very long. We can usually get them done pretty fast.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm going to ask you a series of questions and then if you'll just elaborate on the questions that would be awesome.

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay, what brings you to bright heart.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.470
Lindsay Short: Um, I've had a problem with heroin and meth for a while and I need help getting off of it.

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right. Um, any

12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any pain issues.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.810
Lindsay Short: No. Okay.

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you tell me a little bit about your substance abuse history like at what age did you first use, what was the substance that you first used and how did it progress to where you are today.

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:19.410
Lindsay Short: Um, I didn't really use hardcore drugs for most of my life. It was just like drinking and weed and then when I went to New York for school. I messed around a little bit with heroin for a minute, but

16
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360
Lindsay Short: I'd lost access to it and it was only a couple of months and

17
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.940
Lindsay Short: Never went back to it until fairly recently. It's a, like a year and a half or so. Two years at the most.

18
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.390
Lindsay Short: And I think it's no

19
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.180
Lindsay Short: Self medication or you know treating underlying depression and things more than anything.

20
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.590
Lindsay Short: When I

21
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.420
Lindsay Short: Like sorted out. It's just like, I don't care type mentality.

22
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.400
Lindsay Short: Just want to escape. So, um, and then the

23
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.980
Lindsay Short: Methods been I was on Adderall, for many years, and

24
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.010
Lindsay Short: That was helpful, but

25
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.680
Lindsay Short: I never. Well, I did for a while, take what I was supposed to. But after a while. I started taking more and more and then buying it on the streets and then it got to be too expensive. So in order to function I

26
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.940
Lindsay Short: transitioned over to me so

27
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long have you been using that

28
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.610
Lindsay Short: Same about the same amount of time.

29
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.320
Lindsay Short: A couple years, maybe a little bit more on them.

30
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, let's see any past treatment.

31
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Substance Abuse Treatment

32
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.670
Lindsay Short: Yeah. Um, I've been in kind of rehab facilities, more than once, but

33
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.040
Lindsay Short: It was kind of

34
00:02:49.350 --> 00:03:01.230
Lindsay Short: It wasn't actively like I wasn't using any part anything hardcore. My parents put me in these places because they didn't really know what to do with me when I was a mess just it's like issues, I guess you'd say,

35
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the next question. Any mental health treatment or diagnosis.

36
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.890
Lindsay Short: Yes.

37
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.560
Lindsay Short: Depression, anxiety,

38
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.620
Lindsay Short: And I'm sure there's been other diagnoses. But that's, I mean,

39
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.340
Lindsay Short: Many treatments. Many hospitalizations.

40
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.660
Lindsay Short: Not

41
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just so it's Ins and Outs 5150

42
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.010
Lindsay Short: Yeah, in New York. I was hospitalized for like three months, they won't let me offer it up.

43
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.780
Lindsay Short: Okay.

44
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Three months. Wow.

45
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.720
Lindsay Short: Yeah, that's pretty

46
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.980
Lindsay Short: did more harm than good, I think. But yeah.

47
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.910
Lindsay Short: Three months a long time and California can never get away with that. I don't think

48
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

49
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

50
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.480
Lindsay Short: Is pretty

51
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I guess. Um, okay. So any past suicide thoughts or attempts

52
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.090
Yeah.

53
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.860
Lindsay Short: Couple.

54
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.620
Lindsay Short: somewhat serious I'm

55
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.680
Lindsay Short: Serious

56
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.210
Lindsay Short: I'm multiple just kind of calls for help, but

57
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when was your last

58
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your last one.

59
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.440
Um,

60
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.290
Lindsay Short: It's been a while. I'd say the last was

61
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.850
Lindsay Short: When I got back from New York.

62
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.610
Lindsay Short: The first time and that was in like 2012 maybe

63
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, okay. And what about thoughts. Do you still struggle with that. Or has it been that long since you've had any thoughts to

64
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.320
Lindsay Short: Know, I still struggle with thoughts, but I'm just like promised myself and my mom and everybody that I would never

65
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.900
Lindsay Short: Consider that again so

66
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, it's nice that you have them to be able to bounce it off of, you know,

67
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.300
Lindsay Short: Someone I did. Yeah, and I

68
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:19.590
Lindsay Short: Can't blame them. But like I I hurt my foot. My mom through so Martel, so kind of I'm not allowed to even say like I'm depressed. I'm sad anymore because these walls go up and she

69
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.020
Said,

70
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.230
Lindsay Short: She just can't handle it. So, and I get it.

71
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any past or current homicide thoughts or attempts

72
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody says no. Most people look at me like, what

73
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

74
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about self harm any cutting or Bernie or anything like that.

75
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.130
Lindsay Short: Yeah.

76
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.040
Lindsay Short: started cutting when I was 21

77
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.640
Lindsay Short: And I don't really know why my life was what I, you know, that was perfect at the time.

78
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:23.820
Lindsay Short: It was like UCLA. I was in a sorority at friends. I was on my way to medical school. I thought, and one day is when I got really drunk and angry and then it was a struggle for many years to stop doing that. I haven't done that in probably five years.

79
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good, good.

80
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.230
Lindsay Short: Yeah, around the same time as the

81
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.240
Lindsay Short: Last suicide it

82
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:50.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so, um, can you tell me a little bit about your family dynamics, growing up as a kid. Did your parents stay together where they separated or divorced or you adopted. How many siblings do you have, you know, just the basic dynamics around your family unit.

83
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.860
Lindsay Short: Yeah, and my parents were together.

84
00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:01.260
Lindsay Short: My dad died in 2016 from cancer, but they were great parents. I think I was the oldest of three.

85
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:11.220
Lindsay Short: More or less than only child, because I'm, I'm, like, six and a half and eight and a half years older. My brother and sister, but parents were supportive

86
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.590
Lindsay Short: You know,

87
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.690
Lindsay Short: I was

88
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.680
Lindsay Short: The only thing negative. I guess I could say, and I've done a lot of therapy.

89
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:30.930
Lindsay Short: As expected to be, you know, perfect and different in every which way. And, but, I mean, I can't complain. No abuse, nothing I've looked for it. There's nothing

90
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.430
Lindsay Short: Nothing. Yeah.

91
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any mental health or substance abuse within your family unit.

92
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.250
Lindsay Short: No, not that I'm aware of. Okay.

93
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:48.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going back back again to your childhood, tell me what it was like for you in school.

94
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.930
Lindsay Short: And schools, I'm good. I was always very hard on myself and

95
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.050
Lindsay Short: Just did. Well, it came. Easy to me the most part.

96
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You graduated. Well, obviously you graduate. If you went on to college right

97
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely did you complete college

98
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.940
Lindsay Short: It took me a while. Um, but yeah, I got

99
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.360
Lindsay Short: Undergrad I did at UCLA, and then I went and did my Masters later.

100
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you have a master's

101
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.720
In nursing

102
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey, good job.

103
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:28.980
Thank you.

104
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any no military background know

105
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past or present legal issues. No.

106
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.230
Think

107
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think

108
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any

109
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Current or

110
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Current financial stressors. Sorry.

111
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.420
Lindsay Short: student loan debt.

112
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, don't we love that.

113
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.500
Lindsay Short: Other than that, no.

114
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, do you currently have any children.

115
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you currently in a relationship.

116
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:14.040
Lindsay Short: Yes, I have a boyfriend. We've been together about a year, but he doesn't know. I mean, he knows about my past, but he doesn't know nobody knows about any of my substance abuse like whatsoever.

117
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

118
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.270
Lindsay Short: And that's probably like one of the biggest stresses is

119
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.460
Lindsay Short: Yeah, fear of being discovered.

120
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What would happen if you told them what do you think would happen

121
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.770
Lindsay Short: Oh, he would be gone. My family would probably

122
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.310
Lindsay Short: Give up on me and it just

123
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.860
Lindsay Short: That'd be

124
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.340
Lindsay Short: Pretty sure sure as lose everything.

125
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

126
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me why you're working with bright heart. What are some of the things that you think that you need to work on.

127
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.180
Lindsay Short: Self esteem.

128
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.080
Lindsay Short: Self forgiveness relationship like communication.

129
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.200
Lindsay Short: And

130
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:02.730
Lindsay Short: Just

131
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.690
Lindsay Short: Being holding myself accountable and

132
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.810
Lindsay Short: Not living in denial

133
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, I don't think you live in denial. I think you're living in fear.

134
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.710
Lindsay Short: It's easy, though in the day to day to be. Think of it. I don't have an issue and, you know, because, yeah, I can

135
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.850
Lindsay Short: I don't know, I just can convince myself that

136
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.970
Lindsay Short: Though it's hard to come here and

137
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.420
Lindsay Short: I guess face reality or

138
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.700
Lindsay Short: Address. What I've really been doing to myself and look at it.

139
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that, you know,

140
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We are definitely not a judgmental lot

141
00:10:49.140 --> 00:11:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we are here to help you succeed right and walk through this and it's important that we build you up so that you're okay with you. You know what I mean.

142
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, okay. So my next question is do you do you attend to any kind of self help groups or meetings or anything like that.

143
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

144
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Is it something that you're interested in doing or not interested in doing.

145
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:27.870
Lindsay Short: Not really. Um, I've done in the past and I wasn't a big fan. But more than that, it's just I don't really have the time.

146
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.640
Lindsay Short: Hard enough to keep the appointments here, I just work my work schedules kind of unpredictable. So

147
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.200
Okay.

148
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:46.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, I was just curious because there is a program that is called women for sobriety.

149
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's

150
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you ever heard of smart recovery.

151
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.360
Lindsay Short: Mm hmm.

152
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so it's off of that philosophy really is is more

153
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:20.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: smart recovery based and new life based but it really builds women builds your self esteem, the things that we need as women to succeed, you know, and to overcome all of those things. It's a little bit more different. It's different than a or na

154
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can get phone support, you can get you can go to online zoom you know zoom meetings. If you choose. They don't have them every day.

155
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Depending on your area, you know, they'll have them on certain days.

156
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They have

157
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A huge amount of literature that can help as far as self affirmations as far as agreements with yourself.

158
00:12:53.070 --> 00:13:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing, you know, really something for you to think about even just diving into a little bit of

159
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of their literature to help build up your self esteem and different things to be able to build up you know your daily affirmations on where you're at right

160
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:24.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, it's pretty amazing. I have a few women that I work with that are actually, you know, diving into some of the literature and stuff and

161
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I went to an amazing

162
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:33.570
Lindsay Short: Facility, a long time ago that was based on that model. I don't really remember anything about it though, be something to consider.

163
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's definitely something to at least go in and and look at and even if you could pull off, off of their literature page the daily

164
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do they call it. It's not daily affirmations, but they have a different word that they call it. And so you're not

165
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not

166
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh gosh, I totally got tongue tied. Hold on, let me pull it up so that I can explain it in the correct manner.

167
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want to get it wrong.

168
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or sobriety.

169
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely different. I love the literature that they have

170
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's levels, instead of step work.

171
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is called a new life program is what it's called.

172
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then I see acceptance statements.

173
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.450
Like

174
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.960
Lindsay Short: The 12 STEP program. I remember that much.

175
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Us you liked it better than vegetables.

176
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah, yeah.

177
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.190
Yeah.

178
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.710
Lindsay Short: Search based I think then

179
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.770
Lindsay Short: Yeah, and the higher power and all that.

180
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of people do have an issue with that and and that's okay because, you know, a isn't you know it's not recovery and sobriety. It's about you. You know what I mean.

181
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not about anything else. So if you look at these

182
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can see the difference.

183
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think of these

184
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So this is what they call the acceptance statements and so to get into the mindset in the morning what I've been asking some of the women that I work with is to

185
00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is to either go to the website in the morning or download this one page and read it every morning that you get up.

186
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, you can read it on your way to where you can read it, you know, while you're getting ready for work.

187
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it really puts that positive thought process in your head.

188
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just start your day with and it's something. It's up to you, you know, really, because this is about you and what you're comfortable with.

189
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But this is like a start. You know what I mean, this is about getting you to that point where you're comfortable with with who you are.

190
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

191
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think

192
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.280
Lindsay Short: I'm open to it.

193
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yay.

194
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm glad only because I know that

195
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:03.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I definitely wouldn't. I definitely wouldn't promote something that I didn't believe in. You know what I mean.

196
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:22.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that a lot of people struggle with the spiritual aspects, the higher power aspect of a na and so there has to be other things we can do to promote self esteem to promote, you know, living a healthy lifestyle to be okay and comfortable in our own skin, you know,

197
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I like to, there's plenty of stuff to read articles.

198
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They even have one on self esteem. It's pretty amazing.

199
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I encourage you to go check it out and see if it's, you know, stuff that you're willing to work with work on

200
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to see if maybe it's something that would work for you.

201
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think

202
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I bet you're busy so you're technically a nurse right graduated as a nurse.

203
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.430
You

204
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holy cow, you're busy.

205
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:14.070
Lindsay Short: It's not even that so much. I mean it is that, but it depends, like some right right now, I'm just kind of just going, minute to minute by

206
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.860
Lindsay Short: Just coming off heroin and everything.

207
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:31.410
Lindsay Short: I feel like I'm just reacting to my mood of the moment and doing what I have to do to keep functioning. So, I mean, if that would help. That's great. But sometimes they feel like it's too much effort.

208
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.090
Lindsay Short: Yeah.

209
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, can I, how many, how long do you actually have silver and I asked you that

210
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.120
Lindsay Short: Weeks maybe

211
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.600
Lindsay Short: bleak see week however long I've been prescribed Suboxone

212
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you got to be kind to yourself right now because you are in this whole transition

213
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.800
Lindsay Short: Over though.

214
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.020
Lindsay Short: I mean, I'm still using the math.

215
00:18:59.220 --> 00:18:59.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

216
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we want to get you to a point where you're not

217
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right. Definitely.

218
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And as a nurse, you know, the medical aspects of that.

219
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.780
Yeah, absolutely.

220
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:32.490
Lindsay Short: I mean, I hate it. And I hate myself for using it and but I still have to keep functioning and I don't know how to do that without it you know it. Also, I had in my mind that it would be more doable to address one thing at a time. I don't know. Maybe that's just bullshit.

221
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you mean to address like the heroin usage versus the that's

222
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.670
Lindsay Short: Yeah, do that. Heroin first and then later but

223
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.730
Lindsay Short: I was all I just don't know how

224
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

225
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm trying to think. Because, you know, you've already addressed. You've already started addressing the heroin issue.

226
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you've you're in a map program to to, you know, with medication assisted treatment to be able to stay away from the heroin piece. And so now we've got to get to get you to a point where you can do the same thing with math, you know,

227
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just kind of

228
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get some distance between you and

229
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the math and you know I you and I can do.

230
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know we can do therapy on a regular basis.

231
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And devise an action plan for you to be able to wean yourself off.

232
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And get away from it. If that's the most comfortable way to do it for you. It's up to you.

233
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.410
Lindsay Short: I think I needed just like a week off of life to be able to go sleep.

234
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.180
Lindsay Short: You know,

235
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:57.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was gonna be my second question, do you have, is there any way that you could take a couple days off work and have the weekend. If you don't work the weekends and then back to back a couple weekdays, to be able to

236
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.450
Lindsay Short: Live, but it would need to give like a couple months notice

237
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:04.920
Oh, wow.

238
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a long time.

239
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know that the the detox from math is really sleeping and eating and

240
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of self care.

241
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.030
Lindsay Short: dreading it

242
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:30.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it really is. It's just about taking you know what Bas being kind to yourself, knowing that when you're in this emotional roller coaster.

243
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're exactly going through what you need to go through to get you know it completely out of your system, you know, but it's surely is nothing compared to heroin, trying to get off heroin and you're physically very sick right

244
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.430
Lindsay Short: Medication. It's a piece of cake.

245
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, with medication. It's a lot easier. Which is why because a lot of people continue to use because they're afraid of that which are all

246
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:58.890
Lindsay Short: You know,

247
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like they use it. First, you know, to for the high, then the highs gone and they're just using to feel normal.

248
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, avoid being said with methods, a little bit. You know, it's a lot different, because you don't have all those physical ailments that go with the detox. You have tiredness.

249
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: emotional rollercoaster.

250
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

251
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You feel like you're starving all the time.

252
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you you know your body's been lacking this substance you know that

253
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is good for you. You know what I mean.

254
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it wants to keep it.

255
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm more than willing to work through this with you.

256
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:44.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

257
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:54.510
Lindsay Short: I want to get through it. I just wish there is a way like which there's a medication or it could be sedated for withdrawal person.

258
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

259
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.510
Lindsay Short: They don't do that.

260
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's really nothing to there's really nothing you know unless they not you know unless you go and they you get knocked out for three or four days, but

261
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it's you just lose days that way with method, you know, the detox really isn't

262
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That so much physical is what it is emotional and mental you know

263
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.460
Lindsay Short: Much more scared of the emotional burden. I can handle the physical

264
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, um, I don't know if you're aware of this, but you know any kind of addiction treatment that you have to take time off from work for really falls under HIPAA and

265
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is a medical issue, you know that right

266
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.070
Lindsay Short: No.

267
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is

268
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if even if you thought about going to a detox some kind of inpatient detox for two or three days.

269
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would fall under HIPAA, it would fall under short term disability.

270
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

271
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.380
Lindsay Short: You could just tell them that I had a medical needed medical leave

272
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or something. Yeah. Yes.

273
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Qualify for, you know, FM la

274
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to research.

275
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And look into.

276
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Might be

277
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, an avenue for you to

278
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to go, you know,

279
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.720
Yeah.

280
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.990
Lindsay Short: That would be amazing.

281
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:43.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. And yeah, they don't your work doesn't have to know, again, it's a medical issue, it falls under HIPAA

282
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's kind of where we sit with it. So something to think about.

283
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.680
Lindsay Short: Yeah.

284
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a shorter faster way.

285
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:04.920
Lindsay Short: Of detoxing off Madden, you know, definitely look into it, my bosses. I mean, I just was thinking if it would be

286
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:24.840
Lindsay Short: If you give me hell like past be passive aggressive, he can. He's a neurosurgeon, and he thinks he's God's gift and I serve him basis so nice guy. In general, but if I did something like that. I just worried that it be make my life, however long time after

287
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.320
Lindsay Short: I don't know, I can do it though.

288
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, just explore your options and see, you know, what's going to be the best route for you to be able, you know, to do it and either which way you decide to walk through this with you. Whichever way you decide to do it. All right. Just know that you have support and

289
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm here.

290
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll be here.

291
00:25:51.720 --> 00:26:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whether you go through detox and come back or whether you just, you know, work at it at home. I think my concern is about you working at it alone at home is that you're alone.

292
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you still got to put up you know this presence with your boyfriend and your family that you're okay when you're not feeling okay

293
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.000
Lindsay Short: That's the thing with my boyfriend. I mean, I've been

294
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:23.100
Lindsay Short: Sick. Many times this year. Just when I was trying to come off and heroin before, but something like this would just, I don't know how I'd explain it.

295
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.350
Lindsay Short: Yeah, he going somewhere, though.

296
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, for a couple days.

297
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.170
Yeah.

298
00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to think about. Yeah.

299
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so we're done. I mean, it was pretty painless. They didn't do your bio psychosocial

300
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I heard it's

301
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.240
Lindsay Short: nearly as bad as I expected.

302
00:26:46.770 --> 00:27:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I know a lot of people like I've done, I've used to work at a residential treatment center and sitting with people doing a 30 page bio psychosocial that asked repetitive questions. It's like

303
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just apologize. I remember apologizing. Like, I'm so sorry because you've already answered that question, but I have to ask it again.

304
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

305
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, bright heart has it condensed and exactly what the information that they need. They have so it's pretty painless.

306
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.270
Lindsay Short: And then with brighter.

307
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Almost a year now.

308
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:33.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing I came from a residential treatment program and I wanted to get out of that setting and really

309
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:39.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Come into the setting and work from home, and that's what I've been doing since it's pretty amazing.

310
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.420
Lindsay Short: Whole new thing that I didn't know existed until recently, but it's pretty cool.

311
00:27:46.020 --> 00:28:01.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. Okay, so, um, I what I would like to do is for you to set up a schedule an individual session for next week with me. And let's discuss what your options are and what direction you want to go.

312
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again I will walk through it with you if you're going to do it at home, you know, we can check in daily. We can check in every other day. We can check in twice a week, you know, whatever is going to help you.

313
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how I can support you in the best possible manner, while you're going through this. Okay.

314
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.440
Thank you.

315
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we do that for me.

316
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.910
Lindsay Short: We'll do that.

317
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and then do some research and let me know what you decide to do

318
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.080
Lindsay Short: Sounds good.

319
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:35.340
Okay.

320
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, Lindsey, I will talk to you later. And I'm looking forward to seeing you next week.

321
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.300
Lindsay Short: Alright, thanks so much.

322
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Have a great week.

323
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

324
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, hello.

325
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

326
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.810
Misty Bailey: I'm doing good. How are you

327
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am doing awesome.

328
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How Was Your Week.

329
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.380
Misty Bailey: Not

330
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.050
Misty Bailey: Just kind of

331
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.620
Misty Bailey: Doing

332
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:20.310
Misty Bailey: I don't really think of much anything exciting that happened this week I painted birdhouses with the kids. I completed a puzzle.

333
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.790
Misty Bailey: More most exciting things that happened this week, I suppose.

334
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.020
Is work.

335
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Works going good.

336
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.580
Misty Bailey: Yeah works going just fine.

337
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:38.580
Misty Bailey: Couple more potential projects came in, so that's good. It's always good to make money.

338
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.940
Misty Bailey: Yeah, my, uh, my life is kind of boring, which I prefer so

339
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame you. Mine is too. And thank God you know out of the chaos and into the piece.

340
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think we just get to a certain point where

341
00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Chaos just no longer works, you know,

342
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What to eat. Debbie Debbie's

343
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.620
Misty Bailey: Stressful and hectic sometimes

344
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, big time. Very much so.

345
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I drink it a smoking. Are you doing

346
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.130
Misty Bailey: I am light.

347
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:25.770
Misty Bailey: I'm trying to because I got a thing that you stick your laptop on that has fans to help keep the computer. Cool.

348
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:41.490
Misty Bailey: My computer tends to I'm on it all the time. And so when I'm on it. It's usually video calls and stuff. And I'm also trying to charge it at the same time, and it just tends to get hot, but the problem is is I just got it and the cord is like

349
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I sort

350
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:52.290
Misty Bailey: It's actually like that long. It's like your computer's way over here and I'm having put it way over here and like adjusting

351
00:30:53.490 --> 00:31:04.860
Misty Bailey: Until I can figure out how to get a longer court because it's USB to USB and the new MacBook Pros only have four USB seaports

352
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think I see

353
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no actual USB ports, right, because I, that was my struggle was not having that's the sea. Right.

354
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.120
Misty Bailey: Yeah, that little circular kind of round looking one

355
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:38.310
Misty Bailey: Yeah, yeah, yeah. My only has for us BC, which is odd because, I mean, hopefully things will start going to a universal USB see at some point.

356
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:49.350
Misty Bailey: Like I'm upset that the new iPhone 11 we're still at their old table and didn't upgrade to the newest USB see because everything is upgrading to that point, and even their pros or USB see that

357
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.430
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I mean, that's all I have to complain about. I'm doing pretty good so

358
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's crazy, because you have to get the in adapter from Mac or from Apple

359
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.590
Misty Bailey: Mm hmm.

360
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For it to be able to connect a USB two and that's been my struggle with it too is just that I can't plug anything in you know into it, except my my iPhone. The only thing I could plug into it.

361
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.960
Misty Bailey: Got at one point, I got a cheaper.

362
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:35.910
Misty Bailey: I got a cheaper like a cord from for my laptop and because Apple. Apple cords are just their trash.

363
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:50.190
Misty Bailey: The My computer is slightly over a year old, and within the first six months, the apple core just died. It wouldn't charge me. And so I had to end up getting one from like Amazon and they're so expensive.

364
00:32:51.540 --> 00:33:02.160
Misty Bailey: Expensive apples, just an expensive product to have and I used to use Android, but I switched over to Apple when I started working for gravity jack because literally everything is apple

365
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:08.970
Misty Bailey: Mm hmm. All our computers, everyone's phones. Every like everything we do is apple. And I'm like, it gets I gotta jump on the bandwagon.

366
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gotta get on the Apple. Apple, you know, Apple definitely has its good good points about it for sure.

367
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:27.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, they are very, very expensive, very expensive and every thing you know you got your mouse that you got to buy separate you got

368
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: earbuds you got to buy separate, you know. It's crazy. By the time you're done, you've invested couple thousand dollars in a system and and every piece that should come with it.

369
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To run it.

370
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

371
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:42.990
But it doesn't

372
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.420
Misty Bailey: Pray Terry information on primary software.

373
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. I agree with you. So tell me some of the things that refresh my memory. What are we working on today.

374
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:09.420
Misty Bailey: So mostly is kind of what we were working on last time we just patience and then I kind of spoke a word about other things that I might need to work on. And part of that is like

375
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:29.160
Misty Bailey: Empathy, not the greatest empathizing with people and I realized that I don't lack empathy, especially when it comes like animals or like definitely if someone's like embarrassed or upset, like on TV or play correctly. I have empathy in general. Yeah, sometimes I'm just not very good.

376
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:44.400
Misty Bailey: At empathizing, I suppose, like last night, for example, my friend comes in and he's like one of his co workers, Zach. Turns out he has like a lower lung infection and he has just been he's been gone for like the last month and a half and just came back last week.

377
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:51.060
Misty Bailey: And he has to leave again because he can't come back until all this stuff is over with. Because now he's considered high risk.

378
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:58.740
Misty Bailey: Which then we're going to kind of a kind of a crappy slot, because now he's having to do work six days a week for the scalable future

379
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:08.790
Misty Bailey: Kind of a situation. And I'm just like, well, we're money and he's like, well, not really. And I'm like, well, more like I'm thinking of trying to like think of positive things and he's just, you know, grumpy about it.

380
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:17.070
Misty Bailey: And rather than empathizing that he's like a crappy I'm just like, why can't you just not be upset. Like, deal with it. It's life occasionally

381
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:25.470
Misty Bailey: Crap isn't going to go your way and you're going to have to work and you're going to have to take over your responsibilities, like, what are you going to do about it, but like nothing. Just stop pitching.

382
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:36.780
Misty Bailey: But instead of like emphasizing me like, okay, yeah. Understand, like you're upset and the sucks for you. I tend to go the opposite direction. I'm just like, get over it kind of a situation.

383
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:50.520
Misty Bailey: That with the stove, the other day, we have a we live in, like, a field at area kind of right outside of town, so we can have a lot of mice and the mice will put like dog food into the oven.

384
00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:00.180
Misty Bailey: And so I was like, You need to get the dog food out of the oven, like we need to work on this. And then, of course, he was just like instantly past like, doesn't my project for the week. And it just gets like

385
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:08.430
Misty Bailey: Basically any minor inconvenience for him turns into like it's huge drama fast and, in my opinion, like I'm just more like shopping, get it done.

386
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:21.780
Misty Bailey: It's like some things take maintenance takes maintenance. It's called having a house. Get over it. Instead of empathizing with him. How do you take time out of his day to do that kind of stuff.

387
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.270
Misty Bailey: So I struggled with that.

388
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:39.510
Misty Bailey: Quite a bit. Just in general. I'm saying with like the kids like when they're bored. Like, that's an important. I don't care, find something to do. And I heard entertainment like I just don't. I'm just not very good empathizing with people.

389
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.420
Misty Bailey: When situations occur.

390
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's really about how you present the information. It sounds to me like you know i don't know how we can, how we can develop empathy and if we don't start first, changing the way that you're giving the information

391
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean like you just identified the ways that you should have responded versus the ways that you did respond

392
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

393
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:14.460
Misty Bailey: Yeah, kind of the way I I mostly try to like not respond like

394
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:25.170
Misty Bailey: President when he's doing like the stove. I just walked away. I didn't say anything to him because I knew if I would have said something, it would have been like, get over it.

395
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.190
Misty Bailey: And I didn't want to say that. So it's just like

396
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:37.500
Misty Bailey: Just keep my mouth shut, kind of a situation. And then like yesterday when he was bitching about it and I try to come up with a couple positives. I finally just had him like

397
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:45.150
Misty Bailey: Just sort of told him like can you think of anything positive in this situation. If not, then, you know, why are you complaining

398
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.880
Misty Bailey: And I could tell you, like, really upset about that.

399
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.660
Afterwards,

400
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, I know this sucks. And I'm really sorry that you have to, you know, do this.

401
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is what it is you know

402
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really

403
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My favorite statement. Used to be, you know,

404
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's the cold hard truth.

405
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:25.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get over it. It is what it is just the cold hard facts right and so really, really, that piece and and being able to to even if you don't feel empathy or you you don't feel that empathetic piece.

406
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those things that the way that you respond to it.

407
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.090
Is

408
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is the vital importance of it.

409
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know definitely we all come come into situations where

410
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:52.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We don't feel empathy, like maybe somebody is has brought the situation on themselves. And it's hard to feel indebted to somebody that that you know, does that, you know, to mean well, does that. But in the same sense, it's like

411
00:38:53.430 --> 00:39:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: reeling back and in really realizing what to say versus what not to say hey you know what I mean is really it. It's like

412
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your head. There's nothing wrong with in your head saying it's just the way it is. Life's hard, you have a house. These are things you have to deal with. But really watching what comes out of, you know, out of your mouth, saying, you know, you got to change it.

413
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Eventually, maybe you might develop a little bit more empathy. But, you know, you're pretty cut and dry, you know, this is just how it is. And you know, it's not it's not a character flaw. It's just a piece of who you are.

414
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:45.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And there's nothing wrong with it, missy. Just some people don't know how to how to respond, you know, or they get upset because you because you lack

415
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you lack empathy. People think that you lack caring

416
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And reality that's

417
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's absolutely not true. You care.

418
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just not about the situation. This is just a part of life. These are things that we have to do. Just do it, get done with it and get on with life. Right.

419
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:14.520
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I mean that's how that's how I've always just kind of good stuff is no matter what we're going to have situations where she had just isn't going to go our way.

420
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.940
Misty Bailey: Yeah, rather than complaining about it or getting upset about it.

421
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:25.800
Misty Bailey: I actually read an article the other day, I don't know. I really, really, really wish I would have like saved it but it was about how

422
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.500
Misty Bailey: People big traumatic events don't affect people the same way that a bunch of like small inconveniences do that are

423
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:34.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

424
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:52.350
Misty Bailey: In our body is designed to overcome these big obstacles like something really tried to cabins and we have a way to be able to handle that. But when like little small inconveniences come about that doesn't kick in and we just don't handle in the same way we would handle big situations.

425
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:59.430
Misty Bailey: Yeah, and I feel like sometimes that's absolutely me and I feel like that in general is like

426
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:09.780
Misty Bailey: I don't know. I thought it was super interesting because I can totally see that. Because to me, most inconveniences aren't a big deal. But when I have a ton of review the really, really small things that just don't go my way

427
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah.

428
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:17.160
Misty Bailey: You know, you just kind of get frustrated and you just kind of blow up a little bit. But yeah, for me.

429
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.280
Misty Bailey: I don't know. I thought it was just really interesting just kind of article. Yeah.

430
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. And the more that that you read on different on empathy.

431
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How to develop empathy.

432
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, a lot of times

433
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good example like what is empathy.

434
00:41:41.400 --> 00:42:01.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: According to influence influential psychologist Daniel Goldman empathy is one of the five key components of emotional intelligence, a vital leadership skill, it develops through three stages cognitive empathy emotional empathy and compassionate empathy. So, which makes sense.

435
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, let me share this with you.

436
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:15.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to be doing all this research on how they develop empathy now. Thank you. You gave me a project. I love it.

437
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so this is from what's called mine tools.

438
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go up and look. See, and a lot of times, you know, when

439
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We always as therapists, go and look for new things to be able to work with our clients with

440
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so for me this is you've just given me a challenge. I love it.

441
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cognitive empathy. Right. It's about being empathetic in your head.

442
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cognitive empathy is ability to understand what other what other person might be thinking or feeling

443
00:42:54.060 --> 00:43:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It need not involve any emotional engagement, but by the observer. So in no emotional engagement by you managers may find cognitive empathy useful in understanding how their team members are feeling and therefore what style of leadership would get the best from from them. Today's

444
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Similarly sales executives can use it to gauge the mood of a customer, helping them to choose the most effective tone for conversation cognitive EMPATHY IS THE MOST RATIONAL into in

445
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: lecture hall. I almost couldn't say that word and emotional neutral ability. This means that some people use it for negative purposes. For example, those with a

446
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mac, she'll I can't even say that word personality trait may use cognitive empathy to manipulate people who are emotionally vulnerable. Okay, I get that piece.

447
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But for us it's about

448
00:43:53.550 --> 00:44:00.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thinking it. But basically, first off, it's about changing that that that thought process to

449
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, if I was if I was in his shoes. How would I feel in this moment, I can understand his frustration. You know what I mean. And then really giving kind words. You know what I mean, saying kind things. So you're speaking hypothetically.

450
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

451
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost like fake

452
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost like faking it till you make it so learning how to change the way that you

453
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you respond to people.

454
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right until you actually feel it, because the next piece is the emotional empathy.

455
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:48.600
Misty Bailey: Cognitive empathy. I feel like I could, for sure. Work on that more I understood. I feel like I understand what someone else might be thinking in a situation

456
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.960
Misty Bailey: Like I can understand, for example, right, be frustrated to have to fix this up because that is rushing because it's like crap. I gotta do this.

457
00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:04.200
Misty Bailey: I then after that point. That's what I struggle with is like, okay, I understand how you be frustrated. However, get over it.

458
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.550
Misty Bailey: Like, that's kind of where it stops it stops it like, okay, I understand why you'd be sad or upset or frustrated

459
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure.

460
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.700
Misty Bailey: But now it's time to put on your big boy panties and just deal with the situation.

461
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe that maybe that piece is what needs to not be said

462
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It could

463
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:34.680
Misty Bailey: See, I don't normally I don't say that this is this, but this is why I think I have a tendency you rather not say anything.

464
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nothing at all.

465
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:44.760
Misty Bailey: I hate confrontation and in relationships. I'm very much. I don't like to fight. We don't like to start fights and like parasites.

466
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:54.720
Misty Bailey: And when I feel like an argument might come on, or what I say might potentially cause an argument. I literally just walk away and go do something else. And I'll say anything.

467
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To

468
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.560
Misty Bailey: Me, that's a better alternative than starting an argument.

469
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:06.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you ever go back and address the issue.

470
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:14.910
Misty Bailey: Sometimes, depending on what it is oftentimes I will give myself a little bit of time to determine if it's been worth it, like, Okay. Was it me just being like

471
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:24.300
Misty Bailey: Because even whatever reason or upset, for whatever reason, or is this like a pattern or is it something that I need to address it. I think it's me. I need to address. I will address it later down the road.

472
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:31.710
Misty Bailey: More so, especially with him. Please calm, because he he's a very, very emotional dramatic person.

473
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:41.310
Misty Bailey: So the opposite. So I have to be super careful about when I bring some of like that because if he's already having like a whatever moment.

474
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:50.160
Misty Bailey: That it's just not worth it at that time when he's already kind of frustrated or something. So I have a tendency to just walk away.

475
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and then come back and adjusted when things are calmer and

476
00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:06.930
Misty Bailey: Yeah, if I feel like it needs address. Sometimes it's like okay I was just being crappy for no reason. Like, no point in me addressing it because I was literally just being a bitch. So there's that.

477
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: did go back and apologize if you were out and feel like you were Adeline

478
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:23.760
Misty Bailey: Oh yeah, oh yeah, always be the first took photos and like, okay, I'm sorry, I said that. I'm sorry. I was that way. Like, that wasn't that was rude of me, or that was like unkind of me if I ever feel like I did something wrong. I have

479
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.970
Misty Bailey: Indefinite Mila a humility to be able to be like, You know what, I, that was my my bed.

480
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, see, that's good.

481
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really good. And I also know that

482
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:44.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The tone the eye contact, the body language, all of that plays a factor in our communication. Right.

483
00:47:45.750 --> 00:48:02.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so it does when you're trying to show somebody empathy as well. You know, if you're speaking in a kind tone if your words are are sincere, you know, then all of that they pick up on as well, you know,

484
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of makes a difference. So it starts up here, it would that thought process.

485
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:09.120
Misty Bailey: Through

486
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:24.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The connection with the with the mouth and what exactly you're saying, and you know piece of it is is walking in their shoes, saying, you know, I have no idea what it feels like to be in your shoes. But if I were in your shoes.

487
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can see all your frustrated. I can see how you're hurt. I can see you know

488
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really, you know, that's really kind of the start of it.

489
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: developing empathy.

490
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:39.270
You know,

491
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about for yourself.

492
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.110
Misty Bailey: What do you mean

493
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you show yourself empathy.

494
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.440
Misty Bailey: How, how does one show oneself empathy.

495
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, like

496
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you've been hurt if you

497
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Said things that you wish that you wouldn't have said you feel bad. You go back into your apologize, but do you do you show yourself that kindness that you're trying to develop for other people.

498
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.400
Misty Bailey: Gosh, I guess I'm not sure what you mean.

499
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It when you do something that you feel that you need to apologize, do you beat yourself up mentally or do you just accept it. All right. I took that I did that, you know, that's it. And do you move forward, is what I'm asking.

500
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:36.810
Misty Bailey: The ladder for sure.

501
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.220
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I'm not. I'm think I'm pretty

502
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:56.340
Misty Bailey: I don't have low self esteem in any in any means to, like, I'm not another kind of person to think on that or oh ugly or oh I just like this. Everybody or oh like

503
00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:11.340
Misty Bailey: Sometimes I'm like really big, like I used to get Botox my forehead and like, like with Botox back because I these two huge lines. And I'm like, I just don't want to get one. I'm older. But it's not like oh my god I'm hideous because I have these two huge like indented my forehead.

504
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:23.070
Misty Bailey: I could probably do something to help prevent those in the future kind of situation or like, I don't know, I just, I don't. Again, I don't have like really neat like

505
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:36.990
Misty Bailey: Self esteem issues, I suppose. Like I don't beat myself up over anything I pretty much think things is like a learning experience when I do something. Something to learn from not something to dwell on or

506
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.540
Misty Bailey: beat myself up over, I guess.

507
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is exactly what we try to teach people right we try to teach people don't beat yourself up over something identify it change the behavior and move on.

508
00:50:51.600 --> 00:51:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've already got this really huge head start on so many. And so many of these thought processes that a lot of people struggle with, you know that right

509
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:11.340
Misty Bailey: No, I guess not really i don't i don't know how other people really like think about going away. I know that people tend to do that.

510
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:22.290
Misty Bailey: Like, like I know people tend to have anxiety or people don't have depression or or low self esteem or I understand. I understand where that can come from for a lot of people. Yeah.

511
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:32.160
Misty Bailey: I'm not sure why I've never felt that way. Um, I think part of I wouldn't say part of it is thanks to my dad. But then I see how my sister turned out and I'm not so sure.

512
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:38.430
Misty Bailey: This is just very, very different than I am, because when I was very much like a very prideful person like

513
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:46.260
Misty Bailey: My maiden name is browns. He's like, where the grounds, you're, you know, you're around like you can do anything you know he was very, very, very supportive.

514
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:57.000
Misty Bailey: And very much like you can do whatever you want to do if you put your mind to it. Like there's nothing you can do. So my dad's always been that kind of like just get up, do it.

515
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:06.900
Misty Bailey: A lot of my personality traits I think come from him and I was adopted from them you adopted me so like just a lot of his like mannerisms like

516
00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:15.750
Misty Bailey: The get up and just do it. Just don't sit around my dad's like one thing, growing up. You never ever ever said the word hang out.

517
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:25.830
Misty Bailey: Because my dad's like nobody's hanging out. That's not a thing you do. You don't hang out hang out when you get in trouble. He's like, what are you doing like you need to be doing something

518
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:32.970
Misty Bailey: So my dad always instilled like you know if you're going to go somewhere, you need to do it because we have a reason a purpose to do something.

519
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.340
Misty Bailey: At home just hang out.

520
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And watch TV years

521
00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:41.070
Misty Bailey: It's not like he was opposed to like downtime was really a friend's house to hang out.

522
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:49.650
Misty Bailey: There not. I'm going to go my friends house, and we're going to watch movies. Okay. Like that kind of having a purpose for what we do.

523
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. Because I totally understand that whole concept I totally do.

524
00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:09.990
Misty Bailey: Yeah. Mostly it's because he didn't want me to get in trouble. He's just like hanging out just gets you in trouble coats, you'll go off and do just stupid stuff he was a teenager. Once he's like, you're totally. No, but I had, I had an unusual amount of freedom as a teenager.

525
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:14.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good because you're trusting right

526
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:26.940
Misty Bailey: Yeah yeah I screwed up. I screwed up all the time. And my dad never like took away my freedoms, it was more of like what did you learn from that, like, one time I didn't come home on time and my

527
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.530
Misty Bailey: Curfew I think was like 2am

528
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.860
Misty Bailey: So it wasn't like I had an early curfew.

529
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.530
Misty Bailey: And I didn't show. So my dad boarded up the house in the house and I had to seek out my car.

530
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:42.780
Misty Bailey: And he's just like,

531
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.980
Misty Bailey: Are going to come home for curfew. I was like, yeah.

532
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:47.670
Yes.

533
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.430
Misty Bailey: Like that was his kind of like

534
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.300
Misty Bailey: I guess punishments or whatever because, yeah, I did. I screwed up a lot as as a kid as kids do.

535
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.730
Misty Bailey: I would screw up all the time, but it was one of those situations where he just let me make my mistakes and

536
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.510
Misty Bailey: And I'm super thankful for that because a lot of my like

537
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:16.350
Misty Bailey: When people turn 18 or 21 they want to go out and they want to drink and they want to have all this freedom and they're finding out from the parents dumb and they go kind of hog wild.

538
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's

539
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:28.080
Misty Bailey: My life when I turned 18. I'm like, I'm kind of overdoing that because I did a lot of that as a teenager always out party always out friends always out drinking always out just like just doing whatever

540
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:38.340
Misty Bailey: I wanted. Then when I turned into an adult. I'm like, that's not so fun anymore like getting so drunk that I can't function for today's isn't really fun anymore.

541
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:44.670
Misty Bailey: Yeah job. I've got to pay bills like so I got a lot of that out when I was a lot

542
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Younger

543
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:56.250
Misty Bailey: The guy just let me he's like you know what you're, you know, you never drive drunk, you never do like you have these set of like basic values and yeah you get in trouble, you get to the party or something like

544
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:57.900
Misty Bailey: So,

545
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:00.840
Misty Bailey: It's not that big of a deal so

546
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What what awesome parenting.

547
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:17.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Definitely letting you learn your own lessons and yeah i mean i mean that's awesome. Honestly, it really is because it's really taught you a lot, you know a lot

548
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What to do, what not to do. You know what I mean. Test the fire, and if it's hot, stay away from it. And you know, that's really kind of what he has instilled in you and that's amazing. I just want to tell you that

549
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.070
Misty Bailey: Yeah.

550
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:32.700
Misty Bailey: I have a

551
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:41.400
Misty Bailey: Lot of respect for my dad you know he's he's in blind Native American man that adopted, not just one, but two kids that were his

552
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.760
Misty Bailey: And he didn't have to

553
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:52.350
Misty Bailey: Wait, didn't need to because both he's on my birthday. Again, so he's my little brother's birth certificate, but we are actually his kids.

554
00:55:53.790 --> 00:56:03.030
Misty Bailey: And I don't know, like, as an adult, thinking about that. I can't think of any guy that's like, yeah, let me put my name on this child's birth certificate that isn't mine, like who does that.

555
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:08.490
Misty Bailey: Yeah, apparently he did because he was with my mom during this time. So yeah, he did that, but

556
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:23.370
Misty Bailey: My sister. On the other hand, my sister has like nothing but horrible things to say about him our childhood, like the cheap. She's a little bit. So right now, she needs to get off all the medications that she's on

557
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:30.450
Misty Bailey: Some sort of like mental Institute rehab situation pretty bad.

558
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

559
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, definitely different. Huh.

560
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:44.760
Misty Bailey: Yeah, it's interesting because we just turned out so dramatically different. My sister is a wicked, wicked smart individual

561
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:53.730
Misty Bailey: Lindsay waken smart and she just who thought process is so bizarre. It's like

562
00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:55.920
Misty Bailey: She's been

563
00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:02.010
Misty Bailey: Diagnosed with so many different things and it's all by this like one doctor

564
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:12.990
Misty Bailey: Which makes me like it concerns me because I feel like this doctor is a pill pusher in my personal opinion because my sister's on like over 13 different medications, including like

565
00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:20.220
Misty Bailey: Painkillers like two different types of prescription painkillers, she's on like bipolar medication, she's on like just like

566
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:31.020
Misty Bailey: Everything you can possibly think of. And she has a guitar malformation, and she went to a surgeon up in Seattle and the surgeon was like, it's not bad enough to operate on

567
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:46.530
Misty Bailey: Like it's it's not bad enough, like you shouldn't be having all these issues. My sister is that kind of person that will have all these issues and if she find something that fits that criteria. Julie holds onto it for dear life is a reason why she's

568
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.090
Misty Bailey: Like

569
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:57.000
Misty Bailey: Broken, I guess. And then, so he didn't operate on her and then he went she went to a place here in Spokane. It was like, I'm having migraines.

570
00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:03.720
Misty Bailey: And the doctor migraine clinic was like, okay, we can help you but you got to get off all this medication first and then we can help you like we can't

571
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.230
Misty Bailey: Help you those that occasion, of course, her responses.

572
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:20.040
Misty Bailey: To satisfy your. They don't know what the heck they're talking about data and she gets very violent very aggressive very like everybody else's stupid, but her like she has an issue and nobody wants to help her. And I'm like,

573
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:34.350
Misty Bailey: Well, Jay. They can't really figure out what's wrong with you, it could be like a side effect of one of these many medications. It could be a rebound headache from all the pain pills or it could be like a whole fluid or things that they don't know if you're still taking stuff.

574
00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

575
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:47.880
Misty Bailey: And so having a doctor that's prescribing her like pain pills and prescribing her psych medication one doctor prescribing all of that. I just feel like she found someone that will prescribe or whatever she wants.

576
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:48.690
Misty Bailey: Yeah.

577
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was just hard to find. Nowadays,

578
00:58:51.930 --> 00:59:03.090
Misty Bailey: Yeah, so I feel like I feel like that's this doctor because i don't i don't know any like ethical doctor that would prescribe that many medications in so many different avenues.

579
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: especially nowadays.

580
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:22.530
Misty Bailey: I know and so like I just worry about our lot cuz she just she'll have her up moments and, but for the most part, what she just isn't this weird like just the stuff she thinks and says, isn't the kind of stuff. She used to think and say, like, even five years ago.

581
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:25.200
Misty Bailey: And I just feel like the amount of medication, she's on

582
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.020
Misty Bailey: Has really messed with her mind a lot

583
00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:42.900
Misty Bailey: Like the fact that her boyfriend wants to kisser is like this huge like molestation kick him out. I hate them. It's like just freak out. I'm like dude. It's a normal thing in a normal relationship to kiss your partner.

584
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:49.410
Misty Bailey: Like she doesn't see that it's like this bizarre like concept, you're

585
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How old is she,

586
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.500
Misty Bailey: She's two years. I'm going to be so she has 26

587
00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:56.670
Oh, wow.

588
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would, would the mores, we're talking about her. I thought she was like a teenager.

589
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:03.600
Misty Bailey: He acts like one

590
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She actually how long, how long she been on this medication.

591
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:26.610
Misty Bailey: Finally, the last five years. She's been on some sort, and it just keeps getting, like, more and more and worse and worse. Again, if she can cling to a diagnosis that explains her issues, but she will she'll come to it for Dear, dear life.

592
01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:34.500
Misty Bailey: Like she recently had a car broken into. And I halfway suspect that was not really a breaking

593
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:44.670
Misty Bailey: I have was just like she ran out of pain meds and was hoping that having everything stolen from her, including the pain meds because like Jay, would you have your laptop and your payments and everything on your car.

594
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.830
Misty Bailey: To me, that's just a weird

595
01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:58.920
Misty Bailey: Whatever, but okay so she got much stuff stolen and lady from the insurance that does all the investigations, because if you have an insurance claim they investigate it. And she's like,

596
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:08.160
Misty Bailey: How do I know you are who you say you are. She's like, well, I can send you an email right now. And she's like, okay, I'll look at my at home please like, Well, can you look at it, right.

597
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:21.750
Misty Bailey: Now and then, so we can continue talking so it gets claim going and she just like No, because I don't know who you say you are has no one ever questioned who you are, before. And I'm just like, Jay. That's a really weird. But that's not what normal people think

598
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:24.000
Misty Bailey: People don't really think like

599
01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:30.990
Misty Bailey: Who else would know that you filed a claim on your insurance for these last items like

600
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

601
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:34.140
Misty Bailey: Doesn't make sense.

602
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:37.650
Misty Bailey: But I say that to her because I questioned or

603
01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:51.330
Misty Bailey: Even a little bit. She would absolutely go off the deep end. And she keeps thinking that that needs to be put into a home and I was like, no, that's not being putting all he's crazy. He's going crazy. He's going senile, I'm thinking

604
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.950
Misty Bailey: I think you're the one that's having issues. Yes. My dad is having a lot of memory lapse issues. He's also 67

605
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:08.880
Misty Bailey: Eight restarting to get memory lapse issues, but when I talked to him. He sounds more sane than you do. But that's what I think in my head, but it could never tell her that

606
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

607
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:16.770
Misty Bailey: Like she thinks that dad gave her phone number to the post office, the wrong phone number, the post office. And I'm like, why would you do that. I don't know.

608
01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:24.180
Misty Bailey: Because he wants me to get in trouble and like how would giving the wrong phone number, the post office, get in trouble. I don't know, but it just instantly is like

609
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He did it Maria. Yeah.

610
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:43.830
Misty Bailey: But so she just, yeah. It breaks my heart because my sister is like one of my best friends. And it's been like a recent development. Like, I would say probably the last three to five years that she's really just went wrong. Like I don't know who you are anymore.

611
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:55.200
Misty Bailey: Like I don't know where my sister went because like even her idea of us, growing up. Yes. My dad had a bit of a drinking problem when you drink. He was kind of an asshole.

612
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.030
Misty Bailey: That was about it.

613
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

614
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.690
Misty Bailey: A little bit of a temper problem, but as always have a temporary issue.

615
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:09.330
Misty Bailey: Nobody's perfect. But in my sister's had she had this like horribly abusive like traumatic childhood.

616
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.310
Misty Bailey: I was like, you realize, me and why it were there too. And we don't think that

617
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:20.940
Misty Bailey: Like we don't. We didn't have that would you weren't there when he did all this stuff. And I'm like, I just

618
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:27.780
Misty Bailey: I don't, I don't think so. I don't think this stuff really happened the way you think it happened.

619
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:46.500
Misty Bailey: Yeah, like, and also, even if he was kind of a dick, when you were kids. Were you ever sexually abused. No. Were you ever hit know did you have food. Yes. Do roof overhead. Yes, Dad. Give you $1,000 the beginning of every school year, get ready clothing clothing. Yes.

620
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:53.640
Misty Bailey: Like, by all accounts, you had everything and more that could possibly ask for growing up.

621
01:03:54.210 --> 01:04:02.220
Misty Bailey: Right, if you wanted to be in sports. My dad was a sports fanatic. If you were in sports, the agreement was he would buy a brand new equipment every year.

622
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:14.940
Misty Bailey: For being in sports, you never have to use use equipment you always get brand new equipment, it'd be an intern season like he would always ensure that we have the things we need, so in my head, I'm like, what, what was so bad.

623
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:15.900
Yeah.

624
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.220
Misty Bailey: I can't think of anything that was so bad.

625
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.920
Misty Bailey: Was a that's yeah was absolutely perfect. No. Didn't have a mom. That's correct.

626
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.040
Misty Bailey: Yes. Yeah, and I only drink anymore but encouraging.

627
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:39.780
Misty Bailey: But nobody's perfect like I could only imagine being a blind 30 year old male with three kids to which are yours that you're trying to support

628
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.590
Misty Bailey: That would be enough to make me probably drink.

629
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.960
Misty Bailey: Especially given me. We are

630
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.530
Misty Bailey: Like thinking back now about all the hell of it. My dad just like

631
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:54.720
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I can see it.

632
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See, there it is right there you just showed empathy for your dad.

633
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.320
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I have so much like I just have so much respect for him.

634
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:09.600
Misty Bailey: Oh, yeah.

635
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:12.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just did.

636
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly what it was telling you to do, put yourself in his shoes.

637
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Imagine how he would feel

638
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just voiced empathy for your that yeah

639
01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.950
Misty Bailey: And I told my dad that so many times. My dad's responses I block it out.

640
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.700
Misty Bailey: All the crazy stuff I did as a kid I block it out.

641
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:37.710
Misty Bailey: It was brings me to

642
01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.220
Misty Bailey: A lot of respect for my dad so

643
01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He just had a lot of empathy.

644
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.110
Misty Bailey: empathy for him.

645
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.000
But

646
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:53.490
Misty Bailey: I mean maybe part of that is that I respect him so much. Yeah.

647
01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:55.410
Like I just respect.

648
01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see,

649
01:05:59.340 --> 01:05:59.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know,

650
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you apply that

651
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To your boyfriend you apply that to these small little things that you feel you know in those areas that you feel that you lack that empathy and

652
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got to be in that same mindset in those little instances as well.

653
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:27.600
Misty Bailey: I think the hard part is I don't understand, like, I understand why they might feel that way. But I also don't understand why they continue to feel that way.

654
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:35.250
Misty Bailey: My dad. It's a little bit different because, again, I think, me and my dad think a lot of life, because I was just taught to think a lot like he does.

655
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:45.690
Misty Bailey: Like for example, my dad agrees that depression is a thing. But God is very open. He's like, yes, I've struggled depression. Do I let it affect me know

656
01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:51.420
Misty Bailey: Like, that's just how he is, and I guess for like me being able to empathize with him is because I

657
01:06:51.930 --> 01:07:02.700
Misty Bailey: Totally think and feel the way that he does. Yeah, empathizing with someone that I don't necessarily agree with, like, I don't agree with the way of handling it. That's where I have a lot more issue with

658
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure.

659
01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:11.910
Misty Bailey: Like I can understand why you get frustrated. But I also don't understand why you continue to stay frustrated or right you continue to let it affect you. I don't understand why you do that.

660
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so changing that to, you know, I understand you know how you're feeling right now I understand where you're frustrated

661
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how can we

662
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get you out of that and that frustration. You know what I mean, and really kind of focusing on helping them veer to the other side of it. You know what I mean, whether it be

663
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Changing the subject and talking about something, you know, a memory of something that was funny, something that you today together something that

664
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:57.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will take them out of that mindset in that moment. You know what I mean that that's showing it. But the as well as you understand that they're frustrated. You know what I mean. But that's as far as it goes. But how can you help them get to the other side of that.

665
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so just being able to do that.

666
01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:06.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They feel that empathetic piece for me.

667
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

668
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.820
Misty Bailey: Yeah, I can see that.

669
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like with the kids.

670
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:22.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I understand you're bored boredom as part of life, you really, really as well get bored sometimes is what are you going to do about it.

671
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. What are our options. What can you do to get out of being bored is their game you can play. Is there a book. You can read his or music he can listen to what is it that you can do to help you not be bored.

672
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

673
01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. So it's like helping them get to that other piece get to that connection of the resolution, would you have the resolution. It's like this is just how it is. Right.

674
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is, I think, the way that you think is awesome. To be honest with you. You know what I mean and applying a little bit of the problem solving skills that you have

675
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To their frustration and helping them get to the other side, really shows more empathy than anything else, you could say or do.

676
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.470
Misty Bailey: You mean telling them only boring people get bored.

677
01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:15.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just say it right, make them laugh about it. You know what I mean, say, you know what I mean.

678
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: make a joke out of it, make make funny to where they're out of that mindset and they're, you know, they're off to something else.

679
01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:32.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What can you do to solve that problem. You know what I mean, I understand, new board and I get it. We all get bored. Sometimes what is it you can do to get out of them.

680
01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and helping them veer towards that solution mind focus that you have

681
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have that

682
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:47.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Now you just need to share it and kind of share it with the people that you live with. It's pretty amazing.

683
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:58.230
Misty Bailey: Yeah. Kids are whole like I can talk about them all day, both good and negative

684
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:01.230
Misty Bailey: One. He just turned five

685
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:05.010
Misty Bailey: Right now, he doesn't understand the difference between the line a joke.

686
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

687
01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.790
Misty Bailey: It's caught lying. He says, I was just joking.

688
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:24.120
Misty Bailey: Yeah, because in all honesty, when we do joke with people, a lot of time is misdirection and it is lying when we talk about two people. So like when it gets caught and in trouble if he's, he goes, I'm just joking. He thinks it's totally okay because

689
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.040
Misty Bailey: None joke. It's a joke is when you

690
01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:33.600
Misty Bailey: Do something I'm true like in his head. That's how it works. And I'm like, What a joke also has to be funny and it can't hurt other people

691
01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:42.750
Misty Bailey: Yeah, like he can't use his little five year old head. You just cannot understand the difference. So we had to talk about, like, be crying wolf as well.

692
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like you

693
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.970
Misty Bailey: Can you say I'm just joking. Everything we're not going to be serious with something serious happens

694
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.440
Misty Bailey: Yeah situation. And he also has his whenever you get some chiller now.

695
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.380
Misty Bailey: His responses. Well, I was bored.

696
01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:02.070
Misty Bailey: Like, oh I draw on the walls because I was bored. I got to. That's a good enough reason. The hard part is

697
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:14.610
Misty Bailey: Is he stays with us three to four days a week, he said, his mom to three days a week. And then he says his grandparents, one, two days a week and his mom and his grandparents on that side. They none of them work.

698
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:21.270
Misty Bailey: If you know the most don't work. And so they literally do nothing but cater to these two kids all day.

699
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:23.820
Misty Bailey: Like

700
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:31.830
Misty Bailey: For you. We've got activities, we've got things to do and they literally cater to them all day every day.

701
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.460
Misty Bailey: Especially the grandma and it's really, really difficult. So they come over here and I'm like, I gotta work, dude.

702
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:45.360
Misty Bailey: You just got to work. We can see here and play with you all day. They get upset and they act out and

703
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:51.240
Misty Bailey: They want they're just like, because I was born. You weren't there to play with me. So I did whatever I wanted to do.

704
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So in switching that in switching that around right before the day starts

705
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can sit with them and say, all right,

706
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want you to get bored today.

707
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:21.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So here's their choices of activities that you can engage in while I'm working and why your dad is working so that you don't get bored and so that you know little things like writing on the wall doesn't happen. What is it that you're going to choose to do so you don't get bored.

708
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The beginning of the day. Right.

709
01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I really would hate for you to get bored today.

710
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I really would hate that I know that you get bored. A lot. Sometimes me and data work in. So here's some things

711
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To something that when you start feeling bored, you're going to, you're going to do. Here's, you know, here's this here's this here's this choose one that you're going to be able to do when you get bored today.

712
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. So you've already addressed it in the beginning of the day.

713
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:03.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you check in with them, you know, you check in with them in a couple hours have you gotten BORED YET. Have you done you know what you said you were going to do.

714
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, did it work, you know, bored anymore. You know what I mean. And it's just about redirecting their their their mind process their thought process. You know what I mean.

715
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Giving them options.

716
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then holding them to that those options.

717
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:20.700
Misty Bailey: Yeah.

718
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:24.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. It's kind of like a psychological

719
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're basically using psychology to help them get to where they need to be.

720
01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:38.220
Misty Bailey: Right. I just feel. I feel like there's a big disservice those kids because like they go to a private school pretty wealthy private school

721
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:44.010
Misty Bailey: They get kind of everything handed to them on a silver platter kind of situation expression on the wrong side.

722
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:56.130
Misty Bailey: And so they're very like the mom side of the family is very, very well off until they get what they want. And so, Michelle Hudson, the five year old if it takes any like iota of work.

723
01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:04.890
Misty Bailey: If there's like, it's not just pure and unadulterated fun. There's even a bit of work, you just like, I'm out. I don't want to do this.

724
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:18.570
Misty Bailey: Like when we're flowers in the front yard, he only wanted to put in the bolts, because that's the fun part. I told him like you don't dig the hole. You don't get up into the bowl. If you walk away and you can play with the dog and you're out here, then you don't get to put in a bowl.

725
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

726
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:26.430
Misty Bailey: Her brother did the the entire garden at one point he constrictions like isn't my journey to get them involved in like you were gone.

727
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:33.450
Misty Bailey: You did something else you chose spend your time something else, you didn't want to help dig up the garden so you don't get the fun part, putting in the bowl.

728
01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:44.430
Misty Bailey: And then, of course, all sorts of upset because again you still like to even tell me he's like well mom just gives you whatever along if mom gets as a gift. She gives it to me as a gift.

729
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:56.100
Misty Bailey: Whatever mommy and he gives it to me because, you know, that's just how he is you just get anything you want. And I feel like it's kind of a big disservice because he doesn't interact with

730
01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:04.440
Misty Bailey: He doesn't interact with kids that aren't well off. He doesn't interact with anyone that doesn't get what they want. They want it. Does that make sense.

731
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep.

732
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:16.650
Misty Bailey: And to be this is very, very entitled, like, What do you mean telling me that I had to figure out how to not be bored. I have to figure out to be. No, that's your job. Like, that's how he thinks

733
01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The old is a big disservice.

734
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.270
Misty Bailey: I think the older one totally cool. The older one autism.

735
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:37.230
Misty Bailey: But he I super enjoy spending time with him because he's very much more like yeah, let me help. Yeah, let's do some work. Yeah, like he doesn't care what it is if you spending time with you.

736
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:42.900
Misty Bailey: Like I was doing 1000 piece puzzle. A very, it was a bunch of different books.

737
01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:48.360
Misty Bailey: Way we worry about this seven year olds like ability

738
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:55.500
Misty Bailey: And you just sat there and just have to figure it out. I think you got a total of, like, five pieces the entire board.

739
01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:56.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

740
01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.570
Misty Bailey: He says he was like yeah like super excited

741
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:09.570
Misty Bailey: He didn't care that it took lots and lots of work. He's just, I just want to spend time with you. So I'll do whatever you doing oh you're cleaning the house. Well, let me help.

742
01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:10.920
Misty Bailey: Like that's I keep

743
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.380
Misty Bailey: Whereas the younger ones.

744
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.360
Misty Bailey: Just like he's kind of he's kind of the favorite one over there with

745
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:24.540
Misty Bailey: I kind of have a preference to be able to run. I'm not afraid to admit that I prefer one over the other.

746
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:41.430
Misty Bailey: But you can definitely tell that the younger one is probably given the most attention and the most preferential treatment because he's the most needy most I need, I need, I need, I need, I need. Where's the older ones more like I'll just do my own thing.

747
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.690
Misty Bailey: And yeah, I just feel like it's a huge disservice to the everyone

748
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:57.540
Misty Bailey: Yeah, like even we were out hiking and when I told him, I said, Okay, we go hiking. If you chose a trail that goes down, you realize we have to walk up that trail. Right.

749
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:03.900
Misty Bailey: fielder ones like God. Okay, we're not going down that trail yet and eventually we really just want to go down the trail cool but other trail.

750
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:17.790
Misty Bailey: And Hudson's like soon as we haven't started walking back up. He's like, I don't want do this anymore. And the older brothers, like do don't ruin this for me. That's what he said. He's like, Don't ruin this for me because he comes to get a lot of is fun ruined because his little

751
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:27.570
Misty Bailey: Yeah, it was like putting the truck is wake up there. You want wait on here. There's no option but to walk back up.

752
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:33.900
Misty Bailey: Up option. And he's like, well, I don't want to do this isn't, it isn't fun to walk back up and I'm like,

753
01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:45.390
Misty Bailey: Then you want to be stuck out in the middle of the woods, because I'm just going to keep walking. And you can follow me or not. And he's just like he just started freaking out who's like you know me, I'm like, that's it you're five feet behind me.

754
01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.050
Misty Bailey: I could reach out and I'm not leaving you.

755
01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, did he walk up. Yeah.

756
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:59.190
Misty Bailey: Eventually locked up crying crying. Half the way because he's just like, I don't want to do this. I don't want to have to walk a lot of work.

757
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Yeah, you're gonna have your hands full. When that was a teenager, that's for sure.

758
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:11.310
Misty Bailey: I feel bad for the older one because the older one has expressed several times. I'm like,

759
01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:22.320
Misty Bailey: Dude, you're ruining this for me because it's not like if the younger one does something bad. And we had something planned. We had to cancel the entire trip because I can't leave a five year old one alone and just take the older one

760
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

761
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:31.350
Misty Bailey: You have to cancel all of it. And the older one camera and he's starting to realize that I'm not doing anything wrong, but I'm getting punished because of it.

762
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.870
Misty Bailey: And I don't like it.

763
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:43.740
Misty Bailey: And the problem is that I overheard the five year old talking about how he's going to like fake cry to get his older brother in trouble, how he's going to like

764
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.020
Misty Bailey: Tell them tell us that Cameron did something bad, even though we didn't just to get them in trouble because he sat on his bed, he said. He said, I'm

765
01:18:52.350 --> 01:19:00.750
Misty Bailey: Going to tell, I'm gonna tell Mr. You did this is that I can hear them. And so when housing comes out is like camera did this. And I'm like, Cameron sat on your bed.

766
01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:10.590
Misty Bailey: Well, it is my bed. He's not supposed to stand with them like you just lied about what he did. He's like, he's on my bed, and that's just like you're such a manipulative little

767
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.830
Misty Bailey: nippy little like we

768
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:21.240
Misty Bailey: Don't say that. Obviously, to him, but I think I'm like, where are you learning these skills from

769
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:29.220
Misty Bailey: That's not something normal people know how to do. It's something that they're either taught or like reinforced.

770
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, or they watch

771
01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:34.980
Misty Bailey: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking like taught like like that's being by watching

772
01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:43.620
Misty Bailey: who's blind to who like in my head, I'm like, everything we do the house. We never ever ever told the kids don't play a mom.

773
01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.950
Misty Bailey: I'm totally against that 100%. I'm like,

774
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:47.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If we

775
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:59.370
Misty Bailey: Were doing that your ex their mom should know about, we might consider whether we should do that in front of the kids in the first place, or do it at all. Right. Like, that's how it works in my head. I don't like lying or deceiving in any way.

776
01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:08.910
Misty Bailey: And so like it makes you wonder if like on their end of things they say, Don't Tell, don't tell you that don't know, you know I'm saying, like, don't do that.

777
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:17.970
Misty Bailey: It makes me wonder if that kind of stuff is going on because I know it's not happening on our side because we've never not once said, don't tell don't so

778
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.810
Right.

779
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You never know.

780
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:21.960
Misty Bailey: Yeah.

781
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:30.270
Misty Bailey: It's just, you know, it's an interesting thing. So we have to really my boyfriend right now he's actually on his therapist appointment with his

782
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:36.720
Misty Bailey: He reached out to a family therapist to help work with him and his kids to get like a better

783
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:41.130
Misty Bailey: Like how to help raise a kid with autism and help to help

784
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:43.260
raise kids being cool

785
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.270
Misty Bailey: non standard family, right, like how to help

786
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.160
Misty Bailey: With that, because he's just like, sometimes you get overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.

787
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:53.940
Misty Bailey: When

788
01:20:54.180 --> 01:21:05.130
Misty Bailey: The five year olds crying because he wants his mom and he's over here like what do I do like i don't i don't kids. So he took it upon himself about two months ago to find himself a family therapist.

789
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:13.470
Misty Bailey: So one week of just became a therapist, and then the next week. It'll be him. And the kids and therapist that rotates.

790
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice. That's good.

791
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good. It shows that he's willing to, you know, do whatever he needs to do to, you know, help the kids.

792
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.160
You know,

793
01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.410
Misty Bailey: Yeah. Yeah, he definitely has their best interest in mind.

794
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, sounds like it very much so.

795
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're going to work on your responses this week.

796
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and think about how you're portraying the information. And you know what it is that you need to filter through before it comes out.

797
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

798
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And try to

799
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.450
Misty Bailey: Have come out and not just walk away.

800
01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:55.350
Yeah.

801
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:57.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

802
01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we'll just we'll practice that for this week.

803
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we'll expand on it next week.

804
01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see what we can implement and add into it. Okay.

805
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have an awesome week missing.

806
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:13.710

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not, that's not fair fight.

857
01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:28.770
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

858
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.460
Moyocoyotzin: Wall.

859
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was the frustration.

860
01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:40.680
Moyocoyotzin: Nope. Whoo. Whoo.

861
01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:47.850
Moyocoyotzin: You know, we've been married a little over two years and there's no excuse for it. I know that.

862
01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:55.110
Moyocoyotzin: Don't know, or just always fighting. She's always accusing me of things and they never happened. So

863
01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:58.260
Moyocoyotzin: I don't know.

864
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That okay so let's talk about that a little bit.

865
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.320
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

866
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

867
01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're are the things that you're being accused of things that you have a history of doing

868
01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.270
Moyocoyotzin: No.

869
01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.280
Moyocoyotzin: I'm glad you're not

870
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.250
Moyocoyotzin: was locked up all the mirrors. We can i mean

871
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:22.980
Moyocoyotzin: I was working at this place and

872
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:41.100
Moyocoyotzin: I was working at Presbyterian Hospital here in Albuquerque. And the lady was training me and do I know things I had an affair with her and it never happened. Yeah, I mean I see her. I ended up my butt dialing the phone and I was telling the girls succeed and

873
01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:46.320
Moyocoyotzin: You know, and that's where all that came from. So I don't know.

874
01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:52.530
Moyocoyotzin: Which he's always had issues about that's almost from the beginning of our relationship.

875
01:26:54.270 --> 01:27:05.640
Moyocoyotzin: And she's the only one I've been with other than my ex wife that was 18 years ago I met her I dated one girl before her, and that was it. Yeah, I mean I didn't stay with her.

876
01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.020
Moyocoyotzin: I met her in November and new year's day it was over.

877
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:22.800
Moyocoyotzin: Because she was accusing me of she was going to call my PO because I wanted to add Linder, my, my dad bought a blazer and I lend it to her as I don't have a license and she would pick me up and

878
01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:38.850
Moyocoyotzin: She threatened to so I told her I had to take the car and she turned to call my PR me and call the cops and everything else because I wasn't going to get in the car. I got, man. Well, I'm just gonna take off. No, I didn't have a license.

879
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:47.730
Moyocoyotzin: But anyway, long story short, there and and Cody I that I finally met her, and

880
01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:52.620
Moyocoyotzin: They were friends at one time my world, it

881
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hahaha yeah

882
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.420
Moyocoyotzin: So,

883
01:27:58.590 --> 01:28:09.540
Moyocoyotzin: You know, and but I never slept with the other girl. I never eat because I was a I was on that program where for the hepatitis, I had the eight eight week medication and

884
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.290
Moyocoyotzin: My doctor

885
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:18.750
Moyocoyotzin: At the clinic where I picked up health care for the homeless. That's where my P O said me and that's where I got on the Suboxone program there and

886
01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.070
Moyocoyotzin: And that's what happened there. I mean,

887
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:33.240
Moyocoyotzin: She don't miss anyone and do nothing. Because, uh, and I respected her wishes and then I ended up all that she were always fighting to me. And so

888
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:35.520
Moyocoyotzin: I don't know.

889
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:47.670
Moyocoyotzin: Me. I've been I was locked up for a long time. I don't know me and been around women the guards there, but I, those are the end me I'd never talked to them.

890
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you struggle with being able to communicate in an appropriate manner to your spouse.

891
01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:11.970
Moyocoyotzin: That's what Joanna tells me I mean she because I end up getting address but I get mad because she accuses me of things that I didn't even do we, I mean, and it's in her head and she just keeps on and keeps on saying that I did.

892
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Never know what it will. Okay, so if you but dialed her then. Just remember that she heard what she heard and whether or not it was true, or you know anything happened or didn't happen. Whatever Happened in what she heard she heard

893
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So for her. That is

894
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:35.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

895
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:46.830
Moyocoyotzin: Know exactly but you know I even told the girl. I love my wife. I mean I anyone nothing with a with a lady. She was way younger to my daughter's a me

896
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he's

897
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:59.040
Moyocoyotzin: My daughter's just turned 38 I'm going to be 60. I mean, I ain't got nothing in common, other than fucking excuse the word, but that never happened.

898
01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:09.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So okay, so what if, what if, what if, instead of getting mad about being accused of something

899
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about it respond in a in a calm manner.

900
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just deny it, tell your wife that you love her and that it never happened.

901
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:25.500
Moyocoyotzin: I do all that. And I try and I try because we don't get nowhere. Yeah, I mean,

902
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

903
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:39.720
Moyocoyotzin: We tried talk and eventually I did end up getting mad because it just comes on and tells me that it happened, never happened. I mean, I even quit my job because of all that, you know, I mean, and

904
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there may be two months.

905
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.150
Moyocoyotzin: So that maybe

906
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She was trading you but we're flirting with her.

907
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.090
Moyocoyotzin: No.

908
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, she flirting with you.

Moyocoyotzin: She even told me she wanted to have six and I told I told my wife. I mean, I love my wife. I mean, I don't need nobody I got her. Yeah, I mean,

912
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:18.570
Moyocoyotzin: When I got out of the night, you know, my PO and I was seeing her name was Sarah. She was the site there at the clinic and

913
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:34.710
Moyocoyotzin: They didn't believe me they told me. Nope. We. That's the first thing a man comes out of prison he wants a woman I my, my response to that was always trying to get my life together. I didn't have a woman for first time was 20 years and then I went back and did 30 more years. Yeah, I mean,

914
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:38.190
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, I was trying to

915
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:42.840

Moyocoyotzin: Then after that I met. That's how I met Joanna.

919
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:59.610
Moyocoyotzin: A friend of ours said I was dating or and Joanna wanted to tell me

920
01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:07.440
Moyocoyotzin: About this girl because he lied to me from the gauge, he was using heroin. She was on this box and she was using an area.

921
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:19.950
Moyocoyotzin: All the fields, I found that out after you know I mean because I told the straight up where I had been and you know I don't like line. And that's all she did to me was like me and then I met Joe and

Moyocoyotzin: I asked her out and but we talked over the only she told me about about Cecilia and

Moyocoyotzin: I took her out.

925

948
01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:56.370
Moyocoyotzin: So,

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've been out for years you've been sober for years. Right.

01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

971
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How so in the past four years.

972
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about the last four years. Don't think about the time when you were in prison because that's your history. It's done and gone, you've been out in society for four years now.

973
01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:43.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So you think about how you communicate to other people outside of your family unit. I want you to think about how you communicate to other people you communicate with me pretty well.

974
01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:45.540
Moyocoyotzin: Right, right.

975
01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so giving when you're in a frustrating conversation with your wife. There's nothing wrong with saying

976
01:37:54.570 --> 01:38:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm feeling I'm getting frustrated and I need to take a few minutes, I need to walk out walk away from this conversation for a few minutes. Let's come back in an hour.

977
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's talk about this in an hour.

978
01:38:07.650 --> 01:38:16.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. But give yourself those minutes so that you don't break any more phones so that you know your grandkids that live in your house don't hear you.

979
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Throwing phones against the wall. Right.

980
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

981
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:33.480
Moyocoyotzin: It's hard to talk to her because she won't give me that I mean she just keeps on and keeps on and that's what I tell her we don't get nowhere. We stay stuck at that same where you're accusing me of doing these things and

982
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.160
Moyocoyotzin: You know, they never happen.

983
01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:43.110
Moyocoyotzin: I tried to tell her I met enough if I did sleep with a lady, I tell you, you know, I mean that we've been going through this for almost a year now.

984
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:51.420
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, being all the time will be all right for the four days and then she'll start and I mean

985
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.260
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I heard her. I get it. I mean, but I never did what she's saying, I did you, I mean,

986
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know there's something. Okay, so there's physical cheating, right, there's going and having sex with somebody else. But there's something that's also called emotional cheating.

987
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.370
Moyocoyotzin: Right. She told me that, too.

988
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.190
Moyocoyotzin: She tells me that all the time.

989
01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, definitely you know emotionally cheated with this other girl.

990
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:34.410
Moyocoyotzin: Here is I guess she got hurt because I was talking to her. I mean, but we were working with. She was training me but you know I never, I never led the lady on. I never nothing. I mean, she was younger. You know, I don't know.

991
01:39:37.170 --> 01:39:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you know what I would suggest is that you

992
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just validate her feelings. You know what I mean. But tell her.

993
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.140
Moyocoyotzin: Right and join us told me, You mean to talk to you about it, you know, I mean,

994
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:59.820
Moyocoyotzin: Talk to somebody. I mean, I told her. I'll talk to you about it. Yeah, I mean that we, I get another view and

995
01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:02.820
Moyocoyotzin: She's writing. I mean,

996
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:07.860
Moyocoyotzin: You know, and I tried to tell her, it never happened. But she just

997
01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sex never happen. Right.

998
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, okay.

999
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.200
No, that's how we

1000
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, but the emotional part

1001
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:18.510
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1002
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:20.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

1003
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There, that's to that. That's really a thing.

1004
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can take the cell phones for that because you know once

1005
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:45.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: cellphones became such a big huge thing people were going on and text messaging sexting other people. You know what I mean, they never would physically touch them, but the words that they would say they were flirting and talking in that manner to other people, which is a form of cheating.

1006
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

1007
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:57.420
Moyocoyotzin: You know, in the conversations you heard I was telling her, you know, I didn't want nothing. You know, I don't. My wife and she heard all that part two. I mean, and

1008
01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:58.680
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, I don't know.

1009
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:01.380
Moyocoyotzin: That's what I tell her.

1010
01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:16.170
Moyocoyotzin: You heard that. Didn't you say that, but that don't matter. You were still and she do I know the type of person where she had already told me she one third party in a relationship, don't tell nobody nothing and fish to be another woman.

1011
01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.780
Moyocoyotzin: My sister. That's all I got. Is my sister. She gets hurt when I talked to my sister. I mean,

1012
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:27.390
Right.

1013
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

1014
01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, this is what I know, I know that you can't change her

1015
01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

1016
01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can. The only thing that you can do is change your response.

1017
01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what we're working on right now is you right and so being able to change your response to her insecurities.

1018
01:41:51.150 --> 01:41:52.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is going to help you in the long run.

1019
01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

1020
01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:58.920
Moyocoyotzin: Exactly right.

Yeah.

1022
01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:09.120
Moyocoyotzin: We'll have to talk to you more about it than because you know it's you know I love, joy, and I mean she's my life by

1023
01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.080
Moyocoyotzin: I tried to give her EVERYTHING I CAN YOU. I mean, I was where I was at. And, you know, and she understands that you

1025
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:36.480
Moyocoyotzin: You know, because I had told her from the gay. I mean, I, I told her, just like I told Cecilia You. I mean, I don't want to lie. Don't lie to me. I mean, be straight up.

1026
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:54.990
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I ain't going to grow in her and and do something like that. Some my one one know because I did that to my first wife, you know, I mean, I was young guy reason when I was 23 years old I didn't get out till I was 43 years old and she's still waited for me all them years and

1027
01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:01.410
Moyocoyotzin: Like came out, I started doing this in bullshit robbing and using heroin.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember, I want you to remember this. All right, you've got a plethora of females. Right, right.

1065
01:46:22.530 --> 01:46:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What they what you show them what you monitor what you role model in front of them is how they believe there they is how they believe they should be treated in a relationship.

1066
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:37.860
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1067
01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does that make sense.

1068
01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:41.460
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah.

1069
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, you don't. You want to be a role model that shows them respect encourage and love and take no shit from know from nobody. Right.

1070
01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:04.710
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, especially a man. I mean I wouldn't want to be treated. You know when you hear it or anything.

1071
01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.070
Moyocoyotzin: Crazy phrase.

1072
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it in those terms. And I know that it's just a phone, but you know when you boil it down and you break it down.

1073
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:30.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into smaller terms kids really learn what they live. And so if this is what the babies are hearing and what the babies are seeing, then that's what they believe, as normal. That's what they think is okay. Right.

1074
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.070
Moyocoyotzin: Right. Oh yeah, they

1075
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:33.750
Moyocoyotzin: Pick up area for sure.

1076
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they do. So what we want to do is, is to give you some skills to be able to not throw phones anymore when you're frustrated. Right, so that way the next time your responses different and you can respect yourself and respect the house full of females that you have going on over there.

1077
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:56.400
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1078
01:47:58.410 --> 01:47:58.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

1079
01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So that's what we're going to work on the next couple weeks. All right, we're gonna work.

1080
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:22.350
Moyocoyotzin: Excuse me. I was going to you. I didn't have the phone. We tried. I was at work, yesterday, so she's tried to call and get another meeting with Chris and but they wanted to talk to me. She told me when I got home so that didn't happen. I missed a meeting with him again yesterday.

1081
01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:29.640
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I thought I was gonna miss it today, but I told you last week, I'll be here. So,

1082
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important. It's really okay so because you're engaged in a mat program. Right.

1083
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you and I are doing together.

1084
01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:43.440
Moyocoyotzin: Right. They got me on crazy hours. I'm telling you.

1085
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:52.320
Moyocoyotzin: That with all this girl respond on there. They had a lot of people and they're opening up new mexico all the ways soon I think

1086
01:48:52.770 --> 01:49:05.130
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, that's what this was saying. So, you know, we're because we're only bearing coffins. Right now we're doing it out of those, but the cremations, and the ones we put in the Crips, all that are going to be starting now the boss told us.

1087
01:49:06.570 --> 01:49:08.400
Moyocoyotzin: He said, it's been get crazier.

1088
01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:12.390
Moyocoyotzin: Because he got me on call. So I gotta go up when they call

1089
01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but you've also be got to be attentive to your program to

1090
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.540
Moyocoyotzin: I know, I know, and I don't want to be missing.

1091
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I and I know that it's interfering with your schedule, but you've got to be present, you know, and that's Dr all men, you know, he's busy. You know, he's got a lot of patients, a lot of clients that he's working with and he actually sent me an email asking me when

1092
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:47.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was going to see you and reiterate that is vitally important that you're up front for your program, you know,

1093
01:49:47.730 --> 01:49:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you come to group that you come to your meetings with him and your meetings with him will be very long. It's just a check in to see how you're doing things we adjusted

1094
01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:10.530
Moyocoyotzin: Because he had told me when I first started the program, he had told me I gotta be on the thing. I mean, because some people get those two boxes. If he gives him a full prescription, then you won't see them for the whole month you know I'm saying, I get it.

1095
01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:12.870
And

1096
01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:16.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

1097
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:27.690
Moyocoyotzin: She told me she tried to reschedule it, but whoever at the virtual clinic or whatever they told her, they needed to talk to me. And by the time I got home, I didn't even do it so

1098
01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that they're open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so

1099
01:50:34.290 --> 01:50:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can call in and yeah

1100
01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:37.830
And they'll get, like, oh,

1101
01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.320
Moyocoyotzin: I didn't know they were open all day, all night.

1102
01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.480
Moyocoyotzin: All day long.

1103
01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so be, you know, and part of it is because you have to take accountability and be responsible for your program.

1104
01:50:55.950 --> 01:51:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're responsible with work. You're responsible with your family. This is a vital piece of that, you know, this is your self care.

1105
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.070
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1106
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:06.240
Moyocoyotzin: Very good.

1107
01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I'm reiterating to you how important it is that you show up for group.

1108
01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that you show up for your appointments

1109
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and that's what Dr. Element asked me to make sure that you understood. Because what happens when you don't show up. Is it shows you're a non compliance.

1110
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know,

1111
01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even though.

1112
01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't want to be a non compliance your prescription days get shorter because they it puts you in a high risk category. When you put your recovery.

1113
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:48.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right back of the line. You know what I mean. You want your recovery in the front of the line because everything else benefits when you do that.

1114
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.370
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1115
01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.510
Moyocoyotzin: That makes sense. Yeah, it makes sense. I get it.

1116
01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

1117
01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So show up and suit up and show up for

1118
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your for your program. Okay.

1119
01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.180
Moyocoyotzin: Right, okay.

1120
01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.340
Moyocoyotzin: And we'll head.

1121
01:52:09.150 --> 01:52:15.690
Moyocoyotzin: What about this more. I mean, because it's getting crazy. I mean, I try with her.

1122
01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:17.850
Moyocoyotzin: Well, I know.

1123
01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:20.340
Moyocoyotzin: I don't know.

1124
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:22.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

1125
01:52:23.490 --> 01:52:31.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It does get frustrating and I can totally hear it and I totally understand where you're at, with it. But let's change your responses to it.

1126
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you disengage. If you do not engage in the argument, step back. Don't engage in the argument I call it totaling up turtle up

1127
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:42.330
Moyocoyotzin: But

1128
01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:43.710
Moyocoyotzin: What's

1129
01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:44.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your mouth.

1130
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:47.790
Moyocoyotzin: Let it go. Do we both come down there.

1131
01:52:48.480 --> 01:53:01.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, and that's what you need to say listen and you can you can tell her this to my this is what my therapist told me to do. She told me that will work starting to get back in that argumentative cycle for me to take time out.

1132
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Us to take time out.

1133
01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and come back one more.

1134
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:14.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I want you to know that I love you and I want this to work.

1135
01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm going to reiterate that I did not sleep with that girl, and I'm sorry for the emotional anguish that I caused you and that's it.

1136
01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then just step back, take that time that you need so that you don't throw phones so that those babies don't hear you guys arguing. You know what I mean.

1137
01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your response. Once you take the sales from your side. Take out the wind. Take out the argument. Take out the fight. You have nothing to defend if you did nothing wrong. Remember that

1138
01:53:51.810 --> 01:54:02.070
Moyocoyotzin: And she told she told me that all the time because I get defensive because I did do something but I get. I get defensive because I get accused the things I didn't do. That's why give me

1139
01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Change that thought. You have nothing to defend

1140
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:08.250
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1141
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

1142
01:54:10.050 --> 01:54:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank you and you feel yourself getting frustrated when you feel that coming on.

1143
01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stop. And you can say, I'm starting to get frustrated. We need to take a time, we need to take a break, because I don't want to argue with you over this again. I love you.

1144
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's come back in a couple hours and if we're not okay in a couple hours, then let's revisit this in 24 hours.

1145
01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:35.370
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1146
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

1147
01:54:37.410 --> 01:54:53.100
Moyocoyotzin: All right, got it right. I guess I just see told me I needed because we're going to, I don't know. You want to go already, but we have went to marriage constantly for a while, you know that that didn't really work either. I mean, because you just kept telling the

1148
01:54:54.300 --> 01:55:02.700
Moyocoyotzin: Therapist. The same thing to read because he would ask me, and I told them. Yeah, I mean, she's always accusing me of these things and then they never happen. That's

1149
01:55:03.150 --> 01:55:09.660
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I was locked up for a long time. Yeah. I mean, in the, you know, I even heard her like that. You mean because I don't want, I don't want to be heard like

1150
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:12.960
Moyocoyotzin: I get it, I did it to my first wife, and

1151
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:17.190
Moyocoyotzin: No. And that's that was before I went to prison and

1152
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:21.420
Moyocoyotzin: I tried to work means are we, I came out and

1153
01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.910
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I started using

1154
01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when she starts at when she starts bringing it up again. What would be her response if you just walked up and hugged her

1155
01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:37.680
Moyocoyotzin: Please me away.

1156
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

1157
01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I say try it.

1158
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.000
Moyocoyotzin: Okay, I'll try.

1159
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's called opposite action you're doing the complete opposite than what you would normally do.

1160
01:55:51.720 --> 01:56:03.780
Moyocoyotzin: You know, and then we'll, we'll be good. I mean, we'll get over it, I guess. And then she'll but she thinks about and she's constantly that's in their mind all the time. You know, I mean, I get it. I've heard

1161
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:07.230
Moyocoyotzin: It.

1162
01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

1163
01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:24.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you might have to do it a little bit of times but validate her feelings and and you know tell her you know I love you and I'm here and you know i know that i did act that way, you know, in the past, I learned from it.

1164
01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: will never happen again.

1165
01:56:27.810 --> 01:56:28.170
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

1166
01:56:29.370 --> 01:56:36.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. But you don't have anything to defend you've already voice that in don't engage in that in that part of it.

1167
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pull yourself back from it.

1168
01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:40.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

1169
01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good try that. That's your first assignment.

1170
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:52.890
Moyocoyotzin: Right. Yeah, that didn't get on that other theme. But you told me because I got the phone, but I'll do it eventually

1171
01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:56.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once you get once you get a phone again you're

1172
01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:04.080
Moyocoyotzin: Gonna get paid tomorrow, so I'm gonna, we're gonna we're gonna go get one. We went over there. Now, I was close Metro PCS or

1173
01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:05.520
Moyocoyotzin: Those that

1174
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

1175
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, that's totally fine. But make sure that you make your groups and make sure that you make your appointment with Dr element. OK.

1176
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:21.720
Moyocoyotzin: OK, I will. I'll, uh, I'll see on Wednesday, I mean to yeah Wednesday, for sure.

1178
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:36.270
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, because she enjoys

1179
01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.390
Moyocoyotzin: She tried to get them do

1180
01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:46.290
Moyocoyotzin: To change it or something, but they don't get told her that they needed to talk to me. So I don't know.

1181
01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:51.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because they want you accountable and upfront to deal with your program.

1182
01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that makes sense.

1183
