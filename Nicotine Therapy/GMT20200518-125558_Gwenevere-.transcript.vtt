00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.460
Nadine Quintana: Saying what she has to say and and

102
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.160
Nadine Quintana: And she tries to like

103
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.760
Nadine Quintana: Like for an example.

104
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:42.810
Nadine Quintana: We bought my sister's baby like so much stuff like my sister, the butter so much stuff like my sister's like hey guys like she told my mom, you know, like, can you guys

105
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.610

106
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.490
Nadine Quintana: You know, so you think you guys could maybe like just stop, you know,

107
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:05.610
Nadine Quintana: And my mom calls me and she's like, Oh, your sister. She's just, you know, I don't know why she asked. I don't know why.

108
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:14.610
Nadine Quintana: Because her husband's name is Joe. She's like, Joe's family could buy him stuff like we do. We go to the store, we just buy things that we like like at his family do that and

109
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:26.940
Nadine Quintana: And you know, it's not that they can't do that. It's just that my sister hadn't put up like a registry yet like they didn't know what she needed, you know, and my sister, try to explain that.

110
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:36.450
Nadine Quintana: And then my mom starts with, Oh, we'll tell them not to buy this and tell him not to pay that. And I'm going to buy it and my sister like mom know like

111
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.200
Nadine Quintana: You know, give them a chance to buy it like you guys spent like so much money ready like you guys you know

112
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:51.750
Nadine Quintana: It helps you guys out, and you guys all need to be spending more money and that way they could help out to like she chose to put it in the nicest way.

113
00:11:52.200 --> 00:12:05.760
Nadine Quintana: And my mom's just like things. My sister's been mean because she called me like right after that she's like, Oh, these over here and she's telling us not to buy the baby anything so you know what don't buy the baby nothing to just get him nothing, no more and

114
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So needed

115
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're, you're giving me more evidence that your mom not be able

116
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To change.

117
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's depressing. That's discouraging heartbreaking.

118
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if it's true. What if she's not ready. What if what's needed is just acceptance not you and your sister asking her to be anything other than what she is. But rather you guys changing the way you view her because it doesn't sound like

119
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, I don't know. You guys know your mom.

120
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I asked a question, I did because if you did come back and you said, No, you know what

121
00:12:53.850 --> 00:13:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When I said you know what I'd really don't want to hear about you, your beliefs about what to do with my husband. I'm enjoying my new relationship might change the relationship with my husband, it's important to always be the father of my children and

122
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And she said something like maybe she said

123
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it took me a week or so. But I thought about that. And you're right, it is your life and and an A partnership and a marriage.

124
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Only those two people know what's really going on. But she didn't say that she didn't say anything like that.

125
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to show you something and and you can tell me if you've seen this already, but I just wonder if watching this 12 minute video by Ariel on how to deal with gaslighting has for and if you have your, your recovery journal handy handy. But today would be a good day for that one.

126
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.930
Nadine Quintana: Let me get a real quick.

127
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to show it to you because it might be useful.

128
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh at the top of the page. Just put the word gaslighting and then put for four or five steps. There's really primarily only two but

129
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, this is just a lay person. She's not a clinician, this is just a child of a mother who gets lights.

130
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay gaslight is not a clinical term.

131
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you learn this, you're going to see it all over the place.

132
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You might even consider self.

133
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's basically

134
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When someone outside of you denies

135
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth.

136
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to say I'm feeling lonely. Your mother might say, No, you're not. You know what that is. It's just this de de de or

137
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I'm enjoying my relationship with my husband. I feel like we've evolved. No, no, no. That's just you, you're insecure denied.

138
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Reality. So listen to her story, although it's not like yours. Exactly. It's like no one's it's her story. But listen closely to what the mother does chose this woman who was obviously the child. She's now an adult Alicia just got she'll share the screen with a couple items on what to do.

139
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It now. The world is experiencing what I experienced every day as a child.

140
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: There is chaos confusion.

141
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything is upside down.

142
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Reality is being cancelled and nothing means anything

143
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: gaslighting refers to when someone manipulates you into questioning your own sanity.

144
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a term we are hearing a lot of right now.

145
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a term. I'm very familiar with.

146
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: People are perhaps confused with how to manage and to cope with the situation. And that's where I can help.

147
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was in my mid 30s. I had a meeting with my editor and it was my first major journalism assignment for the Sunday Times magazine.

148
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I gone to meet him for a drink and I was feeling hopeful. I was feeling like things might work out.

149
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And as I was leaving another writer arrived.

150
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This writer recognized me from when I was a child, and he said, Are you so and so's daughter and I replied, Yes.

151
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And hit been a guest at one of my mother's dinner parties.

152
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: After I left this meeting my editor told me

153
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It said how I always wondered how that little girl would survive. I had thought her own and chances or suicide or murder.

154
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When you told me this line. I felt validation, because here was this person who had actually witnessed what I knew to be true and it confirmed what I knew

155
00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So he had said two options suicide or murder. Why would he say that. And what does this have to do with gas lighting.

156
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I grew up in an environment that from the outside, seemed privileged an enviable my mother was a very glamorous poet and an artist, and there were always very interesting people around.

157
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Them a boogeyman world.

158
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She loved entertaining and there would be raucous parties on weeknights I would be in my bed trying to go to sleep, and I would be woken up with drunken laughter noise outside the bedroom.

159
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes these people would come into my room to escape from the crowd and they would sit and they would smoke and they would use the bathroom.

160
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And other times I would get up in my night gown and open the door and shout desperately. Please, can be quiet. It's a school night I have to go to sleep. I have to get up tomorrow.

161
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: My mother would reply Ariel come to the party or she would say after the belly dancer. Everyone will go home.

162
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It was total bombardment.

163
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So the following morning, what would happen is I would confront her about the situation and it was as though this disruption had never happened.

164
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What I thought had happened, I was being told had not happened and that I was making a big deal out of nothing, just want to check in with you, you understand everything so far.

165
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.200
Yes.

166
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If I confronted her with the facts. They were bad in a way

167
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I was sprayed with words of adoration and words of content.

168
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're stupid idiot, and I wish you had never been born

169
00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: When I confronted her about having said this to me. I was told I was making it up and and it was a lot

170
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So it wasn't just that my reality was canceled, but my perceptions of reality or overwritten.

171
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality.

172
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: being denied what you have seen with your own eyes, and you know to be true being denied an experience that you have had and you know is real.

173
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, the ratio of the abuse was worse than the abuse.

174
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense for not being believed was worse than EBS itself eraser.

175
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.940
Nadine Quintana: What's that mean to her.

176
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know the word erase like with a an eraser.

177
00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's this neat word is kind of comes from that word eraser. So the eraser of the abuse was worse than the abuse itself. In other words, you know, she had this abuse with from her mother, but that wasn't even as bad for her as being told it didn't happen.

178
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's it's at the end validating of her reality that was more painful, so it can make you crazy.

179
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are not crazy.

180
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I developed for strategies they helped me and at the time I didn't even know they were strategies. So in these uncertain times. I'm going to share them with you and maybe they can help you to

181
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one is to remain defiant

182
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So write that one down. I was a little girl. I wrote a story about running away from home.

183
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And when my mother saw the story, she said.

184
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't true, and demanded I change it and I didn't change it.

185
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually yelled out, I am not changing my story. I'm not

186
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This defiance was key because I was trusting my version of reality and not allowing it to be altered on demand.

187
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This anger protected me and knew what I knew and it couldn't be erased.

188
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So the person gaslighting you will often try to bully you

189
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But being defiant is something that does not make you difficult it's being resilient.

190
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize that you will never get accountability.

191
00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In my late 20s, I tried to confront the truth remain defiance. The first one. The second one, recognize there will never be accountability, which means the person says, Yes, I see, I see my part, I see my part, I realized what I did.

192
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That may never happen about what happened in my childhood I was sitting with my mother in a Japanese restaurant and I said the words, child abuse, for the first time out loud.

193
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I said it playfully so she didn't feel like it was an attack on her and immediately her response was, what about mommy abuse, nobody ever talks about that.

194
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I learned in that you recognize that. What about me, that's that that's that guilt trip, that's that that's that same thing. So that's kind of what she's talking about right here.

195
00:23:53.790 --> 00:24:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Moment was that she would never be able to take accountability for her actions, she would never get it. She would never say, Oh, you're right. You have a point

196
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And that acknowledgement was not in the cards.

197
00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Asserting myself was not just useful, but it was harmful.

198
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the person gaslighting you will never be able to respond to logic or reason. And so if you

199
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hearing that

200
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: For you and your sister, say this is supposed to be.

201
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The happiest time in my life. Please conform to this social, it is, it isn't a fact just happens to be something that you your sister wants it's it's it's her fantasy, it's got nothing to do with your mom's fantasy, but your sister has a particular fantasy about being pregnant and

202
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What may happen is your mother may not honor that meaning won't say oh, yes, that makes sense. Well, let's see what we can do to make this an amazing experience. Instead what may happen is

203
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what about everything that I do for all of you and

204
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

205
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just throwing it out there.

206
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can apply logic and reason you're going to feel let down

207
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: With this recognition. You are no longer powerless.

208
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go of the wish for it to be different. This is a big one for me because don't wish for to get different is very powerful inoculates you to the tumult

209
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So this number three means

210
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance. It means just like oh the wish that it be different.

211
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom may never change.

212
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you and I can talk later on, start to see something else in her but this has to do with addressing the current suffering of you and your sister.

213
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go of the wish GEE, I WISH mom were different.

214
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And tumult means just chaos.

215
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It allows you to continue to believe that logic and reason will prevail.

216
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And after a particularly bad episode. My mother would reassure me that it would never happen again.

217
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It would happen again.

218
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Promises were broken. And I realized that I could not rely on her work.

219
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: With gaslighting the person gaslighting you makes you feel as though the ground is always shifting beneath your feet and that you have no center of gravity.

220
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You want things to make sense, but they won't

221
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Engaging with someone who is gaslighting you means you will never feel hurt. So what's the solution you stop engaging and you put yourself first.

222
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Number four, would be to develop a healthy detachment. I had to develop coping mechanisms or not. So this is the actual one

223
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What this is the what to do. It doesn't mean you stop loving it doesn't mean you stop talking. It just means

224
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You stop expecting things to be different. And when someone does a gaslighting behavior like denies your reality, this never happened or guilt trips, you do not engage in that conversation.

225
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't engage

226
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can still love them, you can

227
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Accept. What is but getting into content where you hope logic and reason will work.

228
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It will fail, nine out of 10 times just will fail because that's not, they're not using logic and reasoning. They're using emotional reasoning.

229
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is you're going to recognize this in words like healthy boundaries, being able to say this is her stuff she's just. This is just the same sort of a game that she's been playing a long time, my whole life. Maybe, but

230
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what my reality is my reality. I'll just turn my attention to my sister.

231
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see if I can just create that, but I'm not going to try and use logic to convince my mother to change your mind.

232
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to do it. So it's not engaging in that content, you just sort of pulled back on that part you can continue to love and accept but you stopped trying to convince them to change their thinking.

233
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a child.

234
00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The back and forth and the push and pull affection was emotional whiplash. You're wonderful you're horrible. I love you, I hate you. I had to protect myself by believing that nothing meant anything

235
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can't invest in anything. The other person says what happens. Well, when you grow up, there's a price for me.

236
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What had been adapted as a child became maladaptive as an adult.

237
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that one adaptive

238
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so adaptive means

239
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It works.

240
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You do something in your life to adapt.

241
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have someone you sleep with it snores you put your clothes in years you adapt or

242
00:29:51.750 --> 00:30:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what we're doing right now. If someone emotionally hijacked you you learn, you know what, I'm just not going to talk about things that I already know we're not going to agree on the adapt to our environment. If it's Mal.

243
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Adapter. That's what she's saying what she's saying. And when she was younger was adaptive

244
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, as an adult, it became now adaptive Molly means bad so not adaptive. So she's going to talk

245
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, what was good when you were a kid me not really work that well in adult relationships so trusting was very difficult. I was always needing verification. I became vigilant about clarity.

246
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no room for misunderstanding and there was no no margin for error.

247
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody asked me once, what are you looking for in a relationship, and I replied certainty.

248
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I needed certainty in an uncertain world.

249
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This part making sense.

250
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: fancy words in there.

251
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't trust. She grew up not being able to trust and rely on what her mother was saying.

252
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But then when she got into a relationship. She wanted you probably would have shown up as

253
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: expecting perfection really picking it every thing someone says, making sure picking up on any Miss truth. She wanted everything to be as exact as what someone says, as they do. I mean, just a real hyper, she said, sort of hyper vigilance to it.

254
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She wanted certainty and of course you know there's no such thing. But because she didn't have it as a child. She had a really hard time with trust and wanting things to be certain.

255
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But we live in an uncertain world.

256
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there has to be away to find balance.

257
00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: detaching from gaslighting does not mean total detachment.

258
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It means distinguishing between a world of the gas lighter and the real world.

259
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can live people have their alternative facts, you'll stick to reality.

260
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So if the only options for me were suicide or murder. How did I survive well there was actually a third option writing it down.

261
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This was my way of making sense of the chaos by organizing it on the page.

262
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This happened. This was real.

263
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether the writing was published or not it was something that had to be written

264
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To say what needed to be said, Okay, I'll stop it there. Just a little time to process.

265
00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice

266
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.890
Nadine Quintana: I noticed that

267
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.210
Nadine Quintana: I

268
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.090
Nadine Quintana: What everything she was saying was, bye.

269
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.780
Nadine Quintana: really familiar with me.

270
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.180
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with the way down, like I

271
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.330
Nadine Quintana: I have some

272
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.440
Nadine Quintana: Some issues, I guess.

273
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But look how trust member to that word trust has been in our treatment plan this whole time.

274
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.250
Nadine Quintana: Mm hmm.

275
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You also had an event as a young girl that's also plays into mistress about the world.

276
00:33:51.870 --> 00:34:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You had the separation from your father and then passing SO THERE'S BEEN MOMENTS both developmental with mom. Possibly. I don't know how long she's been doing this behavior, but typically it's right around when

277
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You start to be able to talk like I mean, but it can be invalidating even as a baby. So I don't know how long it's been going on.

278
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But you tell me when you say, I think that it makes me think there's issues. What do you think those issues are

279
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:22.920
Nadine Quintana: Um,

280
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.990
Nadine Quintana: Give me me think like that's maybe where like I get my my

281
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.390
Nadine Quintana: My, my trust issues and and

282
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:39.360
Nadine Quintana: Just like open up and you know like afraid to say, or like over

283
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:45.750
Nadine Quintana: Not overthinking arm like always questioning everything like

284
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.110
Nadine Quintana: You know, instead of just saying

285
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.040
Nadine Quintana: What I feel

286
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.990
Nadine Quintana: Sometimes you

287
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you remember early on. And for most of the time, say, Well, I don't know what that means. What does that mean, that's right. And it started in

288
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your now trusting that whatever your interpretation is it's good enough and you can respond so that piece right there and that front end of, well, what does that mean, and I don't like I need to know more, like, wanting that safety wanting certainty.

289
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's changed.

290
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The progress.

291
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.910
Nadine Quintana: It made me think about like

292
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.040
Nadine Quintana: Stuff like that. Like how I'm like real, you know,

293
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.260
Nadine Quintana: I was, you know,

294
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.360
Nadine Quintana: I would push people back and just always

295
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:44.040
Nadine Quintana: Like, I'm not sure if that's what I've worked. I wasn't sure myself. And now I see why.

296
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:45.840
Nadine Quintana: I'm always

297
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A possibility of something to do with it. Yeah.

298
00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And does it give you some ideas about. Yes, go for it. If you want to write those are options. You can try. See if your mom can hear.

299
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Her great

300
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but there's this other way to if it doesn't pan out if she really cannot open her mind that maybe there's another reality, besides hers.

301
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And with this gal Ariel is is describing his mom's alternate reality.

302
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepting she's just going to see it differently. We see it differently, you and your sister happened to share some some realities and mom has hers.

303
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And we stopped trying to make her change. She cannot use logic and reason. So it's just another option if you don't want to get really, really frustrated with her.

304
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.200
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I'm free. I have been actually really I have been doing that, like, kind of just being away.

305
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.200
Nadine Quintana: Um,

306
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.890
Nadine Quintana: But it's still is getting to me to where I'm just like,

307
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.360
Nadine Quintana: Even when she's out of town, it just

308
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.670
Nadine Quintana: Like I feel like I have a break from her like when she goes out of town. I'm just saying.

309
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.210
Nadine Quintana: Like if I'm sending like naughty kids away and I get to take a break for a weekend. That's how I feel like

310
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.290
Nadine Quintana: Relieved, but then

311
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:39.360
Nadine Quintana: Like every time I even tried to do that. I just try to distance myself or try to even agree with what she says. And just like she needs to say that's just what she what she goes up just work who she is.

312
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.460
Nadine Quintana: I tried to do that.

313
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:57.840
Nadine Quintana: But then it constantly like Captain like over and over, like, she'll call me and call me or text me and she'll be like, Oh, why don't you answer for me. Right. Oh, you don't want to talk to me and I'll try like No, Mom, I'm busy or something. So starting so naked.

314
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

315
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We're at the top of the hour. And I'd like to, if you're open to it, take what we did today.

316
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And pick it up again because then we can talk about ways to actually say something or text, something that will

317
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Show her you're you're here, you're still tethered to or you haven't caught her off like this, but you're not engaging in content.

318
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That you get to maintain like this defiance, meaning I will not pretend like you're altered reality is mine. I won't do it.

319
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't go down that guilt trip. I won't do it. We're not going to say that, but if you just sort of maintain this, you know, like, like a like a little teenager like know

320
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm trying to say. So maintaining that logical, right, and get that little imagery and then we'll come up with some fancy things that maybe we can just

321
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Send a little text. So she knows she's heard, but we don't have to engage in content that are neutral that are going to hopefully because her off let's let's pick that up next time.

322
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.590
Nadine Quintana: But do you do

323
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Are you starting back work or still not sure

324
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.840
Nadine Quintana: I'm still haven't heard nothing okay

325
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How about can we meet

326
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: On

327
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.880
Nadine Quintana: June.

328
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: 3 at seven.

329
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.320
Nadine Quintana: To

330
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:38.310
Nadine Quintana: Seven. Yes, let me just write it down so I I have it here.

331
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We are day. It's a Wednesday. So if you start working well, um, we've got to change that. But

332
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.290
Nadine Quintana: Okay, well, if, if I do happen to start working

333
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.240
Nadine Quintana: I'll call I'll text you like once I find out

334
00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.070
Nadine Quintana: And let you know.

335
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.560
Nadine Quintana: Okay, so, June 3 at what time

336
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm glad I got to spend a little time with you on my next clients here.

337
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But kind of stupid that a little bit. You may want to look it up again watch it again if you want to really give it some thought I'm

338
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of process. It's a pretty rich concept and maybe looking up concept. So there's a lot of people that have a lot of opinion about what gaslighting is

339
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognizing the way people do it what you would call a guilt trip or what I would say a denied reality what anyone says that didn't happen. And you're like, I was there. I know it happened.

340
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Before, right. You can't deny that I'm having a particular emotion like that's under your bit like

341
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you, I'm sad. Like, you can't deny that. So that's kind of where those come up. And so it's just this lump term that can capture a lot of different behaviors.

342
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a big fan of it. But again, it's not a clinical term. It's not in the diagnostic manual or anything. It's just a term that

343
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I just love

344
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they did. We don't have another term in psychology for it. So I'm like, well, this is as good as any. I like it.

345
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.430
And her name.

346
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Arielle and it is called. I think it's how to deal with a guest later.

347
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.360
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

348
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.150
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I'll look

349
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.670
Nadine Quintana: I'm having my appointment corner. Okay. All right, good.

350
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, see you later.

351
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.660
Nadine Quintana: Okay, thank
