68
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.270
Peggy: Yeah, it's different.

69
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.770
Peggy: Yeah, I kind of flipped out when I first moved here because it was only one main road and

70
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.130
Peggy: I was

71
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.930
Peggy: A. What did I get into

72
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.980
Joan Kandel: But I like it.

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.300
Ain't no la

74
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.840
Joan Kandel: Though, that's a different world. But yeah, it's a different pace and it sounds like it'll be a welcome welcome pace.

75
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.520
Peggy: Yes.

76
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.940
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So tell me about why you're here with with bright heart and how did you find out about bright heart.

77
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.220
Peggy: Well,

78
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.700
Peggy: I have had been followed in LA for a number of years with a physician, I was a chronic pain patient

79
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.080
Peggy: For a number of years. I was on a regimen exercise and I have

80
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:27.750
Peggy: Everything from morphine to bike it in the and then ultimately, I was put on methadone for pain and I, after being on methadone for less than a year, I decided to just was not going to work for me. It was not, it was just too much and

81
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.800
Peggy: I don't want too.

82
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.970
Joan Kandel: Much meaning.

83
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.740
Joan Kandel: Too much meaning what it is.

84
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.650
Peggy: Today too much, just my teeth were falling out and

85
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.000
Peggy: I was just not feeling well.

86
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.400
Peggy: And I felt really sedated.

87
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.010
Peggy: Uh huh. And as I was also

88
00:05:48.510 --> 00:06:00.690
Peggy: Afraid of since I have some some sleep disorder. I was little bit afraid of taking method of leaping. You know, I don't know how how qualified that fear was but I'm

89
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.450
Peggy: Anyway, I had a brilliant idea that I would just go off all my medicine at that time.

90
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.890
Peggy: Oops, and

91
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.160
Peggy: And it was a disaster ended up in the hospital.

92
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.810
Joan Kandel: Yeah, when was that

93
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.380
Peggy: That was in

94
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.370
Peggy: About 2002

95
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.990
Joan Kandel: Okay.

96
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:36.330
Peggy: Okay. And I didn't stay in the hospital. They just, they didn't eat me. But they did refer me to a physician who is dealing with sudden tax time

97
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.040
Peggy: Okay. And he thought that that might be a good choice for me.

98
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.910
Peggy: And so we started on the phone via text back then. And it worked really well.

99
00:06:48.240 --> 00:07:04.830
Peggy: Okay. Um, and I've been taking it ever since then, when we moved out here. I had done some research to make sure there were physicians and Silver City that could prescribe my medicine, but I got out here and they were all gone after me. They were listed

100
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.180
Peggy: Oh am

101
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.550
Peggy: I good yeah and there's nobody

102
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.110
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that list is not very accurate. And if they don't keep up with it.

103
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:23.760
Peggy: So, um, I ran out of my medicine. I had my primary care doctor out here. Dr. Ski he gave me a little bit.

104
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:40.710
Peggy: He couldn't prescribe a you know a month's worth, but he gave me a little bit to hold me over until I could see somebody else and I was panicking. I didn't know was gonna have to go to Santa Fe, or what excuse me I have bronchitis. Right now I'm that

105
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:49.260
Peggy: I happen to be. I work in medical regulatory and I happen to be working on telemedicine right now.

106
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.550
Peggy: Do. Okay. Safety report some telemedicine and I hadn't thought of you.

107
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.600
Joan Kandel: Know how am I

108
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.590
Thought

109
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.980
Peggy: It was just a kid was mad, and it was

110
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.020
Peggy: really fortunate. Fine.

111
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:12.690
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right. No, that's fantastic because you're bright heart, it works so well for people who are you know out in underserved areas like you are

112
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.340
Joan Kandel: Absolutely.

113
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.520
Peggy: Yeah, I mean I my work has been with looking at clinics in India and Tele ICU.

114
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.320
Peggy: Effectiveness, and the mortality rates going down and

115
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.370
Peggy: That's great stuff is is blessed and, you know, it's great.

116
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.220
Joan Kandel: Yeah, really supportive. Yeah.

117
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.750
Peggy: So yeah, I'm patient

118
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.340
Joan Kandel: There you go.

119
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.670
Joan Kandel: Well, that's good. I'm glad you found us.

120
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.710
Joan Kandel: And

121
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.860
Joan Kandel: I don't know if you you know this about bright heart but the bright heart the

122
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.040
Joan Kandel: The, the main focus is

123
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:58.620
Joan Kandel: Is opioid use disorder. And that's the main thing that we prescribe the the buprenorphine for and the Suboxone

124
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:05.130
Joan Kandel: But we also have a program in pain management.

125
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.380
Joan Kandel: And

126
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:26.130
Joan Kandel: There's a, there's a doctor, Dr. Tracy Jackson. She's a pain specialist and she's really quite amazing. And she's been with bright heart for a while, but she just very recently got her new mexico license. So she's now starting to see our patients who have pain management issues.

127
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:39.990
Joan Kandel: And she's, she's wonderful she's really into mindfulness and yoga and different ways to help people manage their own pain and not relying

128
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.700
Peggy: Just on medication and then

129
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:48.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I figured you might be. And so I so I will be happy to get you into her groups. They do groups.

130
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:58.950
Joan Kandel: And I think it's every other week. They have a group. She won't be prescribing you any meds. I'll be prescribing the meds and so you'll do a group with me.

131
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:08.910
Joan Kandel: But then you'll also kind of alternate and do groups with her, which are really specific to pain management stuff. And that might help you to to help your, your pain.

132
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:16.650
Peggy: It's that would be great. I should have had that my primary care doctor has referred me to a surgeon

133
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:26.610
Peggy: In 2000 and this is something that I procrastinated because I'm afraid of having back surgery, I really didn't want to, but he

134
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.720
Joan Kandel: wants me to at least get a

135
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.400
Peggy: Console and he says that if I have the surgery that I might not have a pain issue.

136
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.740
Peggy: A hollow, but I've yeah

137
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.770
Peggy: A lot of back surgeries where you that doesn't happen that way.

138
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.580
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it can go either way. What is the nature of your pain.

139
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:52.890
Peggy: I had a car accident and I was rear ended by a semi and I already had degenerative disc and spinal stenosis and

140
00:10:54.090 --> 00:11:03.510
Peggy: After the accident. I started having some cervical problems. And then my lumbar pain just went through the roof so

141
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:11.880
Peggy: In a nutshell, it's degenerative disc disease spinal stenosis and herniated disc.

142
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.990
Joan Kandel: In the cervical or lumbar or the

143
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.040
Peggy: Number, the number is where the herniated is

144
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.540
Peggy: The cervical area.

145
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:33.450
Peggy: Is all i don't have a lot of pain there, but I have numb fingers on my left hand to my little finger in my fourth finger and numb. Now, and they've never come back from

146
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.310
Peggy: Totally accident.

147
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.650
Joan Kandel: Totally no

148
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.000
Joan Kandel: You don't feel even

149
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.180
Peggy: Ugly. Totally. I mean, I can, I can feel tingling.

150
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.130
Joan Kandel: Tingling. Okay, I got it.

151
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:54.420
Peggy: But the older I get the more this is becoming um it's really whittling away at my feeling of health.

152
00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:08.760
Peggy: Yeah, and I really want to get on top of it. Now I'm 61 years old now and I need to get on top of it. I'm interested in yoga and trying to re acquaint myself with my body and

153
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.270
Peggy: Brain and not just rely on medication.

154
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:18.810
Joan Kandel: Right. Absolutely. Great. So, um, do you have an appointment with a surgeon

155
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.600
Peggy: With. I'm sorry.

156
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.650
Joan Kandel: With a surgeon

157
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.920
Peggy: Um, no. I have to call them and these given me a referral. We send a referral over to Dr.

158
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.370
Peggy: Surgical group in Tucson.

159
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.460
Peggy: Okay, and I'll be going over there.

160
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.440
Joan Kandel: Okay, so

161
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:48.450
Joan Kandel: Yes, I think we get you in with Dr. Jackson and what she does is she has a one on one APPOINTMENT WITH YOU LIKE THIS, TRACY Jackson is her name and

162
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.890
Joan Kandel: You should actually Google her. She did a TED talk, which you'll be very interested in

163
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:06.060
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So Tracy Jackson and her TED Talk is something like the hardest pill to swallow.

164
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:23.490
Joan Kandel: And so you can watch her watch her TED talk. And then you'll get to know you know her. Her mindset and and she's wonderful so I'll get you in with her. You can have a one on one with her and then get set up with her groups and

165
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.770
Joan Kandel: And, you know, talk to her about the surgical consult and, you know, even if you have the consult

166
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.910
Joan Kandel: You could probably share that with her and she could kind of interpret it and kind of see what the thinking is

167
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.060
Joan Kandel: Since she can't lay her hands on you.

168
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.510
Joan Kandel: Then at least she can see somebody else doing it you know that

169
00:13:45.930 --> 00:14:00.990
Joan Kandel: Evaluation and then you know you could you could work with her on that and if your pain improves without surgery, then that's great. And if you need a surgical consults and that's that's what you do kind of see how you do.

170
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:09.300
Peggy: I'M GOING TO DO WHAT IT director, it takes at this point because my mobility is starting to become less than

171
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.090
Peggy: I'm having trouble. There's, I have to crawl up the stairs, because of pain or now so

172
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.120
Peggy: I used to walk 10 blocks a day.

173
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:32.160
Peggy: And that was just two years ago and now my hips don't feel like they're, they feel like they're out of place in my back just starts hurting in that lumbar region, and I can't, I have to turn around, go back home.

174
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.570
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

175
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:49.800
Joan Kandel: Right yeah that's that's not a way to be. Yeah, so we'll see if we can get some help with that. And so in terms of the. Now, you mentioned Soviet texts were you on just the buprenorphine or the combination buprenorphine naloxone

176
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.720
Peggy: I've been on both

177
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:52.680
Peggy: Okay.

178
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.290
Joan Kandel: And you you do fine with the combination

179
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.960
Joan Kandel: Yes. Yeah, okay, and

180
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.740
Joan Kandel: And you have insurance that covers it.

181
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.460
Joan Kandel: Yes. Okay. Okay, good. And what's your dose.

182
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.380
Peggy: I take three eight milligram tablets in the morning.

183
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:19.380
Joan Kandel: Three. I thought I looked up the Prescription Monitoring Program and it said you were on 16 milligrams. No.

184
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.330
Peggy: No, I'm I'm 24

185
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.000
Joan Kandel: Okay.

186
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.280
Joan Kandel: And how long have you been on 24

187
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.800
Peggy: Ever since I started taking it.

188
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.520
Joan Kandel: Hahaha

189
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:39.750
Peggy: You know what though, the last time that Dr. Steve my primary care doctor both needed a temporary prescription. I think right

190
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.800
Peggy: I mean,

191
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.910
Joan Kandel: That's what I saw.

192
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:42.990
Peggy: Yeah.

193
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.760
Joan Kandel: That's the one that I saw. So that's why I thought it was 16 so but you've but

194
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.340
Joan Kandel: You've been taking 24

195
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.820
Joan Kandel: Correct, even though it said 16. Okay. And have you

196
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.600
Joan Kandel: Have you

197
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.830
Joan Kandel: tried taking less to see how you do unless

198
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.360
Peggy: Yes.

199
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.350
Joan Kandel: And what happened.

200
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:21.450
Peggy: I don't feel as well. I feel when I go down. I've tried going down as low as eight milligrams. And I just, I have breakthrough withdrawal and um, I don't know if maybe I haven't given it long enough to

201
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.270
Peggy: Even out or I can deal with withdrawal is just

202
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.150
Joan Kandel: Sure. Right, that's understandable. Yeah.

203
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.800
Joan Kandel: And when you

204
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.110
Uh huh.

205
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:44.730
Joan Kandel: When you did that, when you did that experiment to see if you could handle the eight milligrams. How did you, how did you get from 24 to eight.

206
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:51.150
Peggy: I when I, this was my own experiment I started tightening down and I

207
00:16:52.740 --> 00:17:08.640
Peggy: I went from three tablets to the next day or two tablets in the state on two tablets for like three days and then went down to one tablet stayed on one tablet for, you know, see how that was going to work. I think that this is a while ago.

208
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.430
Peggy: But something to that effect. Okay.

209
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.460
Peggy: Do it just really rapid Stairs, stairs to them.

210
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.230
Joan Kandel: That actually sounds pretty rapid to me.

211
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.240
Peggy: Is that rapid

212
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:32.970
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that sounds pretty rapid, you know, if you're gonna if you're going to be successful at at really tapering down, it needs to be a slow, very gradual taper so

213
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:42.300
Joan Kandel: You know, in your case, I think that it's very, very possible that you don't need 24 milligrams

214
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.310
Peggy: But

215
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:53.370
Joan Kandel: It would be a slow process to see if that's the case. So what I would suggest is actually that you do that you go like down by

216
00:17:54.090 --> 00:18:00.630
Joan Kandel: At this level about two milligrams. So like to 22 milligrams and stay there for like two weeks.

217
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:13.260
Joan Kandel: And then go to 20 milligrams and stay there for two weeks because then you won't feel that dreaded withdrawal because it's horrible. And, you know, and that's just scary, but, you know, if you were to go down by

218
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:24.300
Joan Kandel: Here it's scary, it's just scary. So if you were to go down by, you know, one or two milligrams every couple of weeks. You could make progress and not really feel that maybe the first

219
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:31.440
Joan Kandel: One or two days, you might feel a little bit of, you know, very mild kind of withdrawal, but nothing like the bad stuff.

220
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.420
Joan Kandel: So,

221
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.670
Joan Kandel: So I would I would

222
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.720
Peggy: Be open to trying

223
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.660
Joan Kandel: Okay, I would invite you to think about that. And if you want to think about that. Now we can we can start you

224
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.420
Joan Kandel: Instead of at 24 at 22 and you and I are going to see each other every week.

225
00:18:48.840 --> 00:19:01.830
Joan Kandel: And so we can kind of assess and if at any point you go down and you're like add that was horrible. And I'm not getting used to it and I want to go up. We can go back up. So it's not a scary proposition.

226
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:18.630
Joan Kandel: And I'm not going to like leave you on your own for a month to kind of be suffering it we would go gradually and we would stay in touch. So that if it feels like it's too much or you're not ready for the next jump because the last one was a little bit tough, that's fine. We could take

227
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.380
Peggy: One at a time.

228
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.760
Peggy: When I feel bad.

229
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.140
Joan Kandel: Well, sure that

230
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.300
Peggy: I understand a big panic.

231
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.650
And

232
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:33.960
Peggy: They have pain because I've had paid has been out of control before and I don't want ever experienced that again.

233
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.520
Peggy: Right, and I have had when I went to Israel for six months, I

234
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:44.760
Peggy: Lost my medicine in the airlines. Yeah. And I went 17 days without my sub you Tex.

235
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.200
Joan Kandel: Oh that's high level.

236
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.240
Peggy: living hell.

237
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.550
Peggy: Yeah. Mm hmm.

238
00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:00.300
Joan Kandel: Oh my gosh, and then you're not at home and you're in a foreign land. Oh my gosh, yeah, no, we're going to avoid that at all costs.

239
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:08.820
Joan Kandel: Yeah, but you know, I do think, I mean I can imagine that that it may be enough for you to be on eight milligrams

240
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.050
Joan Kandel: You know and and

241
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:27.480
Joan Kandel: Be and be feeling the same way that you're feeling in terms of your pain control, especially in combination with with visiting with Dr. Jackson and maybe learning some techniques to really help with your pain actually help with the pain, not just you know mask it with with medications.

242
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.010
Joan Kandel: So,

243
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.700
Peggy: Um,

244
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:40.050
Joan Kandel: So yeah, I think that that would be if you're if you're willing to go down that road. I think that it would be nice to kind of start down that road and see, see where it takes us

245
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:49.710
Peggy: I'm absolutely willing. I also noticed over the years that I have kind of a flat aspect now.

246
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.030
Peggy: My emotional aspect is just not

247
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.000
Peggy: I'm not as creative as I used to be.

248
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.070
Peggy: Okay, it's the medicine.

249
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.440
Joan Kandel: Yeah, like a kind of wanted to

250
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:01.950
Peggy: Me.

251
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.040
Peggy: Mm hmm blunting. Thank you. Yes.

252
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.720
Peggy: Yeah, I feel blunted

253
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.940
Peggy: Yeah, and that's a really big incentive for me to start tapering down

254
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.650
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Well, good. So let's, let's do that. So when I do

255
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:24.120
Joan Kandel: Put your prescription in. If it's okay with you. I'll put it in for 22 milligrams instead of 24 milligrams

256
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.800
Joan Kandel: Which will be I'll prescribe the strips.

257
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.150
Joan Kandel: And so the strips can be cut and so that'll be two and three quarters strips every day instead of three strips.

258
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.180
Peggy: Sounds great.

259
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.140
Joan Kandel: Oh, good.

260
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.010
Joan Kandel: Let's do it. I mean, we'll see how we'll see how we do. And I have a good feeling. I think you're

261
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.210
Joan Kandel: Able to get done.

262
00:21:51.660 --> 00:22:08.490
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. And when we will take our time and if we find that you know you get down to like six milligrams, or four milligrams, then it gets really then we go really slowly take little you know little eights have a strip off every, every few weeks.

263
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:19.380
Joan Kandel: But if you find that you that you hit a dead end, you're not under any pressure to like go all the way off. You know, you go as low as you feel like you're functional

264
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:33.780
Joan Kandel: Because I believe that you that medications can help, but the lowest dose that's the lowest effective dose is the bestest to be so we'll find your lowest effective dose and if your lowest effective dose is nothing. Hallelujah. That's great.

265
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.160
Joan Kandel: But if it's not, it's not a

266
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.350
Joan Kandel: Failure, you know, it's, it's okay.

267
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.200
Peggy: I appreciate that I like, I like your way of thinking.

268
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.040
Joan Kandel: Okay, good.

269
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.750
Joan Kandel: All right.

270
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:57.150
Joan Kandel: While I'm on it. The other thing that I'm going to prescribe for you because I prescribe it for everybody that I prescribe buprenorphine to is a narc and kit.

271
00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.160
Joan Kandel: Do you have an arc and

272
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.080
Peggy: Okay, you know what that zone.

273
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:12.330
Joan Kandel: Yes. You know what it is. Okay, so it's an it's a it's a nasal spray and it's just really helpful to have around. You know overdoses are so

274
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:27.000
Joan Kandel: Common, unfortunately, and I always carry one around with me in my purse, because you never know when you're going to find somebody sitting on a bench and they're like slumped over and you can't wake them up squirt the stuff in their nose and

275
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.670
Joan Kandel: You might save their life. Yeah. So I'm going to give

276
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.960
Peggy: You some people in my community carry them who work out in the fields and public health.

277
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:43.260
Joan Kandel: Yes, right. So it's a good thing to have. So I'm going to, I'm going to write for that as well. So don't be surprised when the pharmacist says here's your other medication and

278
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:50.760
Joan Kandel: And I'll they'll be refills on there. So if you ever had to use it and you need a refill, it'll be at the same pharmacy.

279
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.560
Peggy: Okay.

280
00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:01.470
Joan Kandel: And I will, I will not be prescribing other medications for you. So the other meds that you take, you will get from your, from your PCP.

281
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.910
Joan Kandel: Right. Okay. What other meds. Do you take

282
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.730
Peggy: I take effects more

283
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:10.290
Joan Kandel: Okay.

284
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.210
Peggy: For anxiety.

285
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.680
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. How much

286
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.000
Peggy: I take as an adjunct to that.

287
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.160
Peggy: Abilify

288
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:21.600
Okay.

289
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.250
Peggy: five milligrams. And I also

290
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.500
Joan Kandel: What's your dose of effects are

291
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.930
Peggy: 150 milligrams twice a day. So that's 300 milligrams

292
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.710
Okay.

293
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.110
Peggy: And let me see. I got

294
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.610
Peggy: HTTP. My hands were swelling. I don't take this all the time, this was just give

295
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.330

503
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.910

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.140
Peggy: I just don't care for it. It makes me confortable

529
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.640
Peggy: So it's just

530
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.260
Peggy: It's, it's so

531
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.760
Joan Kandel: It is so nasty. And it's just it just ravages the body.

532
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:57.390
Peggy: It does. And I can't consider my. I mean, I'm a medical professional and I'm outside smoking while everyone else is in the conference, you know,

533
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.620

535
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.860
Peggy: I'm probably 10 to 15 cigarettes a day maybe

536
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.380
Joan Kandel: Yeah, and that's cut down

537
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.480
Peggy: That's cut down

538
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.250

539
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:20.610

Peggy: Next on the list. Yeah, that's

541
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.560
Joan Kandel: That's going to be the biggest favor that you could do for yourself of anything.

542
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.990

549
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:55.530
Joan Kandel: It was really, really hard. So I'm glad you have the patches, because they can help.

619
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.230
Joan Kandel: Really nice people in the group. The groups are an hour long

620
00:45:50.640 --> 00:46:06.570
Joan Kandel: They consist of we there I'm there and the therapist is there. Her name is Dominique, she's wonderful and then there are anywhere between, like, five and 10 patients and we all meet on the computer and we all see each other.

621
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:15.330
Joan Kandel: And we start the group with a medical check in. So I go around and ask everybody how they're doing with their meds, if they need refills how their doses.

622
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.310
Joan Kandel: And

623
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:24.870
Joan Kandel: And then we go into more therapeutic group sort of process that's led by Dominique

624
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.230
Joan Kandel: It's great. It's a really wonderful thing. And most people in the group.

625
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:42.180
Joan Kandel: Are struggling with addiction issues and they're in recovery, so it's it's slightly different than your story, but you know we're all people and we can all relate to each other.

626
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.180
Peggy: So they to the addiction aspects.

627
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.710
Peggy: Totally can relate

628
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.430
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Oh, good. How do you feel like that applies to you.

629
00:46:51.990 --> 00:47:04.230
Peggy: Because I can't just go off of this medicine. I I'm I am tied to it. Yeah, gardenless what my intention was when I started taking it taking it to get high or do anything.

630
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.530
Joan Kandel: Right.

631
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.970
Peggy: But I am tethered to it.

632
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.350
Peggy: Right. That is

633
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.400
Peggy: That is a somewhat of an addiction.

634
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:13.620
Peggy: It's a dependent

635
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:21.060
Joan Kandel: Independent. So there is there is quite a difference, but it, but I understand how that there is a there's that feeling.

636
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:22.500
Peggy: Mm hmm.

637
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.920
Peggy: Yeah, yeah. And you're not alone. Ever.

638
00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:28.290
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. Right. Right.

639
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.370
Joan Kandel: So, so that'll be the group and then

640
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:42.660
Joan Kandel: Like I say, when we do get you. And there's a little bit of a waiting period to get in with Dr. Jackson, because she's just starting with the New Mexico patients so she has a bit of an onslaught.

641
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:52.530
Joan Kandel: But once once you get in with her for the individual visit, then you'll start seeing her in her groups and you can alternate her group with my group.

642
00:47:54.060 --> 00:48:01.320
Joan Kandel: But she won't be giving you any prescriptions. So you'll get the prescriptions on the Tuesday groups.

643
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:03.690
Joan Kandel: And

644
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.860
Joan Kandel: So, so that's how that will work.

645
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:09.090
Okay.

646
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:22.200
Joan Kandel: And if you have any concerns or questions or or need a refill or need to to communicate something with me. The

647
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:27.150
Joan Kandel: The place to do that is that number that you call the local at the virtual clinic.

648
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:37.560
Joan Kandel: And that they're there 24 seven. So if you have any issues with anything related to bright heart call them and they will troubleshoot and get you help with their insurance issues or

649
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:49.920
Joan Kandel: Education issues, anything like that. That's your go to number that's also the same number that you'll call every week before group will call about a half an hour 20 to 30 minutes before the group.

650
00:48:50.610 --> 00:49:04.950
Joan Kandel: So around four o'clock for our group and they will check you in, they will have you every week they have you do what's called a brief addiction monitor so they kind of have you rate yourself how you've been during the past week.

651
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:10.590
Joan Kandel: And and and you'll do that before every group. So that's a weekly thing.

652
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.270
Joan Kandel: And then what they'll do is they'll tell you what the number is to call

653
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:29.760
Joan Kandel: For the group because it changes every week, so that makes it so that you have to check in with them before you can attend to the group. So that's how we do that. So every week. It'll be a different number. Yeah, but their number will remain the same.

654
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.320
Peggy: Okay.

655
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.270
Joan Kandel: So that's how we do that.

656
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:40.320
Joan Kandel: And let me just, I'm gonna, I'm going to read off a bunch of symptoms.

657
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.860
Joan Kandel: I'll do a review of systems here and I'm just going to read off a bunch of symptoms.

658
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:52.410
Joan Kandel: Some of them we've already talked about. But if there's any here that we haven't talked about that apply to you just stop me.

659
00:49:53.010 --> 00:50:07.470
Joan Kandel: Okay, okay, fevers, night sweats fatigue change in weight change in vision I redness I pain hearing loss, your pain ringing in the ears.

660
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:13.380

661
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.160
Peggy: Right now.

662
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:15.690

Joan Kandel: sores in the mouth pain in the teeth pain in the neck which you have you already told me that

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.000
Peggy: Is that

665
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:27.390
Joan Kandel: Is that a big source of pain in the neck pain or is it more the low back.

666
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.310
Peggy: Its back

667
00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.280

671
00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:49.950
Peggy: Yeah.

Peggy: Yeah, as long as propranolol there. It's fine.

Peggy: Okay, this is a long term thing that I've had.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:01.770

Joan Kandel: Great.

702
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:55.860
Joan Kandel: Okay, I just want to do a very quick extremely limited physical exam because here I am. And there you are. So what I'd like to do is just look at it in your eyes. So if you could get the the look right into the camera.

703
00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:01.110
Joan Kandel: Bring the bring it to you and just kind of look right into the camera.

704
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.510
Joan Kandel: Perfect. And now. Oh, that's great. And I'll look to your right.

705
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.810
Joan Kandel: Just with your eyes good and look to your left.

706
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.710
Joan Kandel: Good and up towards the top of your head.

707
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.010
Joan Kandel: Good and down towards your feet.

708
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.780
Joan Kandel: Great. Okay. Now pull back a little bit and let me take a look in your mouth.

709
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:30.810
Joan Kandel: Great. OK, and now go back a little bit further. And I just want to kind of watch you take a couple of breaths.

710
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.680
Joan Kandel: Deep breaths, hopefully won't make you cough.

711
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:51.810
Joan Kandel: Good. Okay. Great. And then if you could just kind of push on your on your belly, just to kind of push all areas of your belly and let me know if if that feels okay any pain with that.

712
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:54.510
Joan Kandel: Feel soft

713
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.610
Joan Kandel: Soft. Okay. Wonderful. That's great. Okay.

714
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.860
Joan Kandel: Thank you for that.

715
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:05.640
Joan Kandel: Do you have any questions for me.

716
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.300
Peggy: I know you've been very thorough

717
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.410
Joan Kandel: I'm very excited to

718
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.760
Peggy: Be in this program.

719
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.770
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's pretty great. Oh, good.

720
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.850
Joan Kandel: Good. That's great. Yeah, I think it's going to really help and

721
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:27.150
Joan Kandel: It's a, it's great to not have to go to the doctor's office. I mean, you still have to go the doctor's office, but not a different doctors office.

722
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.380
Peggy: 300 miles to the doctor's office.

723
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:33.420
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that's a drag. Yeah.

724
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:43.980
Joan Kandel: Oh. The other thing to tell you about is the, is that every about every month randomly. We do a urine drug screen on everybody.

725
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:50.640
Joan Kandel: So the way we do that is this first one, you'll go do that as part of your lab work.

726
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:55.770
Joan Kandel: But then, as you're in the program you'll actually just do those at home.

727
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.260
Joan Kandel: And what we do is we send you a

728
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:08.820
Joan Kandel: big bulky manila envelope in the mail and and we're so when you get that envelope do not open it. Don't even open the envelope.

729
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:15.090
Joan Kandel: So when you get that envelope call the virtual clinic and tell them, hey, I got this big bulky envelope. What do I do

730
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:26.340
Joan Kandel: And they'll, they'll watch you open it. They'll watch you take the little cup out they'll have you go to the bathroom and then they'll talk you through how to check it right there on the phone with them on the camera.

731
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.450
Joan Kandel: So, so do that all with them if you

732
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:43.650
Joan Kandel: If you open the envelope or the or the cup without them seeing it, then they'll say it's invalid and they'll have you go to the lab to do it. So it's just a big pain to have to do that so

733
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.590
Joan Kandel: So when you get the envelope just call them.

734
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:59.040
Joan Kandel: And I think that's all that I have to do. So I assume that you told them where your where your pharmacy is and that's probably in the computer for me to enter

735
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.610
Peggy: A pharmacy.

736
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.050
Joan Kandel: Yes. Okay. In

737
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.650
My

738
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:09.540
Peggy: Mind intake paperwork.

739
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:19.350
Joan Kandel: Okay, good. So I'll just make sure that it's Genoa and I'll put that in. After we get off the call here. So do you still have some of the

740
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.700
Joan Kandel: The subaqua

741
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.170
Joan Kandel: About from your doc.

742
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:26.220
Joan Kandel: Are you out.

743
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.220
Peggy: No. Yeah, please. Yeah, I've been out for two days.

744
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.390
Joan Kandel: Oh. Oh. Are you feeling really crappy

745
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.310
Peggy: Yes.

746
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.330
Peggy: Oh,

747
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:47.520
Joan Kandel: My gosh. Wow. Yeah. Okay, so, um, so yes, you will get that and we'll do the the 22 milligram dose and

748
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:59.100
Joan Kandel: It will certainly feel like an improvement to how you're doing now, since you're since you've been two days without it. So you probably won't even notice that it's a lower dose, because it's going to feel like such an improvement.

749
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:02.460
Joan Kandel: Right.

750
00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:14.550
Joan Kandel: Right. Yeah, right. So, so we'll do that. And then I will see you next Tuesday at group and I will give your name to the to the schedulers to get on Dr. Jackson's list.

751
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.690
Peggy: Thank you so much.

752
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.490
Peggy: Yeah, you're still hopeful.

753
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.350
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Good. Well, you should

754
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:28.440
Joan Kandel: Things are good things are looking up. Now you're in Silver City. There's your silver lining

755
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.450
Peggy: Right, ring the bell.

756
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:39.630
Joan Kandel: That's right. Okay, so, um, alright, so I'll sign off here and I'll prescribe that for you. And then I'll see you next Tuesday.

757
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.690
Peggy: Pleasure meeting you.

758
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.360
Joan Kandel: You too. Good luck. Moving into your new place.

759
00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:47.790
Peggy: Thank you. Okay.

760
00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:48.450
Joan Kandel: Bye bye.
