Gwenevere Abriel: So the coughing that I'm hearing is from him.

182
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

183
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.880

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want regarding substance use moving forward in your own words.

189
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, that was

190
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. But I want both

191
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:52.140
Kelli Ottnat: I do want to live a day without Suboxone without needing anything

192
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.270

198
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I have it right in here.

199
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would that be called

200
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

201
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This one.

202
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just not going to be good for me.

203
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I want to find it somewhere else I'd like to do a little inventory with you. Okay. Probably not take up our time just just the time we have. What were the three objects.

207
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.460
Kelli Ottnat: It, it works, but I would like for it to be a little sharper.

208
00:22:50.910 --> 00:23:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Does it feel like it's fuzzy or in the short term, like, Oh man, I can't believe I'm walking over here. I remember what I wanted, or is it like that stuff from a long time ago, you'd like to pull it from maybe to hit the campus but it feels like you just can't get to it.

209
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.350
Kelli Ottnat: Us makes a very small makes hey
