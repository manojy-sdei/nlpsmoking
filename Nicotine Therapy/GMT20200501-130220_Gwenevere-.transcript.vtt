5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And can you hear and see me. Oh, yeah. Excellent.

6
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just moved into

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A new

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Home.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.340
Justin’s iPhone: Well, we're just moving into a new whole workflow process of moving into our house and go to Tina Mexico.

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.830
Justin’s iPhone: A mile away from the lake.

11
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm in Florida. I won't know much about the cities that you're in. Um, but I starting to get familiar. Some of y'all say something. I'm like, oh yeah, I recognize that

12
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to go over a little bit about literally like two minutes and then the rest of this is going to be jam packed with

13
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like what you've done with the doctor today is I'm going to be gathering a history.

14
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be tempted to want to give me an explanation.

15
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For a response. But today, won't be the day for that that's going to come when you and I are sitting

16
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're doing individual therapy and really getting to know kind of underlying history and see if we can create some change.

17
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But

18
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So today is really just looking for sort of a short response so that I can sort of make note of it really sort of contextualize your history.

19
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But it won't be a long story with each question. Okay, they're going to be sort of short. Otherwise, it's a two hour assessment, I have to jam into an hour. And it's a very difficult assessment for me.

20
00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how difficult. It's going to be for you, but I have watched and a lot of people like oh my gosh, all these questions. So just be patient with yourself. If you don't remember something just say, I don't remember. Okay.

21
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so that you have an idea of who I am. My name is

22
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: One of your homie Gwen or hey, that lady I see on Thursdays, whatever. Um,

23
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I am in Florida. I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist and have been licensed for over 20 years here, and it'll be three years in New Mexico. I specifically. Got it. Just to work with my heart health, and

24
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Have always been drawn to folks struggling with substance use all the way from outpatient in custody felony drug court to more executive

25
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At in private practice and all that. So I just like it. I like y'all. I like working with it. It's my favorite. So I don't know if that makes me twisted but

26
00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What else, I have a you have my cell phone. Actually, I use this for confirming appointments

27
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll see that the night before. This is a courtesy reminder I reach out to people and I say, hey, can you confirm the appointment.

28
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, last night I sent you one.

29
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Just jealousy

30
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said, okay, so you acknowledged it right

31
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And

32
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people are tend to nowadays with how frequently, and then we're going to dive into the assessment.

33
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Are very tempted to want to carry on conversations about medication or they want to talk about context of their life through texting, but you're welcome to send me messages, but I don't do psychotherapy through texting, which means I'm going to text back might feel cold.

34
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But it'll be well when can you meet next in here. I'm an independent contractor. And so my work happens while we're here, won't be on your phone.

35
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be in here. So that's all group or an individual therapy. So just to let you know, you do need to let me know if you won't keep an appointment 24 hours in advance so that I can offer it to folks that I have on on call list.

36
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool, cool, cool, we're going to dive right into it. Then I'm going to start with the context of how

37
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You develop a chemical dependence on opiates. So for some people it's my head, you know, wisdom tooth Paul when I was, you know, 18 or something. When did you first use short acting opiates. Those are purpose. That's hydrocodone fentanyl

38
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.780
Justin’s iPhone: Like 12

39
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.040

44
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And how often were you and that pill itself actually have to explain more and more thing because you're going to see this a lot. I have an air condition, which means going to see me.

45
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably saw in group, a couple of times I have to clear my ear. It's like being under selfie to water or up in an airplane.

46
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the only way to fix it as have to tilt my head so you'll get used to ignore it over time. And I do apologize for that. So here you are. You're 12 years do you and your friends and your party morning those pills and how often were you doing it and how much

123
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:20.610
Justin’s iPhone: From the corner, when I say that. But then, but I had a good doctor, Dr. Watson, he will he was describing my pain medicine and pretty much he was the one who said, Let me try you putting you on the box and

124
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're saying, let's think about when that might have been. So if we said

125
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: 30

126
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.420

130
00:11:48.720 --> 00:12:03.210
Justin’s iPhone: And then I was back on pills and then my wife found this doctor and Dr. Watson was like, let's take you off the pills and put you on Suboxone and see how that does for pain. And so I've started taking that for pain and I've been on that ever since.

131
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be correct me if I'm wrong, and I can hear that. Your wife is helping you.

132
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some real positives to having collateral information, but they're also maybe some challenges that you look to stay in communication about that is definitely an assessment from your memory I i'm I'm assessing your recall ability. So when she's feeding information I'm

133
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I love family at this is this is really exciting that she's such a participant in your recovery, but I'm assessing other things at the same time. So please, if you can, if you can't remember if you say, I don't remember.

134
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.230
