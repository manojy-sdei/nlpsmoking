40
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:23.670

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.410
Stanton Hazelroth: They were like unusual lovebirds the whole time.

42
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:51.870
Stanton Hazelroth: Growing up, we had this idyllic childhood. Now my younger brother was a bluebird. So we spend a lot of time, you know, being taken care of by the people down the street or in hospital waiting rooms or something. This model was in and out for surgeries and seven, and he died.

43
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.860
Stanton Hazelroth: So that was

44
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.970
Stanton Hazelroth: Pretty hard on the sad side.

45
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:12.180
Stanton Hazelroth: But my dad was a real creators and commercial artist, but he also made models and stuff and some of my friends still tell stories about the fun things he did so.

46
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.540
Stanton Hazelroth: You know, I thought it was always pretty good. My mom was a little weird about sex. But then now is her generation, I guess.

56
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:24.840
Stanton Hazelroth: I was did pretty well. So, and then I got involved in a lot of extracurricular activities. I wasn't really much financially. So it was more painted signs for the weekend pep rallies and different things like that.

57
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.390
Stanton Hazelroth: But it was in my teens. I first noticed a period of time when I felt depressed.

58
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:51.450
Stanton Hazelroth: And I didn't know it was a thing. But after I look back on it, I see. There were these specific maybe six months periods couple years that I was down and and then I come out of it. You find a year to

59
00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:04.710
Stanton Hazelroth: It might it again and then in law scores one really came falling down the insomnia. Got to last for several days several nights and

60
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:15.690
Stanton Hazelroth: I had to go start taking sleeping pills. I don't know what it was in the 70s, 60s 60s, I guess.

61
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.990
Stanton Hazelroth: But I have been

62
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.500

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and any past or present legal issues.

65
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:45.570
Stanton Hazelroth: Oh no, I mean, I was in business, my adult was part of my adult life, and so was engaged in a few lawsuits here and there, but

66
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.720
Stanton Hazelroth: It was all business.
