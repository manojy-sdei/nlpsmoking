Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, I'm sorry, people waiting. I didn't know that you have checked in and I just shut down my computer because I thought you were no shell. So I apologize.

3
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.180
Brian Kern: Okay.

4
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:58.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, thanks for showing up on point to be doing your bio psychosocial I'll be talking about past and present history in some information. Um, so, and then at the end, what we'll do is we'll develop the treatment plan together. Okay, so

5
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's start from the beginning. Brian, what, what brings you to seeking treatment now.

6
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Brian Kern: Well, I was clean for a couple years. I'm like, I went to

7
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.580
Brian Kern: I got arrested, about four or five years ago, I went to jail for almost 15 months.

8
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.800
Brian Kern: And then I went to rehab after I got jail shortly after I got a rehab I relapse. I used twice.

9
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.930
Brian Kern: And that was

10
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Captured that time frame.

11
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.660
Brian Kern: That

12
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.770
Brian Kern: That was 2000

13
00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:02.550
Brian Kern: It was 2018 cuz it would have been two years that I was clean. On January 21 of this year, but I relapsed right before then, and use a few times.

14
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.150
Brian Kern: And then that's why I'm seeking treatment now.

15
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:18.750
Brian Kern: Well, because I just moved to New Mexico. Six months ago and I wasn't really plugged in and like the mental health services here.

16
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:40.200
Brian Kern: So I couldn't get any of my like medication. So I was, I was like, extremely anxious, you know, and that's what led to me using using opiates again because I was so anxious I wasn't going to work every day and like just feeling terrible, you know,

17
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Diagnosis

18
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.440
Brian Kern: PTSD.

19
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.390
Brian Kern: And general anxiety generalized anxiety disorder.

20
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.110
Brian Kern: I was diagnosed with PTSD.

21
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.630
Brian Kern: Six years ago.

22
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.570
Brian Kern: Um, I was homeless, me and my twin brother are homeless together.

23
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.070
Brian Kern: And

24
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:26.220
Brian Kern: This this kids in front of dude basically like we were sleeping on benches, you know, so we're like really homeless, you know, and we were at these benches in Arlington, Virginia.

25
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:37.410
Brian Kern: Just, just like about to go to sleep. And this gets in front of dude asked my twin brother to put a cigarette out and my brother told them.

26
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:49.200
Brian Kern: Like, he was like, fuck you, you know, like he wasn't gonna put a cigarette out. So we went to sleep like we're on two separate benches right next to each other. We went to sleep and

27
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.560
Brian Kern: I will go up like three hours later and my right hand was hanging off and he had hit me in the face with a machete.

28
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.160
Brian Kern: And caught my eye out. And he tried to cut my head off.

29
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.060
So,

30
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:12.630
Brian Kern: Basically, uh, I was wandering down the street at that point bleeding to death and a cop cop having to drive by so I saved my life. My brother was alright to he got stabbed.

31
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.280
Brian Kern: Well yeah, I was diagnosed with PTSD after that.

32
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.170
Brian Kern: Yeah, it was pretty brutal

33
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.280
Brian Kern: Yeah.

34
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did they catch the person, the homeless guy.

35
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.480
Brian Kern: Yeah, yeah, he got arrested a couple days later.

36
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:51.060
Brian Kern: And then I don't think I was really I wasn't really diagnosed with PTSD until cuz my twin brother died a month after that of overdose. We were in a we're in a homeless shelter.

37
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.820
Brian Kern: He, he died of an overdose, like right after the machete attack.

38
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.460
Brian Kern: Yeah.

39
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How did you guys become homeless as a result of your addiction.

40
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:23.040
Brian Kern: Um, yeah, I was I was definitely homeless as a result of my addiction, my brother actually wasn't homeless until like a couple weeks before that happened like he was living with somebody and he got he like got kicked out of there so

41
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.500
Brian Kern: So he yeah I guess you could say he was probably a homeless as a result of his addiction to but I was definitely a homeless as a result of my addiction.

42
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me about that. How did you get to that point of homelessness.

43
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.510
Brian Kern: Um, well.

44
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.900
Brian Kern: Basically

45
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.870
Brian Kern: Um,

46
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.870
Brian Kern: I don't know, I guess like trying to think about it.

47
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.110
Brian Kern: Like I lived in a place because this was in Virginia. Like I lived in a place

48
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.240
Brian Kern: I had a townhouse like I was sharing with some people and then

49
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.000
Brian Kern: And then I started using again so I couldn't pay my bills.

50
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.440
Brian Kern: And I couldn't pay my rent.

51
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.440
Brian Kern: I was

52
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.440
Brian Kern: I was about 20 at the time.

53
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.440
Brian Kern: So,

54
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.920
Brian Kern: I was homeless for about six years.

55
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.470
Brian Kern: Yeah.

56
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So prior to that, when did the addiction start. How old were you when you first use any job.

57
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.930
Brian Kern: I was a when I first use any drugs.

58
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.800
Brian Kern: I was 15 when I first smoke weed.

59
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.440
Brian Kern: And then I tried smoking crack a little bit after that it was pretty quick. I got try and then I tried to hold

60
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.340
Brian Kern: I had a phase where I was doing like any drug. I could basically get, you know, I'm

61
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.310
Brian Kern: Doing a lot of ecstasy at one point.

62
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.440
Brian Kern: Was cocaine.

63
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.760
Brian Kern: And then when I was 18 is when I really discovered opiates.

64
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How did you discover the opium.

65
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.430
Brian Kern: Um,

66
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.090
Brian Kern: My friends, I had a friend who asked me if I wanted to try shooting heroin and I was I just said, sure.

67
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.830
Brian Kern: You know,

68
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.140
Brian Kern: 18

69
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.350
Brian Kern: Yeah.

70
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How long

71
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.290
Brian Kern: Until

72
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:51.510
Brian Kern: I mean, I was using ball time from that point until the machete attack.

73
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.320
Brian Kern: So I went to, I had to go to like court mandated mandated treatment. A couple times.

74
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.910
Brian Kern: Um, but I was still using like the whole time. Like I never got clean, pretty much.

75
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you recall how many times you sought out treatment for heart health. And what year

76
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:22.410
Brian Kern: Okay, so yeah. The first time I the first time I went to treatment. I was 19

77
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.380
Brian Kern: That was court mandated

78
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.890
Brian Kern: I went for a month.

79
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.070
Brian Kern: And then I had to go back to treatment to a three month program.

80
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.350
Brian Kern: About six months after that. So I was still 19

81
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.780
Brian Kern: And then

82
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.120
Brian Kern: I went to

83
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:57.330
Brian Kern: A couple years later, I don't remember exactly how old I was probably like 22 maybe I went to the place. Salvation Army treatment center for like a month.

84
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.370
Brian Kern: And then I got kicked out. So I got high in there and then

85
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.350
Brian Kern: And then I went to treatment.

86
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.790
Brian Kern: I went to. I went to treatment for two months, a year after the machete attack.

87
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.920
Brian Kern: So that I was 27 when I went to that.

88
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.310
Brian Kern: And then

89
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.530
Brian Kern: After that,

90
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:37.650
Brian Kern: You know, about four or five, four or five years ago, like four years ago when I got arrested.

91
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.290
Brian Kern: I went through.

92
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.590
Brian Kern: To jail and I went to treatment in jail.

93
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.560
Brian Kern: For nine months in jail.

94
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:56.700
Brian Kern: That was called the act unit that place helped me a lot, actually, like, that was the one treatment where I feel like I got a lot out of it.

95
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:05.580
Brian Kern: Even though I relapse after that. So then after I got out of jail that time I went to a place called Phoenix house.

96
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.660
Brian Kern: Which was the judge saying please house.

97
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What worked well then that made that

98
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.790
That timestamp.

99
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.960
Brian Kern: What would you ask

100
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you said, I think the X house the place that you went

101
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.440
Brian Kern: Back to unit.

102
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The acting that you said that

103
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That really helped you in your recovery. What was, yeah.

104
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.270
Definitely

105
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.180
Brian Kern: Um, I had a counselor in there. They're like, really helped me like

106
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:51.690
Brian Kern: Like get to like the bottom of why I was like using for so many years, and it just helped me like it was like one of those programs for you, like, people like

107
00:10:52.260 --> 00:11:05.970
Brian Kern: Can find each other on their issues. And so, you know, I mean, and like, I don't know, I just felt like it really helped me a lot, you know, and like I really wanted to stay clean after that I was sick and tired of everything.

108
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How long was that program.

109
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.680
Brian Kern: Oh, it was nine months long

110
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.270
Brian Kern: It was in the jail.

111
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.690
Brian Kern: When you were really yeah he

112
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relaxed again.

113
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:31.230
Brian Kern: Well, not right away when I was released from jail. I went right to another program called Phoenix house.

114
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.350
Brian Kern: For three months.

115
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.330
Brian Kern: Which I like that program to

116
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.440
Brian Kern: All those good, you know, and then I went to do

117
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:50.190
Brian Kern: So after Phoenix house. I went to a sober living that that that place ran called a

118
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.470
Brian Kern: What was it called

119
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.780
Brian Kern: I can't remember what it was called nothing about it.

120
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.340
Brian Kern: Called

121
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:10.530
Brian Kern: Oh yeah, it was like a sober living facility you know where you, like, get a job, and so, and I had a job when I went there.

122
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.590
Brian Kern: And then I i relapse.

123
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:22.260
Brian Kern: Basically, like there wasn't really anything to lead up to the relapse. It was just, I was hanging out with a couple friends from the act unit.

124
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.850
Brian Kern: And one of them got the idea that we should go get some some dough.

125
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.240
Brian Kern: And then we just send it off. It was like an idea that turned into like we were doing it, you know.

126
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.230
Brian Kern: And then after the first after that time I used I like I only used one other time.

127
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:49.980
Brian Kern: But I was obsessing about it the whole time. You know, I mean like in between up, you know, I was like obsessing about it and then

128
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.300
Brian Kern: The second time I used I overdose.

129
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.600
Brian Kern: And ended up in the hospital so

130
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.570
Brian Kern: So then I went back to

131
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was that

132
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:17.250
Brian Kern: That was two years ago. So yes, it was two years ago. That's why I was saying like, I would have been two years clean January 21 you know i mean what I use like right before then.

133
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Find out about our program before you got here.

134
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.650
Brian Kern: Well,

135
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.970
Brian Kern: My, my wife actually found it because

136
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.330
Brian Kern: Wife found it because

137
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.760
Brian Kern: Because I relapse like

138
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.100
Brian Kern: You know, a little more than a month ago lead before I got no program, you know,

139
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relax, a month.

140
00:13:47.250 --> 00:14:01.200
Brian Kern: I was just super because I couldn't get my like anxiety, like my PTSD meds because I was plugged into, like, I didn't have a doctor here. So I was super anxious, all the time. Yeah.

141
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.650
Brian Kern: And that's, that's what led me using heroin, because like I felt like that was the only thing that was going to take the edge off.

142
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.320
Brian Kern: Of like length it you know i mean
