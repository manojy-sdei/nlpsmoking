00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.530
Laura Lujan: I'm trying to find a bone tomorrow.

3
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I will hold on.

4
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I will sit here both hands on my desk racing myself.

5
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.810
Laura Lujan: The attitude.

6
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, but I have more where that came from.

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.400
Laura Lujan: I know you do.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.800
Laura Lujan: Okay.

9
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.790
Yeah.

10
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.670
Laura Lujan: Hello ladder. Yes.

11
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.470
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

12
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I appreciate all the preparation for the meeting.

13
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a solid self esteem.

14
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He

15
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is cracking me up.

16
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

17
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

18
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see. I'll get into, you can take a little bit more time and look around. I'll be opening up a note here.

19
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep keep looking.

20
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want you to have the experience of of privacy. I know you trust.

21
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Said,

22
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Kyle, but

23
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know the guy.

24
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So yesterday we could track back footsteps. Maybe in a bathroom. Do you take them off before you took a shower or

25
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.000
Laura Lujan: You

26
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.880
Laura Lujan: Know when

27
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.410
Laura Lujan: Pocket the book that I'm writing a shopping last time.

28
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: They fall off onto the floor from a nightstand or

29
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Today we do a

30
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Review of treatment goals.

31
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you have some in

32
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A drawer.

33
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo yo you used it on Tuesday, because you were there.

34
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We could just stick you in a closet and then we can

35
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.790
Laura Lujan: Write

36
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.760
Laura Lujan: That name.

37
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.480
Laura Lujan: Hey guys before

38
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.370
Laura Lujan: They weren't aware. I thought a lot of walking

39
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.670
Laura Lujan: I

40
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta get different perspective.

41
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.250
Is

42
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So take your time. Get those earbuds in and

43
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.070
Laura Lujan: Can you hear me.

44
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I can you hear me.

45
00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.400
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I can.

46
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what are you in a living room, which kind of role are you in

47
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.480
Laura Lujan: The bedroom, because how about long

48
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.770
Okay.

49
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're with Kyle.

50
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So we'll let will kind of keep it a bit superficial, which if I work out. I

51
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Have

52
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to look at your goals and kind of a little, a little something about each one

53
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I have one.

54
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.800
Laura Lujan: What do you mean

55
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.210
Your goals.

56
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your goal, the things you're working on, so

57
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The first one is I want to continue to stay sober. So that's

58
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the big one. That's probably one of the ones that kind of why you're here right

59
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, um, after having told me about the slip after you and I met

60
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times would you say your mind has wandered too well.

61
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.090
Laura Lujan: Morning before

62
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're thinking of using a little a lot more

63
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.320
Laura Lujan: And yeah, but it's not like I know that

64
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.450
Laura Lujan: I'm thinking about it as like a I'm an excuse is like

65
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.490
Laura Lujan: In essence of, like, oh my god, thinking. So why, why are not kind of thing. If I keep your money. You know what I mean.

66
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:07.650
Laura Lujan: And that's not really I don't I don't consider that me having cravings. Really, that's just me having a defense mechanism, you don't. I mean not not defense mechanism. But you know what I'm trying to say like I'm

67
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Justification maybe

68
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.060
Laura Lujan: Yeah, like I'm using it as like a counter argument, kind of thing.

69
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

70
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.940
Laura Lujan: I wasn't for him in my lifetime. I don't think I would have said that you know i mean

71
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.130
Let's talk

72
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, have been thinking about it more, and the way you've been thinking about it, is my dad drinks. And so why can't I use

73
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.790
Laura Lujan: Yeah yeah

74
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

75
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's the voice of the addict. That's the one that justifies negative behavior. The one that tells half truths. Right. Um,

76
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's the counter argument, the one that is you the authentic self. What's the argument back to well shit everybody's doing it. Come on dad to everybody's a hypocrite. Why don't we just get one.

77
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:12.960
Laura Lujan: could die.

78
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I could die.

79
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.530
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I could literally like, I mean it on the phone.

80
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you say more. Are you saying as much as like 20 times a day.

81
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.660
Laura Lujan: How often, okay. No, no, no, no.

82
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just me.

83
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.550
Laura Lujan: More time today.

84
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

85
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.200
Laura Lujan: Which again is a lot more than I was thinking about it. You know what I mean.

86
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.790
Laura Lujan: Like probably like a whole week like six times a week it back maybe five times.

87
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:59.880
Laura Lujan: So now it's like, All right, well, you know, it just justify more of my head I guess now but it shouldn't be. There's no excuse for that, you know,

88
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but that's that's you. That's this part of the brain, the one that can think about the present and the future. But let's separate the mind like from actual brain tissue because so brain tissue.

89
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Look what just happened. You just had a big euphoric effect very recently.

90
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.200
Laura Lujan: Mm hmm.

91
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your brain, the tissue. When you think about the brain chemistry, your brain. It went like this.

92
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It just, yeah, it just sent you a spray of

93
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Of dopa mean what okay so here's what I did it. Not only did you get this huge rush from from the math right but your brain gave you this big spray to reinforce that you

94
00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Go do that again. It wants this it doesn't it doesn't care that it's illegal and going to put your ass in jail. They don't care.

95
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't care. I don't care if you die right it thinks when there's that much jumping me why that's got to be a good thing.

96
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because a little bit. Yet when we eat a yummy cake.

97
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we have sex or something that's so feel so good. Yay for that.

98
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's sending you a spray of domain that will get you to remember the steps that it took to get to this big rush. So let's stay with this. This is new for a lot of people this chemistry part it reinforces all the steps it took

99
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to get to that big euphoric experience.

100
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're giving yourself a moral hard time you're calling yourself names over this right

101
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But this has nothing to do. This has nothing to do with spirituality. This has nothing to do with morals. This is chemistry. So you're wondering about it more because it had a recent spray

102
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Of dopamine and a huge rush of doing for me and it wants you to feel like that again.

103
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.480
Laura Lujan: My point I um

104
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.490
Laura Lujan: It's like I'm being the good of the disease. Is that why people play that kind of

105
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.850
Laura Lujan: Okay, that makes sense because honestly, I thought that was all bullshit like I think we're about, you know,

106
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.490
Laura Lujan: Going into these and I'm like a full shade disease. I'm like, I'm not saying that, you know,

107
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:34.950
Laura Lujan: I mean, people can call it, but all they want, you know, I'm all for people call it better and ever, but it's not a defeat. It's not you know I

108
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what you're saying I struggle with it.

109
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I don't use the term I'll admit, I don't. It's true.

110
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.420
I don't

111
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:48.780
Laura Lujan: I don't

112
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.020
Laura Lujan: Because I am not sure

113
00:12:53.070 --> 00:13:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, no, I get it, I and it's in. It's in our treatment plan to, you know, increased awareness of the disease model.

114
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. Um, this is maybe a way that you could get away with it.

115
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're at ease. You know that term. I'm at ease. I feel comfortable

116
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not anxious. I'm not angry. I'm not sad. I'm at ease.

117
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you kind of use it like that and you say this is a disease.

118
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can catch yourself with that one. That's

119
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.830
Laura Lujan: All good. Okay.

120
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.400
Laura Lujan: All right, that's not totally Vito now.

121
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.040
Laura Lujan: Again,

122
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it's coming back. So that's what I do with it. And instead, what I do is I talk about chemistry and I talked about

123
00:13:46.020 --> 00:14:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That tissue so unfortunately when you went and you did that met the other day. You just, you just made tissue that went from whatever that original experience of hopelessness confusion and craziness. You just made tissue to in the brain. And that's the unfortunate part

124
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, meaning you made a neural connection or 100. I don't know how many

125
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That that happened. Now I can't do anything about that. Those are facts right like so. Now, but what we can do is you can stop giving yourself a hard time

126
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's the thought. Now, we didn't have you just made a neural connection that wasn't there before. So yeah, you're going to think about it more, and remember your brain.

127
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:34.530
Is

128
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.480
Laura Lujan: Thinking

129
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know week. It's not like that. This is this

130
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.540
Laura Lujan: Is back. These are

131
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A mystery chemistry, chemistry. So here's the deal. The nice thing is you did make tissue. So that kind of sucks. But if you can remember this conversation. This is just my

132
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Brain trying to get my butt over to something that feels really good. That's like Neanderthal behavior and I'm smarter than that. I'm smarter than

133
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll use my my smart brain. The front part here. That's the old one that had me looking for for berries and and potatoes and you know Rutabaga. You know, it was had me foraging

134
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm smarter than that. I can, I can use another part of my brain. So you just have to kind of wait for that that frontal the prefrontal cortex to come on

135
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.370
Laura Lujan: But no quarter.

136
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.660
Of a because

137
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one. So you just kind of gotta wait for it. If you could just

138
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't be judgmental about that about you just say that's just my brain. I recently used. So there's more tissue connected to that right now. And so it's heading over there wants me to feel good. I better go to something else that feels good.

139
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.970
Laura Lujan: Like workout.

140
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, now

141
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.740
Laura Lujan: I actually thought I had been like, you know, I'm finding my head of like what would be me the thing euphoric feeling of like, you know, mess kind of thing.

142
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.940
Laura Lujan: And only thing I can think of that would like cat, a better show, you know,

143
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:17.220
Laura Lujan: Or you have so never something that you know meets all the criteria that gives you the thing. Feeling kinda you know I'm not going back.

144
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:27.900
Laura Lujan: Like because you know you get used to getting the adrenaline rush you know your your hyped up, you're not like you know now on your butt doing nothing, you know,

145
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's create a new goal because today is a day where we review goals. Anyway, let's create a new one that I don't want it to be mine. Notice you brought an exercise. Why don't you tell me what you want to do and I'll write it down.

146
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.760
Laura Lujan: Oh, I'm

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that I got. Okay, that's

150
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.330
Laura Lujan: Good diet down to like a bare minimum of, like, maybe once a day.

151
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.230
Laura Lujan: Because I do it a lot.

152
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

153
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.520
Laura Lujan: So we can conversation or whatever.

154
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.750
Absolutely.

155
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Cognitive Behavioral goal and I got that one. But what about this the one you said before.

156
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.470
Laura Lujan: What the word our

157
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.680

Gwenevere Abriel: Hear what it would be for you.

159
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.740
Laura Lujan: I mean, sorry. Sorry, I'm in a new workout one or number

160
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:45.420
Laura Lujan: Oh, he's developed the development plan may may may not work out all the way we develop a plan to where you know I go to the gym or an open yet so no develop a plan, or I go to the gym. So I thought was very good over

161
00:17:47.010 --> 00:18:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. So that's kind of what we're doing right now. So here's the first part first part is to write a goal. And our goal is develop a workout plan and that could be a goal. We could do that over the next month. It's something for us to sort of be tangible about and we can

162
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:11.070
Laura Lujan: Start then, you know, hopefully by the by the end of the month during open again.

163
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's cool. I will put that together.

164
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a goal develop a workout plan, quote unquote, and the objective is now this is where I come in.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the obstacle for you.

166
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.740

Gwenevere Abriel: While

Gwenevere Abriel: Our CK s

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.610

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, walking

Gwenevere Abriel: I got it. Alright, so we have walking

185
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What about, um, what about, do you have a bike.

186
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.630
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

187
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You have bike would, that would you want that to be part of the

188
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about

189
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: rollerblades skateboards. Things like that.

190
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.790
Laura Lujan: You know, I, are you kidding me, I'm done. Hard of Hearing not be horrible.

191
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.530
Laura Lujan: I not do that.

192
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, what about the gymnastics, how, how could that come back into your life.

193
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:18.660
Laura Lujan: Actually one of the one of the coordinators, I was talking to you on point, whatever she's doing but only in and go over what I wanted to hear. Whenever I'm like you know preferences or whatever on we talked to my meditation at one point in yoga.

194
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.760
Laura Lujan: And I'm not me. I can you know getting something like that or

195
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Goodness. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So now, now you're talking my speed. I like the walking and yoga those, that's my speed nowadays. I like it.

196
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.240
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

197
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.340
Laura Lujan: Like

198
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: gymnastics. You gotta stop my heart.

199
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

200
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So you already have things you like

201
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.240
Laura Lujan: You already

202
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Have in your life. So that's pretty cool.

203
00:20:53.790 --> 00:21:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To fill up a workout plan. Now, none of those really have to do with a gym. Those are things that you could be doing

204
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah, they could mean it's it's about kind of now turning our attention to what the obstacles are so now I want you to think about, let's just take walking. What keeps you from currently walking. Walking minutes

205
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.430
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I used to all the time. I got some

206
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:45.150
Laura Lujan: Um, but how are you doing stupidly high carb re, you know, to me, you know, walking and Al Gore dungeon, a good idea. So now we're talking about actually walking not high turn I feel for both, you know, have you know a positive feeling not the root of negative one here.

207
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

208
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.340
Now, whomever

209
00:21:48.570 --> 00:22:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's important that we talk about it for a second because um let's still talk about the walking. I wanted to check in. Are you saying I used to walk at two in the morning because I was high and I was trying to get to my next connect or I was high and I needed to put

210
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That energy

211
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.810
Laura Lujan: Someone to piss me off.

212
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:19.860
Laura Lujan: Or, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't understand me or something like that. And if I don't hear something. Right. And if you weren't repeat it. I get really mad.

213
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:33.480
Laura Lujan: So my thing is I would dip all the time and I didn't have the current clients on me. I wouldn't wait for anyone. So I would just leave it, you know, to me, whatever time it was or what are you doing, I'm going to do if I can't hear you.

214
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.300
Laura Lujan: Are you know he would like that.

215
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.420
Laura Lujan: So that's what I mean. I would never walk to recognize

216
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so now I want you to try this on.

217
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Have some compassion for the fact that there is a reason maybe that walking is not as appealing.

218
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when you were walking before you were mad and hurt and rejected and not taken care of and ignored and not important.

219
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Why walking. Not that appealing.

220
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:16.590
Laura Lujan: Thing. Because, like, it's so it's so hot. I said it was still like a way for me to calm down.

221
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:31.800
Laura Lujan: Okay, whenever I arrived her walking that I forget all the problems and you like calm down and texting, whoever the hell I lost it over like look, I'm dying. I couldn't hear you weren't being you know what I mean. And I'm like, calm down and go back and more normal

222
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.240
Laura Lujan: Normal

223
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.600
Laura Lujan: Normal. Oh.

224
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so that is so walking is a coping skill. Yeah. Yep, good.

225
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.740
Laura Lujan: And are not going to be coping and, you know, natural

226
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.170
Laura Lujan: Beneficial scroll, you know, yep.

227
00:23:52.380 --> 00:24:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, now that we've explored that let's talk a little bit about biking. Is there anything that could get in the way of you, biking, for example, that you have a tire that is flat or

228
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.040
No.

229
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.490
Laura Lujan: No, not yet. I'm going to soon as you get done with her. Oh.

230
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.730
Laura Lujan: I will do

231
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.140
Laura Lujan: That

232
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So anything that we get in the way of biking. For example, where is the bike.

233
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:40.770
Laura Lujan: Our moms. But worst case scenario of absolutely i mean i'd have caused by me, New York.

234
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.260
Laura Lujan: Or Chicago, Miami, New into

235
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we need to buy a bike.

236
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.690
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I guess I have it on the mom so I could get that one bath, but I'd rather not get norms.

237
00:24:52.980 --> 00:25:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's not right. I mean, that's what this is all about. It's about sort of protecting recovery. Let's not bring more risk into your life. That's definitely is not what I want.

238
00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay. So I wrote it down one barrier to biking might be. We need to buy one.

239
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.980
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I get that. I'm going to call him my mentor.

240
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then. Oh, have you ever done meditation.

241
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:34.650
Laura Lujan: No, I haven't. Like I said that that chick from her health told me that I should know you said like based on all the criteria that I gave her an Irish Ma ma ma might actually benefit from it and I like it. Maybe

242
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.420
Laura Lujan: We wouldn't hold on.

243
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.100
Laura Lujan: So,

244
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We can we can explore a little bit of that together.

245
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.780
Laura Lujan: Yeah, we can look it up and touching on see what it's about. And, you know,

246
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.440
Laura Lujan: No one can see it.

247
00:25:50.640 --> 00:26:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So an interesting thing with meditation is people think it's one thing, but it turns out it's another

248
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: People think meditation is clearing your mind of all thoughts and so I have a thought I must be failing at meditation, I can't do meditation. Now, that's not it. Meditation means you're sitting with a thought that comes in.

249
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get back present into the body, or let's say you are focused on a little, a little light or something.

250
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But the idea that a thought won't come

251
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is ridiculous.

252
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The thoughts are going to come

253
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not failing and meditation, just because you have a thought. I just want to start with that. Okay.

254
00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay but the effort of over and over and over, continuing to be mindful and coming back to the body.

255
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It is healing and transformative. And I agree, it would be good for you as it is for all of us.

256
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I love it. So we'll do a little bit of that together.

257
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's talk about yo go okay so you have options for yoga on the internet, like all over the place.

258
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.050
Laura Lujan: So I've actually had a little bit of returning to with yoga, not much more. And I was like,

259
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:43.980
Laura Lujan: Seven, eight me my grandma used to do yoga a lot because she um she had a really bad back and so every morning she would do yoga and I'm doing with her like I even have my mom, my

260
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.230
Laura Lujan: Hearing. Yeah.

261
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:55.770
Laura Lujan: Yeah, so I'm a little curious and then mag guys, like I said, I have been you remember what we did, or whatever, but remember we did it.

262
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So as a starter maybe what I'll do is I ran across and they're all over the internet, you're not gonna have any problems fight.

263
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Fight, you know, type in five minute yoga 10 Minute. Yo, you're going to get those. They're going to be all over

264
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I ran across one that I have sent two people. I'm going to see if I can find it, it's only five minutes.

265
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But she's, she's really moving

266
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:23.970
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

267
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And since we're we're easing our way in to this idea of developing a workout plan.

268
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe if you look at this video, you might do it once a week.

269
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: For five

270
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how hard could that be what I've shoot you know I've done it. I'm going to meet with Quinn and I'll just do

271
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything for five minutes I cram it in there. Okay, so then you did it.

272
00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And but something else might happen. Something cool might happen after that five minutes, and I'd be curious to see what happens after that. So are you want me to see if I can track it down at some point and get it to you.

273
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.100
Laura Lujan: Yeah, that'd be cool.

274
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. I'm seeing it'll pop up right now and I

275
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.800
Laura Lujan: promise I won't pull it. Yeah. What I do with my dad not watch. I promise I watch to watch it.

276
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot about that.

277
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.020
Laura Lujan: I didn't

278
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask you, it's only five minutes. I promise it's literally called a five minute you know that so

279
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. I'm just going to see if this is her. If it is, then I'll just show you it is so I lucked out, just so you can get an idea of what she's doing. Okay.

280
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi I'm Nina. Yeah, we're gonna get it. So we're going to start at the top of the math.

Laura Lujan: Yeah.

291
00:30:49.260 --> 00:31:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. Um, so, so far, notice she's not too fast. She's not too slow. I find her case kind of nice. And she names everything

292
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.200
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I think I've written a little device for

293
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going too fast.

294
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.110
Well,

295
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.080
Laura Lujan: Maybe the lagging maybe it does look like

296
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:19.110
Laura Lujan: My voice and things like it's not up to par with her thing I thought about that. I mean I the video has to be like in summer. You know what I mean.

297
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

298
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:33.180
Laura Lujan: Voicing like a phone too fast and she's done like level to move before it just the video, you're good. I agree that it's just a video of them. Yeah, I agree. I can fit Hakeem was right and that's

299
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.130
Laura Lujan: And that's good, like

300
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I think too. So in the front. So I fast forward through for talking and I go right to right where it starts, maybe go in a minute. It's literally

301
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This whole video is five minutes and 27 seconds. So, yeah.

302
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no it's not. I'm not kidding. It really is five minutes. But if you do, what she's doing just

303
00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel it.

304
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you'll do it again. Or maybe you'll do it. And this time we'll try and do it do the pose before she does. And you'll think oh this is

305
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This is chatter Rhonda or something or whatever. She says, I'm trying to remember the word. But notice how this is a new

306
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing to do. It's going to occupy your brain. So it's more than just about exercise, it's about doing something new.

307
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When those thoughts about using come up, you might say, you know what, I'll add this to my list of things to do. I'll just turn this video on it's only five minutes.

308
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll kick everybody out of the room. I mean, everybody can wait five minutes, I

309
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Darn near do it in a bathroom. If it's big enough, I get this done. And now, my head is striking

310
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've just done something that took my full attention. And I don't know all the word she's using and these poses are a little awkward, and I have to concentrate on them. So it'd be a good thing to actually use as a distraction to to get your mind off of using

311
00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

312
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll send it to you. And this text, the message the phone. Our phone number. I've been using is a good one.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.310
Laura Lujan: Yeah, baby.

314
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what I'm doing. What am I doing maybe

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.500

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.720
Laura Lujan: I have a thing where, after like after that one little thing I've been smoked cigarettes after

328
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.100
Laura Lujan: Okay. Good thing. Yeah, because I don't feel that way.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.470
Record.

365
00:37:50.490 --> 00:38:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we want to start with where you're at and we want it to go down. We don't want it to go up. So how many times a day do you have one of those.

366
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.920
Do you have a little

367
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.420
Laura Lujan: Over

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole thing any of those times a day do you have negative self talk, is it

370
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: 100 times a day.

371
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it 20 times a day. Is it once a day, just give me a rough or so that we can see it start to decrease

372
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:32.940
Laura Lujan: I go to like this whole thing is I just added that I call it an episode. It's like 30 seconds and just me rambling on about what the hell I did wrong, whatever about what you know.

373
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.530
Yeah, then

374
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:44.160
Laura Lujan: Kind of waking a sock or whatever. And then also gay. I'm sorry, you know, get over it. I probably haven't tried. Like, I don't know, six or 700

375
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go.

376
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, from seven

377
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.780
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

378
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it's an episode of of just

379
00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:03.300
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I'm just whatever the hell yeah I never, I didn't even go yeah I'm doing on your own time thrown at them.

380
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.630
Laura Lujan: All right. Okay. All right. Yeah, right.

381
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So over the next 30 days, let's don't go too fast. We want to reinforce and praise when you make progress. What would feel like progress, but it's not rushing what would feel like can do a better, but it's not perfect yet.

382
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.260
Or

383
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Four times so we're

384
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:35.340
Laura Lujan: Getting the episodes down to like, you know, maybe a couple sentences instead of like a whole 32nd period of just

385
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and we

386
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.730
Laura Lujan: Don't know which way you want to go with it. We are

387
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.990
Laura Lujan: A bit more, you know,

388
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: See, so one of them has to do with the duration and one has to do with frequency

389
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

390
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.020
Laura Lujan: If you can put them all on see which one you know

391
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll do that we'll say client will decrease from seven times a day to

392
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.030
Laura Lujan: Four.

393
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Times a day.

394
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:06.630
Laura Lujan: As

Gwenevere Abriel: Nice 30

398
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:24.360
Laura Lujan: I can probably do a lot of that we are again if I actually thought about it and you know actually worked on it. I know I can find me.

399
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I do too. But I also want you to celebrate success in 30 days. I also want you to not have too many things that you're working on. So do you want me to change it from 15 seconds to a different number.

400
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.510
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

401
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:46.680

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:27.450
Laura Lujan: Well, I got a call me they kind of slacking right. I thought everybody else has the whole um I like begging forever and usually like heroin.

408
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If yeah if you were in group today, you would have heard two people talking all about alcohol and then two people talking about math.

409
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:43.920
Laura Lujan: And running

413
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know that is the norm is that it doesn't matter, but you just haven't run across the exact composition

414
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: In a group to know that there's all kinds of stuff in there and some people right they fall in love with buprenorphine and they're addicted to the very thing that we're giving them so

415
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I need to be like us, providing your mess. It's really quite a pickle.

416
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

417
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.190
Laura Lujan: But I liked in jail too much.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

422
00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the places she had to hide that. I don't even want to hear about it.

423
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:57.270
Laura Lujan: Right. It's funny because like, that was one of the reason why they want to get released to a halfway house.

424
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:04.200

Laura Lujan: Know, finding

456
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Out what we talked about was that we might be acting in we might be turning

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.100
Laura Lujan: Pro. Yeah.

458
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We might be turning it towards self injury and that is also

459
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.030
Laura Lujan: Self. SOUND Oh no. Yeah.

460
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.970

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.830
Laura Lujan: Huh. Shouldn't me for like for most people. It's not but

462
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

463
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:40.800
Laura Lujan: I like self injury is kind of one were like, I don't understand it is. And the thing is, like, um, my ex boyfriend at one point he had a daughter who was 13 dot whatever i was i like I think I just turned 19 knowledge he, I don't know, whatever. Well, his daughter referred to us.

464
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:49.620
Laura Lujan: But, um, he was cutting and my boyfriend is my concern, you need to do to do. And I'm like, Well, if there's nothing you can do ashes.

465
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.350
Laura Lujan: Nothing you can do. You just gotta you know let her deal with it you know she she's going through her and stuff. Just like you know

466
00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.850
Laura Lujan: It's not, it's not as bad as I saw the cuts. They weren't that bad, they were just, you know, like little bits of paper customer. I mean, like they were like all

467
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:10.830
Laura Lujan: Gushing you know deep and like the fact that I was able to even begin to understand that he was like, kind of like really a little bit

468
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:20.250
Laura Lujan: Okay. And, you know, so I was able to help on that level, but it's just like I said it's a touchy subject. I've moved on and on, they freaked out.

469
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so I'm. Do I look like I'm freaking out.

470
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.570
Laura Lujan: Well, no.

471
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:25.440
Laura Lujan: No, no.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.880
Laura Lujan: And I love that about you.

473
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like the discussion because it isn't, it isn't.

474
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't. I want to die. It's I want relief. I want it.

475
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.720
Laura Lujan: I want to feel her. Thank you.

476
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get that. So what if we wrote a goal.

477
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the the cutting behavior. If we say this is how often it happens. You have to tell me this is how often happens, or maybe it only happens when

478
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's one of those episodes of negative self doubt and they one of those last, you know, 24 hours or something, I don't know when it on. I don't know.

479
00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:19.020
Laura Lujan: What happened to me whenever I feel like I'm in the wrong. Oh, I like that, that I have to do in order to make it okay for example, like if I end up

480
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:28.140
Laura Lujan: If. Can I count on and I don't know car ride or whatever. And I forgot to tell him something that he was supposed to do, or something.

481
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:38.460
Laura Lujan: And I said, oh, crap, I'm trying to, what do you want me to do them because, like, what, what do I do. He's like, You don't do anything. What do you mean, what I want you to do at the last thing I want you to do.

482
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:46.260
Laura Lujan: And then I, you know, think about it on my guy you're right across from you and your new coach, like I knew better, you know, but that's the first thought that I have is

483
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:56.940
Laura Lujan: Well, how do I pick the star icon, like what do I do things like what, like what I would do that, you know, and his reaction is the same every time. But again, and getting to the point where I'm like, wait.

484
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.440
Laura Lujan: A minute not you know
