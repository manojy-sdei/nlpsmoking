00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.510
Angelo Archuletta: You know, and I mean I've never been anything

81
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:06.960
Angelo Archuletta: You know, I've never ever been violent. I've never been in any way, you know, sexual or anything like

82
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you know

83
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.530
Angelo Archuletta: For this, you know, and I've never

84
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.910
Angelo Archuletta: Displayed in it. But the most harmful behavior was my drug addiction, but I never brought that around the girls.

85
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.990
Angelo Archuletta: You know, and I never worked.

86
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, but because of that.

87
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:42.630
Angelo Archuletta: I was dangerous, you know, and like, and I don't know I guess on her. Her dad side like I guess she had an uncle that that had like died, you know, was under the same circumstances, drug abuse and stuff like that that had died from his drug abuse. He had gotten clean or whatever and

88
00:07:44.520 --> 00:08:04.650
Angelo Archuletta: He was feeling for like two years or something and then the one time he relapsed he died, you know, and so, you know, there's that you know don't get don't get too close to D him because he could end up just, you know, they pretty much put at it, you know. Yeah.

89
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.340
Angelo Archuletta: As well.

90
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.600
You know and i mean

91
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:28.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this, this restoration process has been so difficult for you as far as acceptance from your family members because they're still judging from your past transgressions, is this kind of like the culture of your family. Is it difficult for them as others transgressions.

92
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their Angela.

93
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:35.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

94
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.340
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah, you just came back he froze for us.

95
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:47.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For a minute there. Yeah, I said this, this process of restoration has been challenging for you because, despite the years of sobriety under your belt.

96
00:08:48.330 --> 00:09:06.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're still being held or judged based on your past addiction. And I'm wondering if this is just kind of have your family, the culture of your family. Is it is it like this in all situations are they typically kind of like the family that hold on to what you've done in the past and

97
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.070
less forgiving. Oh.

98
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.110
Angelo Archuletta: Very much so.

99
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.950
Angelo Archuletta: And like

100
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.600
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. I

101
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:21.480
Angelo Archuletta: Especially with me on. I don't know. Like, it seems like with with me, especially you know they hold on to stuff and you know like I'm

102
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:40.230
Angelo Archuletta: Like I'm like the black sheep, for some reason, you know, and I hate to sound like the, you know, everybody always picks on me, you know, but like it, it seems, for me, it seems like I live to a different set of standards and everybody else.

103
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.030
Angelo Archuletta: I'm held to a

104
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.540
Angelo Archuletta: Completely different set of rules and standards.

105
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.730
Angelo Archuletta: than everybody else.

106
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let me on

107
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our session to watch a video.

108
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:05.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That talks about these situations because this family dynamic doesn't doesn't help you to get past

109
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:17.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The black or white kiki and the feeling of isolation and disconnect you know in trauma, it's important to have those social supports and that connection within the community as part of

110
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:29.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The healing process. But it becomes difficult if you can't get best support within your own internal network. So I hear the struggle and I just want it to run

111
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:41.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I saw this video part of you. And I wanted to share it with you just so that we can have one discuss and hear your thoughts on this video. What this experience has been like for you so

112
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:56.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is there anyone in your family that you feel is like that that safe space that doesn't hold judgment against you.

113
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.560
Angelo Archuletta: Sometimes my mom, you know, but I mean, it always backfires

114
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.210
Angelo Archuletta: You know,

115
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.860
Inconsistent

116
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:12.630
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah.

117
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.630
Angelo Archuletta: Like I'll confide

118
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.410
Angelo Archuletta: In her

119
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:33.120
Angelo Archuletta: In like she'll like so back at you know like when we're in a fighter and every you know she'll like roller eyes and like, here we go again. You know what. Next you're gonna kill yourself right you know and like you know like make fun of me about, you know, and it's just like

120
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.920
Angelo Archuletta: You know I

121
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's your family's background culturally

122
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

123
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.700
Angelo Archuletta: Like we were raised Hispanic more

124
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:08.040
Angelo Archuletta: But I mean, we're always raised pretty middle class, you know, upper middle class, I'd say. I mean, we, I mean, I grew up.

125
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.730
Angelo Archuletta: In nice homes, you know, but like I didn't know they was

126
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:23.250
Angelo Archuletta: We were never like we were always raised to be very proper, you know, we couldn't make messes or anything.

127
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.880
Angelo Archuletta: Like that.

128
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.500
Angelo Archuletta: You know, I mean,

129
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:40.020
Angelo Archuletta: For instance, you know, one of the first houses. I remember, you know, was we had an indoor swimming pool, you know, which was, you know, I mean even still, it's pretty crazy.

130
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.120
Angelo Archuletta: But, I mean, we never used

131
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It, you know,

132
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:56.880
Angelo Archuletta: I think we got in it one time, you know, because it was it was more for show, you know, and it was more of like my parents like status, you know, but like they could never afford to heat it up.

133
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:16.740
Angelo Archuletta: You know, to spend time in it and like we were always like working around it. You know, like working on the, you know, on the landscaping and stuff like that around it, you know, maintaining nap. But like we'd never like really enjoyed the actual the actual pool, you know,

134
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So okay, so what was your family's

135
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.060

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.270
Angelo Archuletta: Sending a halt.

138
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.730
Angelo Archuletta: To nonprofit charity bingo halls and stuff like that so

139
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.480
And there's

140
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sorry, they were produced successful

141
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you know, their business.

142
00:13:47.400 --> 00:14:10.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The reason why I ask is because socio economic status and culture plays a huge course and our perception of things and how we view reality. And so when I hear you know the Hispanic culture, you know, what are typically their views when it comes to addiction versus mental health.

143
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um,

144
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.100
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. My dad always thought it was a bunch of BS.

145
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, like

146
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean, he thought that

147
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:30.690
Angelo Archuletta: Therapy was, you know, silly and like it was just, you know, that, that the world was getting to sense and I mean this was back in the 90s.

148
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know when you know like

149
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.880
Angelo Archuletta: Things were starting to

150
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.070
Angelo Archuletta: come to light.

151
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know where people were

152
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.040
Angelo Archuletta: You know, were

153
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:54.090
Angelo Archuletta: victims were, you know, encouraged to speak up and have a voice. You know, like I remember in elementary school like my dad, you know, one of the counselors pulled me aside because she'd seen

154
00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:08.700
Angelo Archuletta: bruises on my legs, you know, and like, you know, I didn't say anything about it, you know, because I need better than anything. And I remember my dad just be, you know, like all the people are bunch of pussies, you know, everything is

155
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.160
Angelo Archuletta: Used to them and blah, blah, blah.

156
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.600
Angelo Archuletta: You know, and I

157
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:18.300
Angelo Archuletta: Got a lot of that kind of stuck on stage, you know, like I believe you know like

158
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:25.110
Angelo Archuletta: This is what normal. You know, like, this is what boys go through, you know, this is when toughens in

159
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:25.800
This

160
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Process. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

161
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like he's just

162
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He's teaching me to be a man.

163
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's been my understanding to when I look cultural implications, is that addiction and mental health, you know, they're not really looked as an illness, it's looked at as a scapegoat.

164
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:56.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, a way of trying to get attention. And so even when you said that your mama throwback. Let me guess. Now you want to kill yourself.

165
00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:03.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it's that lack of empathy because it's coming from a place of believing that your addiction and also your mental health.

166
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:11.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is just attention seeking behavior and not realizing that you know there's a chemical imbalance, there's a dependency.

167
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're working and trying to get your emotional brain and your rational brain on the same alignment and it's a constant daily struggle. So do that to ensure that

168
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:35.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you're not in a safe space that welcomes you to get in line and tone with that and then social economic status. I'm thinking that heightens and even more because now we're talking about status.

169
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:45.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're talking about how you're perceived. So those are two things against you. Not working in your favor. As far as empathy goes

170
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because the social economic status. I could imagine to get to that level of

171
00:16:52.170 --> 00:17:06.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: After speech. It didn't include much compassion towards others and empathy, it was more about discipline, which is probably as to why you were physically abuse so often was all about discipline.

172
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Structure family rules.

173
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.740
Angelo Archuletta: And humility. I mean, nobody would you say like like don't everything like

174
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.230
Angelo Archuletta: You know, you deserve anything or anything like that was very clear, you know,

175
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:36.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's that cultural aspect coming in that's not from the social economic status speaking. That's that cultural aspect talking like a, you know, we come from humble beginnings, we work so hard to get here. And this is our success. It's not yours.

176
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.700
Angelo Archuletta: You're not old anything

177
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.450
Angelo Archuletta: You know,

178
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.520
Angelo Archuletta: I mean you but I mean you

179
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.060
Angelo Archuletta: You're capable to earn the same you know

180
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.710
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah, but I mean,

181
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reducing yeah

182
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.130
Right.

183
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what aspects. Do you feel you contribute

184
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the family dynamic

185
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.220
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. I struggle.

186
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:15.570
Angelo Archuletta: I struggle to find, like, you know, and that's why like it means so much to me to get out there and help

187
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.060
Angelo Archuletta: And to participate.

188
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.950
Angelo Archuletta: For me, my, you know, I

189
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.940
Angelo Archuletta: Know like I was just gonna say like my my yard or whatever, you know, I think, you know, I take pride in

190
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.740
Angelo Archuletta: You know, then like I've got you know I'm always taking taking pride in my yard.

191
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.570
Angelo Archuletta: You know and like

192
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.030
Angelo Archuletta: They're out there working on something with

193
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.030
Angelo Archuletta: It, you know, and I can just pay you know and

194
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

195
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.370
Angelo Archuletta: That's like my contribution to the family, you know, it's like

196
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:08.700
Angelo Archuletta: Getting the yard nice you know and like they've taken that over, you know. And so now, like my contribution is

197
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.750
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know, I just, I'm not contributing

198
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: more value than the landscape.

199
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.850
Angelo Archuletta: I really don't participate a lot in the family like

200
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, it almost felt they don't allow you a space to participate.

201
00:19:48.090 --> 00:20:02.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And with that, coming from that. Okay, the cultural implications that we're considering the social economic status. I'm thinking, once you're able to get a hold of what your value is. And that's been related

202
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:10.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then they can see back right because it's all about production. What do you bring to the table.

203
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:22.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. It's difficult to say what you bring to the table when you don't have the confidence to even explain that because

204
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:37.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have a confidence in the landscaping. You know, I saw that when you said to your mom. I don't care. She wants from there. I'm going to be there because this is where I shine. This is where I'm able to show what I produce, but it was still shut down.

205
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

206
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it realistic or practical. Have you ever envisioned.

207
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Living somewhere else. What would that look like for you.

208
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.850
Angelo Archuletta: Um,

209
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.400
Angelo Archuletta: Actually, that's

210
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.890
Angelo Archuletta: Become one of, like, that was kind of

211
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:14.550
Angelo Archuletta: My, my first reaction to was, you know, like I think it's time for me to like this is obviously not a healthy environment for me so I mean really and truly. The only thing I can do is move on from here and now that like I'm getting my

212
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.440
Angelo Archuletta: Disability and I'm getting some day to

213
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.970
Angelo Archuletta: Be a pretty

214
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:30.510
Angelo Archuletta: Pretty nice chunk of change. So yeah, that's probably going to be my first priority is getting my own space, you know, and

215
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.250
Angelo Archuletta: surrounding myself with

216
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.020
Angelo Archuletta: With people that can

217
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.330
Angelo Archuletta: You know, build me up. Instead, instead of just tear me down.

218
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:58.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because to try to get the things that we're talking about, and that I know it's not just me that mentioned it's you want you want it for yourself. But you're not in an emotionally safe environment that allows you to have insight about what you bring to the, you know,

219
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's so much more than the landscaping, you know, the being such interesting perspective.

220
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:16.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the way you break down like on the body and the symptoms. I'm like, jeez, like that is not my specialty on where the therapy, but the way you can break down the scientific structure of the brain and all this stuff.

221
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:28.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean sometimes you talk about the April, and it's almost like it's just you two guys like just speaking medically and no one else is in the room. I see you come alive when you're able to talk about that.

222
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's intellect there there's intelligence, as well as the skill set of being able to garden.

223
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:44.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I don't know the last time you heard what you're good at. But I want you to to hear what I noticed

224
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right now listing this place.

225
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.670
I don't know.

226
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.010
Angelo Archuletta: It's hard to hear.

227
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.720
Angelo Archuletta: You know, like a compliment.

228
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.420
Angelo Archuletta: I'm just like,

229
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.020
Angelo Archuletta: I've been like, so like

230
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:39.240
Angelo Archuletta: Just at my wit's end for so long and like just just blatant like you know like everybody could see you know like the nobody sees it, you know, and it's just

231
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.310
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

232
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:55.170
Angelo Archuletta: I keep like welcoming same abuse like so it's like I start wondering like, what is it I'm doing to

233
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:02.010
Angelo Archuletta: To welcome that and like to, to encourage that, you know,

234
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell you this research that supports that.

235
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:21.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: survivors of trauma, often they go back to the same structure and the same environment because what they're internalized is that eventually they can return to that.

236
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:21.570
Angelo Archuletta: Place.

237
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And be victorious.

238
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.210
Angelo Archuletta: They can change the law.

239
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like those movies you watch with those books you

240
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Read back into several different endings.

241
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:37.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It starts off the same but then towards the end, you can create an ending. That's what trauma or physical

242
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Journey. Yeah.

243
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:52.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what trauma does to you. It gives you this AWS perspective that even if the environment is not emotionally safe, even if it's not nurturing, I will return to

244
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.130
Angelo Archuletta: It because

245
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One, it's no it's no place for me.

246
00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Into

247
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.140
Angelo Archuletta: These pillars in

248
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.590
Angelo Archuletta: I I create these pillars within that

249
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.630
Situation, I

250
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.370
Angelo Archuletta: I create these pillars of familiar trauma.

251
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.630
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah, with the

252
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Situation that aren't really there. Yeah. Because like you said, the key word is it's familiar

253
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:35.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's familiar to trauma victims have this compulsion to repeat they repeat against the anxiety. You know, you may see some compulsions that you have the source of your trauma.

254
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:45.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm not saying this to justify that keep doing it. But to let you know that

255
00:25:46.500 --> 00:26:04.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're not just this person that keeps wanting it. It's your trauma that motivates you to this compulsion to repeat and to this hope and this expectation that even a painful situation, you'll be able to be a master over it and you'll find a new resolution.

256
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:14.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I want to encourage you to find a resolution to find alternative safe space because

257
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This environment is

258
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.820
Angelo Archuletta: I just, I don't, I don't know where to

259
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:37.860
Angelo Archuletta: Where to go from here, like with with my son and stuff like, you know, do I give them this the cold shoulder. Do I, you know, beg for his attention. Do I just

260
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:45.210
Angelo Archuletta: I mean, how do I interact with. I mean, when you get snubbed like that and like rejected.

261
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's

262
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.340
Angelo Archuletta: What's the proper way to

263
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.970
Angelo Archuletta: To react.

264
00:26:55.290 --> 00:27:07.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Boundaries, so you don't have why because avoidance doesn't solve any issues. So it's one having this awareness that okay, Angela.

265
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:18.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have a tendency to repeat a compulsion to repeat, even though this is a trigger for you. This is an unsafe environment. It's a familiar place.

266
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:27.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Lana happy awareness that this this environment as I create emotional safety for me. How can I create an emotional safe environment within this home.

267
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:39.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it's not like you get this information and you move tomorrow. But in the interim until you find a new place altogether that emotional safety looks like establishing your boundaries.

268
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:52.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And being in places that welcome and not allowing people to talk down to you because like you said, I get that sense to your mom waivers.

269
00:27:53.010 --> 00:28:09.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's what makes it so complex. She waves in her role to be nurturing so go from nurturing to condemning you don't know when it's been a shift. And then when she makes that shift we go back to the self loading the condemnation and not feeling worthy and

270
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:18.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when her nurturing hat is on. It's very protecting because for her to keep trying to, you know, persuade you to come inside.

271
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:30.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then tell you later. Hey, listen, some. The reason why I said is a killer just doesn't want to be around to me that shows that she was really trying to protect you from rejection

272
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:40.740
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah, and I mean even afterwards, you know, because I had taken off I went to go run to Maryland, like, you know,

273
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:58.140
Angelo Archuletta: She was, you know, like very apologize, you know, she was like, I got into it with Andrew and I told him you know it's not right what he's doing, you know that I'm trying to, you know, she had a talk with him. You know, you know, really trying to

274
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.740
Angelo Archuletta: Work with him. And it's messed up that you're giving me so much resistance, you know,

275
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.580
Angelo Archuletta: And I mean, she's between

276
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.250
Angelo Archuletta: I mean, she's kind of stuck in the middle.

277
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know as the

278
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.070
Angelo Archuletta: coarser as the

279
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.260
I mean,

280
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:23.310
Angelo Archuletta: She's stuck between me and Minecraft. The rest of the family.

281
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.000
You know,

282
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Look like if you move her as the mediator.

283
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you were able to establish the boundaries with your son, so he knows the rules and regulations of how how to communicate with my father.

284
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that looks like for you, how comfortable it with enforcing those

285
00:29:51.960 --> 00:30:00.330
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know when I try when I've tried in the past, it just, it usually ends badly for me where I'm ultimately

286
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:13.590
Angelo Archuletta: You know, like whatever I said doesn't go and I'm yelled at, you know, and I'm kind of put down and put in my place and my son sitting there kind of, you know, like

287
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See you place your mom. Yeah.

288
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:24.510
Angelo Archuletta: Or my sister or, you know, like, because I'll try and talk to them, you know, and they're like,

289
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.580
Angelo Archuletta: You know what, you got to understand, you know,

290
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.830
Angelo Archuletta: Andrews point of view, you know, and so, you know, and I get their point of view, like

291
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:32.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't know if you

292
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:46.260
Angelo Archuletta: Weeks ago I you know told him that he had to come with me. You know, I picked him up from school and he just completely refuse to to participate that and that's usually what he does, you know,

293
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:46.830
The only

294
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.210
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. The only time he wants to

295
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.070
Angelo Archuletta: To come around as if he's going to get something out of it, you know.

296
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:11.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Opportunities to create one on one conversations because it sounds like when you're communicating with them. There's an audience. Your mom stereo systems there.

297
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:29.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And these are you know your mom has immune system and her natural role, you already know that your sister is not a supporter. So putting yourself in unsafe environments where you want to exert your boundaries. There's so much opposition. You're putting yourself right at the battle line.

298
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.140
Angelo Archuletta: Right.

299
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:38.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I opportunities to enforce these boundaries with your son in one on one settings.

300
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.200
Angelo Archuletta: Probably for, like, once I get my own place.

301
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.590
Angelo Archuletta: I mean, because like right now. I mean, I

302
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.650
Angelo Archuletta: They made it clear that I have no room to speak like

303
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.160
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know why I mean

304
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.050
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. They're just always undermining me and it's

305
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.610
Angelo Archuletta: Like

306
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.210
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know how to

307
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:27.600
Angelo Archuletta: Get away from that, you know, like how to bypass that. You know, so I end up just, you know, just be like, all right, you know what, whatever. Do whatever you're going to do and I obviously my opinion doesn't matter. You know,

308
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:36.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your time is over time that your opinion doesn't matter. And then over time, it creates this expectation

309
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:55.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That again that compulsion to repeat. I am going to attempt to discipline, my son in audience. I know that's unhealthy. Are you know the outcome is going to be that they say, I'm in the wrong and hence further

310
00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:02.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Determine from the role of responsibility and being a father to my son.

311
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:10.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I get to go back into this place of self deprecation and unworthiness

312
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it's a pattern that repeats.

313
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unintentionally

314
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:29.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I hate to see it, say it, but it's almost like you're seeking it if you try to parent with an audience that audience in particular.

315
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:46.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm wondering how responsive with your son be if you notice something saying, Hey, let's go for a walk outside or hey, you talk to your appointment instead of trying to voice it in front of them. What would that look like what would be responsive.

316
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.910
Angelo Archuletta: Well, what do you usually does is

317
00:33:54.030 --> 00:34:08.280
Angelo Archuletta: Like what I've done that before in the past like, you know, like, take it like you'll play the game of, you know, we'll ask grandma and she said it was okay. And I'm like, Well, I'm saying it's not okay. I don't

318
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.970
Angelo Archuletta: Like him coming into my room or whatever and like

319
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.610
Angelo Archuletta: Caught him several times in there.

320
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.440
Angelo Archuletta: Getting into my pot.

321
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.540
Angelo Archuletta: You know he's at that age where he's

322
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.010
Angelo Archuletta: Getting into my shit and I've told it, you know, and I've caught him right hand it

323
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.730
Angelo Archuletta: You know,

324
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:31.350
Angelo Archuletta: So there's a good reason that you know and I tell you know, look, we don't want you up there, you know, in the room.

325
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unless you take

326
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:33.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A shower. You know, because you have

327
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:50.550
Angelo Archuletta: To share the show, you know, and one of us has to be up there, whatever, you know, and he continuously does not fall you know I catch them up there, Tom. Hey, what did I tell you about coming up here, what we're not up Will Graham said it's okay. When I say it's not okay you know like

328
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A key to

329
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The key to your room.

330
00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:02.610
Angelo Archuletta: We don't have a lock on it. And that was my suggestion was that like, we start putting a lock on, you know, because there's times where we're not home.

331
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.140
Angelo Archuletta: You know, and

332
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.970
Angelo Archuletta: And I want to start, you know, locking the door.

333
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:15.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But would it be an issue if you took the initiative and you install the lock on the door.

334
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.970
Angelo Archuletta: As long as i think that i mean it would be okay as long as you know I cleared it with me.

335
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.430
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know. I really

336
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.060
Angelo Archuletta: I would think she'd be fine with it, but

337
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.560
Angelo Archuletta: She surprised me with quite a bit before you know

338
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the other alternative is moving, moving the lead altogether.

339
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. He already knows where it is and you can access it.

340
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.110
Angelo Archuletta: Well,

341
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He just he

342
00:35:48.870 --> 00:36:04.620
Angelo Archuletta: He goes through my stuff. Any. It doesn't even have to be the leader, the potter and ever like, he'll, you know, you'll see a pocket knife that he likes you know and stick it in his pocket, you know, or I just, I hate him going through all my stuff forever.

343
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's an invasion of privacy. So, yeah.

344
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My things was practical to me is getting a lock on the door.

345
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:19.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if that's something that you feel that you can show the production of this town better create safety.

346
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And privacy in the home.

347
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.420
Angelo Archuletta: I mean, and I'm kind of

348
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like I

349
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.550
Angelo Archuletta: Gotta be honest, you know I carry my own baggage about the issue or whatever.

350
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:40.860
Angelo Archuletta: Because you know when I became a thief, you know, like I was, you know, I mean,

351
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:54.270
Angelo Archuletta: I, I'd never lived the down you know and like my mom is just like she kind of just like you know it's not a big deal. You know, so I'm carrying my own baggage about it. My own you know

352
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.850
Angelo Archuletta: And I need to get over that and just get more

353
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:04.410
Angelo Archuletta: Practical and just stop to be hit, you know, stop it in its put a lock on the door stop the game, you know,

354
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.720
Angelo Archuletta: And move on and I

355
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.590
Angelo Archuletta: Probably the best way to to go about most of these

356
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:17.790
Angelo Archuletta: Things is stopped taking things. So personally, I mean get practical and and move on.

357
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.110
Angelo Archuletta: You know, even with

358
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:26.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your guilt from your past addiction to keep you from applying very practical solution.

359
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:42.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To your problems and you're taking on what your family has done. And I'm wondering if you're taking it on or if it's vice versa, your family takes it on, they see that you're still stuff appreciating yourself and still wallowing in this bill of your past addiction.

360
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:49.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so it makes you question on the context of your sobriety. If you're still holding on so much guilt and then they, in turn,

361
00:37:50.820 --> 00:38:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Heat this shame on you because they haven't seen any other side of you. They haven't seen the Confident Angelo that sober, that's no longer taking on the responsibility of his past addictions. You've moved on.

362
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.380
Angelo Archuletta: Right.

363
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.300
Angelo Archuletta: And I think that's a lot of

364
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:17.610
Angelo Archuletta: Like what I talked about in past sections, you know, still feeling like a junkie. You know, like

365
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.920
Angelo Archuletta: I still feel like

366
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.360
Angelo Archuletta: You know, like I haven't obtained any recovery like I've

367
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.180
Angelo Archuletta: Obtained sobriety. You've been my

368
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:27.810
Angelo Archuletta: Recovery.

369
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:41.190
Angelo Archuletta: You know, I feel like like this like being here really kind of stunted my growth, you know, but I mean if I want to get real with myself. I mean, I could grow anywhere where I met you know

370
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:43.170
Angelo Archuletta: It's

371
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not me know

372
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:54.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you're in an unhealthy and emotionally unsafe environment, you'll grow, but it'll be cut down

373
00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The minute you get to interpret your default. So you always be playing catch up.

374
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:11.580
Angelo Archuletta: That is kind of, I mean a really good analogy of how itself. You know, when I get a little bit of growth and it gets chopped right down

375
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your growth doesn't even look like a flower blooming. It's like a week.

376
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.610
Angelo Archuletta: It's like

377
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's pull this week.

378
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:26.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's like, no, that's my growth that's a flower, that's about to build. Nope, that's a week so unhealthy environments does not

379
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Support

380
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:33.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: healthy growth and that compulsion to stay where you are. You know what

381
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You just did it right now, just to find that

382
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, I should be able to grow even in this environment.

383
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm gonna challenge that right there. That's why it's so difficult.

384
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:57.210
Angelo Archuletta: I'm looking at my, my mom's dog we cut cut his hair today and it's all chopped up and like talking about growth and being shot, you know,

385
00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.760
Angelo Archuletta: It's funny.

386
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.020
Angelo Archuletta: Cuz he's got patches all over

387
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Representation of what your growth will be

388
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.440
Santa toxic environment.

389
00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.150
Angelo Archuletta: Right.

390
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.710
Angelo Archuletta: Like, that's how I feel.

391
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, just like

392
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.810
Angelo Archuletta: Google patches out of my like just

393
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.630
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah, I don't know.

394
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:35.430
Angelo Archuletta: I'm just, I, I know it's time for me to move on, you know, and I'm just, I think I'm a little stir crazy a little emotional

395
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know and i mean

396
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.200
Angelo Archuletta: It's good to have somebody else to bounce idea, you know, and kind of get out of my own head.

397
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.920
You know,

398
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do this. Again, we're still on that every two weeks. Right.

399
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.290
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah yeah

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, whatever happened today ever on check you in

Angelo Archuletta: Look at this still

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.220
Angelo Archuletta: 10 to 15 minutes it's telling me.

403
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.110
Angelo Archuletta: I don't know, but there is a message. There's two messages there so

404
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, we'll try to check in, so that

405
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.830
Angelo Archuletta: Yeah.

406
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:25.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Claim that you were waiting and so exactly what you told me that she just came from a meeting room. Did you have my number from previously so

407
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.220
Now you're checking

408
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:41.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a professional group for group, but I want you to think about what we talked about emotional safety and think about what that will look like for you what an emotionally safe environment would look like for you.

409
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.190
Angelo Archuletta: Um,

410
