80
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.930

81
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.510

82
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:51.300
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: I was married to a guy, the head Crohn's disease. So I'm after they were kind of hard to find and

83
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.730
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: Then I've done heroin.

84

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:26.280
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: And then, as they say, you know, we try to sell to our drug of choice and try to jump on another one. Well, just recently I tried to get off these things myself. And that was a no no

87
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.620
And I tried using

88
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.380
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: Math.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:57.300
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: And that I think was the drug that I like the most. I would have to say out of everything I've done. I mean, I'm almost 50 years old. I've should have done crash this and been done with this long time ago I got grandbabies I got, you know, to take care of. I can't be

93
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.680
So,

94
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.470
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: I'm the reason I went to a place called Healing Arts.

97
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:33.180
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: And they've just decided that they can have the same doctor prescribe

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:48.840
I0U2eFAtED8AAAAAAAAAggFtb3RvIGU1IGdvICgyMjYpAEFnVU: subs and Xanax or subs and lot of pain. So she told me she said, You need to find another doctor that will prescribe you suck Suboxone and then I'll prescribe you your psych meds.
