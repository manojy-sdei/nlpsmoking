00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what are you currently trying. When you think about. I mean, we get context of what's going on. But what are you trying to do, whether it's cognitive, whether it's behavioral to try to shut that busy mind down

25
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:11.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's like, I, I've been trying just to like I trailer and then I just tried to like take some time to sit somewhere quiet and just kind of

26
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:31.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Slow down my thinking. This looks great. Looks like it's always like going even when I lay down. You know, like I'm always speaking. So I'm nothing really been trying to keep it felt like

27
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.510
Nothing. Oh.

28
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, I just think too much is going on, I guess, I don't know.

29
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well let's let's try a couple of the things

30
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the first one is

31
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had if you had a witness yet to all of the

32
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking. Have you had one where you sat with whether it's mom or anyone and you've been able to say those thoughts out loud and have a witness have you had that yet.

33
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.340
Elizabeth Sandoval: I talk a lot to my boyfriend.

34
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yes, to my older daughter.

35
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: And my niece.

36
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.740
Elizabeth Sandoval: And my mom.

37
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, but mostly like

38
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like my boyfriend.

39
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: Is pretty supportive

40
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice that

41
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You do any editing when you're talking to your boyfriend, for example. Well, there's some things I can say it about 99% of it. There's a little piece. I can't quite say

42
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.590
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

43
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: A little bit.

44
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well, I think I could tell him anything

45
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:20.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just, I don't know quite understand it because he he grew up in a different type of helpful. I would think like he's kind of on his own like our family is kind of more like I don't know closer so I don't know. He really understands like

46
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.530
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

47
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: Part of all sometimes

48
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The heart rate because you have a phrase, you'll say,

49
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just us. It's just us that one.

50
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

51
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: He has like he has sisters. He has two other two sisters

52
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

53
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: They all kind of grew up separate from one another so

54
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm not saying you know he probably doesn't have maybe feels the same way, but

55
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

56
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's just hard to understand, like,

57
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.000
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess how much I'm going to miss them and how much I

58
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just have this sadness and me.

59
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.800
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because I know he noticed is a lot because in your eyes a little more sappy lately, or

60
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just more like have unlike a just yeah

61
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.850
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just like moody. I try not to pay it out with anyone, but it's really hard.

62
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if that phrase, but I'd rather you have a phrase, and I might be saying it wrong. What do you do remember when you think about this, this loss.

63
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I was saying it's just so that's all I have. Like you would say third certain phrases like that that really stood out to me.

64
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's that thing you hear yourself saying like this person doesn't understand they don't understand my brother and I, what

65
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: We understand each other.

66
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: You think that have an understanding. Yeah, like

67
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: We, I don't know, it's just like something that we have. I feel like we just had like this special bond where we kind of understand where

68
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: Each one's coming from and not ever being judgmental towards like very, you know,

69
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I were to rewind. Let's say some of the videos, maybe from a group or something. What's that phrase that that I'm remembering and I'm probably getting wrong. What do you, what do you think you're you're saying

70
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't remember.

71
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.460
Yeah.

72
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.460
Elizabeth Sandoval: I think that's maybe also, I feel like a lot is going to, I don't know. Not a lot is going to be left on me but

73
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, what will be don't deprive yourself what's going to be put on you.

74
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know my my niece right now she's having a real hard time with it all too.

75
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:42.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I know I'm going to have to step up and be more there figure be there for a little more to for my nephew.

76
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:56.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just don't know nominate time management everyone you know I felt like it's a little overwhelming sometimes I want to be there for everyone. And my parents.

77
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Are just i feel like i don't i feel like i'm i'm just like breakdown. You know, like

78
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: I need to be strong for everyone.

79
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what's wiping out. It's the house.

80
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

81
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already been doing that.

82
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Haven't you

83
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.160
Yeah.

84
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play this one all the way out.

85
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see if your best guess is really the only outcome.

86
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't take it all on and you don't step up instead you step back and you go, metaphorically on a hike.

87
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, now I don't step up.

88
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to happen. What's this worst case scenario that your mind keeps busy with

89
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:17.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: I worried that my niece and nephew are might lose himself as far as like maybe start drinking or maybe doing drugs.

90
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:33.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because I noticed a nice she's, she's been doing that lately and that worries me a lot because, you know, my brother have the same issues. You know, I don't want them to end up like that, at such an early age, you know,

91
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: And I don't want them to deal with their grief in that way either.

92
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's where's their mother in this story.

93
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well there she's around. I mean, she she obviously their divorce and she had her own life she's there.

94
00:09:52.710 --> 00:10:06.000
Elizabeth Sandoval: She's, she's supportive. I think she has her own place. And my nephew has his own place. I think my niece is going to be going to live with her mom soon, though, too. So I'm hoping that that happens.

95
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:07.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

96
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it that you step up. How is it that space, even for you to step into is there, you see it, how is it that their mother isn't

97
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: There in that space that you're wanting to step or you think I'm gonna have to step in and step up. I wonder why that spaces even available for you to step up into

98
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.610
You know,

99
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.460
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know. I like that.

100
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:45.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't, I don't know, maybe because I feel like I'm like going to be representing like my brother. Now, you know,

101
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: That part of him, you know,

102
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:03.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because like I tell you a lot about like my mom, she I felt like she's very fragile sometimes like

103
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Keep in our family together.

104
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess is what I worry about you know

105
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:36.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because I feel like sometimes we're like now. With all this going on with my brother, we become closer but you know after say something happens. I don't want the US to separate, you know, and go our own ways or something or my niece and my nephew to withdraw and kind of, you know,

106
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: Get lost in their own

107
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: In their in their grief, you know,

108
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I get that and all of that, that's them. And now let's focus on you for a moment.

109
00:11:50.430 --> 00:12:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel to be closer to your family right now at a time like this. How does it feel to be closer to your mother and even to your brother, possibly don't know. But how does it feel

110
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Feels better. I mean bills complete no

111
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: Family, it's like it's gonna be instead of separation.

112
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: I feel like we we wasted like kind of a lot of time, let me

113
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus on your super you wasted time. See if you can find it, or did you waste time

114
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:39.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm not kidding, like how I felt sooner, like, you know, putting those boundaries. No, my mom and stuff.

115
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, I wish I would have done that.

116
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:50.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, we would be further, I mean it. We just got to start somewhere, but

117
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm glad. Like, I feel good. Now that

118
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: We're close, I just don't want to lose that later on.

119
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.160
Okay.

120
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's visit again that thought of how there's even this year for you.

121
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To to take up that space. Are you taking on sort of this idea of

122
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The position of a father that these kids.

123
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:47.520
Elizabeth Sandoval: Don't know. I don't know about that. But I just know like my niece like lately, she's been here a lot. So I see that she's like, you know, more like relying on me. You know, when she's when she's not at my brothers to come speak here.

124
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: And stuff so I feel like she feels comfortable

125
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It. How would like for you to have her stayed there.

126
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A truly I genuinely mean that

127
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: I bet it's a little overwhelming to

128
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because I have a lot going on in my household is. It is.

129
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:18.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it does make me feel a little overwhelmed or like, like, like I said, She's, she's been drinking a little bit so like I don't want

130
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.590
Elizabeth Sandoval: Her my son to start like trying to drink together or any of that. So I worry about that.

131
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.560
Elizabeth Sandoval: young mothers me

132
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it stays in worry and it's missing the action that you are starting to enjoy it with your mother. We're starting to speak directly to her. You are liking that.

133
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're just spending time worrying. So let's see if maybe you've been actually taking some action. See if you can take that intuition that insight that you know analysis of

134
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You are your son's mother.

135
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

136
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And also this other person has a need. So both of those are existing at the same time.

137
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Was. What about you, what do you need slow way down. Let's just focus there for a little bit. What is it that you want. What do you need when you notice she needs needs to come over

138
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do.

139
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:48.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: Let her know like maybe also the boundaries of what it's going to take for for me to feel comfortable and wanting to be here, you know,

140
00:15:49.950 --> 00:16:05.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: Sometimes I'm girl like kind of not quite with my friends I've learned to be more outspoken, but it's like, I don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but lately I'm, like, the heck with that you know my house so

141
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, how it actually happens. Try not to edit it. I really want to be let in your world. When you say, well, let me hear how you talk to her.

142
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:16.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well,

143
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: I told her the other day.

144
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:32.880
Elizabeth Sandoval: I was like, look right. I don't mind you coming over here. It's just when you come over here. I don't want you to be drinking and bringing alcoholics into my house.

145
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:45.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, I don't if you guys, you need some support or you want to hang out with your cousin or with us. That's going to be one thing that is not going to happen.

146
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.800
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, we could have dinner.

147
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: Talk, but

148
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.240
Elizabeth Sandoval: Other than that, like, that's what's going to be going on.

149
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's what I have to offer you.

150
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And was it delivered just the way you said it like that.

151
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of basically a

152
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: pretty mellow architecture and that way.

153
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

154
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: I tried to be

155
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not like

156
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.350
Elizabeth Sandoval: rude or but just like kind of frustrated for life of what a lot

157
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what happened right before that sort of discussion what happened right before that that prompted that discussion what happened right before that.

158
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.880
Elizabeth Sandoval: You said, What would make me feel comfortable or how would I

159
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.690
Change.

160
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Your

161
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: With your nice what happened right before that discussion with her. What happened right before that. What prompted that discussion.

162
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just being that she's been drinking

163
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that's prior knowledge what literally on a timeline, what happened.

164
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to track it.

165
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You saw something heard something I already heard about the thought you were. I heard that you are aware, she's drinking, but you don't come like us. The first time hearing it, you became aware of it.

166
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: Somehow

167
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:39.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it's happened a few times so you know the last time that I found out about it because they try to be sneaky go

168
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:51.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like she'll sneak in and my time or something, or I'll get up and I'll be like, Oh my God, what a face to face. You know, so I don't want that. So,

169
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:59.700
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's kind of like got this situation going of me telling you look this thing going to happen.

170
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: In a

171
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:11.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: Room or or with my son, or we do if you want to come over. We can you could come hang out with, there's not gonna be no drinking. That's not the way we got trying to tell her.

172
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:21.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: She needs to deal with her grief in a different type of way. No, it's kind of, I don't want to be hypocritical towards her anything but

173
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:30.000
Elizabeth Sandoval: I am I trying to help everyone that society. I can't even help myself.

174
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

175
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Play this

176
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go. Worst case scenario, she continues to drink that she's made that her solution and they continue to sneak then what happens. Let's play it all the way out and see how this goes.

177
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.850
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'll end up probably

178
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yelling at my son and not letting her come over

179
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:06.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I don't want it because I know she does need some type of sport, but if she's gonna follow my rules as far as that goes.

180
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: With it.

181
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what let's say he's yelled at and she's told you're not following the house rules, then what happens played all the way through.

182
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:35.220
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then sometimes I'll you know act like or so sometimes it's still, it's still happens. So that's another thing. And it's like,

183
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:42.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's like, I don't feel respected because you're obviously not listening to what I'm telling

184
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: So that's so frustrating.

185
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:53.820
Elizabeth Sandoval: And I mean, my son, she's 2020 years ago and my son's 19 so

186
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:55.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's like

187
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: They're at that age where you tell them, but like, hey, you can't

188
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Make them do anything like

189
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: I took away his car.

190
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:14.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: He doesn't have his car. He's not driving. I don't let them drive my car or anybody his car so

191
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's one thing to do.

192
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm not paying for his phone. Bill Murray or

193
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're, you're working it, Mom, you are you're working all the things you can

194
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And

195
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's still a solution. Can you relate to escaping into a mood altering substance as an escape for grief and distress.

196
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you shaking your head no.

197
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you serious,

198
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: Are you. Oh, wait. Say that one more time. Maybe I misunderstood what you said.

199
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, that won't work nine

200
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have compassion. Can you relate to escaping into drugs and alcohol in order to not feel grief.

201
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.350
Yeah.

202
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.910
Yeah.

203
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Hello.

204
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.440
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

205
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.130
So too, forgiving.

206
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To see that in your son to see that in your nice and you are still learning how to navigate your own recovery. Where do you turn your turning to spirituality

207
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is helping and

208
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of it that's not

209
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind is unruly.

210
00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It will throw out worst cases. What else almost constantly and it's probably keeping you awake. It's not coming up with great ideas coming up with the worst case scenarios.

211
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am getting little bits, more and more of what's really going on over there.

212
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a fair amount of editing, as if it's not okay that you would yell at a kid.

213
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean what parent hasn't

214
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

215
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.330
Wanted

216
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

217
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is where you are probably confronted with that piece about I don't want to be a hypocrite.

218
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If the worst thing is they say, You're full of

219
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing it, why can I, you're such a hypocrite.

220
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm that kid that young person saying that to you. What do you, what do you say back to me as an alternative solution.

221
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:20.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: I've. This has come up and I told them look people I have been a mess up and I have had, like, hit rock bottom, it's me.

222
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: But now that I'm I've gotten older, and my mindsets. Totally different.

223
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I know like it was wrong, you know,

224
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.130
That's

225
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you tell them to do what do you actually do. One of them is prayer. That's a go to

226
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving a philosophy to a 20 year old. Good luck with that.

227
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do

228
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're you're having to face significant pressure right now.

229
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You think I can tell you that think and think and think and think and think and think that they can pray. What else are you doing to try and solve this distress.

230
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Screaming

231
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Screaming

232
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know what's gonna make me feel

233
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I'm trying to like figure it out.

234
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:38.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't want to, like, you know, I don't want to use. That's like the last thing on my mind. But I just stopped thinking

235
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: So hard

236
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you go and you tell people you tell your son. You say, I know.

237
00:25:52.650 --> 00:26:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in it too. I'm scared and us talking US connecting as humans us loving each other and coming closer. This is going to be how we're going to get through this not divided

238
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you do it. You trust that instinct in yourself. The fact that you are liking this connection with your family and you say okay, we're pulling out. Pull it. Everybody grab a pillow. We're all sitting around here and we're going to talk

239
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not going to sit in our room separately. We're not going to

240
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it, and you can talk for real about how easy it is to want to escape these difficult emotions you know more than anybody else does.

241
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I don't know that you fully grieved yet. And now you're going to be facing

242
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well,

243
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can either turn to this beautiful family of yours and live this belief about connection.

244
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you can do it half assed.

245
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your kids will pick up on it. They're going to pick up on the bullshit and they're going to call you.

246
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry about the bad words. I don't have better

247
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your answer could be, I don't know, son. I'm terrified. I'm afraid I won't be strong enough for this either. And then I see you drinking and it reminds me of my own insecurities.

248
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just sit down. Let's. Yes. Did you hear that you just did a nice, big breath because. Isn't that the truth. That's the truth.

249
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.670
Elizabeth Sandoval: Bruce sometimes

250
00:27:47.460 --> 00:28:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Our children pick up on it, they know when we're doing it. Yeah, we're not really coming full tilt this is no time. We need and we come together, we

251
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit down and we say, let's go in the kitchen. I know everything all and isolate. We all want to do that. We're all going to come in the kitchen. We're going to make

252
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: enchiladas. We're going to do it. We're going to fix them.

253
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Pound Cake. We're going to do this and we're going to do this right now, and we're going to talk about our worst fears and we're going to do it together. We're not going to isolate. That's what alcohol wants you to do. That's what all these substances wants you to do they want you to reality.

254
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you love and there is a threat. A real one, that there might be loss of love. There might be a loss. This is happening.

255
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am sorry.

256
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the deliver a difficult information. It is

257
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I also know something else that I think you may have forgotten.

258
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You are living testament that things will be okay. Again, they will be

259
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong. Okay.

260
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Scary.

261
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like the touch. We're like,

262
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: Weird like

263
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:30.300
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like that attachment, we have, like, it's like going away. I don't know, or

264
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep describing. If you need to stop.

265
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: CRYING

266
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: I feel like me, my brother always been like really close.

267
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just

268
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:51.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Felt

269
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:54.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like empty years

270
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Emptiness

271
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

272
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there forever. Are those the thoughts.

273
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.820
Elizabeth Sandoval: To like

274
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: A loss.

275
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: This is my brother, you know, like, that was just I really was my husband, but that was just my blood. This is my blood.

276
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time you tried to escape going through

277
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This time, I'm guessing you want to do it or you move through. You don't want to relapse. Right. You want to actually see

278
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it will be

279
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It means you're going to cry means you're going to be a it means you're going to have to sit with this fear and Elizabeth

280
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son. If you can't motivate it for you. Your son is tea party heartache. His heart is going to be broken by people

281
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: You

282
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Know are going to pass in his life to and

283
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the role model for him. We knew it happens all at the same time what you're giving to your son is a bill discomfort of emptiness.

284
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna have to do the same thing, but if you don't sit with it. He has nowhere to look

285
00:31:45.960 --> 00:32:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Except the simple answer of what a pill and what alcohol. It's so seductive that it will make all of this go away and it will not the grief will be right there waiting when sobriety hits and the hangovers. There will be right there, waiting. So guess what

286
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If you've already made up your mind that you're going to be a woman, a year from now, you're going to be alive and you're from you.

287
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you just kind of decide, Am I going to be this woman that has lost his brother that continues to be this amazing strong resilient woman mother friend daughter. Am I going to be here a year from now, you have you made up your mind you're going to be

295
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:59.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: A great mother, let me keep trying my best to do better and better because it is like the learning experience. You know, I sure do you think of things so much different, and

296
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:09.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: I told my kids, even my daughter. She'll be like, Hey guys, I'm starting to realize like how hard it is, you know, this is really

297
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.050
Elizabeth Sandoval: Two more months so feel gramma

298
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:16.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

299
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the beauty in that

300
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: Beautiful things going on. I

301
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: wish it was just one, but being us humans is such a roller coaster muffins and the more that you can model that for your daughter for your son and say I'm right here it with tears dropping down

302
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared. And I'm not escaping it. This is what being a human is guess what, son. This is it. You, you're going to fall in love.

303
00:33:51.870 --> 00:34:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to love deeply and there will be the trail, there will be disappointment that will be heartache. Sometimes I want as your mother to protect you from it all.

304
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be able to, but you can see right here. I am not escaping in to drugs and alcohol. I'm going to live it.

305
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Means I'm gonna sit here with us sometimes. And we're going to talk about these difficult things. And we're going to cry together and we're going to feel each other's love support and friendship right here. That's how we're going to get through this.

306
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not by hiding in a Roman and sneaking around. Nope, it's going to be better.

307
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And it takes

308
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Humility your humility.

309
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: being humble with the fact that this is huge and it's foreign and it's unknown and it's this big empty thing and you're already starting to have a little piece of it and the old ways of doing things.

310
00:34:49.290 --> 00:35:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be a people pleaser. And I'm going to make everybody. I'm going to take care of everybody, screw that. This demands different this demands leaning into deeper truths about what do I really want right now I want to tell this these of mine. I'm scared to

311
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's sit down and talk about it.

315
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:43.830

316
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not supposed to know how this is going to feel how are we supposed to know

317

Gwenevere Abriel: Why not

348
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:32.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I think lately. I feel like I'm less fun than it used to be.

Elizabeth Sandoval: You don't or

351
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know how you feel after you share your truth. You don't know. That's the point. It's all UNKNOWN. That's what this is. It's all holy crap.

352
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's keeping you awake. You're none of us know

354
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the fear will come up and it's scary and sad and then all of a sudden you're aware of that that emptiness and I'm going to miss my brother so much. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

355
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then maybe you call your brother. I don't know what you did you draw future and then you go talk to your son, it's going to come and go, but I'll tell you something.

Gwenevere Abriel: It does pass

357
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We humans, we feel things intensely, but those feelings do pass

358
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Then there's a giggle again.

359
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's sorrow. There's excitement and disappointment.

Gwenevere Abriel: How are you going to feel about yourself. If that's how a 2am went instead of feeling offended and disrespected, yeah.

364
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: A lot better and more

Right.

369
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the other version, his son feels misunderstood you continue to feel understood. No one understands the closeness nieces. I don't even know where to begin with that one just misunderstood and scared and all that.

370
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And now doesn't have access now son doesn't have access to you. Nice doesn't have access to you on. He's mad at me when really what I need is

412
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.350
Elizabeth Sandoval: Were to walk the puppy.

413
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So also with puppy. Sometimes it's let's play with a puppy. Let's each get him. I know with mine. It's, you know, we throw it, and he runs from one person to the next. And this is kind of fun thing. So we could add something like that.

414
00:46:49.230 --> 00:47:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And go. You could see your very first entry into this Elizabeth can be going and talking to your son proactive talking with your niece on the phone saying I want to do this differently.

415
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I think coming at you with rules. I want to come at this different I want to come at you with understanding and my own truth telling which is I'm terrified.

416
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And I look at you and I see myself and I'm overwhelmed and I i I've been yelling, but really when I

417
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Write

418
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: In your

419
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is no time.

420
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To not show the truth. This is yeah, this is where we get okay there's nothing wrong me, not knowing this is this is scary. This is uncertain. And so you say, nice. Give me your name. So I stopped calling it that was his first name.

421
00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:44.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: Mariah.

422
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so Mariah.

423
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Mariah. You're going to notice something else. I know I've been saying hey don't bring alcohol. That is true. But I haven't been telling you what we're going to do.

424
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the difference. I want you to come over. Don't have to sneak in. I want you to come over here, I've got this list on the fridge. These are the things that we're going to do. We're going to set up some ritual.

425
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to get closer. From this, we're going to stay connected every evening, blah, blah, blah, blah. We're going to make enchiladas. And we're going to have, you know,

426
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Taco Tuesday, and we're going to have meatloaf Monday and we're just going to do it. We're not going to overthink it. We're just going to come on over. We're just going to make it. We're going to do

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I love you and everything is going to be okay. I'm scared to but let's do these things. Let's not go to drugs and alcohol. I'm tempted to

428
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To escape. You know, I already have my grief to and I'm scared. But I think the way is through connecting with each other and being there for each other and you do it proactively

429
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So she knows what to expect. And so, you know, this is what we're going to do we're going to do more of the things that help us feel

430
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

431
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a minute here, right at the end. Elizabeth and kind of kind of track back what you noticed about yourself throughout today's session and just just sort of be a witness to it and

432
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'll do when I

433
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:24.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: When I first started, I felt like you know it was a look a lot. I had more anxiety. I told you that I felt like, you know, I wanted to jump out of my skin so over the time of talking

434
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.300
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I felt like I started to realize

435
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then we put things in perspective.

436
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:41.880
Elizabeth Sandoval: And I started a calm down and feel more at ease. So thank you for that, because it is really do help me.

437
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice, notice what you did. I didn't do anything special.

438
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You did.

439
00:49:51.930 --> 00:50:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The work you shared and you did it a bit like an onion. So maybe you could skip the few top layers and get right to it.

440
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.130
Yeah.

441
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We started out. Oh, everything's fine. I'm fine.

442
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:09.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

443
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Leaking, we don't have time for that.

444
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, son. I'm sad, let's go play a video game, my son, I need a hug and you give them a hug and you cry.

445
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This is. That's what this is, this is whatever's happening than that we name it, we say, Oh my gosh, it's hit me so hard right now. Hey guys, anybody up for a walk. I'm having a really hard time of it and off you go.

446
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:44.910

447
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You get into it. Okay, isolating that's when we get the irritable and then we start making up these stories about this emptiness and loneliness and this is all there's going to be

448
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving towards these people that you love. I think that's where the healing is

449
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:04.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know,

450
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you saw yourself doing here that worked you more that

451
00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I didn't do anything.

452
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:15.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

453
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like, just let it out.

454
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:34.050
Elizabeth Sandoval: Scheduling I'm so I feel scared to let it out and that's with the problem with like I'm gonna break down but it's like released. I feel so much better now, literally, you know,
