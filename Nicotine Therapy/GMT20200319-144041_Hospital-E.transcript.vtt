00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.330
Yes.

3
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.200
Dawn Abriel: What I need, I need to do a history and physical line, yo. And when was the last time you had any opioid

4
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.270
Amanda's: I haven't actually

5
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
Amanda's: I haven't taken anything just my methadone and the Suboxone

6
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.560
Dawn Abriel: Okay so methadone and Suboxone or both opioids.

7
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.260
Amanda's: Okay so yesterday was the opiate the opiate was the Suboxone was yesterday.

8
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.850
Dawn Abriel: And how much did you take

9
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.030
Amanda's: A third

10
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.220
Dawn Abriel: So I need to know milligrams, you took a third of what

11
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.480
Amanda's: They're all

12
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.260
Amanda's: The orange.

13
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.940
Amanda's: The orange package.

14
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so doctors don't learn medicine by shape and color was it an eight milligram four milligram

15
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.500
Amanda's: Or 16

16
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.460
Dawn Abriel: So they don't make a 16

17
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.750
Amanda's: Maybe it was it I don't know. Hold on.

18
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.450
Amanda's: Wow.

19
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.790
Dawn Abriel: Okay. So you took a third of a 12

20
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.640
Amanda's: Yes. All right.

21
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.980
Dawn Abriel: Well,

22
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.120
Dawn Abriel: It'll certainly be easier to give you four milligram

23
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.530
Dawn Abriel: Strips than to have you have you have to cut those

24
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.560
Dawn Abriel: And you were on methadone.

25
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.100
Amanda's: Yes, I was on methadone for two years.

26
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.510
Amanda's: In October, July would be three years.

27
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.600
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And, and so someone switched you over to the Suboxone

28
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
Amanda's: Know they accuse me of my methadone not showing up in my you

29
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:43.680
Amanda's: Know I had already gotten my people for two weeks and then I was gonna have to go back every day again and I'm not, I didn't do anything wrong. My methadone should be in my urine.

30
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.380
Amanda's: And they just knock you down at the clinic, they don't try to figure out anything and they take you back to step one. I tell them I'm not coming back and doing this again.

31
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:05.520
Amanda's: I have to come back to my take. If I have to come back every day. Again, I'm not coming back. So I got my take home and I didn't go back. I thought I could kick record all by myself and I couldn't

32
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.810
Dawn Abriel: So you so you've got this sub off the street.

33
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.430
Amanda's: Yes.

34
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.270
Okay.

35
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.130
Dawn Abriel: I'm I'm impressed. Usually people have a really, really difficult time switching from methadone to Suboxone

36
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:35.070
Amanda's: Well, I think what I did with the Methadone is like I said I had eight bottles left I stayed I would take a little bit at a time. So like I said I was trying to cut down by myself.

37
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.830
Amanda's: And this will be my third day without any methadone at all. The first few days are kind of hard. So I was actually going to buy heroin.

38
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:58.050
Amanda's: But then I ran into the strip and I took a third of it. And I'm not trying to overdose to get high. I just wanted my legs in my just wanted to stop hurting, and I tried the third of it and I stopped hurting

39
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.490
Amanda's: So then I was like, well, I'll just get I'll try Suboxone

40
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.980
Amanda's: And ever since that ever since I got it night before last. I've been okay

41
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.770
Amanda's: My legs have been hurting

42
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.800
Amanda's: But I know that I can't do it with by myself. I can't. It's not a mental, physical, I knew it was, but I just think he was going to be that hard to pick it.

43
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.690
Amanda's: And I thought if I figured out my methadone until for a long time that I could leave myself off and I couldn't do it.

44
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.980
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so I read in the chart that you started with Viking in. And how old were you when you started that

45
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.950
Amanda's: Was about

46
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.160
Amanda's: Five years ago.

47
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.560
Amanda's: I mean I had did it before, but when I really did it when I had my surgery.

48
00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:00.570
Amanda's: Then I found out. Oh, I didn't need it for pain and I still took it and I realized I got high and I should have took myself off. I should have just told the doctor, I didn't need it anymore. But I didn't

49
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.060
Dawn Abriel: And

50
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.140
Dawn Abriel: So you did that for how long before you switch to heroin.

51
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.650
Amanda's: Probably the whole five years I only did heroin, like a few times and then I was trying to get into a program out here in Albuquerque. And I ended up overdosing

52
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.740
Amanda's: Now I got on the Methadone program. Three days later.

53
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and so you you overdosed once

54
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.100
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Okay.

55
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.080
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so no medical problems or legal issues around your drugs.

56
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.340
Amanda's: Oh, no.

57
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.990
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

58
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.330
Dawn Abriel: And but you have had to take more and more to get just to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.

59
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:56.910
Amanda's: Yeah, well I was taking methadone. You know what I mean. And it was still hurting, but I would just deal with it because if I took a little bit. A little bit. I thought I could get off. And when I didn't have any more.

60
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.010
Amanda's: I was like, Okay, let's try this. A couple days and second day, I couldn't do it. So I was I asked somebody that I know here.

61
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:25.770
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so I didn't ask the question, I obviously didn't ask the question correctly, I was asking about tolerance and dependence you you over the years, you had to take more and more of the opioid to get the same effect or to avoid going into withdrawal.

62
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.680
Amanda's: No, I said I 70 milligrams, the entire time. Ah.

63
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.200
Amanda's: OK, I never went up. No.

64
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.840
Dawn Abriel: So 70 milligrams a day.

65
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.110
Amanda's: Yes, that's what I was on my methadone.

66
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.830
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's different.

67
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.710
Dawn Abriel: When you were taking the Viking in

68
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay, Jason Seiler

69
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:07.440
Amanda's: Go yeah I found out that if I needed. Yeah, I would overtime. Yes, a couple pills didn't work, and I would use more, more. Yeah.

70
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.900
Dawn Abriel: That's what I needed to know.

71
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:20.610
Dawn Abriel: Yes, because both buprenorphine and methadone or long acting opioids, so you don't develop the tolerance, the way the short acting like Vika didn't

72
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.260
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah.

73
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.220
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you started using any drug even marijuana

74
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.380
Amanda's: Oh, maybe like 1314

75
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.260
Dawn Abriel: And did you start with marijuana

76
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.670
Yes.

77
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.850
Dawn Abriel: And do you still use it.

78
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.020
No.

79
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:51.000
Dawn Abriel: Has your opioid use gotten in the way of relationships or work social activities.

80
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.530
Amanda's: Now,

81
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.880
Dawn Abriel: And what number program is this be you.

82
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.650
Amanda's: Know this is

83
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.350
Amanda's: This is my second one. But the first one I was court order to go to that this is on my own.

84
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.040
Amanda's: My second one. Okay.

85
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.500
Amanda's: Well, I guess it would be my courage, because I was on methadone and I'm trying to do Suboxone

86
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.680
Amanda's: So I guess my third

87
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.280
Amanda's: Okay, this is a different program. Right.

88
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:36.720
Dawn Abriel: So I'm a little confused and you said there were no legal issues around your drug use.

89
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.170
Dawn Abriel: But you were court order to be in treatment.

90
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.400
Amanda's: And that was a long time ago gas was like almost 15 years ago.

91
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.560
Amanda's: You asked how many programs. This was for me. So I was court ordered for program, a long time ago.

92
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.480
Amanda's: MY 20s.

93
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.340
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so I'll just say legal issues related to drug use in her 20s.

94
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:01.770
Amanda's: Yeah.

95
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:15.990
Dawn Abriel: All right, and most people notice the effect of the opioids, it changes their brain so that they have problems with sleep and anxiety. Is that true for you.

96
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.270
Amanda's: Know,

97
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.770
Dawn Abriel: You have no sleep problems.

98
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.070
Amanda's: I see problems, but it's not because of that.

99
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:33.150
Amanda's: I only sleep three or four hours a night but that's been before I even had opiate problem.

100
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.150
Dawn Abriel: And

101
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.390
Amanda's: I used to take Xanax, but I got off Xanax, get on the Methadone clinic.

102
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.350
Dawn Abriel: Were you ever hospitalized for any mental health issue.

103
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.430
No.

104
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.320
Dawn Abriel: And what would you say your stress level is right now.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.730
Amanda's: Like a one or two.

106
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.650
Dawn Abriel: And that is having to do with

107
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.930
Dawn Abriel: The getting in a program financial relationships with stress about

108
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:46.110

422
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:58.200
Amanda's: Every to cut her hours. So I don't want to say, Oh, I'll take the 130 and then she has to be somewhere and she needs to car. You know what I mean.

423
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:04.020
Amanda's: Unless you have to do inventory at nighttime. I just, I'll take the 730 at night time

424
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:07.740
Okay.

425
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.440
Amanda's: I'll see how that goes for right now.

426
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:19.110
Amanda's: But then I still need to pick one in the daytime for to go to individual

427
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.210

Dawn Abriel: The therapist will get ahold of you.

430
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.780
Dawn Abriel: And do an evaluation and then you will agree on a time

431
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.200
Okay.

432
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.330
Dawn Abriel: And

433
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.560
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to be giving you the beauty trend.

434
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:52.680
Dawn Abriel: Or four milligrams and you already told the care coordinator which pharmacy, you want to use right

435
00:40:53.610 --> 00:41:02.490
Amanda's: Yeah, and I told him that I will let you know. I call this the Albertsons and they said they're not in jeopardy of closing down. So they're good, and they accept my insurance.

436
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:14.220
Amanda's: That girl Mia. I told her that I would check to make sure it would go to the right one. So you're, you're my doctor right

437
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.440
Dawn Abriel: No. Does the 730 Thursday group is Dr. Solomon.

438
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:25.110
Amanda's: Nobody stopped, but you're my doctor for the medication for the Suboxone Rick. Correct.

439
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:33.270
Dawn Abriel: Know the doctor for the group is dr elements. So he will be the one ordering your medicine.

440
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:35.100
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

441
00:41:42.150 --> 00:42:00.300
Amanda's: I know I'm just getting onto the program, but how do I. So my goal. My goal was to get off a methadone, like I use this box until I wouldn't be in pain, how, how can I get off, how can I withdraw and not be on either program which are safely.

442
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:11.070
Dawn Abriel: Use you tell Dr element that you want to start tapering and he'll do it very, very slowly in small little amounts and

443
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:18.540
Dawn Abriel: You just he'll give you support medicine, but you're going to have to tell him. That's what you want to do.

444
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:30.750
Amanda's: I know, that's why I thought that that is what I want to do. I don't want to be honest I my goal was to get off with a methadone. I just got off really that wasn't the right time, but I don't want to stay on this river.

445
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:37.320
Dawn Abriel: There's no reason you have to you can you can come off of it, but it should be done.

446
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.980
Slowly

447
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.360
Amanda's: Yeah.

448
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.070
Dawn Abriel: Alright.

449
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:54.900
Dawn Abriel: So, um, before you go into group 730 on Thursdays, you have to fill out a survey. So you have to go on to the website and

450
00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:04.830
Dawn Abriel: The care coordinator any care coordinator that you find when you go to the virtual clinic, you know that place. You went to before you came in to see me.

451
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:11.160
Dawn Abriel: Those care coordinators will answer any and all of your questions.

452
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:24.600
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so after you're done with me. You're going to go back to the virtual clinic and say that you need to do a couple of things you need to be shown how to do a Bam.

453
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:36.150
Dawn Abriel: And they need to give you the way to do one more survey called the ACE adverse childhood experiences. It's only 10 questions one time.

454
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:55.050
Dawn Abriel: But they'll set you up to be able to do those two things, and the band is what you have to do before every group, you can do it the day before, you know, a few hours before, but it has to be done before group because if you haven't done it, then you have to do it.

455
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.880
Dawn Abriel: And you'll be late for group and some of the therapists.

456
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:07.200
Dawn Abriel: Close the group after 15 minutes. So then you run the risk of not getting your medicine that week because you didn't

457
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.820
Dawn Abriel: Because you didn't notify

458
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:19.620
Amanda's: Okay, so I have so I don't ever leave my house is what you're saying. I do all of this over my phone.

459
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.690
Dawn Abriel: Right, just like this.

460
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.000
Amanda's: Oh, wow. Can I don't need to take my wife to Earth. I've had, I had to physically go to a group

461
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.650
Dawn Abriel: Know this is it you do it just like this.

462
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:38.940
Amanda's: Okay. And Dr. Ottoman he's, he's a doctor of all of these groups.

463
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.200
No.

464
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.960
Amanda's: Okay.

465
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:51.450
Dawn Abriel: There are different doctors running different groups in New Mexico. We have three people in New Mexico who are running groups.

466
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.350
Dawn Abriel: Myself another woman and Dr. Solomon.

467
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:58.860
Amanda's: Okay.

468
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:15.990
Dawn Abriel: So before group you do your bam you the care coordinator will give you the zoom room number for the group because the zoom number changes every week.

469
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:32.910
Dawn Abriel: So you can't use the same number over and over, you have to check in with the virtual clinic. They checked to make sure that you're up to date on your urine drug screen and on your BAM and any co pays that might be needed.

470
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:34.830
Amanda's: And what's them.

471
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.840
Dawn Abriel: Brief addiction monitor

472
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.960
Dawn Abriel: It's a survey the survey that you fill out every week before you go into group.

473
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.150
Dawn Abriel: It helps us follow what's going on in your life.

474
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.030
Amanda's: Every week finally get a week.

475
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.520
Amanda's: Medicine at a time.

476
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.240
Yeah.

477
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:09.660
Dawn Abriel: Until you've been in the program, a long time and you're doing well, you're not missing appointments, then you can talk to the doctor and the therapist about going every two weeks or

478
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:15.690
Dawn Abriel: You know, we do have many people who are once a month because they've been in the program for a couple years.

479
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.240
Amanda's: Yeah, no, I want to be out of the program.

480
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.490
Amanda's: As soon as possible.

481
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:23.070
Dawn Abriel: So,

482
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.400
Amanda's: I just

483
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.000
Amanda's: Depending on this drugs anymore. I've been doing it too long.

484
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:35.190
Dawn Abriel: I hear you. So every month right heart health will send you a manila envelope like this.

485
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:49.350
Dawn Abriel: When you get it in the mail. Do not open it. If you open it, it is not, they won't use it and you'll have to go outside your home to a lab to do you urine drug screen.

486
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:56.910
Dawn Abriel: When you get this in the mail, you go to the virtual clinic and you say, I've got this thing. What do I do with it.

487
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:15.390
Dawn Abriel: And you will open it in front of them and you will take out the urine drug cup like this and you'll open it in front of them, you'll go to the bathroom in your comeback and you'll pull the way up to the camera and you'll very slowly turn it so they can read the results.

488
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:16.830
Amanda's: Oh,

489
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:23.580
Amanda's: I want to take a year and a one time outside of the clinic outside of my house, any of the other time it's

490
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.470
Amanda's: All right now.

491
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:26.370
Yeah.

492
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:31.290
Amanda's: But that's what she was saying about the four times a month.

493
00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.700
Amanda's: For an address, I need a different address, then

494
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.220
Dawn Abriel: It's once a month, the urine drug screen is once a month.

495
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.750
Dawn Abriel: Okay, say that back to me. So I understand you heard it.

496
00:47:47.280 --> 00:48:00.330
Amanda's: I'm going to take a urine test once a month and at Brown package, I cannot open it. I have to call the virtual clinic, you talk one of those care coordinators and open in front of them. I opened the ground. Yes.

497
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.780
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

498
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.620
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I hear you. You got it. So what I

499
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.700
Dawn Abriel: What I wanted. So a zoom room number is not the same as a phone number.

500
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:23.070
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, no. Okay. Because you said call. So you're going to, you go to the virtual clinic by getting into zoom and doing the ID number for zoom

501
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:30.720
Amanda's: Well, yeah, but when I called you guys yesterday, I called the phone number and I talked to me like that. And then I joined zoom

502
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:40.290
Amanda's: So she said that I don't always have to call to get into virtual room. I could call her on the telephone. So I'm not always waiting on hold because I don't have an appointment.

503
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:43.830
Amanda's: So Mina said I could call her on the telephone.

504
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:47.280
Dawn Abriel: Fine, if you want to do it that way. That's fine.

505
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.970
Amanda's: Yesterday I meant by all like

506
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:57.210
Dawn Abriel: Okay, but you can't, if you're going to do the urine drug screen, she'll just make you get on to zoom anyway.

507
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.550
Amanda's: Yeah, but I mean, I'm going to call it and ask for. Bam. And you don't have to go sit in that waiting room.

508
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.600
Amanda's: And have to do that other server, you asked me to do that I'm

509
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.900
Amanda's: Ace, the E. Yeah.

510
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.430
Dawn Abriel: I don't need to go.

511
00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.890
Amanda's: Within 20 minutes okay for them to ask me.

512
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.290
Dawn Abriel: You will see you can try it that way you're going to

513
00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:27.450
Amanda's: Call. So every time I call the virtual clinic I have to dial the 408486476

514
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:31.080
Dawn Abriel: That's the zoom room number

515
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.850
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's the

516
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.380
Dawn Abriel: ID number. It's not a dial. It's not a punch. It's

517
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:42.270
Amanda's: It. Yeah. But is that the one that always will get me to the virtual clinic.

518
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.740
Amanda's: Yeah I don't ever turn

Amanda's: Now it's good number that I got for you. I'm like this cross it out.

521
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.190
Dawn Abriel: You, you probably won't ever need it. Okay.

522
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:03.630
Amanda's: I'm going to close it out and then I had gotten another number yesterday to I'll just ask them if I should throw that away too.

Dawn Abriel: So you're going to go get your labs done. I do.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:20.880
Dawn Abriel: Right heart health does electronic prescriptions. You'll never get a piece of paper with your order on it, it will be electronically submitted to the pharmacy.

525
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.080
Amanda's: Yeah.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:37.290
Dawn Abriel: So you have to call the pharmacy and say has my E prescription come in is my E prescription packaged is my he prescription ready to be picked up.

527
00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:40.980
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah.

Dawn Abriel: I also by law have to order Narc can for anyone who gets an order of an opioid gets an order of Narcan there 11 refills have them all pass them out. Doesn't it's real important that the community have Narcan around

529
00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:05.010
Amanda's: So you're saying because of our this I should always have an offline on me.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.940
Amanda's: If he did anyway.

532
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:19.080
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, the chances of overdosing on our can are really, really small. It's hard to do.

533
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:32.370
Dawn Abriel: But, but where we see it is people are out and they see people overdose and they go out and rescue them. So I know you said you never leave the house but

537
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.790
Amanda's: I just don't have time for that. I'm too old to do that already.
