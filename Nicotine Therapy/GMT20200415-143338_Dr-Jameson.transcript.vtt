Dr Jameson: Okay, so

110
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.590
Dr Jameson: I don't even know that this one of my one of my concerns about these things. It's like

111
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.610
Dr Jameson: Documenting how much you're using, I guess. So I guess it's a cartridge related right

112
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.710
Erik Long: Yeah, I do. One Carter today, which is like

113
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.370
Erik Long: Equivalent to like a pack separate okay where's the nicotine.

114
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.480
Erik Long: Yeah. Hope hopefully less carcinogens below and others.

115
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:57.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah I don't know either. It seems to be inflamed. It's definitely causes inflammation. So an inflammation is underlies a lot of cancer. So I don't know.

116
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.530
Dr Jameson: But hopefully we'll, we'll tackle that

117
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:12.450
Dr Jameson: relatively soon. Maybe after we get this other stuff under control, but that would be that would be fantastic. When you are interested

121
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.530

175
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so what what happened a year ago that change that.

176
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.020
Erik Long: Well, that's when I got out of my last rehab.

177
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:43.950
Erik Long: I

178
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.040
Erik Long: Kind of, I haven't gotten back to anything but I've gone back to

179
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.870
Erik Long: Opiates

180
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.540
Dr Jameson: So, use a lot of things after we have, it's been mainly just opiates.

181
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.320
Yeah.

182
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:05.070
Dr Jameson: Alright, so, then tell me you're pretty young. So when did you start did this start with experimentation or prescription for something like what happened.

183
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.550
Erik Long: Home when I was like eight years old, I got prescribed to Dexter amphetamine.

184

Erik Long: Was I had ADHD.

186
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.950
Erik Long: And then

187
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:29.850
Erik Long: When I was 14 I got prescribed Xanax for social and separation anxiety.

188
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.700
Erik Long: And

189
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:40.770
Erik Long: Then I was like 16 starts drinking and smoking weed.

190
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.010
Dr Jameson: That was

191
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.530

192
00:13:46.620 --> 00:14:01.170
Erik Long: Then that kept going to like after my first semester at college. And then I kind of got in trouble. And then I got arrested and then my dad was like I'm pulling you out of college. I'm not paying for that shit so

193
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.240
Dr Jameson: Here. Okay.

194
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.160
Erik Long: Yes, and I was stuck in my parents basement and I just started getting high alone.

195
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.800
Dr Jameson: And that was with on

196
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.020
Dr Jameson: With what

197
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.930
Erik Long: Whatever I could get my hands on.

198
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:28.050
Erik Long: Okay, but I didn't start, I'd say for like until it's like at least 19 and then you know it started with like Percocet and like oxy 30s.

199
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.290
Erik Long: And harrowing the buying straight fentanyl

200
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.030
Erik Long: Yeah.

201
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.520
Dr Jameson: Sorry, I was still typing Tommy sorry we started the opiates. How old how long ago.

202
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.830
Erik Long: When I was 19 so four years ago.

203
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.860
Dr Jameson: 19 and that was alone or with friends.

204
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.370
Erik Long: Alone or whatever they used to my friends. Okay.

205
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, so far so as you said, Percocet.

206
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.650
Dr Jameson: Then what else did you say sorry

207
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.710
Erik Long: I said oxy 30s. Those are basically the same thing.

208
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.200
Erik Long: As Percocet and then heroin.

209
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.240
Erik Long: And then

210
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.960
Erik Long: Like straight fentanyl

211
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.210
Erik Long: But it never showed up.

212
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.010
Okay.

213
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.110
Dr Jameson: Okay. So currently, so you snow, how you, how you use it, smoking.

214
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.300
Erik Long: inflation rate.

215
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.890
Dr Jameson: Okay snorting

216
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.890
Dr Jameson: How much are you using right now.

217
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.630
Erik Long: I'm

218
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.700
Erik Long: Ready now upgrade.

219
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:44.760
Erik Long: Taking them orally recently because I've been trying to wean myself down what I'm on like probably 45 milligrams of oxy a day.

220
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm glad you're not still using the fentanyl

221
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.860
Dr Jameson: That

222
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.540
Erik Long: Put me in the hospital.

223
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.400
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Well, besides the fact that it yes can kill it kills people very well.

224
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:07.740
Dr Jameson: It's also so strong that the Suboxone is we have a hard time sometimes making that transition that people need to start with methadone.

225
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.550
Erik Long: To taper that I've heard horror stories of methadone.

226
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, I mean,

227
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.990
Dr Jameson: It has, it has

228
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.230
Dr Jameson: I mean it works well for some people. I, you know,

229
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:23.070
Erik Long: Say works well to help them like get off stuff, but then like getting off the method.

230
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.410
Dr Jameson: Yes.

231
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.300
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but I mean to be fair, it can be hard to get off. It's hard to get off any opiates, so I don't know that.

232
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I don't know that that

233
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.500
Dr Jameson: Really, I mean, it's hard to, it's hard to get off the box. I mean we have to taper. I mean, and, you know,

234
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.280
Same

235
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:52.560
Dr Jameson: There are some definite benefits compared. You know, when I believe between methadone and and Suboxone that Suboxone has a lot of ways that makes it superior but

236
00:16:53.670 --> 00:17:04.590
Dr Jameson: There are some people that need the structure of a methadone clinic, like they just aren't there yet. And it does not require that you go into withdrawal before you take your dose so

237
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.440
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you know, there are some some things about it. And sometimes it's a good settings. Anyway, um,

238
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:19.020
Dr Jameson: So now oral use and back to oxycodone, what do you say 45 a day. Yeah.

239
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.130
Erik Long: 45 a day.

240
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.140
Dr Jameson: That's not bad.

241
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.120
Erik Long: Sometimes it takes 60 a day.

242
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.000
Dr Jameson: Okay. So, okay, it's

243
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.950
Erik Long: Horrible compared to what it was.

244
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:36.150
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm impressed that you have had the because that i mean i imagine you've you've suffered through some

245
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.100
Dr Jameson: Withdrawal

246
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.780
Dr Jameson: Process of that so

247
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.810
Erik Long: Yeah, I'm still I haven't taken any today. Okay.

248
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.820
Dr Jameson: I'm

249
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.810
Dr Jameson: Sorry. Give me one second.

250
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.280
Dr Jameson: Welcome multitask.

251
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.420
Working from home.

252
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:37.530
Dr Jameson: Alright, so. Okay, so tell me, You sound like you pretty knowledgeable about a lot of this stuff. So tell me what you know already, so I don't go over stuff that you already know about Suboxone or buprenorphine.

253
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.800
Erik Long: So at one point I was prescribed W Tex.

254
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.690
Erik Long: A couple months.

255
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.370
Erik Long: And then actually helped me a lot.

256
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.230
Erik Long: But then they tried to cut me off it. And that didn't go so well.

257
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.550
Dr Jameson: Okay, so they IT WAS WHAT KIND OF A PLACE. WHAT WAS IT

258
00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.780
Erik Long: Was it. Yeah, okay. It was when I was going into like I op that will yeah

259
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.930
Dr Jameson: Okay, so when you went to rehab. You did an inpatient detox to or how to

260
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.980
Dr Jameson: Do it where you okay and then straight from there to the IoT

261
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.520
Erik Long: Yeah, but they gave me like a really low dose computex

262
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.660
Dr Jameson: Just when you were in Iowa here and the detox to

263
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.850
Erik Long: In the detox to

264
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.020
Erik Long: The whole way through.

265
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.680
Dr Jameson: Okay, good. I was gonna say otherwise. I'm kind of crawl.

266
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.600
Erik Long: The parks would have been horrible.

267
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:36.150
Dr Jameson: Yes, yes. And then he did. I repeat that they just have like a protocol for you do it for so long. And then you come off or did you get kicked out or what happened.

268
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.870
Dr Jameson: Okay, by the way, I'm just so I know where we're at.

269
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.470
Erik Long: A few I didn't get kicked out of. But I would actually went out of business. It's called. It was called recovery road.

270
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.310
Erik Long: Another business and they just clone them. Everybody got yeah

271
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.190
Dr Jameson: So then you kind of suddenly had to stop it.

272
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.540
Erik Long: Yeah, really.

273
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.840
Dr Jameson: So now you know i mean that's the, that's the same

274
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:16.950
Dr Jameson: You know phenomenon as as anything else you stop suddenly maybe and I you know better than I think people it because it's a longer acting drug than a lot of the other ones that you you would otherwise be coming across. Maybe it's a slightly less

275
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.480
Erik Long: Subtle you know

276
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.050
Dr Jameson: It's more gradual, but it still gives you the same

277
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.030
Dr Jameson: Experience, unfortunately. So which Tommy, when

278
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.170
Erik Long: We puke or anything.

279
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.300
Erik Long: Okay, everyone does. Yeah.

280
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.150
Dr Jameson: So, okay. So that was actually my next question was telling me about your withdrawal and

281
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.270
Dr Jameson: What can what's happening right now.

282
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:50.520
Erik Long: What's happening right now. It's just like headache overnight. I get like hot and cold flushes, you know, restless legs is the worst one I freaking hate that.

283
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.380
Dr Jameson: You can't sleep right

284
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.670
I

285
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.720
Erik Long: Can get like a couple hours a night. But yeah, okay.

286
00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.440
Dr Jameson: Usually people

287
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.510
Erik Long: Can see much insomnia.

288
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.510
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then

289
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.620
Dr Jameson: In some new restless legs hot and cold vomiting when it's heroin.

290
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.420
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and headaches.

291
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.030
Erik Long: Oh yeah, and like, um,

292
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.680
Erik Long: So my digestion problems.

293
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.990
Dr Jameson: That area.

294
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:22.860
Yeah.

295
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.390
Dr Jameson: Do

296
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.710
Dr Jameson: Some people yawn a lot or their nose runs

297
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.020
Erik Long: You know,

298
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.260
Dr Jameson: And then you get pain, besides a headache.

299
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.180
Erik Long: Like a kind of ugly flu symptoms like

300
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.900
Erik Long: achy joints. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty common to

301
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.740
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's the worst scenario case scenario, what's happening. You said you haven't used to deck. So when's the last time you

302
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.540
Erik Long: Last night.

303
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.680
Erik Long: Last night at

304
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.730
Erik Long: Nine o'clock.

305
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.750
Dr Jameson: And are they fives or what 15 or what are you

306
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:03.240
Dr Jameson: 15 okay so you took 15 last night around nine. And so how what's happening right now.

307
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.370
Erik Long: But headache.

308
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.130
Erik Long: And, you know, just my body. I feel like I've played a little bit but

309
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.380
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay, so

310
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.080
Dr Jameson: Do you remember

311
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:31.890
Dr Jameson: Okay. The reason I'm asking is, is, and I mentioned that a minute ago, but it's important that you're in withdrawal and we introduce the we don't really use the sub you text, unless you're pregnant.

312
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:42.420
Dr Jameson: So it'll be some buprenorphine naloxone, but it's basically the same thing than the locks on is actually, as you know, because you took the street.

313
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:55.050
Dr Jameson: buprenorphine before and the subtext. That's the blocker. It's not actually naloxone is a blocker, but it in the formulation that you get, then the last one actually is not even absorbed through your

314
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.850
Dr Jameson: Mucous membranes. It's there.

315
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.730
Dr Jameson: To keep people from doing something else with this.

316
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.310
Dr Jameson: And we don't want you to do so.

317
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.100
Erik Long: I've seen people do with sub effects.

318
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.620
Dr Jameson: Yes. So several texts does not have that built in, and therefore it's more at risk for

319
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.270
Dr Jameson: What we call diversion. Right.

320
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:23.550
Dr Jameson: So it shouldn't really change. I mean, people sometimes say that they get a you know nauseous or something you know like big things that are different between the two. But, or the taste or something but

321
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:30.210
Dr Jameson: But, in and of itself. It's dead by the way it's designed, you're not actually really getting any naloxone in you.

322
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.880
Dr Jameson: If you take the medicine, the way it's supposed to be.

323
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.370
Erik Long: Like they'll check so

324
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.160
Dr Jameson: naloxone is Narcan

325
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.930
Erik Long: Okay.

326
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but if they are

327
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:49.500
Dr Jameson: They are related, in a sense, yeah. Now checks on in the locks on our kind of cousins of each other and

328
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.540
Erik Long: Another rehab. They tried to put me on no tricks.

329
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.290
Mm.

330
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.510
Dr Jameson: Hmm.

331
00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:06.120
Dr Jameson: Well, they're related. And I think if you. Well, you could have a side effect to it, but you could also have stuff, you know, it could have put you into what's are all

332
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.960
Erik Long: We know that makes sense that it's not to be absorbed. Well, the buprenorphine well

333
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:10.620
Dr Jameson: Uh huh.

334
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.640
Erik Long: sobering going

335
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

336
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.330
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that's it was it was done more as a you know there have been a not that they work that well. But

337
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.300
Dr Jameson: What was it oh panna or

338
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah, like they've tried to create

339
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.780
Dr Jameson: mechanisms by which it makes the particular

340
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.420
Dr Jameson: Substance less

341
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.300
Dr Jameson: Amenable to be abused. I know they have largely failed.

342
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.250
Erik Long: But it got abused a lot

343
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.910
I know

344
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:43.620
Dr Jameson: I know

345
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:51.990
Dr Jameson: The first time I came across oh pan is totally tangent, but I was I'm

346
00:24:52.710 --> 00:25:05.730
Dr Jameson: Not doing addiction medicine. I was a family practice. I am a family practice, Doc. So I still wasn't and I had an elderly patient who lived in like a nursing home or assisted living and she had a lot of a lot of like arthritis and stuff.

347
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.330
Dr Jameson: But she also had a crazy son and

348
00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:19.980
Dr Jameson: Anyway, somehow she was doing fine, but it was like he kept on meddling and like making a stink with different doctors appointments so that the doctors would like

349
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.790
Dr Jameson: You know, do something. And so anyway, some point she got prescribed this open and I never heard of it before but I walked into

350
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.240
Dr Jameson: A room.

351
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.020
Erik Long: Is so

352
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.690
Dr Jameson: I walked into her room and she was like, totally nodding and I you know when an old person is doing that you think, Oh my God, if they had a stroke. You like you

353
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:50.850
Dr Jameson: Know what's going on. And I was like, Oh my gosh, and then I went and looked up the medicine and the way that they marketed it kind of like actually content they made it sound like it was, you know, not really.

354
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.040
Erik Long: Didn't even easy strong

355
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.740
Dr Jameson: I know, but they kind of made it sound like a weak opioid opiate like thing like

356
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.030
Erik Long: They kind of tried to make it

357
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.670
Dr Jameson: Not really. What it really was and

358
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:16.590
Dr Jameson: I figured it out though. Mike, I think that stuff is making because then I saw her two days later she was fine again. And I was like, okay, that stuff and I tried to tell her son like she shouldn't take that stuff. It's making her and he got like anyway. He was all crazy but

359
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.900
Dr Jameson: In other words, I saw it firsthand, like, oh, okay, this stuff is not not

360
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.700
Dr Jameson: Not

361
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.620
Dr Jameson: Like oh

362
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:34.350
Erik Long: Anyway, I've taken one of those ones before and definitely it's not, it's no week or version of anything.

363
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.070
Dr Jameson: Now, I know.

364
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.520
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so we digress, but

365
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.950
Dr Jameson: The point is that

366
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.470
Dr Jameson: To answer your question.

367
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.490
Dr Jameson: The Naltrexone as opposed to decrease desire.

368
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.070
Dr Jameson: To use it. We use it for alcohol abuse to actually sometimes

369
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.790
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and that's what the vivid troll shot is

370
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:03.450
Dr Jameson: That you have to have not use any opiates for at least I believe it's 10 days, but at least seven

371
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.890
Erik Long: Girls, you go to

372
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:11.040
Dr Jameson: Which so kind of up north and we don't have to wait that long for the buprenorphine. Fortunately, because

373
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:27.210
Dr Jameson: I believe I have to look it up again. But I believe I mean certainly now no luck. So Narcan is just a blocker like it goes in and it pushes the other stuff off and that's why you suddenly feel terrible.

374
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:42.270
Dr Jameson: buprenorphine does that. But it also occupies and stimulates the receptors. It doesn't just block things. So you get kind of a mix. Like it would for to into withdrawal, but it also

375
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:50.640
Dr Jameson: If we time it right, it blocks. Other opiates from getting in there. So someone tries to relapse.

376
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.300
Dr Jameson: It, they don't get their, their

377
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:54.960
Dr Jameson: My

378
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.970
Erik Long: I looked it up. It's like a partial agonist.

379
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.630
Dr Jameson: You got it.

380
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.290
Dr Jameson: So, huh, but it also sets stops the withdrawal symptoms because it's still like

381
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.780
Dr Jameson: tickling those receptors enough

382
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:26.190
Dr Jameson: To keep all that stuff from from happening. So, and it as you sounds like you've read, but it does not much, maybe a trace amount, but it doesn't stimulate or it doesn't do the sedation, which then can lead to respiratory depression and stopping breathing, which is

383
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.420
Dr Jameson: No people overdose. It doesn't really hit that one very much are

384
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:44.520
Dr Jameson: Activated much more blocks that one. Similarly with euphoria doesn't much. I don't know what your experience was with it. Some people will say they do feel a little high with and we usually they are extra sensitive and we just need a lower dose.

385
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:55.320
Dr Jameson: The way that I've seen that happened in every single thing is is that everyone's built a little differently. And some of us have a lot more of one kind of receptor and very few of the other

386
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.890
Erik Long: Which is

387
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:02.580
Dr Jameson: I believe why someone like me who takes Percocet. After my C section just falls asleep but doesn't feel

388
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.880
Dr Jameson: Anything different

389
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.400
Dr Jameson: And some people take it and are like totally energized and feel like, oh my god.

390
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.050
Erik Long: I've never felt so good in their life.

391
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:21.690
Dr Jameson: Because I you know so many people will be like, how get it, and I'm like, I don't really get it either. I mean, but obviously we're not all wired the same so

392
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:31.230
Dr Jameson: If you happen to have a ton of one kind of receptor, maybe this will still give you some euphoria or still some sedation.

393
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:43.170
Dr Jameson: And and also when we keep on activating these receptors. As you know, we kind of increase the, the amount of them that you have and it changes your, your, your wiring gets all

394
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.030
Erik Long: Neuro plasticity.

395
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.360
Dr Jameson: Yes, so you know all the lingo. My goodness.

396
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.660
Erik Long: Yeah, my parents are both PhDs.

397
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.160
Dr Jameson: Okay, good.

398
00:29:54.030 --> 00:30:05.520
Dr Jameson: Um, so, right. So some of that can be reversed with time it some of it depends on how long and how young you were when you started using and that kind of thing, but

399
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:16.350
Dr Jameson: Not all of it is reversed. So, you know, I've seen. Same thing with with alcoholics. I had a patient, not too long ago and I was even surprised.

400
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:30.360
Dr Jameson: She had been sober for, like, I don't even know how long. And she just had a bad. I don't know. She just she started drinking. She said within like three days she was already having to have an I have like a

401
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.790
Dr Jameson: What do you call eye opener.

402
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.740
Erik Long: Actually was already. Yeah, yeah.

403
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.290
Dr Jameson: She was already dependent physically like

404
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.640
Erik Long: Instant or the dog.

405
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:46.890
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm. And I never, I never realized that could happen. So again, so fast, but it's almost like you just pick up right where you left off, it doesn't

406
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.140
Dr Jameson: You don't have to do this whole building

407
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.150
Dr Jameson: It works. Yeah, so

408
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.830
Dr Jameson: Horrible. Right. So some of its reverse, but not all of it so

409
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.890
Dr Jameson: So the way that we take kind of the approach that

410
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:11.340
Dr Jameson: Whatever we focus on harm reduction. So whatever we okay legally whatever legally, we can do to

411
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:28.830
Dr Jameson: Don't take that the wrong way. But whatever we can do to help decrease or not eliminate probably but decrease as much as possible, the likelihood that our patients are going to return to us is what we want to do. And if that means people need to take Suboxone for their entire lives.

412
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:35.640
Dr Jameson: It's not ideal but it's better than it's better than using then again.

413
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:51.510
Dr Jameson: You know, you can look at it like you know something, there's kind of a debate in the in the medical community as well as in the, you know, population in general, are we just replacing one thing for another. And in a sense we are but we're replacing something that's

414
00:31:52.830 --> 00:32:00.540
Dr Jameson: Quality controlled, you know, you get the same dose. Every time you use it, it's safer. It's, you know, there. It has a lot of benefit.

415
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.370
Erik Long: My arguments with my parents.

416
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:14.010
Dr Jameson: Yeah, doesn't change your level of consciousness. Here you function like a regular your own self, your brain. You're, you're thinking clearly and you know if over time.

417
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:21.720
Dr Jameson: We can very very very very very gradually and not not yet but you know sometimes and I think

418
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:42.120
Dr Jameson: Like years later, probably we start that process and works, then so be it. But, but the statistics are not very encouraging about what happens after we stop. So we, we, kind of, you know, you know, you gotta really think long and hard before you sort of release somebody back to, oh, natural because

419
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.500
Erik Long: There's

420
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.780
Erik Long: An overlooked a well for me.

421
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.920
Dr Jameson: My opinion is that

422
00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:56.370
Dr Jameson: There's and I say the same about smoking cigarettes do actually there's a chemical

423
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:09.210
Dr Jameson: Dependence physical dependence, which obviously is much stronger with opiates and nicotine, then there's a behavior habit and we are obviously

424
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:20.970
Dr Jameson: Fixed, you know, addressing the physical stuff with the medication, but that doesn't if we don't like also deal with how mindset and how we think about things and how we address

425
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.110
Stress and

426
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:23.610
Dr Jameson: You know,

427
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.680
Dr Jameson: What's the word

428
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.990
Dr Jameson: I can't think.

429
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.600
Dr Jameson: Anymore. Yeah, you're, you're, you're not ever going to get over the hump, basically. So

430
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.810
Erik Long: That was also part of the discussion. I had my parents is I have to like

431
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.210
Erik Long: Go to therapy.

432
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.820
Erik Long: Meetings and

433
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.200
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's struggling trying to

434
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.850
Erik Long: Meditate and do and

435
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:56.460
Dr Jameson: Be open to thinking about things different ways trying different things, acknowledging. Okay, maybe I don't have all the answers here. Because you know what I've been doing hasn't been working and none of us do.

436
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.620
Dr Jameson: Everyone has their thing. So

437
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:05.070
Dr Jameson: You know, it's not you know that I say that to myself to oh I don't have the answers and

438
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:15.870
Dr Jameson: I think you know that's. Yeah, right. So that's a long term process though, right. You don't just flip a switch and suddenly become an optimist. If you've always been a pessimist, you know, suddenly develop this

439
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:31.950
Dr Jameson: Great self esteem if you haven't had one. If you've had traumas in your life that those need to be processed and healed and you know there's a lot to it. So that takes time, and I think that's why you know the studies have history so far studies to date are extremely

440
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:42.810
Dr Jameson: You know, negative about it. We're not encouraging about what happens when we, when we you know discontinue but I don't think we've may be done the studies.

441
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:57.780
Dr Jameson: That show what happens when we we incorporate pretty intensive and I just mean prolonged not every day. Yeah, counseling and kind of give it a longer amount of time to let your life.

442
00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:06.600
Dr Jameson: Flourish. To the point where you have gotten and that doesn't always protect people either. But the more you have to lose.

443
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's what I mean.

444
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.690
Erik Long: That's why I'm trying this out.

445
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:16.980
Erik Long: Yes, I want to actually be able to build something without being completely fucking miserable because my life. Yeah.

446
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.190
Dr Jameson: Well, I think you sound like you have a lot of potential

447
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.380
Dr Jameson: You have, I think it sounds like you have pretty good support system.

448
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.970
Erik Long: My parents are very supportive.

449
00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:27.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

450
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.820
Erik Long: And they and everyone sober in my house.

451
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.050
Dr Jameson: That's awesome. Good.

452
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.970
Erik Long: No drugs or alcohol and, you know,

453
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.560
Dr Jameson: And I part of me when I heard you say that you were mainly getting high by yourself.

454
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:47.310
Dr Jameson: I thought, oh, that's kind of sad. But then I also was thinking, but that means you don't have to do this whole you know trimming and like

455
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.380
Dr Jameson: Cutting out oh yeah all

456
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.590
Dr Jameson: Parts of their lives. A little, yeah.

457
00:35:52.680 --> 00:36:02.940
Erik Long: All the topics that are here. Well, okay. So when I went to rehab. I moved to Florida for two years. Okay. And that's where I went to rehab three times. Okay, and then

458
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:23.520
Erik Long: When I during that whole process. I kind of like have rehab. You know, you're supposed to delete all the negative contacts you have in our out. So I did that, then I moved back up here. I still have a couple really close friends, or like either normal or sober. So those are really do.

459
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:24.480
Dr Jameson: You mean that

460
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.770
Dr Jameson: Are not addicts.

461
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.170
Dr Jameson: Recover

462
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.030
Erik Long: Like they can drink a beer and just like

463
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.060
Dr Jameson: Okay cuz I don't know. I don't want you to

464
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.310
Dr Jameson: That implies that you're abnormal, which I

465
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.390
Erik Long: I don't know if I will

466
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.710
Erik Long: I'm an addict.

467
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:55.770
Dr Jameson: That's yes but that's it's like, yeah, I try to include what if you have maybe you don't really have reservations about this whole idea, but for people that do I try to say, well, what if we told you have diabetes and you need to take medication.

468
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:10.170
Dr Jameson: Would you because your body's not doing something chemically it's supposed to do. Would you be I mean people don't like when they're diagnosed with diabetes. Don't get me wrong, but you don't consider your it's not some sort of you're not a pariah.

469
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.540
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so

470
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:24.240
Dr Jameson: So it sounds like you have a pretty good grasp on how the medication works. Do you remember you said it was a low dose that they had you on. You remember

471
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.260
Erik Long: I think it was like eight or 10 milligrams of people are saying

472
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:44.280
Dr Jameson: Okay, I know they do things a little different in the inpatient because they sometimes use the two milligram dose and then so many a day because it comes in 248 but with Malcolm and 10 so maybe it was eight. Yeah.

473
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:52.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Um, so the sort of average, typical dose is 60 milligrams a day.

474
00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.810
Dr Jameson: Plus or minus. And, you know, the lower the less you can use and shouldn't take more than you need. Obviously, and that's

475
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.890
Dr Jameson: You know that much less that we someday need to taper and mean away but

476
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.200
Dr Jameson: Everyone's different. But I would say

477
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:33.630
Dr Jameson: Well, what I would suggest we do is sort of the usual induction, process, procedure because actually your current daily dose is, I would say, moderate, like, I mean, it's not a high amount at this point. So hopefully, we don't need a super huge amount to kind of offset the

478
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:42.090
Dr Jameson: To satisfy your receptor is basically. So what I would suggest is, we use the eight. It comes with eight slash to because there's no lesson is to

479
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:50.610
Dr Jameson: Have you take a half and see how that goes. And then you can take the other half an hour later if you still feel icky.

480
00:38:51.450 --> 00:39:03.960
Dr Jameson: Or maybe you'll take a half in the morning and a half at night and that will be your daily dose lives just kind of test it out and see how, see how it works. What, what, what you need to do.

481
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:05.850
Dr Jameson: To feel normal.

482
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.940
Dr Jameson: How tall are you,

483
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.980
Dr Jameson: You know how much you weigh about 150

484
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:33.000
Erik Long: Well, yeah, when I was on a before I got down to like eight milligrams. I started me like I should like, I think it was 12

485
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:46.440
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, like I said, it's more important to me that you feel comfortable so that you're not having cravings and not you know white knuckling it basically

486
00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:51.870
Dr Jameson: You can focus on other things. So if it's 12 if it's eight if it's 16

487
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.960
Dr Jameson: It's really whatever is that right dose for for you right now.

488
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:04.200
Dr Jameson: So I'll write the prescription in such a way, I got to look you up in the sorry I gotta look you up with

489
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.390
Dr Jameson: Drug monitoring systems.

490
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.730
Dr Jameson: Okay, I gotta reset my password.

491
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.780
Erik Long: What's a drug monitoring system.

492
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.070
Dr Jameson: Oh, the

493
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.570
Dr Jameson: The dates have a

494
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:42.270
Dr Jameson: In response to all the opiate stuff you know how people doctor shop and, you know,

495
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.160
Erik Long: Say I had

496
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.190
Erik Long: Like a centralized from another doctor

497
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.440
Dr Jameson: It's a centralized

498
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.830
Dr Jameson: Place to

499
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.790
Erik Long: Keep track of people account. Yeah, so like every pharmacy is

500
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:14.880
Dr Jameson: Updating when they dispense something to a patient. So you can look them up and see, oh, they got a prescription from the doctor and they fill it with that prescription and then they got, you know, it's a way of monitoring basically now we're legally

501
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.560
Dr Jameson: Required to run that report before we prescribe

502
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.710
Dr Jameson: A variety of things including this so

503
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.300
Dr Jameson: Those are

504
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.530
Erik Long: Controlled substances.

505
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:34.530
Dr Jameson: In different states are different, but I'm sorry. Bear with me because then my neighbors. I had to reset my password, and that means I have to put my old password which

506
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.470
Dr Jameson: number off the top of my head.

507
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.640
Dr Jameson: You know, cause so many billions of passwords or anything.

508
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.900
Erik Long: Yeah. Write them down, but I have to take a look at my notes.

509
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:49.770
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, but anyway.

510
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:52.620
Dr Jameson: Please.

511
00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.440
Dr Jameson: And then we are

512
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.170
Dr Jameson: We are requests are they're asking me

513
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.150
Dr Jameson: Identification questions. Oh my god, I'm

514
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:14.910
Dr Jameson: Sorry.

515
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.200
Dr Jameson: We run the report every month to just to double check that.

516
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.470
Dr Jameson: We don't have any surprises.

517
00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.700
Dr Jameson: And that's actually also mandated by law. So

518
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.500
Erik Long: Wait. What state are you in. Are you in Cali

519
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.380
Dr Jameson: I'm actually, I'm actually in Florida.

520
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.760
Oh,

521
00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:40.860
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

522
00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.700
Erik Long: I was living in Delray

523
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.450
Dr Jameson: Okay and true. Yeah, I think. Yeah.

524
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:05.580
Dr Jameson: There has been

525
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.260
Dr Jameson: There has been

526
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.670
Dr Jameson: Didn't have a lowercase letter. And my first

527
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.260
Dr Jameson: Choice. This is taking forever.

528
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:46.440
Dr Jameson: Lord, I can't think of anything. You know, you run out of password ideas, after a while.

529
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.630
Dr Jameson: They've been talking about how there's all these rehabs there that are

530
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.610
Dr Jameson: Basically like

531
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.950
Erik Long: Yeah, they're closing down

532
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.090
Erik Long: Well, I

533
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.850
Dr Jameson: Was probably all the pill mills that started doing

534
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.130
Dr Jameson: Dipping rehab instead of one after the other. It's awful.

535
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:18.480
Erik Long: Yeah.

536
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.040
I remember on

537
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:26.970
Erik Long: One of them is really good, though. One of the rehabs I went to down there. I have friends who work at it, it's called immersion.

538
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:27.870
Uh huh.

539
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.850
Erik Long: But it's very big book 12 step very, very big book 12 step.

540
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:36.690
Yeah.

541
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.460
Dr Jameson: Well,

542
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:38.850
But

543
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.010
Erik Long: Everybody either

544
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:47.040
Erik Long: They don't treat the people like $1 sign as much as the other ones I've been to. Yeah.

545
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.570
Dr Jameson: Oh yeah, oh no you're not only are you leave your baby.

546
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.520
Erik Long: One day off.

547
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.000
Dr Jameson: Okay.

548
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.190
Erik Long: But I wasn't born very leap year

549
00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:00.060
Dr Jameson: 1787. That's right. That's an odd number. So I guess everyone

550
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:13.920
Dr Jameson: Patients found no prescriptions found. So you haven't had any prescription like controlled substances.

551
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.720
Know, sometime

552
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.700
Erik Long: I can tell you the truth, I promise.

553
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.840
Dr Jameson: I know I will. I

554
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:30.450
Dr Jameson: That's what it says, I'm just, you didn't tell me you had so okay so

555
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:39.360
Dr Jameson: There is an induction protocol. I don't know if you saw that on our, on our site anywhere. Did you come across it.

556
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.790
No, that's all right.

557
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.910
Dr Jameson: And then there's films and there's tablets.

558
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:57.270
Dr Jameson: And some people have a preference one. Some people prefer the other. And sometimes we insurance has a preference, often they prefer tablets, because they're cheaper.

559
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:03.120
Erik Long: New tablets are cheaper the tablets dissolve under the title already taken now.

560
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.230
Dr Jameson: You still dissolve them.

561
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.690
Erik Long: Let's go with whatever is cheaper.

562
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:12.780
Dr Jameson: And sometimes there's a prior off, it has to be completed and

563
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.450
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so we we sometimes have to

564
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.990
Dr Jameson: Jump through some hoops to get

565
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.660
Dr Jameson: To get things using a CVS right

566
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:29.010
Mm hmm.

567
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.790
Dr Jameson: Better address because their system.

568
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:51.810
Dr Jameson: So I live in Florida. I work. Well, I work here now. But before worked here. I worked for different telemedicine companies. So I have about 15 state licenses, because it is a national thing.

569
00:46:52.380 --> 00:47:06.870
Dr Jameson: And I have the licenses in Ohio and California and Florida and a variety of other places, but our prescription only can list one. So, it lists the California address because that's the main headquarters of our company.

570
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:15.390
Dr Jameson: And that gets the pharmacy, the local pharmacies all in a tizzy because they don't like seeing that out of state.

571
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.540
Dr Jameson: Maybe. Things are different now because of this outbreak, but I'm just gonna put my whole

572
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.740
Dr Jameson: My whole address on there for them to see okay so

573
00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.030
Dr Jameson: I'm going to write the prescription

574
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.690
Erik Long: Wanted the people normally prefer the film or the tablet, so

575
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:42.210
Dr Jameson: Different people say different things like some people don't like the taste of a film.

576
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:48.060
Dr Jameson: Some people find one. I don't know. So it's half and half. So,

577
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.820
Dr Jameson: We can stick in that same base.

578
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's, I mean it's

579
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.340
Dr Jameson: That was just saying

580
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.850
Dr Jameson: And then if if you don't like on we can always try the other one. Depending on whether your insurance will go along with that, but

581
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.250
Erik Long: I don't think I think

582
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.740
Erik Long: My insurance as you get covering

583
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.460
Dr Jameson: You should

584
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:13.260
Erik Long: Know how to know, well I'll see when I go to the phone. Yeah.

585
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.260
Dr Jameson: If you're not going to be using your insurance, then make sure you are you familiar with a good Rx coupon.

586
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.280
Erik Long: Yeah yeah yeah

587
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.140
Erik Long: Yeah.

588
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.020
Erik Long: Make sure you without insurance is 240

589
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.480
Erik Long: Bucks for one box of spark so

590
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.990
Erik Long: But with it. It's like 35

591
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:31.770
Dr Jameson: Well, that's

592
00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:36.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, it's okay because then there's a copay to that could be lost.

593
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.170
Dr Jameson: Okay, so then

594
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.720
Dr Jameson: So I'm going to write the prescription just says one twice a day.

595
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.500
Dr Jameson: I would like you to break it in half.

596
00:48:51.600 --> 00:49:03.510
Dr Jameson: Well, I would like you to wait a little longer before you even take excited. I really, the more actually really sick. You're feeling, the less likely you are to have it actually create a withdrawal like the way

597
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:13.560
Dr Jameson: The tech sounded for you. So I we generally recommend waiting at least 24 hours or until you're like, I don't think I can handle. You know, I can't take it anymore.

598
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.630
Erik Long: Okay, so I possibly

599
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.760
Erik Long: Wait, how long do you think it will take to fill

600
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:19.950
Dr Jameson: Well,

601
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:21.600
Erik Long: And in a perfect

602
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.040
Dr Jameson: World, it should take an hour.

603
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:28.710
Dr Jameson: But it depends on, does the pharmacy have it in stock. Is there a prior off needed is

604
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.210
Erik Long: Is the farmers in

605
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.530
Erik Long: Ohio. I'm sure they have an inch every dope.

606
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:50.190
Dr Jameson: Well, yeah, but sometimes the pharmacy where we were only in the middle of month they have like a monthly supply so like limit supply and they're, you know, they can't sometimes, it can't take any new patients because they won't be able to keep everybody

607
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.000
Dr Jameson: They won't be able to provide the medication. By the end of the month.

608
00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:02.370
Dr Jameson: I think I just saw an email that they may have waived a rule that pharmacies could only they have some ratio that they can't prescribe but more than

609
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:13.560
Dr Jameson: 5% of their total prescriptions, such as controlled substances, but I think I just saw an email from the DEA. I mean, I read it. And that's what I think I understood that they were trying to say was that

610
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:26.790
Dr Jameson: That is being lifted, so they're, they're the pharmacies are under a lot of scrutiny now rightfully so, I just, it bothers me that they can they can include the Suboxone in their, in their calculations, because

611
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.020
Dr Jameson: These are the people they're trying not to use the others. Come on, anyway.

612
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.270
Dr Jameson: So it shouldn't take too long. But like I say, I

613
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.540
Dr Jameson: I don't always have the final say on that.

614
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.920
Erik Long: Did they expect to power like for tonight.

615
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.630
Milligrams well

616
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:59.610
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Oh, I thought you meant for pills like no, yeah, no, I would say, you know, you take the half and then wait an hour. See how you feel. And if you're still not feeling much better. You take the other half.

617
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:09.240
Dr Jameson: And then tomorrow morning. So again, you know, if you're, if you had to take the second half tonight, then just go ahead and take the whole one tomorrow.

618
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.430
Dr Jameson: And you can either

619
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:20.220
Dr Jameson: Just do that for the day. It's technically a 24 hour drug seems like most of our patients feel better splitting it into two doses.

620
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:26.100
Dr Jameson: I don't know if that's just the behavior being used to having to dose yourself right

621
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.660
Dr Jameson: So really, that that just seems

622
00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.620
Dr Jameson: Too long.

623
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.400
Erik Long: Ago. Yeah.

624
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.930
Dr Jameson: But technically it is a 24 hour medication. So

625
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:39.000
Dr Jameson: All right, so I'll you have some some flexibility there.

626
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:47.040
Dr Jameson: Did they explain to you how are like how our program is structured with the weekly groups and and

627
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.370
Dr Jameson: Or did you read about that. Are you familiar

628
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.590
Erik Long: Not 100%

629
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.090
Dr Jameson: So we do this meeting and then going forward.

630
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:10.170
Dr Jameson: We sometimes we have one extra visit in the middle, just depending on timing, but going forward. You and I see each other weekly in the, in the context of the group.

631
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:21.810
Dr Jameson: Visits. So it's me a counselor and eight to 10 patients. So we start every week with a who needs refills conversation and then

632
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:35.460
Dr Jameson: If it's somebody that's fairly new. We might also talk about how's the dose and how much did you end up meeting and doing need to adjust something, but usually fairly quickly. We get that you will. So it's really just who's, who needs. Who needs refills or not.

633
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:44.220
Dr Jameson: And then the counselor sort of takes over the rest of the meeting and we talk about recovery skills, etc, etc. So we start out with a week supply

634
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:55.320
Dr Jameson: And over time, when people are keeping their appointments and doing their drug screens and passing them and and was meeting with a counselor and sort of following all the

635
00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.850
Dr Jameson: Rules of the program we eventually after a few months.

636
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:07.680
Dr Jameson: reward you with a two week at a time prescription and and then eventually a month at a time, but that

637
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:14.310
Dr Jameson: Is something you work up to. So my tools. My Ohio meetings. What's your, what are your work hours.

638
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.310
Erik Long: Well, normally work.

639
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:28.140
Erik Long: Your Tuesday Friday and Sunday. Okay, what like to to to to a

640
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.740
Dr Jameson: Okay.

641
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.760
Erik Long: One day, one day.

642
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.130
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I have a 1030 Tuesday morning

643
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.830
Dr Jameson: Group, which probably

644
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.610
Dr Jameson: Because then I have a noon and a 130 and an 8pm

645
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:46.980
Dr Jameson: Sound like they would work very

646
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.910
Erik Long: Well, on Tuesday.

647
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.540
Erik Long: Tuesday mornings and then Friday and Sunday nights out. So if I could do 8pm on Tuesday.

648
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:56.490
Yes.

649
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:01.110
Erik Long: Okay, that would be perfect. Okay, so

650
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.270
Dr Jameson: I'm going to send a week supply

651
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:12.000
Dr Jameson: Which should be really more than enough to get you through next Tuesday, because we're already you know you're not even going to start it till tonight.

652
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:20.850
Dr Jameson: So I will send. I just wanted to make sure we have the correct duration before I sent it.

653
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:33.330
Dr Jameson: I'm going to send it right now. What I usually suggest is give the pharmacy. I mean, give me 20 minutes but give them a call fairly soon after this

654
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:49.530
Dr Jameson: And just innocently asked, Did you get just making sure the prescription came through and any idea when it will be ready and when, if they say, Oh, there's a private, you know, that's when you start to get a sense that we we have some other hoops that we have to jump through

655
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.300
Dr Jameson: And if you get that kind of message then

656
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:57.750
Dr Jameson: Go ahead and give us a call back

657
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:58.680
So we can

658
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:08.640
Dr Jameson: We can get on the horn. We have Danielle, does the prior offs and

659
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:16.500
Dr Jameson: The price is only an issue if your insurance is even involved. So if they're not going to cover it at all, then that is just a

660
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.460
Dr Jameson: You know, a moot point

661
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.190
Erik Long: Yeah. OK.

662
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.230
Dr Jameson: So my let's see was

663
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.440
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I gotta find space to to write even here.

664
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.960
Dr Jameson: Do you go by ego, Eric. There's no, not much, I guess, unless you go buy something else.

665
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.310
Erik Long: No, I go back here.

666
00:55:50.760 --> 00:56:05.790
Dr Jameson: Okay, alright, so I'll pencil you in there and we'll assign to that group. Then you also will have a an initial meeting, like a intake, kind of like this with a with a therapist, and then at that point. They'll determine

667
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.220
Dr Jameson: What frequency, you're going to meet with individually with a counselor as well.

668
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:18.840
Dr Jameson: We usually that maybe takes a week or two to get scheduled, just to let everything on the dust settle kind

669
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.480
Dr Jameson: And you're going to have lab work, they talk to you about doing a bloodwork lab work.

670
00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:25.740
No.

671
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:27.390
Dr Jameson: Okay.

672
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.160
Dr Jameson: There's an order in here, but I don't know.

673
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:49.800
Dr Jameson: We have there's an initial round of blood work that we have people do. It's like screenings for and which isn't always relevant, but like screenings for various things you can catch sharing needles, but also blood, blood work like blood counts and liver and kidney and stuff like that.

674
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:56.820
Dr Jameson: And then a urine as well. So we usually use the quest lab.

675
00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:10.770
Dr Jameson: Things are a little crazy right now, so I know some of them are not even like really open or not taking I'm not really sure. So you'll have to, I'll have Jamie. Did you have you met with Jamie or are Jane or who you were talking to

676
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.160
Erik Long: Remember,

677
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.190
Dr Jameson: Marvin.

678
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:21.870
Erik Long: Marvin.

679
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.260
Marvin, you

680
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.800
Dr Jameson: Must be. You haven't heard yet.

681
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:35.460
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that may be why you didn't hear about the laughs Okay.

682
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.240
Dr Jameson: We are growing like crazy.

683
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.670
Dr Jameson: So they're hiring, which is good, but what that means people are training so

684
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.700
Dr Jameson: Okay.

685
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.610
Dr Jameson: Hello.

686
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.840
Dr Jameson: My

687
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.480
Dr Jameson: Mom.

688
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.390
Dr Jameson: Please.

689
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.850
Dr Jameson: Clarify with

690
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:21.660
Dr Jameson: Lab order.

691
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:26.610
Dr Jameson: Quest

692
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:35.700
Dr Jameson: Location, etc. So we normally ask people to have bloodwork labs done within the first week.

693
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:45.210
Dr Jameson: If you find out that the local lab is like not available right now because of the coven stuff.

694
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:47.040
Dr Jameson: Let us know.

695
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:55.500
Dr Jameson: We can look into if you've had any labs done in the last six months that we can just get copies of or

696
00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:09.600
Dr Jameson: You know, if we can't get labs, we can't get labs like can't, we can't fight that. But we can mail you that what what normally happens is after that first this first round of labs going forward. We do monthly

697
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:19.050
Dr Jameson: Medication drug screens, but we mail you a cup that has the little I'm sure you've seen those before with the little readers right and belong. The side of

698
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:19.710
Dr Jameson: It and you

699
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:21.660
Dr Jameson: Do it at home and hold it up to the camera.

700
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.860
Dr Jameson: There's a protocol for that too. But anyway, if we have to just mail you a cup right away instead of in a month.

701
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:39.180
Dr Jameson: To at least get the the drug screen part done as soon as possible. We can adjust our, our usual operating procedure for the moment.

702
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:44.100
Dr Jameson: But we'll try with the local lab and see if we can get

703
00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:50.220
Dr Jameson: get that done as possible. Do you know if you've had any lab sun.

704
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:54.240
Erik Long: In the last know it's been like over a year since I had a lab. Alright.

705
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:59.460
Dr Jameson: And the last time you were in the in the treatment program was how long ago.

706
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.540
Erik Long: So, like, eight months ago, okay, because we

707
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.030
Dr Jameson: Might still but that's the one that went out of business.

708
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.090
Erik Long: No, that was immersion the good one.

709
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:12.240
Erik Long: Okay. Wonder went out of business was like a year and a half ago.

710
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:21.420
Dr Jameson: So we might sell something we if we can. It's nice to get records from previous treatment facility, just, you know, so we're all on the same page and

711
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.370
Dr Jameson: Not to

712
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.830
Dr Jameson: Just to confirm and sometimes there are things that you know you think you know and you don't you know you remembered wrong or whatever. So it's just good to

713
01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:32.160
Have

714
01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:43.470
Dr Jameson: I believe you've probably signed the lease on that too. So maybe they did some labs. I don't know. So we can look and see if we can gather anything from from the previous

715
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.600
Dr Jameson: Records, too.

716
01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.610
Dr Jameson: So,

717
01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:55.560
Dr Jameson: It's kind of a long time between now and Tuesday, which may be fine, because you've taken subjects before but

718
01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:58.830
Dr Jameson: If there's any

719
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.780
Dr Jameson: I will do you feel like you'd like to have another check in between, like Friday, say, or

720
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.390
Erik Long: No, I'll be fine. Okay.

721
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:10.410
Erik Long: If things

722
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:16.650
Dr Jameson: If anything's going on or you have questions or something isn't right, or the tablets make you puke or

723
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.320
Dr Jameson: Something is happening just

724
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:27.810
Dr Jameson: Be in touch and we'll we can always try to find it, squeeze in a time I actually work somewhere else. I'm not really available in foreigners, but I can probably

725
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:47.040
Dr Jameson: If you don't mind me face timing or zooming from my car somewhere I can, I can probably make it work if we if we need to have a little conversation and just who knows if you have a question or it's not going well, or you know there's a problem, then just we'll figure that out. Otherwise,

726
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:59.430
Dr Jameson: Otherwise, we'll plan on seeing you next Tuesday and the protocol for that is you start in the virtual clinic basically for everything. But just like you did today. We asked people

727
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:10.860
Dr Jameson: Lately the zoom times and the volume has increased. So right now, we're asking people to check in, like, an hour early and hopefully you get checked in and then you can go do something else for 45 minutes and then come back.

728
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.060
Erik Long: When it's actually the tighter the

729
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:12.420
Group.

730
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.560
Dr Jameson: And you have earbuds so that's good. We just ask people not to be smoking during group and

731
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.470
Dr Jameson: You know the hip that your votes for HIPAA like privacy for other people in the group. So

732
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.070
Dr Jameson: Other than that, hopefully.

733
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:38.280
Dr Jameson: Hopefully it's fairly straightforward, you'll start getting emails with surveys and they're really into data collection, which is kind of a, it's a

734
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:48.720
Dr Jameson: Pain sometimes for you guys but it's good. Really, because we're able to track like what are the factors that are associated with people dropping out of treatment relaxing.

735
01:02:49.470 --> 01:03:00.780
Dr Jameson: You know, so it's, it is really, it's good but it is work for you, so there there are emails you should be getting emails will survey links. And if you can do those ahead of time. So that's already done when you come to the time to check in.

736
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.270
Dr Jameson: That streamlines like that's what slows it down. A lot of people haven't filled out their surveys, so

737
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.060
Dr Jameson: Just watch for those. Um. Any questions before we go.

738
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:16.560
Erik Long: Um, okay, so eight o'clock Eastern time, right.

739
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.480
Dr Jameson: Yes, good question.

740
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.010
Dr Jameson: Are you Eastern or central

741
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.300
Erik Long: And Eastern

742
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.900
Dr Jameson: Okay, good.

743
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.730
And

744
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.350
Erik Long: Again, just to confirm tablets are sublingual

745
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:29.310
Dr Jameson: Yes.

746
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.780
Erik Long: Just like the strips, you

747
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.680
Dr Jameson: Use, you know, it's all the same thing. Don't eat or drink anything for 10 minutes and

748
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And if you're, you should be able to just split it in half. If you stick a half in there.

749
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:47.550
Dr Jameson: Some people do do that and just put one on each side, too. I think just because it can get a little

750
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.200
Erik Long: Yeah.

751
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:50.460
Dr Jameson: clumpy in there.

752
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:55.020
Erik Long: And then Marvin should call me about the lab at some point.

753
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.240
Dr Jameson: Hopefully, yes. I asked him to so

754
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.320
Erik Long: All right, and I should call the pharmacy in like

755
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.730
Dr Jameson: 30 minutes turn. Yeah.

756
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:09.870
Dr Jameson: Just confirm everything seems like it's working as as design. If you know have a quest lab in your area.

757
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:20.280
Dr Jameson: Or maybe you can google the closest quest and just call them and ask if they can tell if they have an order for you in their system. If they do, and they're open you can just go ahead and go get it done.

758
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.230
Erik Long: That's

759
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:34.050
Dr Jameson: It was sent to quest i i don't know if they if it goes to their central computer or a specific location, but I think it should be the central location. I don't know if you can get anybody on the phone answer those kind of questions for you though.

760
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.140
Erik Long: Times, it's difficult at times.

761
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.030
Dr Jameson: It certainly is.

762
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:49.410
Dr Jameson: So you can take as much as two a day on the tablets don't go above that without talking to us first. Okay, and

763
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:58.350
Dr Jameson: If it's less than that, I think, so much the better. But that you take as much as you need to feel normal.

764
01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.340
Erik Long: Basically

765
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:00.660
Dr Jameson: As long as it's not more than two.

766
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:12.060
Dr Jameson: Okay okay and and just to be clear, getting refills kind of requires you coming to group. So that's all you say that, but you would be

767
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:17.250
Dr Jameson: How many people just don't come and then call like in a panic. I met a mess. And I bet you are

768
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.270
Dr Jameson: What should we come. You know why we're doing group. So anyway,

769
01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:21.600
Erik Long: All right.

770
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.460
Dr Jameson: All right. Nice to meet you.

771
01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:25.140
Erik Long: Nice to meet you too. Thank you.

772
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.970
Dr Jameson: You're welcome. You know how to get out of here.

773
01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.220
Erik Long: A quickly.

774
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.840
Dr Jameson: You got it. Sometimes you

775
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.980
Dr Jameson: Can't see believe so.

776
01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:32.220
That's

777
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:34.470
Erik Long: Good.

778
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:36.090
Dr Jameson: To see you next week.

779
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.200
Erik Long: See ya.

780
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.530
Dr Jameson: What's up,

781
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:09.030
zachariah Giffin: Um, I brought the tell you on Tuesday. I have a prescription

782
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:20.910
zachariah Giffin: I'll spell it for you. I think it's the same thing is value. It's he are a p o l am.

783
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.300
Dr Jameson: OK. And that's for what

784
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:26.010
zachariah Giffin: I'm doing

785
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:34.500
zachariah Giffin: On Friday on Friday, I have to get my bottom teeth pulled and they want me to take it before an hour and a half before I go in

786
01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:36.180
zachariah Giffin: I know I used to

787
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:56.160
zachariah Giffin: I used to be on color pen for anxiety, but since I'm one Suboxone you can't you can't mix benzo with them and I looked it up and it said it was volume. So I want to know if on Friday. Do I not take any Suboxone or should I not take it at all, or

788
01:06:56.370 --> 01:07:00.360
Dr Jameson: Can you, um, how many milligrams. Does it say

789
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.960
zachariah Giffin: It's point 25 milligrams

790
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.550
zachariah Giffin: And they want to tablets.

791
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:08.790
Dr Jameson: They just wanting to take two tablets. An hour before

792
01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:12.960
zachariah Giffin: An hour and a half before I go in before my appointment.

793
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.180
Dr Jameson: Okay. And it's all right.

794
01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:22.050
Dr Jameson: Just looking up. I don't think that's a very high dose. So, so you're right.

795
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.430
Dr Jameson: Historically, there's been a big concern about

796
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:37.920
Dr Jameson: Trial. I'm okay. I don't use this particular one. Very often, but it is. You're right, it is a benzo and it

797
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.380
Dr Jameson: Healthy on. Oh.

798
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:40.950
Okay.

799
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:56.190
Dr Jameson: There has been I'm just reading I'm just looking up the dosing. It's up there has been a concern about

800
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.980
Dr Jameson: The combination because

801
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:19.410
Dr Jameson: In the very few cases where someone has died from like an overdose kind of thing and Suboxone has been buprenorphine has been involved. It's, I think, universally mixed with the when people when they get the drug tests back on the, you know, post mortem. They see the Suboxone and

802
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:28.620
Dr Jameson: pencils or alcohol or something else. So there's been a concern that the combination might increase the risk of overdose.

803
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:42.780
Dr Jameson: People are using when that's happened it's been because people are like melting and snort melting and shooting and you know just doing a lot of things you have to work really hard, actually, to

804
01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:52.200
Dr Jameson: Overdose you can, but you have to really take a lot and in ginormous. You know, in ginormous doses, some other way than its design so

805
01:08:52.920 --> 01:09:00.960
Dr Jameson: Long story short, they have in the last year or so guidelines have actually been published that the risks are much lower than we had previously thought.

806
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:19.560
Dr Jameson: And in patients that you know really can't don't do well without their daily benzo is like the risk of the combination is lower than the risk of people relaxing and overdosing and all this other stuff using street drugs. So long story short, I think it's fine for a single dose.

807
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:22.350
Dr Jameson: Is someone driving you what's the

808
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.670
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah

809
01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:28.410
zachariah Giffin: Yes, I have someone taking me in will be with me all day. Yeah.

810
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.210
Dr Jameson: And how are you like nervous about the procedure or are you

811
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:54.630
zachariah Giffin: Kind of like I rather just take the two broken teeth off and the one next to it. I really don't want all my bottom keeps going back eventually they're taking all my bottom and my top I blessed was to get a top partial bottom denture. Now they think I should just get all of them poor

812
01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.010
zachariah Giffin: I'm okay. I'm worried about. I love food.

813
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:04.680
zachariah Giffin: Yeah. Um, what about in afterwards. I'm always nervous about the procedure.

814
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.380
Dr Jameson: Because I was gonna say you could try it.

815
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:17.970
Dr Jameson: You could try taking a just one of them and then see how you feel like you know, but I think it's fine to take them it's it's really fine. So somebody's driving you so if you're a little extra sleepy.

816
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:28.380
Dr Jameson: That's fine. I mean, they kind of want you into that's kind of the point is to get you a little sleepy. So you're really relaxed. I would just say if you don't really want them so

817
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:44.940
Dr Jameson: I'm not saying anything about this particular dentist cuz I don't know anything. And I don't know what your teeth look like in there either, but they get paid to pull teeth. So the Marty they pull them or they get paid and

818
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:53.700
Dr Jameson: If you don't really want them to pull your teeth and don't consent to them pulling all your teeth fella. No, I just want you to pull the three that we talked the three and

819
01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:01.710
Dr Jameson: You know, like don't sign the paper to get the rest of them pulled right now. You can always do it later. But if you're not so sure you want to do it. I

820
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.270
Dr Jameson: Because you. Why can't you get a partial on the bottom and a partial on the top.

821
01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:11.010
zachariah Giffin: Well those ones right here right they're

822
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.270
zachariah Giffin: Pretty bad too.

823
01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.800
zachariah Giffin: They're starting to break

824
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.090
zachariah Giffin: Okay, so

825
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.170
Dr Jameson: I mean the ones that are

826
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:33.570
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I don't know, I'm not, like I said, I'm not a dentist. I don't know the situation inside your mouth, but just some skepticism is warranted sometimes because I've seen people, young people, they're getting all their teeth book. And you're right. Like, I mean,

827
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.610
Dr Jameson: I don't know. I mean it. Unfortunately, when you don't have

828
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:51.720
Dr Jameson: Financial resources, you don't get the kind of dental care that people with dental with resources and insurance get where you know root canals and crowns and that all costs money.

829
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.250
Dr Jameson: So,

830
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.840
Dr Jameson: pulling teeth is the cheap.

831
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.300
Dr Jameson: The cheap solution really

832
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.700
Dr Jameson: So there's a lot of people losing all their teeth when they're very young, which is a shame but

833
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.490
Dr Jameson: But anyway.

834
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:18.840
Dr Jameson: I'm not, like I said, I don't want to second guess or make it sound like I think your dentist is a crook or something. I'm not saying that. But I have seen Matt happen in some cases. So just, just so you know.

835
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:21.420
Dr Jameson: Like the all these, um,

836
01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:33.930
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so, but thank you for asking. And bringing to our attention and if, if you have a drug screen Monday and it shows some bendel's in it. We know where they came from.

837
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:46.350
Dr Jameson: For pain purposes. That's the other other question I would have a talk to you about post, post procedure pain control little

838
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:52.830
zachariah Giffin: Know I figure I would just be fine taking ibuprofen, though.

839
01:12:53.370 --> 01:13:00.540
zachariah Giffin: Okay, I don't want any BEFORE THEY GIVE ME TYLENOL three, but I was on the Suboxone so I didn't even get it filled

840
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.910
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. Do they know you're on the Suboxone

841
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.790
zachariah Giffin: I'm pretty sure

842
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:15.420
zachariah Giffin: Like I'll make sure I when I go and I'm pretty sure I've told him all my medications. I'm one but Friday when I go in

843
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.540
zachariah Giffin: You know, make sure they know. Okay.

844
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:28.380
Dr Jameson: So this is what I would suggest, I have had patients as we talked about on Suboxone and having these kinds of things done and they do fine. What I would suggest is

845
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:39.570
Dr Jameson: Instead of taking a whole film in the morning and a whole film whenever you usually take them whatever times I would cut your doses in half.

846
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:48.960
Dr Jameson: And take. No, that sounds backwards, but you're going to still take two a day but you're going to take a half and then a half and then a half and a half, like split it up.

847
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.850
Dr Jameson: look smaller more frequent doses that works better for pain that way.

848
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.500
zachariah Giffin: Right.

849
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:57.120
Dr Jameson: Weird, but it does

850
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:13.590
zachariah Giffin: Though I. The reason I knew about the Suboxone mixing with the Benz's is because I have anxiety and I used to be on Klonopin but once I got Suboxone up my side. Dr. Know and

851
01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.570
zachariah Giffin: They give me the GABBA and yeah

852
01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:16.260
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

853
01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:18.720
Dr Jameson: Which is honestly better anyway because

854
01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:28.350
Dr Jameson: Pencils are caused physical dependence and tolerance and all this and they can make you stop breathing and so they're not ideal anyway.

855
01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:39.840
Dr Jameson: But yeah, when we can. We try to avoid the combination, but it's no longer consider like it used to be, if someone was taking a benzo they could not have Suboxone like you had to pick one or the other.

856
01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:41.370
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

857
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:55.440
Dr Jameson: And we're not quite as like stringent about that anymore. I still don't like pencils like for this one time before procedure. Perfect. That's a perfect use of them. But for every day, it's not great. Anyway, so

858
01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:14.310
Dr Jameson: I I'm giving you permission. I don't know how much medicine you have, but I'm giving you permission to take an extra half or even two extra half's in the days right after your procedure if you're having if the Ibuprofen is really not enough.

859
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.340
Dr Jameson: It's going to be somewhat sore. It's really a question of how much you know how how

860
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:32.220
Dr Jameson: The degree. Right. Like, I think we can expect, you're going to have some pain. But if it's like you know you can't sleep and you're, you know, pulling your hair out because it's so so intense, even with ibuprofen.

861
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:44.490
Dr Jameson: You have my permission to take extra paths. You know, so six doses six half and the day instead of four. Don't go beyond that, without checking with me though. Okay.

862
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:52.380
Dr Jameson: No, I don't know if you have any extra if you'll have extra to get you through Tuesday. If you do that, you have

863
01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:03.270
zachariah Giffin: I don't have extra like I have why just take today, but I'm on my way I bought some ice cream that will help with

864
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.410
zachariah Giffin: Okay, hold

865
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:15.390
Dr Jameson: On actually I just I just sent you two weeks worth so you would have, you're not going to run out between now and Tuesday. If you take extras for a few days. Right.

866
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:18.000
zachariah Giffin: No, but

867
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:33.570
Dr Jameson: But we could send an early prescription for the following week if we needed to and explain that you had, you know, used extra. But you're right. If you don't have to then let's not, but I just want to make sure you have that as the backup all else fails, you can do that.

868
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.760
zachariah Giffin: I'm doing I'm pretty confident with diabetes person.

869
01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.770
zachariah Giffin: Said, I want to be him.

870
01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.510
Dr Jameson: And I said, any

871
01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.360
Dr Jameson: You know gabapentin is a pain reliever too so

872
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.270
Dr Jameson: You have right things there.

873
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:57.870
zachariah Giffin: I'm disappointed when I go and I'm pretty sure. Right. Like, I don't want all my bottom teeth out at once, and maybe dig into half and then the other half another time.

874
01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:06.660
zachariah Giffin: So I think I'm wondering, because really I want my it takes forever to get your partials and stuff. And I want to be able to eat.

875
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.250
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. Yeah.

876
01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:12.990
Dr Jameson: That makes sense. That makes sense to your mouth.

877
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:15.330
zachariah Giffin: Yeah, so

878
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, well thanks for letting me know. Good luck, I hope it goes smoothly.

879
01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:23.580
Dr Jameson: And

880
01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:25.500
Dr Jameson: I'll see you on Tuesday.

881
01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:26.910
zachariah Giffin: All right.

882
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.080
Dr Jameson: I'll see you in touch it.

883
01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:32.850
Dr Jameson: Be in touch. If anything goes really Haywire. Which I don't expect but just in case.

884
01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.530
zachariah Giffin: All right, I will

885
