00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

2
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You got here you got here on time ninja.

3
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.250
cynthia wetzel: Did I did.

4
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.050
cynthia wetzel: Yes.

5
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Very interesting.

6
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I got there.

7
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you

8
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That was so

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted those

10
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.540
cynthia wetzel: Last week, you mentioned it was

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.050
Yes.

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do differently that made that possible.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.890
cynthia wetzel: I'm I just

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.590
cynthia wetzel: stopped for a different time.

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.730
cynthia wetzel: Usually I shoot for like five

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.470
cynthia wetzel: I just got up a little later. And I went to step up a little earlier, you know,

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210
cynthia wetzel: I jumped in the shower, a little earlier. No, I'm still

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
cynthia wetzel: Just push a button and fixing my hair so

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.300
cynthia wetzel: Yeah, I'll shoot for even earlier next time.

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Was your alarm set in the morning differently.

22
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so that's that's the start of it.

23
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's it once you actually got started with that earlier alarm. Everything else moved in long, you know, earlier shower earlier Starbucks run everything was just said earlier, it was the getting started.

24
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes so common that it is just that it makes all the difference is that first getting started.

25
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.660
cynthia wetzel: And

26
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.150
cynthia wetzel: Shooting for a different time.

27
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230
cynthia wetzel: I usually shoot for five to

28
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:31.380
cynthia wetzel: That guarantees, I'll be a little late because they know they have a in the main office. Now, it tells you how long estimated wait time is and it never really takes that long, but it always scares me because it's 10 to 15 minutes

29
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
cynthia wetzel: And I expect them answer within two or three minutes so

30
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So this time you were actually there 15 minutes early, and how did it work out.

31
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.740
cynthia wetzel: The answer was in a minute.

32
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm guessing that they because it's been that 10 to 15 i think that that's how they have the screen.

33
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, yeah, I don't know that it changes. I think

34
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

35
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that that is there set saved. I don't know that it's a really

36
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Odeon sensitive modulation. I think my guess is because I've seen it to people have sent me screenshots because they're like, I'm here, I'm here.

37
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, yeah, I see that. And so I've been able to see and I've never seen it.

38
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.180
cynthia wetzel: 35

39
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, which

40
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is what they're saying clients should be getting in that early

41
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.240
cynthia wetzel: Apparently there's a

42
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty big influx on that might be because services are not able to be as in person. So you can picture bright heart health is a real viable option for people so

43
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.530
cynthia wetzel: Oh, good.

44
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.120
Yeah.

45
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is there anything sort of

46
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You had in mind that you

47
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.170
cynthia wetzel: Know, but I did send you my

48
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.940
cynthia wetzel: I wrote

49
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.850
cynthia wetzel: I finally sent it about 15 minutes ago.

50
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.210
cynthia wetzel: Meant to say that last week.

51
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I did not hear what you said. What did you send

52
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.810
cynthia wetzel: I'm the shame.

53
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.750
cynthia wetzel: It was

54
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.750
cynthia wetzel: It's not, it was not like my normal stuff like usually I tell um

55
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.200
cynthia wetzel: The stuff in my book is all like specific stories of

56
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:37.200
cynthia wetzel: incidents that happened. And then, um, and I don't do a whole lot of reflection or, you know, I'm evaluation or anything like that. So this is totally different in that it's all reflection.

57
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.790
cynthia wetzel: And, um, I just sent it to a bar in it. So I thought that you might appreciate it.

58
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, you, you, you may not like what I'm going to tell you, but these are the facts. I cannot hear everything you're saying

59
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just if you don't have to

60
00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just breathe with me. It's just a reality. I'm not sure what's going on it over there. I have seen 212 I've seen three clients, this morning, and it has not been an issue there is

61
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

62
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.210
cynthia wetzel: I'll tell you what it is.

63
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.220
cynthia wetzel: Okay, um, somebody keeps messing with my settings.

64
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.730
cynthia wetzel: Because other people have been using this computer.

65
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.450
cynthia wetzel: And instead of using internet audio. It said it's using my computer audio.

66
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to play with it.

67
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

68
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.340
cynthia wetzel: Um, so

69
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a rush. I just thought I mentioned, if it's things we can fix them we do if we can't we just

70
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.880
cynthia wetzel: Really important.

71
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I do. I want to hear.

72
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to hear what you're saying. So I'll just, just for a second. I'm gonna look over a note from from last time.

73
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.530
Okay.

74
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.330

cynthia wetzel: I'm Googling it because I don't see it.

76
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I can look something up to should I be looking something up.

77
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.230
cynthia wetzel: Yeah, um,

78
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.780
cynthia wetzel: I just want to know how to switch it to

79
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.710
cynthia wetzel: Using internet audio instead of

80
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.140
cynthia wetzel: My computer audio.

81
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.440

111
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But they do not override the settings you choose. I don't see anything about internet though.

159
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the reason we want your name if you're sitting in the waiting room and it says TZ as the 4444444 and I say, Cindy in there. They'll say, yeah.

160
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

161
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to have that name there.

162
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.850
cynthia wetzel: Somehow it got changed to Cindy.

163
00:12:52.590 --> 00:13:00.810
cynthia wetzel: Cindy w. So now when I sign in and I can change it. And I think it's fine to um

164
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.380
cynthia wetzel: To get to their names when they're being in but for summary my

165
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:18.480
cynthia wetzel: Actual like the name that pops up and shows up is Cindy Wu, and I'm like, it's that's never my name. So it's been the away but yeah

166
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now it's all lowercase Cynthia Wessel

167
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Okay, I just say

168
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:23.910
cynthia wetzel: Yes.

Gwenevere Abriel: It's 15 minutes after

170
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at your time. Take a look at that. This is your time.

171
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.380
Yeah.

172
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So tune in to you. You noticed earlier. Some irritation and you shared what those things were

173
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were seeing and hearing me just fine.

174
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are irritated. Was it because I was having to ask a couple of times. Was it that I was quite well make sure, go, go. Nice and slow.

175
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you have been irritated if I never said anything. And I just

176
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.550
cynthia wetzel: I probably would have been confused because I would have been like, why

177
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.650
cynthia wetzel: Why can't she hear me.

178
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.890
cynthia wetzel: I don't want to show my nightstand. It's very messy.

179
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:29.070
cynthia wetzel: I'm not annoyed with you I'm annoyed with Tim asked him not to touch the Settings.

180
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.450
cynthia wetzel: I've asked him a couple times that such this and he

181
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.370
cynthia wetzel: Seems to not give a shit.

182
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You see this

183
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.130
cynthia wetzel: I like that. Very good, though.

184
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.570
cynthia wetzel: Yes, I always do that.

185
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you just do that with Tegan

186
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.100
cynthia wetzel: I assume that he doesn't give a shit and I'm

187
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:17.250
cynthia wetzel: Actually might very well give a shit. I'm, I'm assuming a lot in saying that

188
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:21.750
Yeah.

189
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the first time that you felt like someone in your life doesn't give a shit.

190
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: About what you think and feel we've worked. Let's do it. Come on.

191
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.490
cynthia wetzel: Form. When I was little, obviously.

192
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get a specific image in line.

193
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory how old you were, what you doing, who was around

194
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.290
cynthia wetzel: Okay.

195
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.480
You got one.

196
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.660
cynthia wetzel: Oh, yeah.

197
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something you want to share. You'd rather just hold it in your working awareness.

198
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.010
cynthia wetzel: Pauses hold it in my awareness.

199
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.670
Okay.

200
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you believe about yourself in that memory. What's the I Am, what

201
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.570
cynthia wetzel: I don't, man.

202
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't matter.

203
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the negative cognition and what would you like to thought about yourself back then.

204
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.690
cynthia wetzel: Um,

205
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.700
cynthia wetzel: Maybe my mom was just busy with something else.

206
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.070
cynthia wetzel: That

207
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.600
cynthia wetzel: I do matter.

208
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I matter.

209
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.750
cynthia wetzel: Yeah I matter. I mean,

210
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there would be evidence to support that belief you look around and you say, Look at that. Look at this. See, I'm matter.

211
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When I work a little bit more around those two

212
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to assess the self.

213
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: As I am

214
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A positive belief about the self back them. What would that sentence be I am what

215
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.420
cynthia wetzel: I am worthy.

216
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.680
cynthia wetzel: I wouldn't have known what that meant, though, so

217
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:35.970
cynthia wetzel: Okay.

218
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.710
I'm worthy. I am

219
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative cognition. I don't matter is I am what back then I am

220
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.940
cynthia wetzel: Important

221
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm unimportant.

222
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.230
cynthia wetzel: Important

223
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going back to the negative one. I'm I'm moving

224
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.300
cynthia wetzel: I said important I am

225
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.170
cynthia wetzel: Important

226
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

227
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you did.

228
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.990
cynthia wetzel: Is it negative

229
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.010
cynthia wetzel: Know some negative

230
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, but I am going back to the other negative one, I'm going

231
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Back and I'm shifting that one. Just a little, just a tiny little tiny little shift want to go to the I don't matter one, the one that was fun in that that memory that you have in your mind right now.

232
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The I don't matter.

233
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what is the I Am statement with that one. The belief about the self.

234
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't, when you looked around and you're like, I don't matter. Clearly, look at the seven and see how they're treating me I don't matter. I don't matter. I don't matter. What's the I Am. What did you believe about yourself back then.

235
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.530
cynthia wetzel: What would I like to

236
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

237
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.870
cynthia wetzel: What did I believe that I am worthless.

238
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have a set

239
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.070
cynthia wetzel: On an

240
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: unimportant. Yeah, yeah. So I'm going to

241
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold on to this, this worthless piece here.

242
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have the setup for the am Dr. You already have too tall kind of objects on either side of your phone or on your device.

243
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.100
cynthia wetzel: Know, should I put some on either side of my toys.

244
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, you're on the laptop right

247
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool. And we'll just do that. I'll just, I'll just point to the left and right, your screen and then all you need to do is look left and right.

248
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how how distressed. Are you right now as you're thinking about that that earlier imagery of

249
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.790
cynthia wetzel: Kind of distressed like

250
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.680
cynthia wetzel: What's the scale.

251
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, zero to 100 maybe give it a number somewhere zero to 100

252
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.070
cynthia wetzel: Liga 30

253
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you've got this memory, what should we call this memory if I ever want to bring us back to her, just to refer to that image or that memory, what do I call it

254
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.840
I'm

255
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.480
cynthia wetzel: Carla being Carla.

256
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Are looking Carla Okay, got it.

257
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So go to that pull up that WORST piece.

258
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That image, the worst.

259
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of that memory.

260
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then hold hold on to that negative cognition of I am worthless.

261
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you want to if you want to on your own. You're more than welcome to integrate

262
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Your resource team, you can bring Jim Shaughnessy

263
00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sally. Okay, Bob. There you can bring them in on your own. But right now I want to do. What would be some desensitization.

264
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.840
Okay.

265
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So all you'll be doing is looking at the the the corner as I'm pointing. You don't have to stop and look at me, you'll just be looking left and right at the pace that I said, which you can kind of look through your peripheral vision. Okay.

266
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go.

267
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.950
cynthia wetzel: I'm not looking at the

268
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.120
The same

269
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not looking at me know you're going to cut my finger and appointed the left and right.

270
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your screen.

271
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

272
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The pace isn't going to change unless I say it.

273
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't don't feel like you have to change the pace. Once you get in a groove you'll kind of know whether my fingers still moving in your hear my voice, sort of, say,

274
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together or I might say what's coming up for you right now. And then that's what I mean it really want to know right then what was going on.

275
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here we go. You want to pull up the worst part of that memory, pull it up into your working awareness.

276
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and hold on to that negative belief about yourself of I am worthless. This is going to be a kind of a fast iteration. Just look at the corners of your screen, left and right.

277
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just moving your eyes. If it's strange, your eyes and sit back, just an inch

278
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want him straight

279
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing great.

280
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together, inhale through the nose deep belly breath.

281
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, slowly out the mouth.

282
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you get all go

283
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: On in your mind go blank for even a beat.

284
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then tuning in to see what comes up.

285
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As you notice,

286
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.490
cynthia wetzel: That a lot

287
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that.

288
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just your eyes. Make sure they're not overstrained

289
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

290
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can get that air down in the belly, not just up top.

291
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness alive.

292
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.940
Keep breathing.

293
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Out the mouth.

294
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go letting the mind just rest.

295
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: For even the briefest of a beat.

296
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up.

297
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.050
cynthia wetzel: I'm that I that

298
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:51.480
cynthia wetzel: Feel that a lot. And then I'm then look to other people to make me feel okay about myself and I think a lot of times boys like

299
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.250
cynthia wetzel: Both

300
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.970
cynthia wetzel: did make me feel better about myself.

301
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to go with that. So hold up hold that worst image pull that up.

302
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

303
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the eyes moving try to put your face center. Right, right, and center. The screen just your eyes, going left and right.

304
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To agree.

305
