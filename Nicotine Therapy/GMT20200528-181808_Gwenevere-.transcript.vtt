00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.700

Joshua Lopez: forever to get in.

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.620
Joshua Lopez: I was on

4
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:36.900
Joshua Lopez: waiting forever to get into the clinic virtual clinic and then they sent me to a breakout room that we did another like 1012 minutes and then the new guy Tony and it kind of took him a while to get rejected.

5
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's, it sounds like there's new staff.

6
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.880
Joshua Lopez: So I apologize. I kind of should have checked in earlier, too. So, um,

7
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.390
Joshua Lopez: I know I should have checked into

8
00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, you're here now. Let's not spend too much more time apologizing. We're okay. We're all right. But let me just see how you're doing now. Okay.

9
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this one of those weekends, where your kids aren't around

10
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.240
Joshua Lopez: Not here and then right before I came to zoom

11
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.430
Joshua Lopez: I posted a little post and my son last night.

12
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.080
Joshua Lopez: You know it's missing them. So I posted a little posted him celebrating and

13
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.360
Joshua Lopez: You know, he's got something really super rare on the game. It was super cool. He was jumping around excited

14
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:40.200
Joshua Lopez: And I woke up this morning and my ex brother in law who we still talk. We've been cool this whole time.

15
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.490
Joshua Lopez: He posted. You know, he's like oh wow, is this before, after, you barricaded my sister in a room.

16
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And

17
00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:01.800
Joshua Lopez: Just like came at me. So I text him and I you know I tried to just wasn't trying to art him. I just was like, hey man, you have every right to feel this way. If you're going to come at me.

18
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.760
Joshua Lopez: Do so, on the tax, not on a not on a positive post, you know, to mean is like I've made tons of mistakes when it comes to your sister and I, you know,

19
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:31.110
Joshua Lopez: I'm trying to make excuses. I'm just depressed and you know this was that time I told you where the got a bit physical I was trying to talk to her. She kept like pushing kicking and i just i didn't hit her. But I did try to like talk to her, and

20
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.310
Joshua Lopez: You know, it's not something I'm very proud of.

21
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.300
Joshua Lopez: You know, it's, it is what it is.

22
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.220
Joshua Lopez: You know,

23
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.650
Joshua Lopez: Then he texts text back and you said some really

24
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.920
Joshua Lopez: 848 for stuff and

25
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.680
Joshua Lopez: I just text back like you're right, you know, it just, you're right. I don't have an excuse. I just the right, you know, um,

26
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.220
Joshua Lopez: And I make these mistakes spurs.

27
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.910
Joshua Lopez: I beat myself up pretty bad over them. And I know just

28
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

29
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: just tired. I know.

30
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But Josh what

31
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You were feeling desperate.

32
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever that event was and you haven't told me what it was you behave in a desperate way to try to communicate.

33
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.080
The time

34
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you weren't nasty back in these messages back to your, your brother in law. You weren't you are humble and you have you have that to be proud of right now, but

35
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I

36
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any, are you pacing because you're nervous.

37
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.960
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I'm just

38
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.000
Joshua Lopez: Okay, really just

39
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.750
Tired.

40
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And to get through this. We're going to get through this. Because that this intensity

41
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact having the worst behavior that you had to engage in. It's not lost and forgotten. It was thrown in your face in a public way and it's humiliating. It's embarrassing. And it's feeling all the sharpness of that discomfort, but it will pass Joshua, I can promise you that.

42
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can plot me down somewhere just so mine.

43
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.230
Joshua Lopez: I'm sorry, I'm like, seriously, I'm just

44
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.450
Joshua Lopez: Like on it right now.

45
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.890
Joshua Lopez: So honored

46
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here. I'm glad you you made here and you, you had to wait in that waiting room. We're going to get through this. Okay. We will. But I've got a suggestion for you.

47
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua, one of the reasons why this is so intense. I'm guessing is because you may have never told another human

48
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: May have never told anyone the ugly thing that you did.

49
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's any trust here. The catharsis, the letting go really owning whatever it is that you said, I've done ugly things, but I tell another I tell and it's done the shame dissolves.

50
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing my clients do short of hurting a child right

51
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, murder, whatever hurting and elderly that I'm going to report.

52
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about you.

53
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Owning the fact that you are desperate and you needed to communicate something with your wife. If you tell another human and I'm that human. I think this intensity that you're feeling right now is going to go down.

54
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it off your chest, say, the ugly stuff get it over with. Tell me.

55
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.430
Joshua Lopez: This

56
00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You held her in a room don't hide from it, own it and be done with it. There's nothing I haven't heard

57
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.110
Joshua Lopez: But just that they went to pick up the kids.

58
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.480
Joshua Lopez: And I just

59
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.570
Joshua Lopez: When I'm around her, or in the house. They just get so

60
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.570
Joshua Lopez: I get like this anxiety.

61
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.080
Joshua Lopez: And

62
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:32.250
Joshua Lopez: You know I've done a lot for her. Despite everything I've tried to be there for her. I was in a lot of pain.

63
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:42.900
Joshua Lopez: Right shoulder was killing me. And I said, Hey, would you do me a quick favor five minutes just even if it's a half ass elbow to the back or something just

64
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:53.430
Joshua Lopez: You know President real quick and she's that opportunity to be like, you know, we're not together, so I don't have to do stuff like that for you.

65
00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:07.740
Joshua Lopez: You know, we don't do this, you know, it's over. And it's done really bad and I was like okay well you know your your new guy must have you pretty

66
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.870
Joshua Lopez: Pretty you know

67
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.560
Joshua Lopez: Then of course that offended her and we started arguing and

68
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.670
Joshua Lopez: The last thing I wanted to do was to argue with her like

69
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

70
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.300
Joshua Lopez: It's in the more she pushed the more I just wanted to try and make it right before I left, and of course

71
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.740
Joshua Lopez: Of course, I just took it too far and

72
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:51.900
Joshua Lopez: I was trying to hold on to her and just like stop. Let's talk, please. Let's just talk, please. It's not please and I pulled him onto her and she started speaking her forearm into my neck and I'm literally like being choked by it.

73
00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:02.580
Joshua Lopez: And I'm like, please stop choking me and she's like, Well, just let go and I'm at this point where she has so much pressure on my neck that I let go. I'm gonna go flying back so

74
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.430
Joshua Lopez: The better is right there tossed around the bed and she started kicking the crap out of me and

75
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.370
Joshua Lopez: Just, just remember her screaming. We're done. We're over. We're done. We're over.

76
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.250
Joshua Lopez: And I just

77
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.240
Joshua Lopez: Knew I knew when the arguments started to escalate. I guy.

78
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:38.100
Joshua Lopez: I like the outer body body experience. I just stop and leave just up and leave. You're going to make it worse. You're making it worse. And I just kept making it worse.

79
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.950
Joshua Lopez: And

80
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.650
Joshua Lopez: As usual, I just made more mistakes. I just made things worse.

81
00:08:50.940 --> 00:09:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Name. I'm Joshua, you're going to be done. They'll be done once you say ugly thing that you can't stand that you did will be done. I'm telling you, it's going to feel say the ugly thing. You don't want to tell me

82
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. You tell me how it escalated. I'm still going to care for you and you will still be a good man. After you tell me

83
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.490
Joshua Lopez: Bring kind of explaining

84
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:29.910
Joshua Lopez: My recollection of it. I know when I brought up like Oh, your, your new man must have your law if you can even, like, do me this favor and that's kind of what sparked it

85
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.480
Joshua Lopez: And I should have never have

86
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:42.510
Joshua Lopez: Never have tried to keep her talking to me, just trying to walk away and I, the more she pushed the more I just wanted to

87
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.150
Joshua Lopez: Was desperate. I just wanted to talk to her.

88
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.630
Joshua Lopez: Older, you know, that was wrong and no

89
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.740
Joshua Lopez: This has been

90
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:12.990
Joshua Lopez: month and a half ago, and I had been talking to a brother in law since then, but this morning. It just came out. So I'm just kind of wondering like why did this come up now and it mean like

91
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: After thrown on the bed. How did it continue to escalate when she was kicking

92
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.210
Joshua Lopez: It.

93
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.880
Joshua Lopez: At that point, after I caught a few to the chest. I just

94
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:38.010
Joshua Lopez: yelled out, you know, everything I've ever done. This is, this is how you treat me you know you're hurting somebody who's only intentions were good into love you.

95
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.310
Joshua Lopez: And and I walked out

96
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.320
Joshua Lopez: And

97
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:56.700
Joshua Lopez: Then she walked out and I just was pleading like please just. We don't want to leave like this, please. And she got him on a screen where you're over. We're done.

98
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:07.200
Joshua Lopez: Then I walked out and I had a cup in my hand of Dr. Pepper soda can and just through it and I left.

99
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So what the brother, my brother in law's name.

100
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.060
Joshua Lopez: DJ

101
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can call him. It's a lot shorter to call someone by a name so so DJ. So he got a version of that story right but

102
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:39.300
Joshua Lopez: I assume, and it must have been like either last night or this morning has happened like a month and a half ago, and we have been chatting like nothing, then this morning I wake up and he has that comment on on it, you know.

103
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.410
So,

104
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did it. You've, you've told me the ugliest piece of that memory. Is that right,

105
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.910
Joshua Lopez: I believe so. I mean,

106
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.680
Joshua Lopez: I try not to hide anything because I know it'd be selling myself short

107
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know this isn't it. But notice how it feels to have said it all.

108
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's out

109
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Person. This really this awful thing that happened. Okay. And I'm not going anywhere. I'm still right here. I don't mind how I feel about you hasn't changed what I think about your husband changed nothing has changed.

110
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.730
OK.

111
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's go to imagine how the story might have been

112
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Having been held

113
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When she doesn't want to

114
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Work a backache out. She doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore, but then against her will, having been held, you were brave enough to talk about your truth. Just put yourself in her shoes. We won't stay there for maybe like two minutes.

115
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine the story. She would tell of I don't want to be here and I don't want to be

116
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: In this relationship. I don't want to be in your arms and you're forcing me to be in your arms. I don't want to have to talk to you. I'm being forced against my will, just for a second. Have you ever felt like you were trapped

117
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.240
Joshua Lopez: Do I do

118
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. That's it. You were desperate you trapped her because she's smaller you wanted to be heard you wanted to be understood, you wanted your good intentions to be communicated

119
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a mistake. You already know that's a mistake because you're males tend to be stronger than females. And so from her perspective, it was he used maybe his physical strength to force his need to be heard and understood is that a possibility that she may see it that way.

120
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Okay.

121
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you live with that.

122
00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it happened.

123
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it happened.

124
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.590
Joshua Lopez: But no, I know.

125
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I look good, man.

126
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still a good man. You think that humans aren't desperate and we don't we don't grab the very thing. We love the most, that we say, Please don't leave I I'm not ready. I don't want it.

127
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are still a good man.

128
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You made a mistake when you were desperate you

129
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:31.800
Know,

130
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's today or next month. I don't know when. But you do need to and you did a beautiful job responding to him saying you owned it. You owned it.

131
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And said, I did right I made a mistake. I shouldn't have done that it couldn't have been any better on Facebook. It couldn't have been any better. And you would have protected your sister, the same way.

132
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, everybody's doing the best they can.

133
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing that's happening right now. This is going to move on and it's going to go back to just

134
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have my kids around and I wasn't ready to let go with this relationship because that's at the core of this

135
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Am I right.

136
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.200
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, absolutely.

137
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.220
Yeah.

138
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We all make desperate. We don't

139
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We when we're drowning Joshua, the person that is rescuing us from the ocean. We are drowning them with us like this clamoring for our own life, pulling them under, you know that right

140
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we want to rescue them from behind. So they don't drown us

141
00:15:50.040 --> 00:16:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we want to rescue them. But we know they're desperate to live. We're going to pull them down because dying, we're not thinking rationally.

142
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I will do anything to live. And that's what real desperation is cannot see what is going on, it's just life or death. And for you I having her really leave and go felt like a little, a little death.

143
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.300
Joshua Lopez: Does every, every single time.

144
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.080
Joshua Lopez: They just

145
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.850
Joshua Lopez: It's just tiring and exhausting. I just

146
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.160
Joshua Lopez: A look like

147
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.750
Joshua Lopez: When does it feel like again do it anymore.

148
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.820
Joshua Lopez: You just hurt. So what's already

149
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.540
Joshua Lopez: You gotta get tired.

150
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.650
Joshua Lopez: Tired of all of this.

151
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If your kids were there now, though, would it be

152
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think

153
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.530
Joshua Lopez: Little but even the past couple weeks a bear with me just

154
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.730
Joshua Lopez: I just have shut down. I just

155
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I think they just they're more. Okay. I think you're going to need because you're forgetting that you're, you're a loving good, man. You're forgetting about you, you're focused on the loss as if a piece of you is gone. I think you ready preoccupied with that.

156
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.310
Joshua Lopez: All the time. Yeah, all the time.

157
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But it isn't true.

158
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:32.790
You're right.

159
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You just

160
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.310
Joshua Lopez: Go.

161
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.920
Joshua Lopez: With her. I just

162
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.160
Joshua Lopez: Always just

163
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.910
Joshua Lopez: Just always

164
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.300
Joshua Lopez: Always thought I started a family.

165
00:17:49.410 --> 00:18:02.130
Joshua Lopez: So would grow old with that person. I would see my kids every day and it just is so foreign to me that I just like what bodies just rejecting it every time I tried to

166
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:11.610
Joshua Lopez: Use the tools that we learn. They work sometimes, and other times they just like I just I can't crawl out of this feeling

167
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.320
Joshua Lopez: That work, it's just

168
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't get okay

169
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting your work to you're not quite

170
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.120
Joshua Lopez: It's it's work, it's everywhere right now.

171
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:37.200
Joshua Lopez: In like a good moment. I feel like this. Like I just it's every day all day. It's just exhausting.

172
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you losing sleep too.

173
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.820
Oh, yeah.

174
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.790
Joshua Lopez: Big time. You

175
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Want

176
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: For a period of time to to add on to what we're doing. I think we should meet weekly until this you're over this piece of the grief and then you may also consider medication to are you on any antidepressant.

177
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.460
Joshua Lopez: No, I mean, the doctor prescribed a mild one for my smoking and

178
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.360
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I haven't really been taking it lately I've been

179
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I, can I see it is available and maybe we can have a once we've kind of done the behavioral health part and see if we can get her to console.

180
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, are you getting so bad that you're like, I want out. I want to die. I don't want to live anymore. You getting there.

181
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Joshua, no. Oh, honey.

182
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so it's

183
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad. Okay.

184
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, that's, that's not regular grief. That's something really going on here. And I think let's take, let's take a full

185
00:19:50.250 --> 00:20:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: full force approach to this and let's get some medication involved here and really touching base with me as often as you can. Okay, what I want you to hurt yourself, sweetheart. What is the thought that's going on in that head over and over

186
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.330
Joshua Lopez: I believe this is happening. I

187
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't believe it's happening.

188
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

189
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

190
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all right. I thought I would spend the rest of my life. I thought it would grow old with the old

191
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: People will grandkids. That's not happening. The way you pictured it

192
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It will be something else. But the image you had it won't be. It won't be

193
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua, it may not have been that even though you were together. We don't know the future.

194
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we don't

195
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're grieving an expectation and it's painful.

196
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't actually know how it would have gone

197
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

198
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.690
Joshua Lopez: Thought of her with another man.

199
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.960
Joshua Lopez: Eat me alive.

200
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.670
Joshua Lopez: Mission shouldn't be that way with

201
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.860
Joshua Lopez: Me so

202
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.790
Joshua Lopez: It really does.

203
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:31.620
So,

204
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: These ideas that I'm going to invite a pretty radical. Okay, do you think, do you think that you love Jacqueline as much as you love your children.

205
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.250
Joshua Lopez: I do

206
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.160
Joshua Lopez: Love my children, very much and

207
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.030
Joshua Lopez: Always this

208
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.170
Joshua Lopez: Might sound weird, but I i do i love them all. They were, you know, all three of them were like my baby.

209
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:17.730
Joshua Lopez: I love those little guys. So pretty much, it almost feels like I lost one of them, you know, yeah, I can tell.

210
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When going somewhere with it. Okay. If you love Jacqueline, the same way that you said I love these. These children.

211
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Children, typically we define our love for our children as on conditional. There's nothing. These children can do that. I would stop loving them.

212
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I might not like them today because they're being spoiled brats. I might not like that. I'm feeling and patient and they're just being a kid, but I will always love them. Would you say that's true for your children.

213
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's immovable that needle doesn't move the love stays there. Well, whether we like what they're doing that changes, but we love them. Right.

214
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it meant that their happiness.

215
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: did not include you we say it again if it meant that there, they would be happy and successful in their life, but that would not include you they were allergic to use for some weird disease that they contracted

216
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you stay away from them, so they could be happy.

217
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you want them to be happy.

218
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, they want that for you to

219
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We all want that for you. That same love that you have for those children.

220
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: They

221
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They want that for you to. We all do. It's that unconditional. It's there. It exists, it didn't go anywhere.

222
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For Jacqueline if what you just said is true for her. If it doesn't include you

223
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be time to let her go. So she can be happy and skin his skin one penis one vagina. It's still skin and I know, I know, I know.

224
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: lovemaking and all that stuff is very precious, I get it, I get it, I get it. But if you love her unconditionally. Then you just want her to be happy. And if it doesn't include you then it doesn't

225
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the big radical thing that I'm inviting today is like

226
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to be happy. It just happens to not be with me for whatever reason the recipe.

227
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

228
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's if there's something that really pierced. These last two weeks that really shifted it because you've been

229
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of making your way you've had a progression through this grief, you've been moving through it. You've been doing it. See if there's something that happened over like two weeks ago, or it's maybe been piling up. I heard the piece of of

230
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: DJ, and what else has kind of been going on.

231
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.000
Joshua Lopez: But what is it go

232
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:52.260
Joshua Lopez: Show it shows up as a suggested friend because we have like 15 mutual friends she always pops up as a mutual friend.

233
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.970
Joshua Lopez: Her profile has always been privates on this. You're a friend of hers. You can't see your post

234
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.120
Joshua Lopez: The other day

235
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.490
Joshua Lopez: I saw a new picture of her that you know her profile pic changed.

236
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

237
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.710
Joshua Lopez: Clicked on it.

238
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.640
Joshua Lopez: And it opened up her profile and all the sudden her profile was in private, and I

239
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.960
Joshua Lopez: It's my better judgment. I started scrolling through it.

240
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.440
Joshua Lopez: Oh, and it just

241
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We just tortured yourself.

242
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.520
Joshua Lopez: I did.

243
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. Sure, dead.

244
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah I know cuz it. You still haven't quite gotten it. You say,

245
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be the big painful this is over. You're still not they're

246
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not they're

247
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Happening.

248
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.210
Joshua Lopez: It seemed like there's a guy on there that

249
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.540
Joshua Lopez: She's probably seeing and it just destroyed me. Yeah.

250
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

251
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.610
Joshua Lopez: That destroyed me and I don't even know if it's true, it just

252
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.400
Joshua Lopez: It does seem like it though, you know,

253
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.810
Joshua Lopez: I don't on it asked her, I don't want to

254
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.290
Joshua Lopez: I don't want to know.

255
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already made up your mind that you're already doing the hurting, as if it's true. You know, you've already hurting over it. You're getting yourself ready for that information.

256
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting right up close to the worst thing that you can do. And that's take your wife Joshua

257
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're just about to get it.

258
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's either you move on or it's going to take your life and your children's father

259
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.940
Joshua Lopez: Because the only thing that has kept me from doing it.

260
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you fathom that your son might go through this heartache.

261
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you think he would

262
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna hurt to

263
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone's got through this heart. We all go through this. I'm not talking about, there's a big there's a big heartbreak. I get that.

264
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to tell them, the only way out is just to die.

265
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the message. You'll leave us the legacy

266
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not enough that you have to have someone else you're no good unless you have this other thing. That's the message you leave behind.

267
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not true.

268
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.410
Joshua Lopez: The first time I've ever said that out loud.

269
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a big one. That's why I asked it because I'm seeing something in you that looks. Looks pretty sad.

270
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

271
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.510
Joshua Lopez: Okay, right now.

272
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.060
Joshua Lopez: Really, yeah.

273
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.130
Joshua Lopez: Phil

274
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.010
Joshua Lopez: Phil exhausted.

275
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The exhaustion adds more risk, right, because then we're really not thinking straight. I definitely think you need to sleep. I definitely think that we need to seem see each other more often in here so you can remember. Oh, yeah. I not just that worst thought

276
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Life does go on. You just know yet. You keep projecting into this future that doesn't exist, and you can't imagine another life and my right, you can't picture. It can't picture. It can't picture. It can't picture and again and again and again and again.

277
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there. It's there.

Joshua Lopez: Since she's ugly. You're just not attracted in that way.

289
00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.430

307
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.650
Joshua Lopez: And that's one of the reasons why we hung out because she went through it.

308
00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.900
Joshua Lopez: I honestly

309
00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:03.210
Joshua Lopez: Just I honestly wanted to keep it as friends. I really did.

310
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.820
Joshua Lopez: I just, I feel a little bad because

311
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:10.950
Joshua Lopez: You know, I don't

312
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.150
Joshua Lopez: I don't wanna. I don't want to hurt people. You know,

313
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What these are hard Joshua those navigation. So we have dinner where it's we're so close to crossing and we had a drink and it looks just like a date, doesn't it looks just like

314
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll deal with that, we'll deal with it. There's what, you know, but it's just she knows all the story she knows the story. It's nothing different than what you told me I I am so longing for touch to be held.

315
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so lonely.

316
00:33:50.670 --> 00:34:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That I risked our friendship and I'm I can we go back to the way we were, how do you feel about that Evelyn. Did I just hurt you. Did I mislead you. I'm so sorry that if I did I want our friendship back, it means so much to me. You can say those things if you want

317
00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

318
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She may have some of that too. She may be on on the I took advantage of you.

319
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so nobody's perfect. This is a mass

320
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Hysteria frickin circus and you are going to just to hold on tight to this rollercoaster as best you can. There's no PRETTY WAY TO DO IT. The makeup is going to smear, you're gonna vomit, the writer last 10 minutes longer than you wanted it to. And you just hold on and it will and

321
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It will

322
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

323
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:04.290
Joshua Lopez: Then you know I did feel a little guilty that I enjoyed it. I mean,

324
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.620
Joshua Lopez: It was

325
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.300
Joshua Lopez: It went a lot further than I would have hoped.

326
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.470
Joshua Lopez: But it just felt

327
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.250
Joshua Lopez: It felt good to be wanted it to be touched. It felt good to

328
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:29.070
Joshua Lopez: It is I'm not that attracted you are in that way, but I just

329
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.190
Joshua Lopez: I just, I felt like

330
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:34.500
Joshua Lopez: I needed it.

331
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:45.180
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it's been a really long time that but just the physical sex partner but just the somebody you know

332
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.610
Joshua Lopez: Oh, did your are were

333
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.850
Joshua Lopez: rubbing their fingers on your chest. It just, it's been a really long time.

334
00:35:54.510 --> 00:36:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure you are not only are humans do we need touch but you are an affectionate person I've listened to the to hand holding and things that I've heard in past stories.

335
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. The meaning that you've given sex in the past. It doesn't have to be the meaning here okay was two people that consented, and you

336
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Want maybe we don't even know what she needed from it. So what this is what you wanted needed you needed it will deal with the outcome as it as it happens. So, okay.

337
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not an old person because you took advantage of this opportunity DOESN'T MEAN YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER. SHE DIDN'T RAPE her. She wanted it.

338
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.370
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

339
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to have fun with this body of yours, it's your body

340
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.580
Joshua Lopez: Honestly, was

341
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.390
Joshua Lopez: kind of shocked. Like, what the heck is going on.

342
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's right. You're still alive.

343
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It feel good to feel good for a second, doesn't it.

344
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.230
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

345
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To be a whole big sex means we're getting married and it's love and it doesn't have to be all of that, it can be. This is what happened. This is how I felt. And you can touch base with Evelyn. How long has it been, how many days have passed since you've had a chance to process it with her.

346
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.370
Of

347
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.760
Joshua Lopez: What's today, Thursday.

348
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

349
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.760
Joshua Lopez: SO THIS HAPPENED TUESDAY NIGHT.

350
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:42.570
Joshua Lopez: Tuesday night and you know we text a bit yesterday text this morning.

351
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:53.520
Joshua Lopez: You know cuz that's what I was really just trying to get from it was just, it was nice. Somebody say hey how's your day going, or a house or, you know, like that.

352
00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:05.130
Joshua Lopez: Was really all I was trying for because it's just, I've been lonely, you know, my phone's not blowing up. I'm not Mr.

353
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.740
Joshua Lopez: gigolo, you know, I'm not out looking for tons of women. I just

354
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're participating in that Josh. You know that, right, you're not putting yourself out there.

355
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.630
Joshua Lopez: You know I

356
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.350
Joshua Lopez: I've tried, but with this whole Corona T. There's

357
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.690
Joshua Lopez: No, it's just, it feels really hopeless, at times, because

358
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand why this is the perfect time for online dating. I don't understand why does it feel hopeless.

359
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.390
Joshua Lopez: I've tried that I've

360
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.730
Joshua Lopez: Actually got a couple of apps. But it's just

361
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.910
Joshua Lopez: A never, I never have success on it.

362
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.650
Joshua Lopez: I don't know. I'm just and then that kind of

363
00:38:50.790 --> 00:39:02.190
Joshua Lopez: plays a part in this because it's like wow three apps and you still have it linked with anybody. You know, like, are you not good looking. Are you not attractive you know

364
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's just the time. What if it's not that. What if it's your look at how still attached to Jacqueline, you are. Would that be fair to someone really right now.

365
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope. So let's be honest with the universe. Maybe it's God, I don't know, but let's just say it's the universe. Maybe it's just saying, dude.

366
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it together before you break someone else's heart. What if someone falls in love, like, you know, like

367
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's that. Why can't it be that story, instead of you're not attractive like that isn't true. So that's not a fact, no. So what if it's this. You're just you're still grieving the timing now right anyway.

368
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.540
Joshua Lopez: Possibly. Possibly. I just, you know, with

369
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.590
Joshua Lopez: With everything being rejected and being

370
00:39:54.390 --> 00:40:09.990
Joshua Lopez: In the position. I'm in it is easy to believe that maybe you know maybe I'm not good looking anymore, you know, not that I ever thought I was great looking but you know definitely have faded some pretty women in my life and I just can't seem to do it now.

371
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:12.990
Joshua Lopez: You know, and

372
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.390
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it just

373
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:17.880
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

374
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:29.520
Joshua Lopez: My friend now that I talked to came and hung out and he knows. I've been hanging out with Evelyn, and he's always giving me crap like, oh, you know,

375
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:38.550
Joshua Lopez: You guys are going to end up hooking up this and that. I'm like, No, dude, I'm keeping a strictly friend, keeping the strictly friends and then this thing happened and

376
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:48.900
Joshua Lopez: He came over, yesterday I to see my new apartment for the first time and it just, I felt like I am not one day like going kiss and tell. But I just felt like

377
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:59.040
Joshua Lopez: I had to tell somebody. And I said, well, you call it, dude. It ended up happening. And then he gave me stuff because she's somebody that we knew, since we were in middle school.

378
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:07.710
Joshua Lopez: And he's like, you know, dude. You should have known this was coming because she's probably had a crush on you, since middle school.

379
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.890
Joshua Lopez: Yeah and now you're giving her attention and you're hanging out with her like

380
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.600
Joshua Lopez: You should have known unit. I mean, and there was like, I honestly just

381
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.020
Joshua Lopez: Hundred percent honestly just

382
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:30.270
Joshua Lopez: Thought we could be friends. You know, like I just, I see other people that have friends that are opposite sex and

383
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.790
Joshua Lopez: Their friends. You know, like

384
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.490
Joshua Lopez: That maybe I could have that, but

385
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you see what you did you over generalize. I thought I could have that. No, no, no, not with Evelyn, she may have had a crush with you since since middle school. So you pick one to fulfill the prophecy of I can never have we pick someone who already had a crush on you forever.

386
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, you can have friends. I mean, that are opposite sex and pens, on which movie, you've seen, but it is challenging because sometimes there is one person has an attraction in the other doesn't. So it is it's it's tricky to navigate

387
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:19.560
Joshua Lopez: And if I'm being honest. This was not the first time that I attempted everything that was a girl in it was the same way.

388
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:33.330
Joshua Lopez: Girl wanna I took her out for her birthday. We shared common interest, I've known her since she since before school and we were little. We went to the same church our families know each other.

389
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.350
Joshua Lopez: And the same thing. She made a move on me and

390
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:46.440
Joshua Lopez: I'm like, I'm not trying to, like, I'm not ready to do this yet. I just wanted company.

391
00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.160
Yeah.

392
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.540
Joshua Lopez: So I stopped talking to her because

393
00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.420
Joshua Lopez: You know, I guess it's challenging, like you said, it's

394
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, but that's not a reflection of you that's no reason to go to all never have it, it just the particular recipe of people that she keep keep trying it. You know, so, so I will tell you from out here. There's, there's this sort of message going on, which is I think you want someone

395
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Who reaches out to you that cares about how your day was just pure and simple and it's fundamental that there's people out there that just kind of want to say hey how's your day.

396
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wish your mother had it together to do that.

397
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How is this so that you have a mother that doesn't see how much pain you're in this is relevant people's

398
00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Caregivers affect how we are today. Why don't we have a, you know, I don't know. Your mom history, very much, but I think she has some narcissistic tendencies, where she sort of just redirects everything back to herself to herself to herself, is that right

399
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.100
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, you

400
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.020
Joshua Lopez: Haven't talked to her in two and a half, almost three

401
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What is that that's. Do you ever think about that, that the piece that's missing is that the piece that early piece is I I needed this nurturing in the sense of mother being there when I was younger. I'm still looking for it now.

402
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.870
Joshua Lopez: It's kind of painful.

403
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.090
Joshua Lopez: But at the same time, I don't

404
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:53.760
Joshua Lopez: Feel like I've been wronged. And I'm always the one apologizing. And I'm always the one to bridge the gap that I'm not

405
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.150
Joshua Lopez: Ready to do that with her yet no

406
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I don't. Yeah, I remember the story we you think you slept in your car for a hot second right

407
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't, I don't remember you doing anything that was off. I think

408
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this is a probably a long history of of her behavior.

409
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is to enter into a little bit of the psychological piece right here is to say that the intensity of it. The feeling like, There's a piece missing from me.

410
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not just Jacqueline the psychological part is you needed that attachment bond possibly much, much, much earlier on in childhood with your mother and you're still, still looking for this.

411
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Attachment person in a friend and a woman friend, it's still your kind of longing for it longing for it. We're not conscious of these things, Joshua

412
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But

413
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing that knowing that the intensity dialed up

414
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's supposed to help relieve some of the pressure that you don't have to end your life. We just need to heal this attachment wounds that may have happened with you and your mother that healing is possible. You can feel good happy and enough you can

415
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell if someone's not

416
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just air pressure

417
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I need to check in and see how that little mind to yours is doing, because you see the irony. Right.

418
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never had it have anyone I'm lonely lonely. Meanwhile, these, these women want to get with you, right, you're like, I'm lonely. I'll never had one. There's people want to get with me. Listen.

419
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're more this we look what we look like. Okay.

420
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you get older, this this pretty thing this attracted this thing you it'll show up in an unexpected way it won't be

421
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I, I'm surprised. I'm attracted to this person, but it might come in a form like

422
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I fallen in love with this person, it's not really typically my type. I love who she is. I love how it feels. And we're attracted to each other. So don't get hung up on that, that superficial thing because guess what looks fade.

423
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So the stuff that right that matters.

424
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is on the inside.

425
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.660
Joshua Lopez: But no, and I, I believe in that. I just

426
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:36.960
Joshua Lopez: Like you said, it is superficial like Ellen's a great person, but I just

427
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.130
Joshua Lopez: Don't think, you know,

428
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not, if you're not hot for each other. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it. But my point is don't get because the problem with the online dating is you don't get a feel for someone's personality until you really kind of hang out with them so

429
00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to even just for distraction sacred to test this theory is to just connect with people and you want to hang out with them a little bit. See if there's some fire because sometimes people's personality and some dynamic about someone they can become attractive.

430
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Might want to give it a try.

431
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know. I want to know how you're feeling now as we're heading to the end of the session when know if anything shifted compare a

432
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:30.300
Joshua Lopez: Little bit. I mean, you could tell when I first got here, I was pretty pretty intense.

433
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.140
Joshua Lopez: Still, still sad, but I'm not like

434
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:42.750
Joshua Lopez: Oh, and I got here, just an hour ago, I was. Oh, it was pretty pretty bad.

435
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Your thoughts have shifted your thinking now about what notice where your thoughts are more focused on, as we've been talking the latter part of the session. What are you thinking about

436
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:06.960
Joshua Lopez: Honestly, there's still a bit sporadic. It's more of, maybe I can find somebody, maybe, maybe I'm just not ready.

437
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:11.370
Joshua Lopez: But then you still have a little bit of the negative thoughts like

438
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.100
Joshua Lopez: Tired of being alone.

439
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.070
Joshua Lopez: Then just

440
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:23.340
Joshua Lopez: Everything. It's, it's pretty sporadic and not honed in on one thought I've

441
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.940
Joshua Lopez: Probably got 1000 going through my head right now I overthink and overanalyze a lot

442
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's getting you in trouble. So this thing that I do with the constructive worry is not a joke. This is hardcore stuff, the amount of times you're going to have to swat away the, the name I can't think about her. I will not. You're on a complete detox from Facebook.

443
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Log out and don't go on.

444
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Detox. Nope, nope, nope, and just fantasize about

445
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of fun. What would be a fun, fun data. Go on. I wonder where we go, how would we do a date these days. How would it go when I take your temperature if she was at the door. First, and you know like when I would go, you know,

446
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know, we my mask would, I'd like I get a print screen of my actual face and that would be my mask, you know, it'd be like, with a smile.

447
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Go there and swept away the other ones. It happened.

448
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is radical acceptance. You do not have to overthink it. Now one more minute. It is nobody's fault. It is not your fault. It is not her fault. It is not your children's fault. It's not even your mother or father, his fault.

449
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It happened. Don't think about it again swatted away. I know, I know you will. But push it away and literally go to fantasy, which is right brain.

450
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So you notice you get a little bit when I said that that goofy thing with the bath with the mask. That means you imagined it you pictured it for a second.

451
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That was your brain over there and in creative land on the right side of the brain thinking of something that hasn't existed before go there. That's a fantasy. Good.

452
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How will it be, how will I be well think about what what you did with Evelyn. And look at that.

453
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Day, you know, knowing your own body. How did it feel how did he react. Oh, I remember. Yeah, I'm this I like this part that part I want to do that again. I want to do it with someone that I'm attracted to. I remember me.

454
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, I can have this this kind of physical contact. I like it feels good and I want to have it with someone. I'm attracted to get into that thinking

455
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you. It's going to take some effort. I get that.

456
00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're worth it, turn your attention to it.

457
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I know your your guy friend is saying that, too. Yeah. Isn't he

458
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.080
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, he's

459
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.170
Joshua Lopez: He's like as soon as we can start though, we're gonna start finding ladies.

460
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:22.440
Joshua Lopez: You know, he's like, I'm you know i mean he just he's always encouraging me in that sense. And, you know, at times I look over tweet at other times.

461
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:33.720
Joshua Lopez: But little scared. I have, you know, just because it's new. I haven't, you know, I hadn't went out and looked for girls and over 13 years you know it's

462
00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.560
Joshua Lopez: Very well put yourself there.

463
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's so scary, but it's worth it because you already Josh Why you bought it up against def

464
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It cannot be scarier than now.

465
00:52:51.150 --> 00:53:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got right up next to. And that's when I know people are really ready to make a change. They bought it right up to either drug use suicide homicide. They've gotten right up next to it and they got had to get that close to finally snap. Fuck that shit. I want to be happy.

466
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: They had to get that close. And yes, it's scary. And I'm terrified. I'm like, yes.

467
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also know we humans we do that, like, that's how I'm going to finally Groff really get in my head. This relationship. This marriage is over.

468
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I almost killed myself really

469
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna leave your children behind

470
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, my dad left me because he didn't think he would fall in love. My dad is so awesome. He's the sweetest man I know he's the hardest working man I know is if that's not a good man. If that's not lovable. What the heck are they going to think about themselves.

471
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're talking about makes no sense. You get that

472
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're attractive good intelligent funny loving affection, hard working, man. What are you doing,

474
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That would make no sense to your children.

475
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You get that right.

476
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Are you starting to come around.

477
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:22.230
Yeah.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got it's going to come every five seconds swatted away, doesn't matter comes again. Nope.

Gwenevere Abriel: finds this funny and she's intelligent and mostly most important when you go looking for a partner.

482
00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you want. I think I hope you want to notice how you feel when you're around that person. Pay attention.

483
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I like how I feel when I'm around this and such person. I like that. I feel confident. I feel attractive. I feel intelligent. I don't know what those things are. But that's what you keep your eye out for

484
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice them at work to they might be all around you but you're so busy thinking about who's or what's it you're not focusing on things that that are amazing around the people that are are in your life.

485
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to how you feel around them.

486
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not on what was not on what won't be. But what is focus on the present.

487
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I got.

488
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.410
Joshua Lopez: For for going over time with me. I

489
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.570
Joshua Lopez: Know,

490
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.680
Joshua Lopez: I was a bit late.

491
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:58.980
Joshua Lopez: I know we probably ran over time frame, but I do do very much appreciate you going over time and I needed it.

492
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we need these things. I'm so glad that that you're stating this program and that we're able to do this. So let's look at a couple things you want me to see if the doctor is available to explore medication because you scared me a little

493
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do.

494
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.190
Joshua Lopez: That I don't know what your schedule is like if you have to go

495
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I did have a bio psychosocial. Let me just look in Slack and see if he showed up. I'm guessing he it did not. But I'm going to go check. Okay.

496
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Slack. Is this like database thing.

497
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like a it's like email but secure or

498
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: more secure. That's better grammar.

499
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

500
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm getting stood up.

501
00:56:48.900 --> 00:57:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No show. Yeah, so also keep in mind I'm telling everyone I have maybe someone just fixed it for me. But I didn't have any ability to send or receive texts in Santa Fe. I mean like this black no Wi Fi some kind of twilight zone.

502
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And so yesterday I was in Albuquerque. And I texted all my clients. And I was like, Yeah, you know, can you guys show up tomorrow. You probably got one right and if so grateful and you sent me a thumbs up.

503
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I saw that. Thank you for that. But, I'm, I'm at a loss because everything is I don't have everything that I normally do. So if we make an appointment have really put it in your phone because you may not get a reminder from me is my kind of my point.

504
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: though. Okay, so let me let me go. See, I don't think he's here. So let me go see if we can meet with Dr. Every L and I talk fast so I might be efficient.

505
00:57:49.080 --> 00:58:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to say what's going on that you have some intense despair going on, causing suicidal ideation and it's been as recent as today and then its duration, how, how many days. Have you had it.

506
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:08.040
Joshua Lopez: Oh,

507
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.480
Joshua Lopez: It's been a while.

508
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:22.620
Joshua Lopez: I was in about a month, but it's been real intense like the past week and a half, I would say.

509
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So you hang on tight. I'll be right back. Okay, let me just go see

510
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: He's here. Okay. Well, hold on a second. Don't go anywhere. I still want to

511
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:34.380
See if I can

512
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.540
Get this together.

513
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Joshua. So I'm going to send you over to her zoom room, she's there. I gave her a heads up and she concurs with ma

514
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can take either. I think she'll explore the medication already on and maybe something else to sort of support you through, you know, we're talking about 336 months. It doesn't have to be forever. Okay.

515
01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, get you through this acute that listen, that's the cool thing about medication, it helps with this very thing. So don't don't deprive yourself of it. I'm glad you're at least open. So let me give you the number you got a pen handy.

516
01:00:39.210 --> 01:01:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Her zoom room, unless she gave you the wrong one. I'm assuming she's talking about her personal zoom, which is 349-690-2377 23772 there's two sevens in a row. So read it back to me.

517
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.840

538
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:06.840
