00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.350
Jen: Hi.

2
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.500
Jen: Good, how are you

3
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.480
Richelle Direny: I am

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.100
Tired.

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.970
Richelle Direny: No, no, no, I just want to

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.370
Richelle Direny: Get your coffee.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.180
Jen: Yeah, you kind of sound a little tired.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.940
Richelle Direny: No, gotta get your morning coffee.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.760
Jen: Right, I'm drinking my tea.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.900
Richelle Direny: Oh, um, what is it cold chai tea or hot

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.610
Jen: Hot. Yeah.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.170
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.150
Richelle Direny: Let us. And then I also just climbed up some stairs. So knowing you're out of shape because when you go upstairs and you're huffing and puffing after

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.710
Jen: Right, right.

15
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.680
Jen: Yeah, I was going to ask you to if you talk to. I'm Dr. Austin because she didn't send over my script yesterday.

16
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.810
Jen: No, and I called

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:32.190
Jen: I called my pharmacy. About two o'clock, and they said that nothing was sent over so I called the administration's office and told them, and they said, Okay, we'll get back to

18
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:48.330
Jen: And never dead so I you know told them about it again this morning when I checked in for you. So I don't know what's going on. This happened to me like twice before and it took like two days one time.

19
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.390
Jen: You know, to get my prescription. And I'm like, I can't be having this, you know, waiting two days with no no medication.

20
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.100
Richelle Direny: Wasn't you who told me it wasn't you, who said to do it a day before, because then you won't get it till the night with it, you

21
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.710
Jen: Know I think to me now somebody that wasn't me know wasn't me know because I always

22
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.670
Jen: Called Natalie on on our days that we see each other, you know, and

23
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.470
Jen: I don't know if she heard me say I needed it.

24
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, she did say everybody needed it, I think, except for one person.

25
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:38.940
Jen: Yeah, so I don't know. I know she's filled my Gabba patent because she told me that. And then I said, Yeah, I need a refill on on the strips to but I don't know.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:09.570
Jen: The lady at the you know the missions said that she said one this morning. And then I was waiting for them to contact me last night about about it, but I never got I never got a call or an email.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.850
Richelle Direny: I just sent her a message so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.790
Jen: I appreciate it. Thank you.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.120
Richelle Direny: Let me pull up your

32
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.950
Richelle Direny: Treatment plan.

33
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.080
Richelle Direny: So how was it. How was it, how did the interview go

34
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.540
Jen: Oh, I got the job.

35
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.680
Richelle Direny: Nice, nice. So are you, what are you going to be doing.

36
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:30.060
Jen: Um, I guess some the warehouse work where they pack the the items in the boxes and then ship them out on the truck.

37
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.470
Richelle Direny: So you're so you're going to be going to the warehouse.

38
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.090
Jen: Yeah.

39
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:50.490
Jen: Yeah, so, um, yeah. And my back. Oh my god, I don't know what's wrong with my back. Like, I don't know if it's because I've been sitting on my butt for like

40
00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:08.970
Jen: Pretty much six months doing nothing but my back hurts so bad when I walk like I have to sit down and I'm almost in tears because of the pain. So I don't know. I have to see my doctor

41
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:22.050
Jen: About trying to get something besides the Gabba patent and the proxy and and the Tylenol, because it's not working.

42
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:34.770
Jen: And if I am starting this job on the 29th and I you know it's it's 10 hour days for four days and I can't be in pain working, you know,

43
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:55.740
Jen: So I don't know what type of non narcotic pain medications out there besides Gabba Penn, because that's really not working for me that's like more of a nerve medication. And I think it's like my my muscle or something.

44
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.600
Richelle Direny: So,

45
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.550
Richelle Direny: Did you, are you able to call

46
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.810

47
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.820
Richelle Direny: Speak to her.

48
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:22.530
Jen: Um, yeah, I was gonna call them today to see if they have anything open. I have an appointment next month to get my demo shot and then talk to her about my refills.

49
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:38.370
Jen: Um, you know, my prescriptions and stuff because she gave me select saw for. So I was in a really bad funk of like depression, a little bit and then my anxiety and I don't like I don't like the

50
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.710
Jen: Default

51
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.320
Richelle Direny: She said her good until 420

52
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.680
Jen: Or 24 what

53
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.320
Richelle Direny: I'm guessing your medication.

54
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.860
Richelle Direny: She said the pharmacy won't fill it. Until then,

55
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.950
Jen: Until the 20th

56
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.350
Richelle Direny: Yeah, which is in three days.

57
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.120
Jen: Okay, well,

58
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.340
Richelle Direny: Or do you have none right now at all.

59
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.380
Jen: Um yeah like I had, I think I have like maybe one

60
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.340
Jen: Or two, but I can try to find he

61
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.500
Richelle Direny: Or she just said that they won't

62
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.740
Richelle Direny: They won't fill it. I guess your next refill date is on the 20th. So I when I guess when she called it in. They wouldn't put it through children.

63
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.870
Jen: Okay so well.

64
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:48.180
Jen: I guess I'm just gonna have to wait I'm I probably have them sit around in my bag. Sometimes they fall out of my box that there might be a couple in my bag that I did it. Look, but um but they said that they didn't even get a prescription so

65
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.360
Jen: Do I have to wait to the 20th

66
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:57.540
Richelle Direny: For her to center that's what she's saying that's what she said. They're not going to get because she can't put it through until then.

67
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.260
Jen: Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Just make sure she sends it in the morning, then for me.

68
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.640
Jen: And I'm what three days.

69
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:19.230
Jen: Yeah, I'm sure I have. I mean, I should have them because I had enough. You know what I'm saying. But I couldn't find them, but they're probably in the bottom of my

70
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:32.760
Jen: My bag like my little target bag, where I keep my medications that and sometimes they fall out of the box. So they're probably on the bottom of the bag. And I was just freaking out for no reason.

71
00:08:50.850 --> 00:09:02.940
Richelle Direny: Alright, so, um, in terms of so like I would like this session to be one. Like I said, you know, I just want to start off with that just kind of seeing how everything went with your interview, when do you start working. Yeah.

72
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:10.050
Jen: The 29th. They did, yeah. I went yesterday, I'm

73
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:35.250
Jen: To do like my badge photo and to make sure the hours that I wanted. And then she said that they're going to do a background check. And she said, usually takes two to 10 days. Well, it took one day I got an email today saying congratulations, yada, yada, yada. You know, so

74
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.170
Jen: Yeah, I started on the 29th.

75
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.110
Jen: I'm not a morning person at all. But I took the Morning shift.

76
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.700
Jen: Because

77
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.440
Richelle Direny: You said what time you start nine o'clock.

78
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.020
Jen: No 745

79
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.930
Richelle Direny: Was that means you are good about your bed, early to get

80
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.080
Jen: In and it's about an hour bus ride.

81
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.530
Richelle Direny: So no, you don't drive

82
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:22.320
Jen: No, I'm setting up for a car. Um, but, um, it's like it's a 10 hour day, but the evening shift was from like 630 to like four in the morning, which I would love doing that shift, but

83
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:35.850
Jen: The neighbors around here, you know, are loud because it's becoming springtime summertime. So they're going to be mowing their grass in the morning or afternoon.

84
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.540
Richelle Direny: Because right now, it seems like the the weather is a little bit

85
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.980
Richelle Direny: Out of sorts.

86
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.170
Jen: Well, you know what I mean, like, you know, people out in the yard and the music and

87
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:54.600
Jen: My neighbors, you know, so I wouldn't be able to sleep. Like that's working third shift, pretty much.

88
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.390
Jen: You know, come and then coming home at like

89
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.410
Jen: Six in the morning. I'm going to have to wind down

90
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:09.180
Jen: And then it's just my neighbors are so loud sometimes above me, too. So

91
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.680
Jen: I'm not a double house.

92
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.940
Jen: Number lower

93
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.410
Jen: So I rather just do it in the morning, you know, and then come home.

94
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.120
Jen: And then do what I gotta do whatever I got a bad

95
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.900
Richelle Direny: Hear that I hear me now.

96
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:43.170
Richelle Direny: Okay. So in looking at your, your treatment plan goals like, um, you know, and from here on out. That's what we're going to be

97
00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:03.030
Richelle Direny: Um, what is it like a goal that you would want to work on like yesterday I was going through a goal with someone and like

98
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:20.880
Richelle Direny: As I said, oh, what would you like to work on immediately. He was like, stop smoking. So then we were able to build on that. So what is for you. And let's see, and then we're going to break it down in looking at, um, you know, really, realistically,

99
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:34.260
Richelle Direny: You know, how are you able to be successful in that in that goal, if you will. So what is something that when you think about an all of it. Because when you think about, you know,

100
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.260
Richelle Direny: Your sobriety your sobriety. It's not just about if

101
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:48.000
Richelle Direny: You want one you want to. What was your, your, your drug of choice. It was pink pills, right, or was pills.

102
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.360
Jen: It was it started off pain pills and then I want to heroin.

103
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.070
Richelle Direny: It went to heroin and everything.

104
00:12:53.970 --> 00:13:06.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Now, yes, you know, your ultimate goal your long term goal your life long goal is to stay off of heroin or any type of substances and

105
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.890
Richelle Direny: To be able to maintain that

106
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:18.390
Richelle Direny: And, um, you know, not return back to that we could just talk about. Okay, so what are you going to do today did you identify your trigger, what took you away from not using

107
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:26.970
Richelle Direny: But it's actually thinking about the underlining issues the underlining stressors of those things in life that when you get

108
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.050
Jen: Overwhelmed

109
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.350
Richelle Direny: And you feel you lose hope and you lose all sense of

110
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:42.000
Richelle Direny: Control over any situation for that matter. Your inability to cope is what ultimate Elite is the catalyst to you reaching for something

111
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:53.700
Richelle Direny: To numb the thoughts, the racing thoughts is reaching for something to numb. If you're feeling hurt if you're feeling sad if you're feeling depressed, it's to not feel in that moment.

112
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.710
Richelle Direny: Right to shut out the world.

113
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.550
Jen: Right.

114
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.720
Richelle Direny: I don't want to deal with the world. It's kind of like thinking about Corona, but every time you turn on the news, the news isn't making any better.

115
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.070
Jen: The news we come around you.

116
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:15.840
Richelle Direny: So you're so fearful your you question everything. So guess what I'm so overwhelmed. I want to shut it off, I want to decrease my anxiety. I want to decrease my fear, I want to do everything.

117
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:23.580
Richelle Direny: I'm going to reach for those things that helps me to not think about that to help me to not focus and to worry about that.

118
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:34.620
Richelle Direny: Right when you're thinking about your goals, your goals are, what are some of the things that you can identify that Jennifer needs to

119
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:42.240
Richelle Direny: Work to work through or to work on. What are those things that you can, you know, let's we could, we could do a baby.

120
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:57.810
Richelle Direny: Two goals three long term goals and then we develop those short term individual plans to achieving those goals will do it over a three, four months span and will consistently work on them reviewing them each time.

121
00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.430
Jen: So,

122
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.940
Richelle Direny: When you think about some of the things that you struggle with.

123
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:11.340
Jen: Um, well, the first thing which I was just talking about, was my bath pain because that's a big thing for me because

124
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:33.720
Jen: When my back hurt. Before I would just pop a pill, you know, an opiate or, you know, do my drugs and I wouldn't feel anything and everything would be fine. So that's a really, really big issue for me. Um, and since I gained a little bit of weight.

125
00:15:36.060 --> 00:16:00.600
Jen: In these past like six months that might even have a little bit to do with my back my lower back pain as well because you know if you gain weight. You got more you know wait on you to carry you. Um, so I am starting to walk around the block.

126
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:09.810
Jen: A little bit like and if I if I'm in pain. I'll sit down for a minute because that's how bad it gets

127
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:29.640
Jen: And I feel like I'm in a 90 year old woman's body you know that needs like help you know those the ladies that have like the push roller things, not the chains, but like the pusher things the metal things that help them walk

128
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:48.930
Jen: I feel like I need one of those to put pressure on you know that instead of my back. Because when I go to Walmart and stuff and I push a car I'm fine, because it helps relieve the pressure from my back. So that's a big thing for me. Um,

129
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.100
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so when I, when I think about, okay, so, um,

130
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:04.080
Richelle Direny: So one of the goal can be working on healthier ways to cope with your back pain.

131
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.040
Richelle Direny: So,

132
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.640
Richelle Direny: When you think about your back in pain. I want you to think about

133
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:12.930
Richelle Direny: Let's

134
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:28.890
Richelle Direny: Someone pick that apart or let's go a little bit deeper with your back pain when you because there's the medical aspects of it because my back pain is more medical than it is psychological

135
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.570
Jen: Right.

136
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:36.060
Richelle Direny: Surrounding that I'm from a medical sample. Okay, one

137
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.480
Richelle Direny: When did the back pain star was going on with

138
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:54.450
Jen: I've always had either neck or back issues. I think it was my C three or C for, um, I had something wrong with them in my neck and

139
00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:09.180
Jen: I don't know if they were slipped discs. I don't remember, but they were caused from car accidents. So I've always had issues. Now my my neck pain went away. But now my

140
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:26.100
Jen: Back hurts. I'm possibly from the car accidents. I've been in for one for two I was an exotic dancer for 10 years. So the shoes probably didn't help.

141
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.870
Richelle Direny: Lead them she

142
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.170
Richelle Direny: did a number on your back.

143
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.480
Jen: But I was fine up until I swear, up until

144
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.610
Jen: Six months a year ago you know my eight

145
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:47.970
Richelle Direny: So did you so with going to the doctor and have you gone to a chiropractor.

146
00:18:48.930 --> 00:19:01.080
Jen: I'm scared to go because I don't know. I've heard stories, one of my indigo, especially one of my friends. She went and it messed her up really bad and she had

147
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:11.970
Jen: I don't remember what it was called but you know they master up, but I think if I just said, like maybe physical therapy or

148
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.040
Richelle Direny: Giving you in order to in order for you to go to physical therapy, you have to go to a doctor for them to find the right

149
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:25.500
Richelle Direny: Thing, and I'm not going to. And I want you always hear me say when I refer, when I asked her, and things. I always refer I'm, I'm a firm believer in this

150
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:43.380
Richelle Direny: I am not going to minimize somebody else's story and trauma or whatever that situation is, but I also take into consideration that when a person is telling me something. Are they really be 100% forthcoming with all the information that they're sharing with me.

151
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.210
Richelle Direny: Being

152
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:53.040
Richelle Direny: Your fear is coupled is coupled with whatever your friend told

153
00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:04.650
Richelle Direny: When it comes on to a chiropractor. Um, and that is, she went to the conference or this is what she went in with she came out and now she's all messed up.

154
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:11.310
Richelle Direny: Okay, my mind would say, walk, walk me through the full details of that because

155
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.720
Richelle Direny: For proctor

156
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.950
Richelle Direny: To mess you up.

157
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:24.990
Richelle Direny: Is it that because like I've been to a chiropractor and I'm not gonna tell you any like there are things like when they go to crack your neck. It feels like they're about to end your life.

158
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.020
Richelle Direny: Right, because of the way they do do the night

159
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:34.950
Richelle Direny: But they also say to you, give me full control of your head. They'll tell you don't resist me.

160
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.840
Richelle Direny: They'll say, drop your head.

161
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:44.460
Richelle Direny: Gives me full control and when they're they're shaking your head around. And they said, you're still resisting me because they feel the tension.

162
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:52.650
Richelle Direny: Once they feel that you have released all control in their hand. Then they do the whole snapping thing and then you'll hear your neck go

163
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.410
Like right it

164
00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:08.580
Richelle Direny: Was that you know an issue for her. When you're laying on the bed. You went before you even go in, they ask you, certain questions. Did you ever get into a car accident, this did that whatever the situation is

165
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:21.120
Richelle Direny: Depending on how you whatever experiences you have, for instance, you're an exotic dancer. YOU'RE WEARING THESE HEELS. Maybe you had a phone.

166
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:31.830
Richelle Direny: You go to a chiropractor, they're asking you all these questions because you are personally ashamed of the fact that you weren't an exotic dancer and this is what you did for a living.

167
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:44.940
Richelle Direny: And you got hurt wise on it because of your shame of what it is that you used to do you refuse to tell the chiropractor that that's pertinent information because the car park doesn't care whether or not you're an exotic dancer.

168
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.040
Jen: Oh, I'm not ashamed at all. I

169
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.540
Richelle Direny: Don't know I'm giving you an example.

170
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.340
Richelle Direny: You're giving

171
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.880
Richelle Direny: Example, the conference. It doesn't care.

172
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.410
Richelle Direny: That you're writing dance.

173
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:01.530
Richelle Direny: Okay. He cares that the for 10 years you are wearing the shoes and these are all the things that you were doing.

174
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:15.300
Richelle Direny: So now you're telling him this before he leaves you on the table and starts to adjust you he's gonna say hey you know what, why don't you go do this. Let's rule out all of these things. First, before I can do this. You understand what I'm saying.

175
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:15.540
Jen: Yes.

176
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:23.580
Richelle Direny: Yes. And the reason why even eat, and I thought that was a good example in terms of being an exotic dancer, because I've seen videos of dancers who have

177
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.270
Jen: Fallen

178
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.350
Jen: From being

179
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:40.290
Richelle Direny: On the pole and you know are badly messed up or whatever, and they never necessarily went to go get the assistance that they need to realign themselves. Um, so you went when people are telling you, I went to a chiropractor and they jacked me up. Did they really or

180
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.370
Jen: Right, right.

181
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.720
Richelle Direny: Tell them the full story.

182
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.550
Jen: Right. And yeah.

183
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.170
Richelle Direny: Because when they're adjusting you they're adjusting from head to toe.

184
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:58.590
Richelle Direny: Right when they were and they ask you, certain questions now. It doesn't negate from the fact that, you know, everybody that's in certain businesses shouldn't necessarily be there.

185
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:05.940
Richelle Direny: Because they're not necessarily doing it, but I've been to chiropractors where they put you on machines and they're doing all kinds of things.

186
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.780
Jen: Mm hmm.

187
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:21.090
Richelle Direny: When you walk out of there. They'll tell you because of the fact that you just got an adjustment because of what you just did. Your body is not used to it. You may be in pain. So take some Tylenol, just to relax everything

188
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.750
Jen: Right.

189
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:35.940
Richelle Direny: Right, so sometimes when you're hearing, you'll always meet, hear me always even in group in every situation. I always say I you hear what other people are saying, but whatever you share I needed to. You need to make it personal.

190
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.280
Richelle Direny: To him so

191
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:48.630
Richelle Direny: That. So in in wanting to manage and finding healthier ways to cope with your pain. We have to, in this case, start from a medical standpoint.

192
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:57.390
Richelle Direny: Right, and that's why I asked, Did you go to a doctor did you go to a chiropractor because you probably go to the chiropractor and they do an X ray

193
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:16.320
Richelle Direny: And they'll probably notice. Hey, part of your, your back pain. It's because of this and they may ask, what was it, what were you doing in the past, and then when they tell you, they'll tell you. Okay, this is what the situation is. Now, I would recommend going to a physical therapist.

194
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.280
Richelle Direny: This specific therapy.

195
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.450
Richelle Direny: Because now they'll tailor fit it to the kind of therapy that you need.

196
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.450
Richelle Direny: And now you're better able

197
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:28.440
Jen: Right.

198
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.790
Richelle Direny: To be free of pain.

199
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:30.480
Right.

200
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:40.230
Richelle Direny: Like I had someone yesterday who has the same issue, but with her what her goals is working through her pain in having this exact conversation.

201
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:53.040
Richelle Direny: She was told in order for you to get to, to get rid of your pain. You have to have back surgery but she doesn't want to have back surgery because there's a 70% chance

202
00:24:53.550 --> 00:25:02.940
Richelle Direny: That this will, you know, she could, she could possibly so for her. She made the conscious decision of not doing the surgery to get rid of the pain, but to manage the pain and manage

203
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.260
Jen: All of the same thing, right.

204
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.270
Richelle Direny: So now we're making our goal.

205
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:11.970
Richelle Direny: Based on what's realistic. You want to get off of pain pills, but is that realistic for you.

206
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.680
Jen: I hope so in the future. Yeah, I mean,

207
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:24.330
Richelle Direny: So then we have to start with, going to a doctor and identifying. What's the source of my pain.

208
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:29.160
Jen: Right, gotta go get X rays and see what is

209
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.080
Richelle Direny: Going on really going with

210
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.830
Jen: My neck.

211
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:42.990
Jen: And my, my back because it my back. It even it's going down like my side or, you know, and I lift my leg. Like if I'm standing

212
00:25:43.530 --> 00:26:00.120
Jen: You know, and I can feel that numbness from the sidecar I lift up my leg and push it again like a wall, and it's fine. It feels fine, which is weird. So I'm gonna have to definitely make an appointment.

213
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:08.760
Jen: And maybe try to go get some extra X rays to see where to go from there because

214
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:31.530
Jen: You know this. I can't do this anymore. Maybe. Maybe it's because I'm like I said, I've been lazy. I've always been exercising and I'm, you know, very active and it didn't hurt that that much. But now that I'm sitting on my butt all the time and gained a little bit of weight.

215
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.090
Jen: That might have something to do with it. Also, but yeah, I got, I got to find the underlining point here.

216
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.120
Jen: Mm hmm. Yeah, so

217
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:49.800
Richelle Direny: You have to first start you know taking my pills. It's Hey, did that would get rid of your pain temporarily though.

218
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:58.290
Richelle Direny: Right until you find out the sort because eventually the pain pills that you're taking is no longer going to work because the pain is becoming so much more

219
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:13.650
Jen: And they. And actually, they're not working, like they they work, but they only help slightly, they don't take away the pain at all like an opiate would

220
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:21.900
Jen: It just, it's slightly helping a little bit, but it's not taking away all the pain.

221
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.250
Jen: So then

222
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:34.020
Richelle Direny: If an opiate takes away the pain. It could be that the opiate is acting as almost like an anesthetic drunk, where it just like It numbs everything

223
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.850
Richelle Direny: The pain right so there. So it's like almost behave as if it's an anesthetic drunk.

224
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.760
Richelle Direny: Right there, that's working. But eventually the

225
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.570
Richelle Direny: Ones that anesthesia or the anesthetic wears off. Guess what, hey, I'm still here.

226
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:55.950
Richelle Direny: Right. So, then, did you really ever go to a doctor to identify the source of your

227
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.310
Jen: Oh, I have. Yes, I have gone to the doctor.

228
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:13.500
Jen: But it was years ago. And then my doctor put me on the Gabba Patton. Um, and then hopes. I mean, I mean, I can't take any opiates. I'm

229
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:27.300
Jen: But it helped and she gave me muscle relaxers to which helped a little bit, but it's, it doesn't take it away. I still feel it, especially when I walk so I just have to

230
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.070
Jen: Do what I gotta do make an appointment and take it from there.

231
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.720
Jen: That's all.

232
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:45.330
Richelle Direny: I can do is because this is the other thing about in, you know, it's always important that when you go to the doctor, you have to see the doctor doesn't know.

233
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.410
Jen: Yeah.

234
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.110
Richelle Direny: They don't, they only know what they study in the book.

235
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:56.340
Richelle Direny: They only know what they practice on a mannequin or a cadaver or all of that. Now your real life.

236
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.810
Richelle Direny: You're the real deal.

237
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.420
Richelle Direny: The only way I can help you is if you tell me everything

238
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.970
Richelle Direny: Right, because now

239
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:17.610
Richelle Direny: You are challenging me to do my research and apply my book knowledge to reality to try to figure it out. A doctor can only be world's renowned if

240
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:29.340
Richelle Direny: You challenge them enough and he becomes creative in dealing with your issue and from dealing with your issue. He's the only one that discovered. Hey, it's this, it's that this works.

241
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:37.320
Richelle Direny: Now let's sell it on the market and now he becomes world announced, simply because you put him to that challenge in that test. You get what I'm saying.

242
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:46.140
Richelle Direny: Right. So when you go to the doctor and they're giving you get a patent and you're saying, Hey doc listen though the Gavin patent works a little bit but it ain't really doing the job.

243
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:58.710
Richelle Direny: So I need to figure it out like there is something else going on there because this is what I find if it's a weight issue then he'll say okay well lose 20 pounds. Then come back.

244
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.810
Richelle Direny: Well done, right. So, feel the pain or until then clearly it wasn't the weight. It was something else.

245
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.600
Jen: I think I heard someone has a mailman sorry

246
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.060
Jen: I was on my mind at the door. I'll get it when I'm done.

247
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.720
Jen: Yeah, I'm gonna probably make an appointment. When I get off the phone with you, even if it's a virtual appointment.

248
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.490
Mm hmm.

249
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.120
Richelle Direny: And you have to be mindful, you know, you know if your goal is to eventually get off any type of pill.

250
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:47.550
Richelle Direny: You know you want to really have those informative conversations that they're not just dis prescribing you another drug because when all of these drugs that you're taking your liver your liver has to process it.

251
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.710
Jen: Right, right.

252
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.650
Jen: I love that too great anyway for

253
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.470
Jen: From drinking in my 20s, you know,

254
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.500
Richelle Direny: So, um, so the one goal that we're working on is

255
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.730
Richelle Direny: I see.

256
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.160
Richelle Direny: Pain man working

257
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.130
Richelle Direny: Yes Pena pain management working on healthier ways to cope with your back pain.

258
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.040
Richelle Direny: And now you're going to do that is

259
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.470
Richelle Direny: Or

260
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.810
Richelle Direny: Identify

261
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.910
Jen: I was even thinking about buying a cane.

262
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.720
Jen: For a minute just to help me walk around the block, you know,

263
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.250
Jen: Help with the pressure

264
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:07.170
Richelle Direny: Okay. So, speaking with your medical provider about the source of the pain and discussing options. One of them is

265
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:17.790
Richelle Direny: It and this is I'm going to say this one is going to be a little bit more shorter term because then once you speak with them, then they can you know let you know. So let's see 617

266
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:26.220
Richelle Direny: Um, you will within the next month, you're going to contact the doctor, or a chiropractor to identify within the next month.

267
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.690
Richelle Direny: Be able to have this

268
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.000
Richelle Direny: Informative so whatever they recommend

269
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.110
Richelle Direny: And, you know, follow through on

270
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.260
Richelle Direny: Recommendation

271
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:52.680
Richelle Direny: Because like I said, it's, it's, you have to start from medical anything that you do, even if you see a psychiatrist, they always they always go with the medical for everything. You always have to move out anything medical

272
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.480
Jen: Right.

273
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:05.640
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let's move on to what is something else that you would like to

274
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.090
Jen: Um, get a car.

275
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.960
Jen: And might be. I mean, I don't know, might be

276
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.400
Jen: You know, not important to some people, but for me.

277
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:25.350
Richelle Direny: It's very important 745 in the morning and jumping on a bus or 30 morning for an hour. So, yeah.

278
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:31.590
Jen: That too. I'm. Plus, I've always had a car since I was 16 and

279
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:49.890
Jen: I mean, there was a little bits and pieces like about six months here or month there that I didn't have a car. But, I mean, I haven't had a car I last car was my Chrysler 300 when I was managing at

280
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.970
Jen: Volunteers of America, and that was probably like three years ago.

281
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.070
Jen: So it's been three years since I've had a car.

282
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:10.350
Richelle Direny: Three years ago, okay. So work, I would like to work on getting a car in the next one.

283
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.730
Jen: I want to say within the next six months.

284
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:34.920
Jen: Especially if I'm working at Amazon. They pay pretty good. So if I save you know a month paychecks not in just a month, but over a course of a few months, you know,

285
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.630
Jen: Even just to put down like 2000 down on a car, you know, and have a car note.

286
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.770
Richelle Direny: Okay, so on the objective would be to work on a budget that can support you, meeting the goal.

287
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.880
Yeah.

288
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.560
Jen: And I don't have many bills.

289
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.940
Jen: Because I do have Section eight

290
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:11.310
Jen: Which I'm thankful for, because when I was in treatment. I think I told you this story. When I was in treatment.

291
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:28.950
Jen: When I first got in trouble. I went to Matt Talbot and my counselor said, Hey, do you want to put your name in, you know, section eight lottery. And I was like, what's that I've never heard of it.

292
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:45.420
Jen: She told me I said sure, why not. Well, they picked me and then you had to go down and meet the requirements, you know, no drug felonies and three years no this no that whatever and I got it, but it

293
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:55.080
Jen: It was the most difficult procedure finding a place to take Section eight and Ohio.

294
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.180
Richelle Direny: Anyway,

295
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.650
Richelle Direny: I think that's anywhere. It is

296
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.010
Richelle Direny: Really anywhere. Anywhere decent because

297
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.790
Richelle Direny: Even here in Florida. I've heard that same thing, um, some places don't

298
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.830
Richelle Direny: Some communities don't necessarily because it's like the stigma that's attached to it.

299
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:23.640
Richelle Direny: That for people on spec section. It's the stigma, because it's a voucher that you get. And you have to find the person who is willing to accept that voucher.

300
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.020
Richelle Direny: That time

301
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:33.750
Richelle Direny: So it. I think the reason why the difficulty in it is because of the stigma attached to it. And of course there are people who don't make it that you know

302
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.990
Richelle Direny: Right on help to remove that stigma, because they go

303
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:53.220
Richelle Direny: And then if you decide that you're going to move into a really nice community and then you keep it really bad, like you will then and then all of a sudden starts running down, simply because of the traffic you bring in how to keep the place. So then with that it makes it very, very hard.

304
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.440
Richelle Direny: Right, you're putting your business out in the street that you want a Section eight and that you can't. You're saying so.

305
00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.430
Jen: Right.

306
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.370
Richelle Direny: Right, it's really the stigma type. So that's anywhere you go.

307
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:21.870
Jen: Yeah, and it's because if there's a stigma also attached to it because of in the past, people would trash the house, you know, the houses and leave it. So now, people like me who don't do that. It's hard to find a place, but

308
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:32.220
Jen: I thank God that I found a nice house in a nice neighborhood, you know, so I'm very blessed with that.

309
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.030
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you know, it's all, it's all in how you keep it because I've seen

310
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.870
Richelle Direny: I've seen it on both sides. I've seen where I'm like in a really

311
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:52.980
Richelle Direny: Somewhat upper class neighborhood or somebody was on Section eight and it was a really big house really really your house and

312
00:37:53.610 --> 00:38:01.830
Richelle Direny: When I heard they were on Section eight because I like you know I go and you know we all have these preconceived notions and we somewhat judge people without intentionally trying to judge them.

313
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:09.600
Richelle Direny: And I remember seeing. And I was like, man, this is a big house are you're able to afford this. And then that I was told she said I, there were on Section eight

314
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:27.390
Richelle Direny: And now the inside of the house wasn't all that it wasn't well cats. The outside of house wasn't too too bad. Um, what and then I've also seen places where people they keep the house that almost as if they are the ones that own the house and it's like really, really nice.

315
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.010
Richelle Direny: Right. And you would never know.

316
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:36.720
Richelle Direny: That their own section. Anyway, so, but again, it's just all about the individual. So if a transfer taking

317
00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.470
Richelle Direny: But some of them are not willing to take that chance because of the stigma.

318
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:50.640
Jen: That comes. Right. Right. But I'm going to stay here for, you know, quite a while, till I save up because I want to buy a house.

319
00:38:51.060 --> 00:39:01.110
Jen: You know, I want to purchase my own house and call my own after I, you know, have a good job and I don't, I don't want to live.

320
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:10.350
Jen: On Section eight, the rest of my life. And people think just because you're on Section eight. You don't have to pay rent. Well, when you don't work.

321
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:22.830
Jen: You don't. But once you start working you you have to pay rent and might not be the whole amount but you pay a good part of the rents depending how much you may

322
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.640
Richelle Direny: Then. Mm hmm. Yeah.

323
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.890
Richelle Direny: And I think what section eight, don't they, every so often, someone comes to trick on you right

324
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:44.880
Jen: Yeah, it's either every six months to a year that they do an inspection. So my inspection should be coming up shortly. And there's a couple things that the

325
00:39:45.600 --> 00:40:04.500
Jen: Landlord needs to take care of. Not bad things. But, um, and he's got to paint the the front porch, the steps to preserve picky. Some of them are really, really picky when they come and check the houses and then others.

326
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:13.890
Jen: Don't care. You know, if you want something done. You tell them, and then they write it on the list and tell the landlord, you know,

327
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.080
Jen: So, but, but my place is really nice.

328
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:40.140
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good. Um, so let's see. So with the car, you're going to, we're going to do a budget, maybe on every time that we meet like you start on the 29th, so maybe within like with your first paycheck. You can do some individual goals is like with your first paycheck, you will

329
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.710
Richelle Direny: Put aside, maybe a certain percent or, you know, maybe

330
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:53.100
Richelle Direny: Right percent of your total paycheck, at least 1% or at least 2%

331
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.680
Jen: I'll be doing probably at least half

332
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:07.500
Jen: I mean, probably half between 25 and 50% I know because like I said, I don't have many bells so

333
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.950
Jen: I'll try to do as much as I can.

334
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.370
Jen: But I want to say out least 25%

335
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:34.620
Richelle Direny: Oh,

336
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.820
Jen: Man, I gotta see if I get paid weekly or bi weekly

337
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.920
Richelle Direny: Assignments. I'm going to say, um,

338
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.070
Richelle Direny: Let's do 10%

339
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:44.730
Jen: Okay.

340
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:52.080
Richelle Direny: A month later being realistic because you have to, you haven't worked in a while. So you want to be realistic to what it is that you're doing.

341
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.400
Okay.

342
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.290
Richelle Direny: We'll

343
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.440
Richelle Direny: After

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:36.360
Richelle Direny: All right, and then I'm sold 10% of multi multi multiple 10% of monthly salary.

345
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.280
Jen: I will try to save

346
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.650
Richelle Direny: At least 10% of monthly salary.

347
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.240
Okay.

348
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.770
Richelle Direny: The next one will be

349
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.480
Richelle Direny: What else do you think that you can do to to reach your goal.

350
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.290
Jen: To work. I mean,

351
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.590
Jen: As I don't know.

352
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.540
Richelle Direny: Maintain your job.

353
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:34.890
Jen: Yeah, just. There you go. I had a brain fart for a minute. Yeah, I maintain my job and I'm, you know, not call off or be late, all the time.

354
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.040
Jen: You know, to get fired.

355
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:50.340
Richelle Direny: Okay, maintain drive by following general rules and requirements of the job.

356
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.660
Yes.

357
00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:59.640
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let's just do those because those are two, you know, pretty good ones.

358
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:09.390
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of like when you think about your triggers like. So in terms of your, your relapse prevention plan when you think about triggers. What are

359
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.070
Richelle Direny: What have you

360
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.610
Richelle Direny: Some emotional triggers that you have

361
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.690
Jen: And what are just some emotional triggers, I'm

362
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.940
Jen: Probably. I think I told you before, just being lonely.

363
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:53.370
Jen: That's an emotional. Would that be considered emotional trigger being bored and lonely.

364
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:59.460
Jen: So those are my two major ones is being

365
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.340
Richelle Direny: Alone, because you're that you live alone.

366
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah relationship. What are the relationship triggers for you. If there are

367
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:16.410
Jen: Well, I'm not in a relationship, but when I was I'm

368
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:24.750
Jen: Just when we would argue and I you know I would get so mad.

369
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:35.160
Jen: You know i if i get mad. I would just say, Screw it. You know, I don't want to deal with this type thing.

370
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:41.220
Jen: That was, that was a really toxic relationship, though.

371
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:49.200
Jen: And that was two and a half years ago and I've been single sense. Um, but in a normal house.

372
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:51.600
Jen: What was that

373
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.530
Richelle Direny: What kind of trigger was that what was that relationship sugar.

374
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:03.270
Jen: I mean, it was a toxic relationship. So everything when we thought was a trigger.

375
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.490
Jen: I'm

376
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:15.150
Jen: Just because I mean it was a very toxic codependent relationship and I'd get mad at them.

377
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:33.630
Jen: And he would get mad at me and both of us. We would just say, Screw it, you know. And he, I know you know he did, you would say, you know, I fit and go and leave you know blame me for something leave and go get high.

378
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:52.050
Jen: And, you know, there's a couple times that I that I did too, but in a normal, healthy relationship. I don't believe I'm like where I'm at now. I would rather talk it out.

379
00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:02.070
Jen: Instead of just arguing and saying SEO, you know, because we were both addicts, you know,

380
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.580
Jen: I'm so

381
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.230
Jen: But yeah, just, I mean, arguing

382
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.160
Richelle Direny: About what about situation for growth.

383
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:19.650
Jen: Situational, do you mean as in relationships or

384
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.990
Richelle Direny: Situation anything

385
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.240
Jen: I'm situation all

386
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:35.130
Jen: That's another thing too, if I if I'm on the phone and I'm arguing with somebody. It's making me mad like my mom.

387
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.070
Jen: For instance, you know, or when I lived with her.

388
00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:48.540
Jen: She you know just she made me angry. And I would just want to use

389
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.650
Jen: I wouldn't all the time, but I would just leave.

390
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.280
Jen: So,

391
00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.240
Richelle Direny: What are some healthy coping skills that you would say

392
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.610
Jen: Um,

393
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:10.800
Jen: Well, like I said, I would just leave the situation, you know, either leave the house.

394
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:18.540
Jen: Or hang you know hang up the phone. So I'm hey I have to go. I don't want to talk about this right now.

395
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.000
Jen: Hopeless.

396
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.800
Richelle Direny: Walking away.

397
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.210
Mm hmm.

398
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:31.050
Jen: Walking away from the situation so well escalate anymore.

399
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.300
Jen: I'm

400
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.870
Richelle Direny: For your journal. Do you like to read. Do you listen to music.

401
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:43.860
Jen: That's I love listening to music. I love our I'm getting back into painting.

402
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:54.060
Jen: I have some paints, but it's hard because the the stores are open to go get paints and you know canvas says
