18
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I was running a group and it, it never ends on time. I just can't.

19
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.170
Laura Lujan: Wait to see

20
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.360

Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for that.

23
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I went I went and looked and I saw you were there and I was like okay

24
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I ran over and opened up a room. So anyway, it worked out. All right.

25
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's continue the conversation we were having last time we were starting to talk about

26
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.030
Laura Lujan: One other thing I want to get right. Oh.

27
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.840
Yeah.

28
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

29
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember some of the either the feelings that you had last time we spoke or some of the content just just want to check in and see if any of it stuck.

30
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.340
Laura Lujan: Because I don't

31
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:44.910
Laura Lujan: Really, I remember. I'll let you down because you told me I didn't do it or not. And then you're like, Laura through life.

32
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.250
Laura Lujan: Like I gotta let you know. Yeah.

33
00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting. So I'm looking at some notes here, it's, it's a, it's a, there's a lot of at the top of them kind of write down in the middle.

34
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We were talking a little bit about how your step mom is rude trying to turn on me.

35
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, here we go. Didn't do my homework. I forgot you said

36
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.330
Laura Lujan: You got boring. Okay.

37
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so Dad said this was the piece that I was remembering

38
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It was Dad, I want to go to rehab with you. You got cast and I talked about sort of the ethical standards of treatment that it's it's highly, highly unlikely, even if you were to make sort of himself. There

39
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't be in treatment with them.

40
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.300
Laura Lujan: Oh, good. Right.

41
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.990
So,

42
00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So you said dad grew up in small town, maybe it is why he thinks it's okay. This is a. Okay. Um, so this is today we're going to talk about boundaries. We're going to really spend probably the whole time talking about if you're writing something down and be healthy boundaries.

43
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's what you were touching on um when you were saying maybe it's why he thinks it's okay.

44
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To what right that's the boundary. What, what is he normalizing think is OK.

45
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, yeah.

46
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to get into that.

47
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be a downfall. And me, then I could relapse okay right you putting yourself at risk if you work in a benefit from treatment. It's a scary thing.

48
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's how he gets the power over me invited boundary setting one time dad asked me to watch a video and you were saying, as an example, you set a boundary with your dad because he's basically didn't watch the video.

49
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.410
Laura Lujan: I did to

50
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.490
Laura Lujan: kind of mess.

51
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to talk. We'll talk more about it. LAURA BEING ABLE TO SET healthy boundaries.

52
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is an everyday process. It's not like, oh, I say it. We talked about it once in your life just lines up and everything's perfect

53
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This is typically a critical and important piece of growth for people

54
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: For years, like so. I don't want to make it sound like I'm saying it, and everything's going to fall in line. This is a hard thing to do.

55
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A to recognize when it's a boundary issue to recognize when you're know like your firm know is going to work in a particular environment it's it's subtle and tricky and

56
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the expert in your environment. So I'll talk about different things and we can do some role plays and I'll give you some little tricks about how to communicate. But ultimately, it's going to be you. That will have to navigate that terrain.

57
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so no way I'm not, I don't want to insult you with trying to make this seem easy boundaries are hard for every one, even with the best Silver Spoon upbringing, they're still really hard. Okay.

58
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To say are no is to risk a conflict and none of us like it. We don't like conflict.

59
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.740
Laura Lujan: Everything.

60
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.530
Laura Lujan: In our life.

61
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.830
Laura Lujan: Cowboy, yo.

62
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know.

63
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.540
Yeah.

64
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

65
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I got

66
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:41.040
Laura Lujan: What we're on whenever every time I would, I would just take on a ship out the window and I got talking and

67
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.590
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

68
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.340
So,

69
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about it today. So you get a sense of how important it is. You can see that it's it's almost like all or nothing. Either you shush insane kitty really

70
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.310
Laura Lujan: Quite remark.

71
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Cat question or cat, cat needs some attention. Um, so it is it is an important thing. And a lot of times what what you're describing is this polarity of a leader say nothing. Say nothing say nothing.

72
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or explode as most people it's that one and wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. And then they they had this big explosion or they get themselves depressed or they act out through aggression.

73
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.380
Laura Lujan: They were, you were, you were on the road.

74
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

75
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.280
Laura Lujan: So a lot

76
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.720
Laura Lujan: Oh,

77
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people,

78
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That repression, you know, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year ends up where people will sometimes explode in anger, sometimes they will use drugs and alcohol, right, because they can't deal

79
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.670
Laura Lujan: They can't get over them.

80
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah over they'll cut burn. Yeah.

81
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

82
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you notice how it

83
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants an outlet. It doesn't that repressed opinion and preference. It doesn't want to just stay all locked up. It wants out notice right and so

84
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What we can do is find a healthy way to do it.

85
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly. We're not damaging relationships are throwing our stuff out the window.

86
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

87
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, I get it, though.

88
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.070
Walking

89
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.790
Laura Lujan: Only boy you know 19 company.

90
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's spend a minute. I'm going to share the screen with you.

91
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know if you if I show this to last time or not, but you may want to take a screenshot of it.

92
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's somewhere on my screen. It's just hidden behind couple. I found it.

93
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go.

94
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright share screen. There it is. Okay, so

95
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go through the right side, which is a pretty typical approach.

96
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We might right which is unhealthy unhealthy boundaries.

97
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how they show up in one's life. So I'm going to read them and you kind of get a sense of, oh yeah, me too. Or no, I don't do that anymore. Or, oh yeah, I do that still a little bit or maybe

98
00:10:40.320 --> 00:11:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: With this person or that person. So the first one. You can't say no when you're afraid of rejection or abandonment. So that's when you know you bumped into an unhealthy boundary. So there's basically two two types of boundaries. There's one see my hand, if this is the boundary

99
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's too porous, which means too much of someone else's opinion too much of someone's emotions too much of someone's unwanted touch even or they move my stuff. It's, it's, it gets through. It's called a porous boundary

100
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.990
Laura Lujan: Or

101
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or this one.

102
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, uh huh, or nothing gets through this one is rigid

103
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So this one, this one, you can't take in, it would be a rigid boundary where nothing gets through. This one's porous where too much gets through. And this one's rigid. Okay.

104
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what we'll take we'll just going to take just an example. So I can give an example of what this looks like. So in the therapeutic relationship between you and I, I've already seen that you have

105
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it's not one or the other, you've been able to hear my opinion.

106
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And hopefully I don't know if it's true for you, but you can hear it and realize it's just my opinion.

107
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not maybe true for you. But it's this lady's opinion, she can think what she thinks I know my own opinion, but I can hear her right is that happened.

108
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're in there or wait let me see, let me check if I say something, do you take it on as the truth. Just because I said it.

109
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Depends.

110
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:48.810
Okay.

111
00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll keep an eye on on that one. So, um, where which relationship would you say it's harder for you to say no because you're afraid you'll lose abandonment meaning, you'll lose resources or

112
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.190
Laura Lujan: Whatever right and

113
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

114
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd say specifically is is more useful.

115
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:25.200
Laura Lujan: Or back in the day, my mom. My mom whenever I she she had this idea of like the perfectionism. So I grew up like I grew up, you know,

116
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:34.980
Laura Lujan: Looking at my name. I'm not looking at anything not really guided like she would just get really mad at me and I mean

117
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:46.020
Laura Lujan: It was kind of like, you know, and then so she was like my 91% and be like, Oh, well, it's really hard. I get your autograph for your

118
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.030
Laura Lujan: Family, and I'm like,

119
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.050
Laura Lujan: 90% Hi guys welcome to class.

120
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.890
Laura Lujan: Right, so you know that had a big influence on me.

121
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're

122
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.250
Laura Lujan: Letting her determine what

123
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. That's right. So it's her opinion getting through. So what was needed was smaller, smaller little spaces. So there's I know my truth. I know I'm doing my personal best.

124
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And letting sort of what she's saying bounce off of you. But when we're children when we're teenagers and still to this day, it can it can seek seep through the boundary and it can hurt and it can damage and erode our sense of self.

125
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.240
Boy.

126
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.490
Laura Lujan: If I call you back on. Yeah.

127
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.240
Laura Lujan: I don't

128
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.210
Laura Lujan: Want it

129
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to see it in here more you're going to see another than what you just described, there's going to be even a better example in here. So let's keep reading.

130
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So the healthy version of that.

131
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to where you can say yes.

132
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you can say no. You're okay when others say yes or no to you.

133
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel it, you're going to notice over time as your boundaries get clearer and clearer that when someone says no to you.

134
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't get resentful angry offended.

135
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You just go, Oh, they've reached their limit, they don't have it to give and you're just going to move on but not right now. Right now, it's this intense, how could you How dare you.

136
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.110
Laura Lujan: Bigger right

137
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But these are really the way these are written and makes it seem simple, but the actual change process does take some time. So, but let's just do an overview. Let's keep going. Let's look at the second one over here. The second one under unhealthy boundaries.

138
00:15:51.060 --> 00:16:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You have your identity consists of what you think others want you to be. Now that's even getting closer to what you just described with your mom isn't it.

139
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.240
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

140
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you become a what what's this a chameleon.

141
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

142
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you can be and do anything anybody wants you really right. You're attuned to you can get a sense of what they want.

143
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.320
Laura Lujan: And you actually, you know,

144
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.940
Laura Lujan: I don't know a lot

145
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, chameleon right

146
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.020
Laura Lujan: Well, what can I do for your, your

147
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the key word. You see this word identity.

148
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.250
Yeah.

149
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where it becomes kind of high risk if you continue along this line.

150
00:16:46.890 --> 00:17:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If you continue to behave in a way that only accommodates other people. If your whole identity is on. I know how to conform contort turn into a pretzel accommodate others, then

151
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens to this sense of who am I, it starts to be questioned. Well then who am I really

152
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's look at a healthy version of identity a healthy version would be have a strong sense of identity and you respect yourself, you're not waiting to see what other people think of you. You are respecting yourself.

153
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're also helping

154
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You, um, you may, if you want to, I don't know if your phone will allow for a screenshot. This is one that a lot of people decide to do screenshots of if you know how to do it on your phone.

155
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.120
This is a pretty handy.

156
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.440
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I got it.

157
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go to the third one.

158
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This concept of of identity that I just discussed earlier, is a really complex one, and it takes for some people quite a while to understand

159
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How continuing to be a chameleon can threaten the sense of self of who am I am I am I really real. And I being honest.

160
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It can, it can erode the identity. So this is, this is one that takes quite some in depth work, but we're just touching lightly on some of these concepts. Let's keep moving. Let's go to the third one, you have so unhealthy is you have no balance of power or responsibility in your relationships.

161
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You tend to be either overly responsible

162
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And controlling

163
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Passive and dependent. Yeah. You see it.

164
00:18:49.590 --> 00:19:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So I heard just a tiny touch of it when you were talking about the dynamics of money and how that money with your, with your father is the exchange of of

165
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How he's wrong do and so he see it. It's this power piece that you guys are in kind of locked in this particular game.

166
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:24.030
Laura Lujan: Um, another one would be like my with my with my animal lover. I got back in his life. Whatever I kind of like told him that I was

167
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:32.700
Laura Lujan: Pretty much. And you'd like any level, but okay. And I'm like, I'm serious, like I already back in the day, or whatever. So

168
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.440
Laura Lujan: I thought that the workout for your I never thought like that. But now I

169
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, let me see if I heard you.

170
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you just say

171
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I hurt you. I don't expect you to trust me 100% right now I need to earn that trust.

172
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. That's what I thought.

173
00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:00.780
Laura Lujan: And you're like, Whoa, like you know you and you're good. I

174
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.150
Laura Lujan: Feel

175
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.680
Laura Lujan: Like the

176
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:13.080
Laura Lujan: Like to me. It was never like that. I always call it. I'm a level, there is no legs, no legs or 30 or whatever.

177
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:25.650
Laura Lujan: No, I was always thought that he should treat me like a kid and athletes who are and how I watched him after and I'm like why I know, but it's just it was always like that and you never understood it and kind of why because it wouldn't work.

178
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the healthy opposite of this. Right.

179
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And a healthy relationship is you expect reciprocity and I'm going to tell you that word is such a great one.

180
00:20:44.220 --> 00:21:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You share responsibility and power. Just because you let's say we're self absorbed during your active addiction. It doesn't mean you are unworthy of the same power responsibility value respect.

181
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not you weren't negative 30

182
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict is a no good rascal, and I get that. But you the authentic self. You are deserving of reciprocity shared responsibility and power.

183
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You were never negative 30 that's that's not that's not true. You may need to earn people's trust again because the addict was making the decisions and I get that. But you were still lovable and worthy the whole time.

184
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It just doesn't mean that you were making some of the decisions I think the addict. Who's making a lot of the decisions when you are using

185
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.680
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

186
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I don't have a lot of respect for the addict. That's the truth. And so I don't have nice things to say.

187
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.310
Laura Lujan: I'm all for today. Right.

188
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But no, I want to talk about this word reciprocity. Have you ever heard it before. Do you have some idea of what it means.

189
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.270
Laura Lujan: Right there.

190
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Reciprocity do you join tell you what it means because it's a pretty important word

191
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.000
Laura Lujan: Right, yeah.

192
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Very with the birth of recreating right

193
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it is not is it you do know it it's just you haven't seen it in this form before

194
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You accept brick reciprocating

195
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication trust love, affection.

196
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Contribution to housework to money to

197
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Power responsibility reciprocating which means give and take, and give day. But what you were doing before was you were less than that you you were unable to 30

198
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You

199
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.960
Laura Lujan: Were not on. So I thought, okay, well,

200
00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.610
Laura Lujan: I don't mind money, I'll pay for it. I mean, what do you do, why

201
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.710
Laura Lujan: Because I don't want

202
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.830
Laura Lujan: To go back to the home. I heard your mom was nothing.

203
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're catching it. You're catching that you're older, you're

204
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Over compensating you're overcome.

205
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's because of this part. You see this word identity.

206
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where it got messed up you you don't quite, I don't think get

207
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not diminish because of what happened.

208
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep reviewing because again we're just doing a light touch will pick this stuff up if you think that coughing is from from tobacco or a cold. What do you think that is

209
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.270
Laura Lujan: Another thing I have a cold.

210
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

211
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That stomach you that that's a

212
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: pretty complex.

213
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach ears.

214
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.120
Laura Lujan: Is it

215
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to make sure, is it a dry cough or is there some Fleming there.

216
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.060
Laura Lujan: You know, there's a lot of one

217
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

218
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.940
Laura Lujan: I early are like growing up. I grew up.

219
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:15.900
Hmm.

220
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Do you want to grab some

221
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to run

222
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:22.530
Okay.

223
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go.

224
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.310
Laura Lujan: I did a lot of them. Oh my god, oh my

225
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.060
Laura Lujan: God, we have a bug out bag.

226
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So you take on other people's problems.

227
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.570
Laura Lujan: But

228
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That falls that falls under an unhealthy boundary. And most likely, I'm guessing it comes from this sense of identity.

229
00:24:50.910 --> 00:25:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I see myself as someone who can be anything and everything I can be the helper. Let me. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. I get my value for being accommodating and helpful, but it's too much of anything even good is too much it depletes you okay and it doesn't

230
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Work. I'll get more into this later.

231
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really hard to not

232
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into each one of these in more depth, but now I'm going to go over. Can you still hear me.

233
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.530
Yeah.

234
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over to, you know, in the problem is yours. And when it belongs to someone else. So you're going to hear me in group and in here. A lot of times, say,

235
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a me problem are you problem. I don't encourage it out loud when we're talking with people because it's going to piss them off, but it's

236
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a good thing to have in your head meeting.

237
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.770
Laura Lujan: Okay, yeah.

238
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You keep inside

239
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.680
Laura Lujan: Your, your thing, and the personal Bob but like

240
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.120
Laura Lujan: Okay, I'm not gonna

241
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Cause a fight with net

242
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:05.760
Laura Lujan: Or

243
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.690
Laura Lujan: Your car.

244
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know well

245
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We there's more elegant, there's more.

246
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Graceful ways of saying that get aren't quite as abrupt

247
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is the thought the thought behind it is you know when it's your problem. So you're, for example, your father's drinking his, his inappropriate behavior.

248
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It is primarily it has affected you profoundly but it is his problem to get treatment needs.

249
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: To say again.

250
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.380
Laura Lujan: Shop. I think sometimes I do it.

251
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's no no no no no no.

252
00:26:52.290 --> 00:27:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not because you're not the cause and in the chicken and egg scenario. It's the chicken that came first. Okay, and you're the egg and dad came first mom came first. So you are not to blame, because you're hurting and angry and resentful deep inside and you act out in some way.

253
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You are not to blame for what problems existed before you were born. Truly these these these issues with your family had nothing to do. You're not the cause of any of it.

254
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:43.260
Laura Lujan: Okay. Oh my god, that is so true divided reading a discovery packet on the call. Oh my God, I thought

255
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.560
Laura Lujan: Oh my gosh.

256
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, because I can't hear you. Hold on.

257
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.030
Laura Lujan: Oh god. Okay.

258
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you just read you share personal information too.

259
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon, we're establishing okay so it's okay.

260
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is the first time you probably ever had it written out like this before.

261
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So listen, this is this is because I believe in your, your, your family dynamic. There was no boundaries. There was no boundaries, psychologically, physically

262
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So you what you thought was normal. You go out into the world and you're doing using those same boundary concepts, but they're too porous. There's too much. We need to close them up just a little. You see what I'm saying, closing up

263
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little. We don't want to give information to openly to people that haven't earned your trust.

264
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.900
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I did. I whenever I thought

265
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.130
Laura Lujan: Everybody from across. I did that I did that through the cracks.

266
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.810
Laura Lujan: And whenever I read out of the god dang, I'm not

267
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.280
Laura Lujan: Like

268
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.070
Laura Lujan: That was awful. Behind me you

269
00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.550
Hear me

270
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

271
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You. Um, here's the deal with it over to the healthy one. We didn't do, let's go over to healthy you share personal information gradually

272
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: In a mutually sharing trusting relationship. So what healthy boundaries look like is let's say you're meeting a new friend and you put a little bit out there.

273
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you know, I've kind of I had a little bit of difficulty when I was younger. You start out, kind of like, and then you get a sense of how this other person handles that information.

274
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If they treat it with respect, or if they. Oh, what kind of bad person, or you will then we're not going to keep sharing our way where you would just wouldn't

275
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.110
Laura Lujan: And

276
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so they do the same thing. If you ever been around someone where you just met them for the first time and they tell you

277
00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Every trauma that has ever happened to them and it's all like first time you met him the first hour

278
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.010
Yeah.

279
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

280
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.070
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

281
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is this. So what is the message now that you're seeing it here that's over on the unhealthy side. What do you think that says about that woman or that man that they would give you everything before you have earned their trust.

282
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:24.450
Laura Lujan: No.

283
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.160
Laura Lujan: Beginning

284
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't have good boundaries. So if they don't have good boundaries for themselves how careful. Are they going to be about yours.

285
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You here in it.

286
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If they can't even see where they end

287
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you begin on that psychological plane.

288
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If they're not willing to moderate and give small bits to you to see how you treat what they say.

289
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.910
Oh,

290
00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Say that again. I didn't hear you.

291
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:09.300
Laura Lujan: All the time to get sympathy, because a lot of people do that, like, I'm not a succession of your Android or whatever, it will try and do you make

292
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.730
Laura Lujan: Me.

293
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, they play the victim and they want sympathy. But guess what, that's not healthy, they just met you.

294
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we just met, and you're trying to be a taker. Then they wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what I'm trying to say like, let's get to know each other, first before you start manipulating my emotions. So we go slow.

295
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's keep going. Next one.

296
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we do, do we do the healthy version.

297
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.930
Laura Lujan: Um, yeah.

298
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Your personal information.

299
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.270
Laura Lujan: Slow or

300
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to this one here.

301
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:47.700
Laura Lujan: You guys

302
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, right.

303
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.270
High

304
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: High

305
00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: High tolerance, you have a really high tolerance. So what you think is normal.

306
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The next is, it is going to be like, how do you put

307
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All of you, you must not have any self respect. How could you do that, right. So every family has their on sort of

308
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Baseline tolerance and we end up taking that out into the world and then we're in new relationships we put up with abuse and disrespect. If it's physical if it's emotional if it's sexual we're putting it out there because this is what we thought was normal.

309
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean you're going to tolerate people doing that a lot more than a person who hasn't had the particular history and upbringing, you've had. Let's go to the next one. So,

310
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.060
Yeah.

311
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.580
Laura Lujan: My friend, Tommy, what are you doing, why have you not yet.

312
00:32:48.030 --> 00:33:00.930
Laura Lujan: Oh my. Excellent. And you know the cops showed up bass and drums guitars and I said no. And I'm so impressed by what the fuck are you. Why are you doing, I just gonna let us know what like

313
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.710
Laura Lujan: You know, and they had to call him I didn't talk

314
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.020
Laura Lujan: About kind of, you know,

315
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's nothing there was nothing wrong with you.

316
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a year cycle at your age and development.

317
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The threat of losing a home safety, the little bit of affection that you have was was too daunting. It was too much of a threat. So, I get it. I do.

318
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.630
Laura Lujan: Work department for her.

319
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.880
Laura Lujan: Yeah, I don't want to get thrown out of it.

320
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:35.910
Laura Lujan: Support

321
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But it but there's a toll on you, Laura.

322
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes a toll.

323
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:52.350
Laura Lujan: backfires I am at the end of the game. If you get a conflict or four times and it but my credit, but the good news is, whenever I turned 18 2013

324
00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:01.050
Laura Lujan: I was mistaken. So that's how I was able to get the apartment. Whenever I turn 18 guess what my credit history got wiped out because I hit the teamwork.

325
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.060
Laura Lujan: For that whole like thing to happen with coffee number and then apartment is nowhere.

326
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about

327
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one level, but I'm not talking about credit. I'm talking about the psychological toll on your sense of identity, your sense of confidence and self esteem. That's the toll, it takes and and on the body.

328
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It keeps there. But let's keep talking because I want to see if we can get all the way through this. We got 10 minutes. These are really complex each one of these could take hours that we're going to just touch lightly on. Okay.

329
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go over to this one, which is your once

330
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your needs and feelings are secondary to others and or sometimes determined by others. So what you think feeling want is second always second

331
00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Deferred yeah to someone else. So that's the unhealthy version they healthy version is you get in touch and you know your what you want. You know what you want. You know what you need. You know how your body feels and you communicate

332
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It clearly this is where therapy comes in right in here. This is where you get in touch with. Wait a minute, this may not be what other people want, but I really want this.

333
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where the new skills come in right in here.

334
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go to the next one. Again, we're just touching briefly we can always come back to these next one you ignore your inner voice.

335
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or here you ignore your inner voice and allow others expectations to define your potential. That sounds like

336
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.850
Laura Lujan: A MOM.

337
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I told you, you find one that matched it perfectly. And there it is.

338
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. That's right. You know, you know, you're a rock star.

339
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And for whatever reason that that a with the plus means something. But it doesn't match reality your reality is you're crushing it.

340
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is how you have to hold on to yourself. The inner voice inside here knowing what you want what you feel what you experience how much work you did to get that grade. She's the one that sat at that test was things are hard.

341
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoe. OK, next one.

342
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute. Did I do the healthy version of that. And no, you healthy version is you're committed to and responsible for exploring nurturing your

343
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: full potential.

344
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So hopefully you'll get that feeling in here when we set goals like well what do you want to do and how, how, what's getting in the way of that is it insecurity. Is it fear is it debt is it I'm

345
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm scared I'm nervous. You know, I'm we that's where we can get into taking small steps to lean in to responsibility, accountability and commitment setting goals. It's going to be what you want, not what I want.

346
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's going to the next one. You feel responsible for other people's happiness and fulfillment.

347
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.670
Laura Lujan: Oh rapper.

348
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. And sometimes rely on your relationships to create that for you. Well, he's not happy. So how can I be happy.

349
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:39.480
Laura Lujan: Right. And I always like, if you are not even like okay, well then, so what am I doing wrong.

350
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.300
Laura Lujan: What am I doing nothing. I'm

351
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:44.940
Laura Lujan: Always thinking

352
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's this one, you take on other people's problems as your own.

353
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, and look, look at the one below it, you tend to absorb the feelings of others.

354
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All right here. Yeah, baby.

355
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's the healthy. What's the healthy version. We've got your so the healthy version is you are only responsible for your own. This is radically difficult

356
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: For people that have been sacrificing their own happiness for others.

357
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You are responsible for your own happiness and fulfillment.

358
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You allow others to be responsible for their own happiness.

359
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know this is brand new to you, Laura. And you're like, How can this be true, how can love look like that.

360
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is so foreign but notice how every single one of these ones on the unhealthy side, you said yes to

361
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because you are, you're in the environment, you are. There's, there's so much room to grow.

362
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going. You absorb the tenants or the feeling of others. We already know you're doing that you value, but a healthy version is you value your opinions and feelings as much

363
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: As anybody else's as much as mine, as much as someone with authority as much as as anybody else's you value your own inner voice.

364
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.470
Laura Lujan: Your moral order.

365
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you value your own opinion.

366
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

367
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, keep let's keep going. We're almost done. We got three more.

368
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Unhealthy WOULD BE YOUR ALLY on other people's opinions feelings and ideas more than you do your own kind of touched on that on this, the healthy version would be you know your limits.

369
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You allow others to define

370
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Their, their own

371
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is much like the top one, which is you can say yes and no.

372
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.650
Laura Lujan: And you can accept someone else's air.

373
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes and no. It's the same thing, isn't it.

374
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

375
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you allow others to define your limits or trying to find them for you. Oh, you can do it. Mom was doing that with a business right there.

376
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: How about how about the opposite, you're able to ask for help. How good are you asking for help.

377
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Her not too good.

378
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.530
Laura Lujan: For you.

379
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're doing you're doing this, you're doing this program. And you said, I'm open to whatever

380
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.530
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

381
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm open right that's that's letting help in

382
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The last one you compromise your values and beliefs.

383
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.490
In order to lead.

384
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Others narrative.

385
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:30.360
Laura Lujan: Wait.

386
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What did we start this whole conversation with

387
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: avoid conflict at all costs. I will jump out the window.

388
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

389
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.870
Laura Lujan: Ah,

390
00:40:44.760 --> 00:41:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what the healthy version. It's exciting those warning this there's hope there's like this other way you're going to get to be that will feel like you're more yourself you're more honest with yourself. You're more connected in a meaningful way with people.

391
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't feel like

392
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: People are always taking from you. You'll also be accepting from others, it will feel different, but it does take time because you're not rehearsed at it. So the healthy version, you don't compromise your values or integrity to avoid rejection abandonment or conflict.

393
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: No joke. When I told you this takes people years so wasn't kidding. This is hard.

394
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

395
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.190
Okay.

396
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to, to, to do this activity today.

397
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.220
Laura Lujan: Oh, I'm all

398
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.320
Laura Lujan: Right.

399
00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you mean by disappointment because I'm, I'm not feeling disappointment. So I wanna. I'm curious about where you're just appointments coming in.

400
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.370
Laura Lujan: Okay, like I just

401
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.270
Laura Lujan: How many

402
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you say I let people I let people down

403
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.060
Yeah.

404
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. Know who you let down

405
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been trying to please everyone.

406
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You let you down.

407
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of where I step in and I say,

408
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't let go, uh, you

409
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to your truth. That's where your inner voices. That's the one that knows when you start to get irritated and angry. That's when one of those inner voice is speaking up

410
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.960
