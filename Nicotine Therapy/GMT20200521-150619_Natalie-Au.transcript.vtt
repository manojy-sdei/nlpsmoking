00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.100
U304AA: Yeah, so

58
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.830
U304AA: I started on pain pills and then

59
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.040
U304AA: A pill epidemic in a

60
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.610
U304AA: They got to where I couldn't afford him. So I started using heroin.

U304AA: I have on the streets. I've never actually reached out to try to get server or clean wasn't you know mean and actually stop everything else.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.290
U304AA: Nose run

72
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.850
Sneezing all

73
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.020
U304AA: Fortunately, I know you gotta go through that to get better. So

74
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.590
Natalie Austin: Right. Have you ever been to any rehab.

75
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.180
U304AA: Have

76
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.220
U304AA: I recently just completed one sad to say three months ago.

77
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.850
Natalie Austin: Okay. Was it like a 90 day 130 day

78
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.760
U304AA: 120 I was there for a month.

79
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.080
Natalie Austin: Wow.

80
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.500
U304AA: And then I completed one about probably

81
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.900
U304AA: Five years ago and it was a six month rehab and patient. Both of them were

82
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.390
Natalie Austin: So what happened when you got out and you feel good enough to stay clean

83
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.880
U304AA: I felt great man. And then I just

84
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.690
U304AA: Start getting these cravings and stuff to where

85
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.810
U304AA: I can control them, you know, mean it just

86
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.510
U304AA: It overpowers me

87
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.190
U304AA: So,

88
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:08.580
Natalie Austin: They teach you like how to overpower that whenever you are in rehab. Did they try to teach you how to overpower

89
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:18.450
U304AA: Yeah, but fortunately, you know when when you don't reach out to try to use it sources, let me cover this part off on WikiLeaks.

90
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.010
Natalie Austin: It's not a bird.

91
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.050
Natalie Austin: I thought you were in an auto shop and somebody was changing the brakes.

92
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.800
Natalie Austin: He's got a bird chirping, I thought that was

93
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.770
Natalie Austin: I thought it was like an air brake.

94
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.240
U304AA: Usually, he's talking

95
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.980
U304AA: Oh,

96
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.830
U304AA: Of course, that don't help the situation but uh yeah they did. And I just

97
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.880
U304AA: I don't know, I just never tried to

98
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.610
U304AA: Try to do it. I guess you know me.

99
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.030
U304AA: It was easier just to go ahead and use and not deal with it, I guess. I don't know.

100
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.850
Natalie Austin: Did you go back and like you're the same patterns with people like the wrong people.

101
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.430
U304AA: No, I didn't. So, craziest part about it.

102
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.220
U304AA: I got rid of all my friends that

103
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.200
U304AA: I did all that. I mean, I was doing. Right. I just

104
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.050
U304AA: Beat the cravings, they will never go away.

105
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.330
Natalie Austin: Okay.

106
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.470
Natalie Austin: So I found

107
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.090

U304AA: I keep a select few. And that's it you know be

111
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.890
Natalie Austin: Good. That's smart.

112
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.120
U304AA: But like I

113
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:44.700
U304AA: I don't know, man. I just have like a bad dream about it or something. I'll wake up and feel like using and then sometimes I can be sometimes I get

114
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.190
U304AA: It, it just overpowered me somehow

115
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.920
Natalie Austin: We're going to work on China. You got to overpower it you know

116
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.270
Ya know,

117
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.750
Natalie Austin: Your brain to say, Look, I don't need you. Get away from me, you know,

118
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:17.190
U304AA: It definitely wasn't a good situation you know me, my mom and girlfriend and to come in and find me in the bathroom like. And luckily, just by luck. The week before that we pick my mom's medicine of a Walgreens, and I put the thing in working in there so

119
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.180
U304AA: Bad at all. That's awesome.

123
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.980
U304AA: Walter he sees you guys and always thought it was always a joke. I mean, always thought you gave up one for another. You say,

124
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.950
U304AA: She's made a point blank and simple to me that it works. If you use it and use it the right way so

125
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.570
Natalie Austin: It does. Absolutely.

126
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.470
U304AA: Unfortunately, you know, I've learned the hard way.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.370
Okay.

324
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.630
Natalie Austin: Do they let you know when your prescriptions are ready. Some

U304AA: Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna set up the app to where it'll let me know.

Natalie Austin: Yep, perfect. And I will text you and they'll see your, your farm your prescriptions ready for pickup. Okay.

328
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.850
Natalie Austin: Are you going to swing by some some CVS is even deliver to because of

329
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.140
Natalie Austin: Corona buyers.

330
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.450
U304AA: Yeah, luckily it's just right up the road.

331
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.550
Natalie Austin: Oh, perfect. Okay.

332
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.220
Natalie Austin: That's good. Okay.

333
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.350
Natalie Austin: Now, do you know on

334
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.480
Natalie Austin: I'ma tell you a little bit about the medicine.

335
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.890
Natalie Austin: You like I said, it's usually it works 12 hours for most people.

336
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.550
Natalie Austin: So if you take an eight o'clock in the morning. I will

337
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:39.780
Natalie Austin: Take it eight o'clock at night. You can play around like an hour here there. But don't take it too soon or two legs. No, it'll like quote run out like I had mentioned

338
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:41.610
Natalie Austin: So,

339
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.310
Natalie Austin: Mixture of spaced out

340
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.210
Natalie Austin: If you have any trouble with that though, just let me know.

341
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.440
U304AA: For sure. Well,

342
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.930
Natalie Austin: We can address we can adjust it accordingly.

343
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.390
Natalie Austin: You can get constipation with this medicine so

344
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.390
Natalie Austin: If you get constipated. You can just get over the counter laxative or drink prune juice.

345
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:15.930
Natalie Austin: But just so you know that that's a side effect. That's one of the big side effects. I had a group. Once we talked about that and 19 out of 20 of the people said yes, they have constipation from it. So,

346
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.370
It's very common.

347
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.460
Natalie Austin: To be aware to see you're not surprised.

348
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.250
U304AA: To worry about. I'm in good shape.

349
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:23.970
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

350
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.070
Natalie Austin: That's that's the main one. Yeah.

351
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.050
Natalie Austin: You know, good.

352
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.920
Natalie Austin: And if you can get laxatives from the Dollar Tree, you know, like a stool softener something

353
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.790
U304AA: Locally, I live with my grandma. So she keeps plenty of fruit juice around

354
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.380
Natalie Austin: The streets.

355
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.280
Natalie Austin: That's funny. There you go.

356
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.140
Natalie Austin: That's easy.

357
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.690
U304AA: Because it's just like an opioid

358
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.130
U304AA: Why she got about any kind of medication you need

359
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.930
Natalie Austin: Yes, she probably has a bunch of laxatives me relax polio.

360
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.900
Natalie Austin: So Glaxo you go

361
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.440
Natalie Austin: And Metamucil I know they have a lot of the elderly use Metamucil lot

362
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.090
U304AA: Seen that

363
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.690
Natalie Austin: That's a good

364
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.620
Yeah.

365
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.870
Natalie Austin: Yeah yeah

366
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:22.050
Natalie Austin: Just drink it. It's like orange or so clear. I think now. Yeah, yeah, that's easy to drink too.

367
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.910
U304AA: And then I'll use the same ID number. They gave me the log into with on Monday.

368
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.850
Natalie Austin: This Monday. Yeah. For me, I'm going to run the group on Monday, because

369
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.840
Natalie Austin: I don't think we're shell. It's a holiday. So we're shells. Not going to be there, but it'll just be me.

370
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.730
Natalie Austin: Yeah, just use this ID.

371
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:47.340
Natalie Austin: For Monday. Whenever I'm normally on Mondays Rochelle runs

372
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.070
Natalie Austin: Her part of the group. She's our therapist.

373
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.960
Natalie Austin: She has a whole

374
00:29:53.490 --> 00:30:02.880
Natalie Austin: Program that she runs and I come in as well. Just to give you guys refills, I kind of sit on the sidelines, but she runs the whole group and she has a different topic every week.

375
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.770
Natalie Austin: And she gives you a different room number every, every day.

376
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:15.120
Natalie Austin: And I wish, I wish. They kept the same room number. That would be so much easier. But I guess because I want you to go through the virtual clinic.

377
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.110
Natalie Austin: To start with,

378
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.190
Natalie Austin: You have to sign in.

379
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:18.840
Natalie Austin: To the

380
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.460
Natalie Austin: Like what the secretary and

381
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:26.640
Natalie Austin: Then she puts you into the room. It's kind of like being a doctor's office when you go when you see the receptionist.

382
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.260
Natalie Austin: Maybe have to fill out some quizzes or whatever.

383
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.840
Natalie Austin: Find your forms and go into the room.

384
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:45.120
U304AA: It sounds so crazy. But, you know, like it's easier for me to do this at home, of course, but like I feel more comfortable. I've been able to sit at my own house mean over the talk about it, instead of like a ton of a bunch of other people. You know me.

385
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.200
Natalie Austin: Right, right.

386
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:56.880
U304AA: That's why I really never went to go get the hell I was like I told her I and I didn't even know she was doing this, like this. You mean like that's what she didn't want to let me know you know me so

387
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.900
Natalie Austin: Well, I'm glad you're doing this. Yeah, it's not. It's nice for a lot of people

388
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.140
Natalie Austin: It's very, it's more private. You're right.

389
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.090
U304AA: Absolutely. For sure.

390
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.550
U304AA: And then whenever we have group.

391
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:14.280
Natalie Austin: There's probably like 10 people in the group. There's buttons down the bottom, there's a mute button.

392
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.440
Natalie Austin: And there's a stop video button to see that.

393
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.310
U304AA: Yeah.

394
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:24.570
Natalie Austin: You just hit that Like if you can stop that, for if you have to, like, go to the bathroom or something you don't want us to see your bathroom.

395
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.310
Natalie Austin: Right. Or if you have to scratch your nose or pick your nose. Yeah, we do that.

396
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.940
Natalie Austin: Right unmute for someone in the background. SCREAMING

397
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.820
Natalie Austin: Or the mailman at your door.

398
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.900
U304AA: Just hit me boy.

399
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.480
Natalie Austin: Yeah, or the dogs barking or just just hit the mute button right

400
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.600
Natalie Austin: Absolutely. Okay, and then

401
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.420
Natalie Austin: Those are like little features for your

402
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.330
Natalie Austin: For your making more comfortable to

403
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:59.640
Natalie Austin: Go well sometimes I'm the therapist will mute everybody. It will never she's talking so just go down the line just hit mute all

404
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.410
Natalie Austin: You see that that's she just did that for everybody so she could you guys can hear her.

405
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:05.400
U304AA: Okay.

406
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:17.190
Natalie Austin: Because some people are like, in the car, and they don't know to hit that mute button and you can hear outside noise and stuff. So see, we have one guy that calls us in from a construction site so we can hear all this

407
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.140
All this stuff in the background.

408
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.230
Natalie Austin: meeting him. That's funny.

409
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.570
U304AA: That'll be me in the future. Yeah.

410
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:31.200
Natalie Austin: There you go. Yeah, he has this hard hat on everything, but she has to mute him. Good. You can hear everything in the background is kind of funny.

411
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.870
Natalie Austin: That's awesome. Yeah, our group was really finally people really nice you'll like it.

412
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:37.860
U304AA: Alright.

413
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.180
Natalie Austin: So, good good good crew.

414
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:50.280
Natalie Austin: We also have groups on Thursdays at noon and six. But those are pretty full. But if you happen to miss on Monday, you can always make it up on a Thursday. Okay.

415
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.150
U304AA: I want this. I'm going to stay on top of it and we're trying our hardest just on

416
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.540
Natalie Austin: Least you have some support. That's good.

417
00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.490
U304AA: Absolutely. For sure.

418
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.100
Natalie Austin: I'm sure your grandmother's EXCITED TO ABOUT YOU.

419
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.630
U304AA: Yeah.

420
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.560
U304AA: I told my mom. She's like, Well, why didn't you do. And so I'm telling me, and I'm like, and you know, of course, there's places right

421
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.080
U304AA: To do this, but

422
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.860
U304AA: I've tried it once and it don't never work out like that. Because when you get there, you're around all those people I just go

423
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.510
Natalie Austin: Right.

424
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.860
Natalie Austin: Here, this is a more private settings. Exactly.

So you can

426
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.640
Natalie Austin: You can like you said you could just do this if you're like embarrassed or something. Just do that.

427
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.450
Natalie Austin: Real. I think it's very easy to talk to the group, they're not

428
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.850
Natalie Austin: They're not judgmental, you know, they're not gonna

429
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.030
Natalie Austin: They're all very positive group.

430
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.070
Natalie Austin: They're all just like you just, you know, want to

431
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.110
Natalie Austin: Enjoy life and get better.

432
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.700
U304AA: Yes, correct.

433
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:55.530
U304AA: Did you guys also have, like, can you guys also prescribe my elevator and stuff like that, too, or no.

434
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.000
Natalie Austin: I'm

435
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.300
U304AA: Saying for, I guess,

436
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.360
Natalie Austin: If you can't find a doctor, I think we could

437
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.190
Natalie Austin: Okay, I have to find out.

438
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.330
Natalie Austin: About that.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:13.590
Natalie Austin: You're unable to find Dr. Let me know. And I can ask my boss. See if we can offer

440
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.370
Natalie Austin: Me, I want to look in this I have to look to this.

441
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.430
Natalie Austin: Ohio automated Rx reporting system here. How do you spell your last name.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.770
Natalie Austin: How do you say that

447
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.240
U304AA: Reminds

Natalie Austin: What's your zip code.

451
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:57.300
Four or 5106106

452
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:05.100
Natalie Austin: Have you got prescriptions outside of Ohio YOU'RE GETTING IN PENNSYLVANIA. OR West Virginia.

453
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.410
U304AA: Kentucky.

454
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.270
Natalie Austin: Kentucky did okay

455
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.720
U304AA: Yeah, but I've never been prescribed those in Kentucky.

456
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.500
Okay.

457
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.440
Natalie Austin: And you said he pretty much got this off the street, though, so I don't think we'll ever see anything on here.

458
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.590
Natalie Austin: Right, yeah. Never got a prescription so

459
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.190
U304AA: Unfortunately, my accumulated elevate has always been prescribed to me when I've been incarcerated.

460
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.130
U304AA: Because I never followed the doctor because of my addiction to me.

461
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.840
Natalie Austin: Ah, OK.

462
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.140
U304AA: So you'll probably have a hard time finding any other thrill.

463
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.790
Natalie Austin: Okay, that's fine. You need to find a doctor for your opponent. Definitely.

464
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:52.440
U304AA: Yeah, for sure.

465
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.360
Natalie Austin: Definitely do that.

466
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.730
U304AA: It's easy. It's called the insurance company now for everyone. Right.

467
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.050
Natalie Austin: Yes. Yep.

468
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:08.580
Natalie Austin: No dogs. It's funny, and make sure that if the doctor can't do the elevator and let me know. But hopefully they can do both. I'll make it easier for you.

469
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.280
U304AA: Absolutely, yeah.

470
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:17.370
Natalie Austin: Nothing showing up in here, but that's okay. That's, yeah. You just said you didn't get any prescriptions anywhere else. So

471
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.600
Right.

472
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.050
