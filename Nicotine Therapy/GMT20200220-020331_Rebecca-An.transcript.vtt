00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.659
ethant: Hello.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.759
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, how are you

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.510
ethant: This is Ethan.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, how are you

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.590
ethant: I'm pretty I'm okay.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's everything going

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.280
ethant: Well,

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.260
ethant: I'm

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.500
ethant: I'm like, kind of easing back into work that's my main that's the thing that was on my mind. The most

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.250
Uh huh.

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.130
ethant: Yeah, and work has kind of been a little bit rough, I guess, to be honest.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why tell me about it.

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.690
ethant: Well, I am I'm in a really kind of

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.670
ethant: unusual situation because my actually, my job is ending we sold our company.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.320
ethant: This isn't my choice. But when the company was sold

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:09.660
ethant: Like last year. So this year we're kind of at the end of this phase of merging a company together with a company in Germany.

17
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.610
ethant: Are you there.

18
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry about that.

19
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so your company was sold and

20
00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:03.420
ethant: So that was about a year ago, and we're in the final or that was like nine months ago, I guess. And so we're in this final three month period or my job is supposed to be all wrapped up by

21
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.210
ethant: Sometime in July, I think.

22
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
ethant: So it's really this is a company I've been working for for 10 years. So it's really

23
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.750
ethant: Suited on the one hand it's intensely sad that that

24
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.810
ethant: My job is wrapping up and all these people that I've worked with

25
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.340
ethant: Forever like leaving

26
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.990
ethant: On the other hand, I created all this damage.

27
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.410
ethant: Because I basically my

28
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180
ethant: Relapse adventure was over the same period. So

29
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:45.510
ethant: The people in Germany all know me, I'm like one of the leaves of the moon, the VP of the San Francisco based company and they all know me and they they seem to have sort of

30
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.280
ethant: No one's ever

31
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.820
ethant: Had any harsh words with me. So they seem to they kind of know that I'm this like fragile or dealt, you know, they know that I have these like health problems and

32
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.740
ethant: So they're kind of tiptoeing around me in this weird way.

33
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.560
ethant: So I don't know, there's just a lot of and there's a possibility of extending extending my contract there, but I didn't know what rate. I'm going to get and

34
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.990
ethant: If I don't extend my contract. I have to go start looking for a new job. And then there's a huge amount of fear around that. Because like

35
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.690
ethant: I we actually had this incident where my wife and I both got arrested for domestic violence called to the police.

36
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.660
ethant: Have all these like new arrest on my record and I'm sure it's going to impact my job search

37
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What kind of line of work.

38
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.700
ethant: So I worked in tech i'm a i'm

39
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the

40
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.770
ethant: Platform infrastructure group for a dating website.

41
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.400
ethant: So I don't work locally, but they do background checks at these companies, you know,

42
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right on. So it's

43
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.620
ethant: Um, so anyway, it's just this huge jumble of like screwed up relationships and fear around this and here on that one.

44
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.870
It's tough.

45
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's an opera, there might be an opportunity that you can stay with the company that you're at

46
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.820
ethant: So that's a possibility. I started sort of negotiating with them closing this window.

47
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.010
ethant: started negotiating with them to see if. Really what it is is that like they don't pay the same salaries in Berlin as they do in San Francisco.

48
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.220
ethant: Very high salary.

49
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:51.990
ethant: I have in terms of the range within the company. I'm at the high end for, you know, I'm not an executive, but I'm like at the highest level for individual contributor, so

50
00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:03.480
ethant: So I've been enjoying the actually gave me these golden handcuffs that so it's really bizarre. I've been like this through this whole relapse. I've had like more money coming in than I've ever made my life and

51
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.840
ethant: The company, pretty much won't fire me no matter what I do because they need me so bad for to like wrap up these final details.

52
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Which is good, but

53
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.710
Um,

54
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.340
ethant: So I don't know. It's just, you know, like

55
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:27.690
ethant: Especially in the first weeks of like trying to get over. It's like you're revisiting all these relationships that you've like steamrolled over for the light in the last, you know, for as long as you've been using

56
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:37.410
ethant: Every day is like a new little encounter with somebody who I forgot about or I left hanging. Right. You know, I was basically working in a blackout for like

57
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.830
Months.

58
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you still have your job.

59
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do some glass. Right.

60
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.150
Like bright sides to it.

61
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.870
ethant: You know making all this money. I shouldn't be complaining about that.

62
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.940
ethant: But I really have to get into action to like

63
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.390
ethant: Get my act together and you know either stay with this company for a little while, or find another job. You know, so there's a lot of like

64
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.970
ethant: Anxiety around that.

65
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, stress and fear. Definitely. I don't blame you. Um, you can always you know go just start looking and see what's you know out there just kind of exploring and researching and seeing what's available, you know,

66
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:37.410
ethant: Yeah, I mean, I realized that it comes down to simple sort of just action, but, um, I don't know, I've been in like damage control mode.

67
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.300
ethant: Sure, um,

68
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.830
ethant: What it's been a couple of weeks or something. Since I sort of stopped and started doing sessions with bright heart, um,

69
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:58.620
ethant: Which is so that's, that's great. And I can tell like relationship my moods GETTING A LITTLE MORE STEADY and my relationship with my family sort of stabilizing and I kind of cleaned up all the

70
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.510
ethant: Bills and crap. That was a look in the apartment and and some kind of chipping away at it, but it's like

71
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.500
ethant: It sounds so simple, but I just haven't even had an afternoon. You know where I'm like, Okay, time to, like, look for ago you know

72
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.820
I'm busy.

73
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.360
ethant: Well yeah, I mean I'm and I'm also

74
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:24.510
ethant: Probably you know partially my fault, but just because of the nature of his joggers like any given day there's like five different crises happening happening.

75
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:35.700
ethant: Part of it is just because that's the way the company operates and part of it is because I screwed up for like several months and left all this stuff in this half finished state and nobody knows what to do and

76
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're cleaning up cleaning up everything at work.

77
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.520
ethant: You know,

78
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's kind of crazy and hectic.

79
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.880
Yeah.

80
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I just

81
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Absorbed many weeks. How many weeks. Have you been

82
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sober

83
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.160
ethant: Like a week and a half or something.

84
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:02.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're like, at the very beginning. I mean, literally, the very beginning of this. So you've just got to

85
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: one foot in front of the other. Right now, you know,

86
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you have some time to start exploring online, you know, for your type of work and what's available and just start

87
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Looking, you know, you still have some months that you don't have to, you know, worry about it, but

88
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:27.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely just exploring and putting your feet out there, but don't make it to a point that it stresses you out. You know what I mean.

89
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you have plenty of time and just keeping your options open and taking a look and seeing what's available and in order to mean just doing what you're doing. I'm really and if you get to a point where you feel like it's stressing you out back off a little bit.

90
00:08:46.500 --> 00:09:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, get back right back to the basics to the beginning, you know, things, making sure you know that you are eating healthy and that you're sleeping enough and you know where's your emotions. You know how they've been sitting

91
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really,

92
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, paying attention to those things is just as important to not one of the most you know definitely some of the most important things when when you change your life like you happen

93
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of give yourself time

94
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

95
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:28.260
ethant: Yeah, I know. I have a friend who's been sober for 20 years or something. And he's, he has this he says that however long you are marching walking into the forest. When you turn around, it's going to take you that long to walk out of the forest.

96
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.410
ethant: Which

97
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.680
ethant: Like I found it to be roughly true

98
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.170
ethant: In the path, like, as you know, I've been sober for long periods of time, but

99
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.580
ethant: You get your life gets your problems get compound on one on top of one another and

100
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.860
ethant: It's just like everything my relationships, my legal problems. My

101
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.540
ethant: Just finances.

102
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:06.510
ethant: Family, the stuff of my wife does everything just sort of was totally fucked like two weeks ago now.

103
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.000
ethant: Slightly better but

104
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work in Progress now work in progress, you know, and that's just where you've got to keep it in order. I mean, it's a work in progress, you know, don't try to to run forward or try to do things ahead of time. But really, just put one foot in front of the other and

105
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, do it one day at a time and

106
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it sounds like you cleaning things up at work.

107
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.570
Right, making things better.

108
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what

109
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.800
ethant: Yeah, I said, yeah, I was agreeing with you, um,

110
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.170
ethant: It's, it's been hard like it was a little bit of like a deadlock of like

111
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.410
ethant: Things are so screwed up. It took me like

112
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:13.740
ethant: Three. It took me like five days to, like, read on my email and like figure out what was going on. But so I don't know if I talked to you like a couple days ago, I'd be even more stress, but now I'm like okay there's like these are the three top crises and I have to work on these things.

113
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:22.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which makes sense, you know, staying busy too is a good thing. So, you know, it's probably a good thing that you're busy at work.

114
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that you're able to go back in and clean up these things and and fix some of these things, you know. So a lot of people they don't have that chance it's

115
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they lose their job and their addiction and, you know, they lose the relationships and they lose the house and they lose all these things. And you've been able to get to a point where

116
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You haven't lost that yet. Yep. You know what I mean.

117
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it gets it does get better, you know,

118
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to keep doing it.

119
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

120
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I go to meetings.

121
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:13.920
ethant: Know come pretty turned off by I haven't found any meetings where I feel comfortable. I haven't gone in a while, but I went like when this relapse started, I was in and out of the rooms for like a, you know, three, three to six months.

122
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:26.250
ethant: I got this like hardcore book Thumper sponsor and and we read the book kind of slowly and met every week for several months and finally got to the third step, and he's like,

123
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He didn't want to do it unless

124
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:35.280
ethant: I was serious, you know, unless I was serious about it and I just couldn't look into the I realized like, I don't really actually believe in the

125
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:42.330
ethant: Book. So I was like, no, you know, I guess I can't really tell you though. I'm gonna surrender myself and like

126
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.220
ethant: And

127
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:52.890
ethant: And so, yeah, it kind of fell apart there. And anybody that was kind of like a I have like one friend who's, who has the same story that I do.

128
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.370
ethant: But he was over in a for many years and

129
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:06.660
ethant: He relaxed. But then when he tried to go back. It's like everybody's SPEAKING GREEK AND IT JUST DOESN'T you realize how much

130
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.460
ethant: You kind of were pretending that

131
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.070
ethant: The first time around.

132
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.840
ethant: Yeah, I mean, it's funny people

133
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.580
ethant: And I know that probably send it to some people. Sounds like intellectual pride or whatever. But like, and literally like

134
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:36.240
ethant: Why, if I were to get up in a meeting and say that I'm working with steps, not working for me and all this. I can't know it would be like lying because I don't really believe in it.

135
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would tell me what part. You certainly

136
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.810
ethant: Tell you, when

137
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well part you struggle with.

138
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.980
ethant: What part I started with. I don't know if

139
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: you struggle with. Sorry.

140
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.550
ethant: Oh, well. It was the

141
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.840
ethant: Mean specifically is like the language around the steps in God and stuff that that um

142
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.790
ethant: That I

143
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.380
ethant: Have a big problem with okay

144
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like what kind of language.

145
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.070
ethant: I don't know, though, like powerlessness and surrender and all that stuff.

146
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:26.370
ethant: Father and like we are his children. It's like I've been sober for 10 years and like I kind of said that even though I didn't believe it, but now I'm like, No, I don't believe it.

147
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:46.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and here's the thing is that your belief system as yours and you get to form your recovery around whatever that is. Right. It's funny because I just had this conversation the other day with somebody else. And we really kind of dissected the, the word powerlessness, a little bit.

148
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And one thing that that kind of stuck out was that

149
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The phrase in it says that we were not that we are but that

150
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.150
We were

151
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.880
ethant: Interesting.

152
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so just that just that one word change.

153
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.010
ethant: Yeah.

154
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it gives it a whole different understanding because if you think about it, your life was chaos, you know, your work was going, you know, going down hill your relationship with the word going down hill.

155
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But they're not now.

156
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right. And so it made even more sense to me to after I read it and it is kind of a cycle of chaos, you know, really.

157
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't even really, you know, realize that that's what's going on. And again, you know, you are kind of the exception because most people have to lose everything before they finally

158
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, get it and you know you've been able to say, yeah, this is enough. I need to get back, you know, on the right track.

159
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so there's that piece.

160
00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And a lot of people do have issues with the God thing you know it is. It does feel like it's

161
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Christian based, you know. Yeah.

162
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

163
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:17.160
ethant: There's another there's like an alternative one that's like more Buddhist, apparently, but it's also very, it's very strict about sobriety. It's like

164
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.050
ethant: They're

165
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.080
ethant: In this sponsorship structure and all that kind of stuff. Right.

166
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.990
ethant: Having wrong right what what's up.

167
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Referee. It's called refuge for recovery. I can't speak. Yeah.

168
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what it's called. Yeah.

169
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:43.260
ethant: Yeah, so I could, I mean that's on me is that I really could be more active. And I also had been a smart recovery meetings I actually kind of like this.

170
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.560
ethant: So I'm

171
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Going back

172
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:55.500
ethant: Yeah, I haven't made any commit like specific commitments of anybody or or myself but um

173
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:57.960
ethant: But

174
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.420
ethant: Yeah, I've been like I'm sort of like, Oh, I should do that.

175
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.810
ethant: Friday might be a good day to do that.

176
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.820
ethant: Every meeting that I've never been to that I hear is really good on Friday.

177
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So maybe that should be your commitment for the week.

178
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:17.820
ethant: Yeah.

179
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.710
ethant: You know what, that's a good idea.

180
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is to do that, um,

181
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was I gonna say

182
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many you had you had 10 years sober.

183
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.500
ethant: Yeah.

184
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:39.900
ethant: I had like more than 10 years. I mean, I lost track. I don't know. It was like between 10 and 15 like 11 or 12

185
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. And how did you do it.

186
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:59.760
ethant: What the beginning I was really desperate for the four years, one and two. I was just, I was so desperate is that time I lost my place to live and stuff, or I was right on the edge of losing my place to live. So I I'm

187
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.120
ethant: I was way past losing the job and all that.

188
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.770
ethant: So I was a little bit more desperate and I

189
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.690
ethant: I can't remember at the beginning. Did I go to a six month program and man.

190
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:25.470
ethant: I've been to lots of programs, though in my life. Um, but yeah, I just got willing and I started going to in a me that's the other thing is that a meeting every day. I can't quite get that's like

191
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.290
ethant: I don't

192
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.890
ethant: Have enough years of sobriety where I wasn't where a wasn't the first thing in my life.

193
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:41.130
ethant: That's what struck me where I'm like a kind of want to get back what I had, you know, I was in pretty good shape.

194
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:50.370
ethant: I wasn't driving drunk. I didn't. There were no major, major problems. I just like I had this combination of like a surgery and

195
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:59.700
ethant: You know, major change at work and these things like multiple things kind of happened at the same time and not sort of knocked me out of my recovery.

196
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:10.710
ethant: Add this new you know my my marriage of my wife and she was like she kind of got to the point where she was like, encouraging she you know she didn't realize how serious this variety was

197
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:17.340
ethant: So I don't know, is this crazy come combination of things that are going to knock me out of the off the path.

198
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:29.520
ethant: It's like, I don't want, I want to get back to that. But I'm like I wasn't going to seven meetings a day for, like, years and years and years. And so I don't just have such a heart, you know, and they're telling you you have to do that.

199
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.770
ethant: Or you're going to go. I

200
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.640
ethant: Know, so if you start going six or five days a week and then suddenly you drink, they're like, well, there you go. You know, you were

201
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are those judgment of people yes I do agree but

202
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember that it's theirs. They're purely suggestions.

203
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if they if somebody is taking up above and beyond and saying that this is what you have to do, you know, then

204
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, not so there

205
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.300
ethant: You don't say it is what you have to do, but they say if I'm going to work with you, your spot.

206
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.040
ethant: Okay, great. So

207
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: These are my expectations and what I

208
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.680
ethant: Pull that appear to be doing.

209
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.820
ethant: Some, like I actually read on Reddit like

210
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:29.310
ethant: Some guy was like yeah, just go to a just totally ignore everything like all the stuff about the steps in the book and the sponsorship and just everybody. Hey, we already talked about smart recovery. And there's other options.

211
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there definitely is. But, you know, tell me. Um, so you were able to maintain for the first couple years going to meetings and doing all of that. But how did you maintain for the last five

212
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.500
ethant: I just sort of got in the right patterns. Yeah, I like my job. I get

213
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.480
ethant: You know, I had so much of a life that

214
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.150
ethant: And I'm it's weird, like you can just relax. I didn't. I don't like to drink anymore.

215
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.260
ethant: I'll call is like not something that attracts me

216
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:13.170
ethant: So when and if you're not doing alcohol, you have to kind of go out of your way to like be in a situation where you're tempted by like anything else. Right, right. So, I DON'T KNOW YOU JUST I WAS JUST, sir.

217
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.990
ethant: I was utterly convinced that are not even convinced like i don't i'm not i don't want to drink. I don't like

218
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.810
ethant: It seems like

219
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.400
ethant: yucky.

220
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:30.930
ethant: So, yeah.

221
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me,

222
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give me a little more information on your that's

223
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where do I start

224
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.400
ethant: I keep tracing it back to the surgery.

225
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:56.490
ethant: But really, so it was a surgery and at around the same time. My primary care had prescribed me anxiety. Medic like take it as much as you know QED.

226
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.330
ethant: benzodiazepine like because I was

227
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:00.540
ethant: Having

228
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.370
ethant: I was having panic attacks.

229
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:10.560
ethant: And we tried all these other things and then like he gave me these pills and like once in two or three months. I just have these episodes.

230
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:23.220
ethant: And so one time I had an episode and I took the pill and and like I went to sleep and and then I woke up and I felt fine and it's like I feel like I'm having fit you know at the time. I don't know if I still like

231
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.040
ethant: So anyway, that was one thing that there was sort of like so.

232
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:37.020
ethant: That was like a change like I wouldn't, I wasn't doing that when like earlier in sobriety.

233
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

234
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.660
ethant: And then the other thing that happened was my surgery. And then I got all these great pain meds.

235
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:51.510
ethant: And I got kind of fascinated with like pills and I started searching and like reading about all the pill dealers on Reddit and everything.

236
00:22:52.740 --> 00:23:03.300
ethant: And I always thought it was like those things. Plus, my wife, who was like I described, like we've been married at that point for like six or seven years.

237
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.520
ethant: And she

238
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:15.720
ethant: wasn't convinced that I like that. I'm an addict or she didn't understand really from in my case, you know,

239
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:25.020
ethant: Actually for much of the it was, it wasn't until like the end of she kind of halfway into this year long period. She was like, wow, it makes you happier here. Like, you know,

240
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:41.730
ethant: There's absolutely there is a positive part of, like, all this druggies for you, like, I see this like more inspiring part of your personality that didn't used to come out before so I took her a while to kind of took her. We had to see a lot of consequences before

241
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

242
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.640
ethant: You know, she started she

243
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.890
ethant: Realized that it's better for me to steer clear of all that stuff.

244
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

245
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.830
ethant: Process for both of us. Anyway, those are kind of the ingredients.

246
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know that

247
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Opiates

248
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:06.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And alcohol attach they affect the same receptors in your brain.

249
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm, so

250
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:18.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It makes perfect sense that after you had surgery, you're on pain meds. You know those little receptors, they will go up.

251
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, and so there they are alive and well and then add let's add some benzo to it to, you know, which is a horrible cocktail, you know, definitely. It's, it's definitely a risk.

252
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For OD those two together.

253
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But then, let's add alcohol into a to, you know, so you've got three depressants on board.

254
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As a

255
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:50.850
ethant: Drink. I'm telling you, like the only time I drank I drank like this whole relapse. A great like three times.

256
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.580
Maybe something like that.

257
00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So explain it to me walk me through it a little bit.

258
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.380
ethant: Walk you through

259
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The first time that you drink.

260
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.810
ethant: That I drank specifically

261
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. In this relax knowing

262
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:23.040
ethant: Only reason I would drink as if I was doing cocaine, because I would get so like sort of over take a huge dose of cocaine and like my heart's racing in my body so tense that I'd have to, I was just looking for medicine to like try

263
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.820
ethant: To calm my body down. That's the only reason I would pick up alcohol.

264
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you were doing coke before you were doing.

265
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is your story you relapsed on what Coke and then I'll go. Whoa.

266
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.770
Oh,

267
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.160
ethant: There's the pills. It was like, oh, I could I could

268
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:49.050
ethant: Get some pain pills. I couldn't tell you exactly when the first time I managed to buy some I bought them on the street.

269
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.740
ethant: Or know there's a there's a buddy of mine, he's sober sober for

270
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.120
ethant: Almost as long as I was drinking drinking using but

271
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:12.930
ethant: I don't know. There was like a friend in my life who is like an active alcoholic who had all these connections to like deal arisen.

272
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.740
ethant: See think that was another little part of the part of the

273
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.600
ethant: Part of the process that you know the relapse process.

274
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is your volume up the streets when I couldn't get them from the doctor.

275
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:38.700
ethant: Oh no, I had this friend like era, I had this person in my life who like I was witnessing him using and trying to get sober, but he had all these connections. Right, so like

276
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:49.410
ethant: For example, you're asking me, how did I first relax, like I might have called him up and said like, Hey, give me the number of your dealer or something. I can't remember the exact like sequence of events at this point.

277
00:26:51.630 --> 00:27:11.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, to really stop and dissect and take a look at, you know, the picture as a whole because what we want to do is put I call them roadblocks in place. So when, if you have those situations. Again, you'll know you'll have these blocks in place and you'll know exactly what to do. Right.

278
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

279
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that

280
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:27.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely opiates surgeries, you know, that definitely can put anybody that suffers from addiction, you know, on in high risk situations and so

281
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:38.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, one thing is you know if you have any medical conditions, you know, coming up in the near future to, you know, make sure that you have an accountability, buddy.

282
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Somebody that can help.

283
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:52.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Help you with your pain meds and monitor and you feel free to be able to talk to if if you start having thoughts of getting getting them from a dealer or, or, you know, continuing in that

284
00:27:53.400 --> 00:28:07.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With bentos it's really a risk. If you take them a lot because they're of usable. They're addictive and they are so hard to detox from when you become physically addictive.

285
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it seems to be a longer drawn out process, then you know a lot of the other substances and and so really paying attention. Are you currently taking the business Benz's

286
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:28.830
ethant: So I have a current prescription, but I don't. I haven't been taking them or I guess so. In the past week like since

287
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.600
ethant: I'm

288
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.890
ethant: So since I started talking to Braveheart I've taken like one day I took one. And on another day took a half

289
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:38.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Day.

290
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:46.170
ethant: That was, that was, I was like, last week, so it's been like, I don't know. It's been seven days since I took it, something like that.

291
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.010
Okay.

292
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:54.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just, you know, be really aware, you know, if you're taking him every day, you know,

293
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:08.100
ethant: That's a I am pretty keenly aware of that slippery slope. But I really I like what you said about the roadblock. Because realistically, I have this all started because of my medical problems.

294
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:17.790
ethant: Right. One way to look at it. I have legitimate anxiety I have legitimate pain, pain sometimes like when I had the surgery or

295
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:28.320
ethant: I get these I have Chiari malformation, I have this other thing that makes me jerk my head to the side of always forgetting what it's called. It's a call.

296
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.120
To come in.

297
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.140
ethant: Have you heard of this before. It's like, where you have this twitch.

298
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

299
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't even think of what the one that I do. No.

300
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Contracts, no it's not Tourette's because you yeah

301
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.500
ethant: Yeah.

302
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tourette's is allowed.

303
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:57.630
Here.

304
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:09.060
ethant: We go in, I am I get both four times a year. I go in and get a Botox treatment in my neck to try to treat those

305
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.350
ethant: It's a spinal like neck condition.

306
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:29.220
ethant: Anyway, um, when the neurologist figured out that I have it. They're like, oh, and the problem with it is, it can cause pain and it isn't for me right now. Right. So, but later in my life I could. It's

307
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:41.250
ethant: It's for I think it's, it tends to develop and get worse. So I don't know. We're trying to manage it with the Botox. But anyway, I just like what you said about the roadblocks.

308
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, thought blocks.

309
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:51.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really, you know, and knowing you know and really paying attention. You know when you're in

310
00:30:51.630 --> 00:31:02.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those types of situations, your medical stuff comes up medical stuffs always going to come up. We're always going to have these things that's going to require us to be on this matter that met or whatever.

311
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:20.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what I hear is that you were comfortable in your life and everything's going fine you know you're sober you doing the deal you live in, and you had the surgery, you got the payments for the surgery and that kind of opened up.

312
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The door a little bit. It kind of woke back up. You know what you had laid dormant for a while.

313
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:35.040
ethant: He was the combination of things really that will get back out. But once I was fully woken up and I engaged with it, then it was like, I didn't have

314
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.240
ethant: It took a long time for me to become convinced again that

315
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.980
ethant: There's no, there's no path here where it's not going to end in misery.

316
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.480
ethant: Right. You know, I was like, Oh, I've never really had a big problem with opiates.

317
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:58.350
ethant: Like I've always been, it's always been cocaine or alcohol. So I'll just try like taking opiates and I'll be all about it. And, you know, take them once it once a month or something like that.

318
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.350
ethant: And today, that should be fine for me and actually did that for a while and then like I don't know, I just got on a roll with

319
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:05.820
It.

320
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:19.890
ethant: It's, it's not so much about God, or like powerlessness or anything. I think of it is just like patterns like life patterns with my thinking. Yeah, it's like

321
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:34.860
ethant: The problem is that with all these substances and my personality. I get in a pattern where I take enough of it that it messes up my thinking my decision making and I decided to sort of like an endless cycle.

322
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.300
ethant: Right.

323
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:44.280
ethant: It's really simple, like I got they're using these drugs and I've gotten they're using other drugs and it's like, um,

324
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that bottom line, and even his addiction. Yeah, and you know there is

325
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's three phases to relapse. Also, you know, there's the mental, emotional, and then the physical

326
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that you're in risky situations when you know you've got a lot of stress going on when relationships are are stressful or work is stressful, or you're not eating right, you're not, you know, sleeping enough. Those are stressful risky situations.

327
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.620
ethant: It was this amazing combination of things.

328
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:29.580
ethant: Like I because I are just described to you that one of the ingredients in this was my job. Suddenly was ending

329
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:38.010
ethant: With a stable job for 10 years and all of a sudden I learned, like how you're going to be ever. Right. So that was another one of the ingredients in

330
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.150
ethant: In the sort of setting the stage for that.

331
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:42.630
ethant: Again,

332
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.070
ethant: Go down this road, you know,

333
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:55.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so really taking a look at the stressful stuff that was going on in your life and knowing that those are risks. Those are high risk areas you know I'm

334
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

335
00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:04.500
ethant: I'm still in the high risk area. The one ingredient that's changed as my wife is now convinced that I can't like these guys.

336
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.500
ethant: And that's a big deal that my wife's Steve she won't be supportive of me, you know,

337
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

338
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.220
ethant: She was, she was totally fine with it so

339
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Much not so and that that's

340
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:22.770
ethant: I don't want to sound codependent but that that in and of itself, my major.

341
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:24.840
ethant: Difference.

342
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.340
ethant: She has a big influence on me. It's funny, she's half my age, but she like

343
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.330
ethant: Because we're partners and were together.

344
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: EVERYBODY LIKE.

345
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How it should be right.

346
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely back and forth. That's how chippy

347
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.130
ethant: Why I like

348
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:49.140
ethant: The little her already or be like I'm though I should be the strong one. And the relationship but

349
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.060
ethant: Definitely. She's like she has a big impact on my life.

350
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.240
ethant: So I'm not, I don't mean to sound like

351
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.060
ethant: I'm not very masculine or

352
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.150
ethant: Did you cut off.

353
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey there.

354
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.860
I'm here.

355
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of drive me crazy. Um,

356
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.630
ethant: I don't know if it's your internet or mine or combination

357
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I might spend been playing games with me all day long. So

358
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:10.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know what is going on with it. But, um, anyways. What I was trying to say is that a partnership is 5050 and so you know it's good that

359
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You both should have that influence over each other. You know what I mean.

360
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:26.130
ethant: Yeah, yeah, I did. And I was trying to say that I said something that sounded like I'm like the big man in the relationship or that's not really not the way that I think so. I didn't need to frame it that way.

361
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:44.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's all right. That's all right. I get it. Okay, so we need to work on paying attention to your thoughts and we need to work on paid attention to when you're stressed out, we need to work on making sure that you are putting

362
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:55.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Semi healthy food in your body you're drinking enough water, and that you're getting enough sleep at night because those are the core core elements, you know, self care.

363
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.090
ethant: Is so concurrently.

364
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

365
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you find your emotions, a little crazy, you know, do a check in with yourself, what am I eating today. What am I doing today, how much sleep. Did I get in

366
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is everything okay at home.

367
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really just kind of be easy, you know, with yourself, making sure. Well, I haven't eaten today so I better go, you know, get a meal me or I have a

368
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Drink one glass of water today, so I need to get some more water in me, but really paying attention to that piece because when you pay attention to that piece everything around you just kind of flourishes. Right.

369
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then paying attention to your thought process, you know, any, anything that tells you it's a good idea to drink or use

370
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That your, your disease talking in here.

371
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you've got to be able to identify those that thought process, you know and be able to stop it and say, nope, not going to go down. We're not going to do it.

372
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:55.980
ethant: Well,

373
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and really be able to play the tape forward in your head and say, well, if I do do this. These are the, you know, things at home. We're going to get worse.

374
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to lose this and this and this, you know, but really pay attention to changing that thought process when it, when it if you know it comes. If you have those barriers in place and you

375
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know that you do if you have those thoughts. It's easy to to reverse them.

376
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But part of it too is when we get

377
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Comfortable in life and just doing life.

378
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we forget that we have that peace inside of us that can just open up and take us places that we really don't want to be

379
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's why it's so important that we pay attention to it and opiates and do attack the same receptors that alcohol does. So you're susceptible either which way you go

380
00:38:51.030 --> 00:39:03.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And actually there's called there's something called cross addiction to where you can actually become addicted to another substance than what your primary substance was so you know that's why they say abstinence is the best

381
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your case, with having Benz's on board. You're taking them as needed. You're not overmedicating you're not taking them on a regular basis and just make sure you're staying with that pattern and you're not

382
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.480
ethant: Yeah, I am.

383
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:31.710
ethant: I'm gonna lean on my wife for support with that I've kind of been doing that a little bit already but and you guys, I've been like every meeting I had with you or it's it's come up the bend the benzo thing comes up.

384
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.180
ethant: Yeah, I mean, to be honest.

385
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:56.820
ethant: The it's someone. It's so tricky because you know when I stuck when I got a regular prescription for them. You know why. Actually, it was an off label thing because I so other than the surgery I have these migraines surgery. There's the dystonia remember the word

386
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:05.430
ethant: Um, it's this thing that neurological condition that I have. And then the my migraines, which

387
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.260
ethant: Prior to finding the different medicines that work like I was

388
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.030
ethant: Missing like two, three days of work, a month.

389
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.260
ethant: Because I was constantly having these like serious migraines.

390
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:39.450
ethant: And that, that's why I have the prescription for the lenses, is that there they turns out it doesn't, you have to do some searching to like learn about this, but like they're kind of they're not a first line of defense. But there are a miracle drug when it comes to to migraines, um,

391
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:49.560
ethant: So when I get a bad migraine. This is what happened last week I had a really, I had a bad migraine data was so bad that my the migraine medicine. I have didn't work.

392
00:40:50.190 --> 00:41:05.340
ethant: You know, I took it. I drink a bunch of water. I like laid in bed and waited for an out, you know, to try to relax for an hour and it still didn't work. And then I take a half of a Klonopin and it like totally fixes my headache and allows let's meet to me like relax and go to sleep.

393
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To function.

394
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you're you're using a message as prescribed you're using them for good. You're not abusing him. Um, but just you gotta pay attention in case you do start if it starts coming up, because you know our digital grab ahold of anything, you know,

395
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:38.730
ethant: I know I caught myself. Um, this was kind of hard for me because I, you know, three weeks ago, or whatever. I was my own doctor and I had every drug, you can think of.

396
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:47.790
ethant: So I would take like uppers to go to start working or, you know, take downers to go to sleep at night. I take over it taking opiates, kind of like constantly throughout the day.

397
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:51.690
ethant: And a lot of it.

398
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:59.580
ethant: And it didn't work. And then I'm going to say that it worked. But there were days where it appeared that it was kind of working right.

399
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.850
ethant: So then after I

400
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:12.720
ethant: Got into shape a couple weeks ago. I'm laying in bed and I. So one of the side effects or something, I don't know what's going on. But I have like really bad whole body tremors.

401
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:28.050
ethant: I told Mary Kastner about them, but I like Twitch, all of a sudden like my whole body and never done that before. It's like this is a new thing. So I don't know if it's a reaction to the medication that she prescribed to me in the Suboxone but um

402
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:46.140
ethant: I realized when I was laying in bed. Oh, this is a kind of thing that Ben's. Those are great for they totally stop, I'm like twitches and seizure. So, you know, this is a this is really bugging me so I'm going to take and then I had to stop myself and I look at the bottom, it says like

403
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.940
ethant: Take as needed for anxiety. I'm like, Well, I guess I don't feel anxiety right now so I'm

404
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:59.760
ethant: Like, I can't. I had to not take the medicine that I'm proud. I'm like, You know what, that was the right thing to do. I have to talk to the doctor before

405
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:06.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that is, that was the right thing to do, definitely because you again, you want to really be careful.

406
00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:24.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And knowing that you know you are highly susceptible to start, you know, I'm using them as a crutch, and you don't want to let them work for what they're supposed to talk to Mary, you know, let her help you in this area, any issues with your Suboxone

407
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.480
ethant: Um,

408
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.530
ethant: Yeah, there's a couple things. I'm worried about like

409
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:42.210
ethant: So Mary increased my dosage when in the second week I was taking eight milligrams last week. And then I saw her on Monday, and she increase it from eight to 12

410
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.020
Per day

411
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.370
ethant: And I think I'm just sort of stabilizing on that right now. It's Wednesday.

412
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.810
ethant: So it's a couple days later.

413
00:43:49.920 --> 00:44:00.480
ethant: So I don't know. I'm, I, I've been worried that it's gonna, it's a high dose. It's going to be even harder for me to get off of. And I wasn't sure that I really needed it and

414
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:09.870
ethant: I'm getting so I stuck a runny nose, all it today. Maybe the runny nose is a little bit better but I'm

415
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.160
ethant: Getting the twitching thing.

416
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.060
ethant: I don't know.

417
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.970
ethant: Suboxone side effect or what the heck that is. But

418
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I haven't heard of it being

419
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A side effect of Suboxone I'm

420
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely something to bring up to her.

421
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why did she

422
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was the reason that she increased her dose.

423
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:54.060
ethant: I think she didn't tell me clearly that anyone reason but I started out the session describing my headache Day, which was just was the day prior to my meeting with her. So I had like six okay days, you know, I mean, it was horrible. Because I mean, they're all hard days. Recently, but

424
00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:04.800
ethant: I'd six days with no migraines. And then I had a migraine day and then I met Mary, and so I have like my nose is running. I'm talking about this horrible day with the migraine is so cheap. I don't know. I think she just looked at me and thought I needed more

425
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, let's try this one more time.

426
00:45:52.500 --> 00:46:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the Day, the day after you have your microphone is when you met with Mary and she update you are just induced though on Suboxone because you've only just started working with bright heart so

427
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes perfect sense. So you were still in your induction phase.

428
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah and you know 12 milligram really isn't a high dose.

429
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.740
ethant: Oh, okay.

430
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and how have you been, as far as any cravings, anything like that came up

431
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.360
No.

432
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:28.080
ethant: I don't have cravings, the closest things to cravings that I have are like it kind of

433
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.580
ethant: It's not that I want to take deep take drugs, but

434
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.730
ethant: I have been looking at the

435
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:42.990
ethant: Life. I'm probably going to live when I'm sober and wondering like, do I really want that that life.

436
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:53.760
ethant: I don't know, like, you know, I live in the city. It's like hyper competitive and busy and everyone has kids and it's like no one has a minute to breathe, like in the middle of the day and so

437
00:46:55.230 --> 00:47:02.040
ethant: I, my wife wants to buy a house and you know we both kind of want to have kids. And, um, so I don't know.

438
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:13.500
ethant: I have like some apprehension about succeeding or do I really want that or they don't even really want that life, to start with, to begin with.

439
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.110
ethant: Can I keep it up and compete.

440
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.940
ethant: In San Francisco and make enough money to like have a house and kids here and like and

441
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.880
ethant: Keep my sanity. You know what I mean.

442
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:24.540
Yeah.

443
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Life gets busy, that's for sure. And the cost of living is insane.

444
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:32.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it really

445
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't put your foot so far in the future. Yep. You know what I mean, just try to walk through what you're doing right now.

446
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm because

447
00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.340
It's enough

448
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you're in the very beginning of this whole thing again and you know you want to just really take it easy, try to focus on self care, try to focus on, you know, changing

449
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Changing that thought process around it. But really, just for today. And even if you have those thoughts, just think of it for today. This is what I'm going to do right

450
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just add

451
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

452
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.230
ethant: That's good advice.

453
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:15.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just for today.

454
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, gotta worry about

455
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

456
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:21.780
ethant: Yeah.

457
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And before you know it, you'll have more days and then you'll be able to you know you and your wife will be able to make a decision that's going to work out for

458
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:37.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you guys, you know, and maybe the city isn't the best place maybe there should be some suburban live in or some country live in, but

459
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know is that life does get hectic and it does get busy and you just got to make sure you know Ethan That you are really taking care of yourself. You know, you know, okay, so

460
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're actually you're actually action step for this week was what

461
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:06.630
ethant: I was supposed to come up. I was looking at my notes and it says, think about a specific goal or thing to work on.

462
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:08.370
ethant: Um,

463
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:16.590
ethant: And so I was thinking about that at the beginning of the session and I, the best I could come up with was

464
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:27.240
ethant: sorting out my stress around work, and I think we started talking about that for most of the beginning of the session. And as I appreciate what you said is that

465
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.330
ethant: Obviously you can look at where I where I am. And it's easy to get caught up in like

466
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.450
ethant: A lot of future tripping.

467
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but it is for everybody. You don't. I mean, it's tough.

468
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But when you've got that doomsday coming on top of it, you know, and

469
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:54.240
ethant: And like I have this theory that my I live in a rent controlled apartment and I have this theory that something's going to happen on this building.

470
00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:03.030
ethant: Sooner rather than later. And it's likely that we're going to lose this like reasonably priced place to live and then it'll be real like

471
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.270
ethant: Really interesting

472
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:22.380
ethant: So I'm just like, I'm so I'm unsure of the future with my legal problems and getting a new job or my legal history, I should say, and getting a new job. And then if he stayed with all these meds and getting my mind back together.

473
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to really real. Your brain in and just really focus, bring it back in today. You know what I mean. Get it back into today because that can you can be lost in a rabbit hole. If you stay in the future too long.

474
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For today, you still you have your place to live. You have your job you're, you know, you're sober. Today you are working on you. You are relationships are getting better. So you have all this positive stuff. And, you know, just to throw this out there.

475
00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no but nobody's future is guaranteed. You're right.

476
00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can work if you think about it, we can work for 20 years at the same job just dedicated 90 you know 99.9% of our life to work and one day.

477
00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's gone or one day.

478
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: hurricane hits or Wednesday. You know what I mean. But if we continually live in the what ifs or in the future. It really robs us from what's going on right now.

479
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:41.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, same thing with the past. If you stay in the past few long you totally robbing yourself of what's going on in this moment, you know, and so just you gotta reel, those, those thoughts back to now.

480
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really take, you know, take that daily inventory. If you find yourself getting stressed out about the UNKNOWN of the future.

481
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really just saying today. It's not happening today.

482
00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have a little bit of time. I can do some research. It's like calming yourself down in your head, bringing you back into into right now and keeping it out of there.

483
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that'll cause anxiety and stress and migraines.

484
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

485
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:19.470
ethant: Maybe I could like augment the journal that I'm already doing. And like use it for like a some sort of like focus on today.

486
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:21.540
ethant: Or

487
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:27.150
ethant: Something like meditation, kind of thing on

488
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Focus on today journaling down exactly, especially when your thoughts are going in the future and you feel your anxiety, raise your stress raise you know that's a good idea. You know, to write in your journal and say these are what I have for today. This is what I'm doing today.

489
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it if you do the work and you continue doing the work, things will fall into place.

490
00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:05.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really, honestly, we don't have control over the future. We don't have control over the past the past is done. It's written that chapters over with.

491
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:16.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The future hasn't been written yet. So you have no idea. You might win the lottery in a week, you might, you know what I mean, there's all these variables that that are unknowns.

492
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I said in unknowns.

493
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's easier to sit in the knowns.

494
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:30.870
ethant: Yeah, I appreciate that I haven't another I'll come. I'll let myself go there some other time.

495
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So next week. This time, this place.

496
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your action step for this week is writing in your journal

497
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Daily

498
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep it in today. When you find your thoughts going in the future reel it back in today.

499
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.970
ethant: Right journal daily focus on today. Check thoughts going into future

500
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, and really monitor. If you start having any

501
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any thoughts of using

502
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like you caught yourself with your lenses, which was really cool that you were able to, you know, evaluate that before you just took them.

503
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:38.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

504
00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you just got to keep doing that. Keep self checking yourself and monitor yourself, you know. Yeah.

505
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.890
ethant: Okay, and I'll journal about it. Okay.

506
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we will talk about it next week. Cool. All right.

507
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:59.460
ethant: I'm one. I know. It's like right at the end here, but I have one concern about the schedule for my meds.

508
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:00.990
What's that

509
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.320
ethant: So I met with Mary on the 17th.

510
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:11.460
ethant: And she gave me a 10 day supply with zero refills, but also told me that she's going to be out of town.

511
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.950
ethant: So the next time, I'm going to talk to anyone is on the 24th, I have a group with you. I think

512
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:24.600
ethant: Right. Yeah. And then on the 25th 26 or 27th or something my meds are gonna run out.

513
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:35.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On the 24th what I what I do after group is I send an email to her and to the virtual clinic and let them know that you're going to need a refill.

514
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:43.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so when we see each other on the 24th. I'll ask how many, how many pills you have if yours.

515
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:52.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gosh.

516
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:54.540
ethant: That's not good.

517
00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so, um, when I see you in group that's when I report back and let them know and then your prescription will be refilled from that point forward. Cool. Okay.

518
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.390
ethant: Okay, good. I'm I can not have to worry about it until Monday, then yeah.

519
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.440

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:17.820
ethant: On our calls, it's not that big, or is it big.

523
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it depends. Sometimes I'll have anywhere from seven to 13 people in there so

524
00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It depends. It

525
00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.150
